										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-new-products-iphone-15/">Apple to Launch New Products Including iPhone 15 and Watch Ultra This Year</a></p>
<p>Apple has a few new products in its roadmap for 2023 and well into 2024. The expected new products include the iPhone 15 and a new Apple Watch, among others.</p>
<p>A Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-25/apple-2023-and-2024-road-map-iphone-15-m3-macs-ipad-air-vision-pro-headset-ljbftjwx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> has highlighted products Apple lovers should expect following the company’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-vision-pro-mixed-reality-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vision Pro mixed-reality headset debut</a>. For instance, Apple intends to release the iPhone 15 sometime in the fall of this year. While there is no official word from Apple on specs, several rumors are already floating through the grapevine.</p>
<p>MacRumors earlier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that the iPhone 15 will include four models with two at 6.1 inches and two at 6.7 inches, like the iPhone 14 releases. The report also suggests that all four iPhone 15 models will feature USB-C ports instead of Lightning ports. Prices are expected from $799.</p>
<p>Apple lovers can also expect a new iMac with a 24-inch screen. The company is also reportedly developing a new 30-inch iMac. In addition to the iPhone and iMac, Apple should refresh the iPad Pro and iPad Air as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, expected Apple products include new MacBook Pro models. The MacBook Pro will come in different sizes &#8211; 13, 14, and 15 inches. All three models will feature Apple’s M3 chip.</p>
<p>At its recent Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-series-products-wwdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a new 15-inch MacBook Air priced at $1,299. Users can choose one of four colors, all powered by Apple’s M2 chipset. In addition, Apple announced software updates, including the WatchOS 10 with new features like hiking and cycling for complete tracking. Furthermore, users should expect a software update for iOS 17.</p>
<h2>New Apple Products to Precede Vision Pro Headset</h2>
<p>Some of the products expected from Apple will likely be available before the recently-launched <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-vision-pro-mixed-reality-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vision Pro headset</a> ships to the market. Apple announced the headset at the WWDC, with several interesting features.</p>
<p>For instance, the device comes with an EyeSight feature that switches between transparent and opaque modes for the benefit of people around the user. Owners can also control their devices with hands and eyes, as the headset has 12 cameras that track user movement.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Bloomberg’s report states that there’s still a lot left for Apple to figure out before releasing the Vision Pro. Reportedly, the showcase at the WWDC only featured the best parts of the device. Several features, including in-air typing, are not yet ready. The report also states that Apple is not done integrating several interface elements, and adapting core iPad apps for the new device.</p>
<p>Apple also hasn’t figured out support for third-party apps and might still have trouble with the EyeSight feature. In addition, there is still some uncertainty about the device working well with users who wear prescription lenses.</p>
<p>Consequently, Apple has reportedly expanded device testing and involved a few thousand extra employees. Apple initially only allowed senior executives and engineers to take the new device home. However, the company may now provide more developers with increased access so the device is ready as scheduled.</p>

<p>The move is expected to attract crypto investors who had fled the country following the heavy burdens caused by taxations of unrealized profits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japan-tax-agency-crypto-startups/">Japan&#8217;s National Tax Agency Says Crypto Startups Will Not Pay for Unrealized Gains</a></p>
<p>Undeniably, the cryptocurrency and blockchain markets have turned out to be a huge backbone for the development of economic growth prospects in many markets around the world. By now, it is safe to bet that countries have a clear understanding that the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries are here to stay and thus prudent to tap into their prowess to rebuild their economies following the devastations of Covid-19. Japan has been a key growth factor to most crypto projects, especially those fleeing the United States due to punitive regulatory aspects. Crypto projects like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a> have made a significant entrance into the market of Japan through its cross-border payment solutions including RippleNet.</p>
<h2>Japan Regulators Open Doors Wide for Crypto Projects</h2>
<p>Following the meteoric growth of the cryptocurrency market through the Decentralized Financial (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) industry, the Japanese government is keen to attract investors to tap into its vast local market. In the recent crypto update in Japan, the country’s National Tax Agency via the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) tax committee approved a proposal to exempt digital asset projects from paying unrealized gains on their products.</p>
<p>Essentially, crypto projects operating in the Japanese market were obligated to pay unrealized taxes of about 35 percent on digital tokens issued to the local market. The document added that the tax exemptions will be applicable to unrealized gains from holding applicable crypto assets continuously from the date of issuance or from taking certain technical measures to prevent its transfer to other persons.</p>
<p>The Japanese government only <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/26/japanese-crypto-issuers-wont-pay-taxes-on-unrealized-gains-govt-clarifies/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wants</a> to tax crypto traders after they take profit in fiat currencies, which will be done through regulated digital asset exchanges. According to the country’s prime minister Fumio Kishida, the crypto market has the chance to alter the financial market for the betterment of the future. The narrative is evident through the fact that Kishida reassured investors through a parliament speech last year that the country will continue to focus on supporting the social implementation of digital technology.</p>
<p>Earlier last year, the current ruling party in Japan Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) released an NFT White Paper that referred to the Web3 industry as the new frontier of the digital economy and outlined plans to advance the national strategy on mainstream adoption.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The crypto market in Japan has significantly rebounded since the collapse of FTX and the local subsidiary returned cash to traders. As a means to attract investors of all kinds, Japan has initiatives to use NFTs and DAOs in various governance aspects. Moreover, government officials in Japan are closely looking into how the metaverse industry could revolutionize overall governance.</p>
<p>Moreover, government officials are able to meet virtually in a secure platform through blockchain technology thus increasing the overall efficiency.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/terra-classic-revival-plan-six-samurai/">Terra Classic Engineers Working on Major Revival Plan with ‘Six Samurai’ Proposal</a></p>
<p>Six engineers working on the Terra Classic ecosystem have proposed a &#8216;Six Samurai&#8217; plan for the complete revival of the blockchain ecosystem. This development comes as some community members of Terra have been looking to break away entirely from the shadows of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/do-kwon-extradition-custody-montenegro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disgraced</a> founder Do Kwon and bring new life to the LUNC ecosystem.</p>
<p>Terra Classic, the original network developed by Terraform Labs, has remained as an autonomous blockchain instead of transitioning to Terra 2.0, which emerged as a separate version following Terra&#8217;s downfall. As of Monday, June 26, the LUNC tokens on Terra Classic are currently valued at $580 million.</p>
<p>Terra Classic engineers co-led by “Solid Snake&#8221; and “Bilbo Baggins” submitted a governance proposal to the Terra Classic community with a $116,000 three-month spend. If approved by the community, these engineers would work part-time on the project.</p>
<p>The proposal represents an ambitious roadmap put forward by passionate LUNC holders. The roadmap includes important components such as the migration from Columbus-5 to Columbus-6 and an upgrade to the Cosmos SDK. Additionally, the proposal outlines plans to list Terra Classic on Keplr&#8217;s Web Interface, which offers analytic visualizations, as well as on Mintscan, a block explorer for Cosmos. In the proposal, the Samurai Six engineers noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“LUNC has limitless upside potential, and we want to help realize it by leveraging our skills to bring value to the blockchain and all its investors in order to accomplish a true revival of the ecosystem. We&#8217;re here to provide value to the ecosystem on its road to revival, and we see ourselves as contributors to the Terra Classic blockchain, both as developers and long-time community members/investors.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Six Samurai Propose a Plan for Testnet for TerraUSD (USTC)</h2>
<p>Some additional tasks that the proposal includes are upgrading the network in order to reduce the syncing times between the nodes. It also includes building a testnet for the TerraUSD (USTC) stablecoin for testing financial services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there&#8217;s a plan for building an application for generating yield to token holders along with a plan to reward developers for the user activity that their applications generate.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The Terra Luna Classic community is currently voting on a proposal called &#8220;USTC / Stable Algo Quant Team.&#8221; The proposal aims to incrementally adjust and simulate the TerraClassicUSD (USTC) repeg. Initial voting shows support from the community and the Quant team developers who will be working on setting the USTC repeg to $1. The Joint L1 Task Force (L1TF) developer team will also assist the Quant team in this repeg process.</p>
<p>A team member named RedlineDrifter <a href="https://twitter.com/RedlineDrifter/status/1673107790787739651" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> on Twitter that Proposal 11597 is up for voting. This proposal is crucial for the Terra Luna Classic chain, and other community members are also spreading awareness about the USTC repeg proposal.</p>
<p>According to the proposal, the Quant team requires a payment of $20,000 in LUNC for the first month. The Quant team consists of members like RedlineDrifter, Faffy, Alex, Bilbo Baggins, and Kyjack. Additionally, Terra Classic&#8217;s core developer and professor Edward Kim will volunteer to contribute to the team by assisting in AI research related to backtesting and USTC repeg.</p>
<p>The Quant team&#8217;s objective is to improve an existing tool, conduct a thorough analysis, and provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/singapore-central-bank-tokenizing-assets/">Singapore&#8217;s Central Bank Proposes Interoperable Network Design for Tokenizing Assets</a></p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is proposing a framework to develop open and interoperable networks for tokenizing assets. On Monday, the central bank <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/monographs-or-information-paper/2023/project-guardian-open-interoperable-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a report containing details of its proposal, called Project Guardian.</p>
<p>The publication states that the MAS is already collaborating with 11 organizations working to develop and test tokenization across multiple asset categories. The test will feature foreign exchange, fixed income, and wealth management asset classes powered by a few financial services companies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the MAS is not very supportive of most cryptocurrencies because of their highly speculative nature. However, the central bank said it is interested in the benefits obtainable from the digital asset world. According to MAS deputy managing director of markets and development Leong Sing Chiong, “while MAS strongly discourages and seeks to restrict speculation in cryptocurrencies, we see much potential for value creation and efficiency gains in the digital asset ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Some of the banks part of the initial testing and proposal are DBS, Standard Chartered, Citi, and HSBC. Standard Chartered is already working on a platform that develops asset-backed tokens for trading on the Singapore Exchange. Speaking on the pilot, Standard Chartered’s global head of trade and working capital, Kai Fehr, said the test has already confirmed the advantages available to investors. According to Fehr, “the initial pilot trade conducted in collaboration with Singapore Exchange and Linklogis proves the viability of assets-backed tokenization as an innovative originate-to-distribute structure, and the potential opportunities it presents to investors to participate in financing real-world economic activity.”</p>
<h2>Further Details of Singapore’s Project Guardian Framework for Tokenizing Assets</h2>
<p>In addition to the participating banking giants, the MAS developed the report with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI).</p>
<p>As part of the project, HSBC, Marketnode, and UOB, have concluded a technical pilot for issuing a digitally native structured product. MAS says this pilot proves that the structured product chain can offer faster issuance and settlements at lower costs.</p>
<p>Another pilot carried out by UBS Asset Management explores Variable Capital Company (VCC) fund issuance on digital asset networks. The aim of this pilot is to improve trading VCC fund shares on the secondary market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DBS Bank, UBS AG, and SBI Digital Asset Holdings are working on a repurchasing agreement with digital bonds. This is to introduce more flexibility, efficiency, and speed for cross-border distribution and settlement.</p>
<h2>Singapore’s CBDC Project</h2>
<p>The MAS’ general reluctance toward CBDCs has not kept it from exploring non-speculative digital currencies. Singapore joined several countries working on central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDCs</a>) and completed the first phase of its CBDC project. Called <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/singapore-phase-1-project-orchid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Orchid</a>, the MAS initially began working on it in November 2021.</p>
<p>Project Orchid set out to examine the design and technicalities of a CBDC system in Singapore. The central bank also examined how well a CBDC would function with existing payment frameworks. The bank revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Though MAS has assessed that there is non urgent need for a retail CBDC in Singapore at this point in time, MAS seeks to facilitate ongoing learning and advance the financial infrastructure in Singapore.”</p></blockquote>
<p>At launch, the MAS called Project Orchid a “multi-year, multi-phase exploratory project” without providing a time frame.</p>

<p>In conjunction with its decision to allow Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF trading, HSBC has launched the Virtual Asset Investor Education Centre.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hsbc-etf-hong-kong/">HSBC Approves Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Trading in Hong Kong</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/hsbc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HSBC Holdings plc</a> (LON: HSBA), the largest bank in Hong Kong, has made history by becoming the first bank in the region to offer crypto trading services to its customers.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1673266576370577408" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> by Independent Chinese Journalist, Wu Blockchain, customers can now buy and sell <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/crypto/ethereum-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the Hong Kong exchange. This move comes as a response to the growing demand for digital assets and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hong-kong-hsbc-standard-chartered-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressures</a> on banks from Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the country’s banking regulator, to accept crypto exchanges as clients.</p>
<p>Currently, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has listed three crypto exchange-traded funds on its platform. These ETFs include the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF.</p>
<p>These crypto ETF listings on the Hong Kong exchange provide several advantages to investors. Firstly, it offers a regulated framework that ensures investor protection, enhancing the credibility of the crypto market. Additionally, ETFs provide ease of access, as they can be bought and sold on the exchange like traditional stocks, offering convenience and liquidity to investors.</p>
<p>As more investors gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through regulated channels such as ETFs, the mainstream adoption of digital assets is projected to accelerate, perhaps attracting institutional investors who have been waiting for more established investment vehicles.</p>
<p>HSBC&#8217;s decision to offer crypto trading services to Hong Kong investors is indeed a strategic move that aligns with the growing importance of the cryptocurrency industry in the region. Hong Kong has witnessed significant developments in crypto innovation, attracting a wide range of investors, entrepreneurs, and blockchain enterprises.</p>
<p>The move by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hong-kong-licensed-crypto-exchanges/">open</a> crypto trading activities to retail investors further underscores the increasing acceptance and recognition of digital assets in the financial sector.</p>
<h2>HSBC Launches Virtual Asset Investor Education Centre</h2>
<p>In conjunction with its decision to allow Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF trading, HSBC has launched the Virtual Asset Investor Education Centre. This strategic placement ensures that investors who engage with virtual asset-related products through these platforms have easy access to the educational resources and risk disclosures provided by the education center.</p>
<p>Remarkably, HSBC has made the Virtual Asset Investor Education Centre available to its customers via a variety of channels, including the HSBC HK Easy Invest app, the HSB CHK Mobile Banking app, and online banking.</p>
<p>By providing educational resources and requiring customers to acknowledge the associated risks, HSBC is empowering individuals to make informed investment decisions when engaging with digital asset-related products. This educational initiative contributes to the overall maturity and integrity of the crypto market while fostering a culture of responsible investing in Hong Kong, a stance that many other regions may learn from.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-privacy-coins-eu-regulations/">Binance Rescinds Decision to Delist Privacy Coins as It Complies with EU Regulations</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has reviewed its decision to delist several privacy coins in Europe. The exchange will no longer delist these coins as it works to comply with regulations stipulated by European authorities.</p>
<p>Binance will now reclassify privacy coins to satisfy regulations. In a recent comment, Binance <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-relists-privacy-coins-in-europe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“After carefully considering feedback from our community and several projects, we have revised how we classify privacy coins on our platform to comply with EU-wide regulatory requirements.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Binance also noted that it must comply with regulations in several individual EU jurisdictions since it is registered in these places. The exchange said these jurisdictions have specific laws that expect Binance to “monitor transactions for coins listed on our platform.”</p>
<h2>Binance Planned to Delist Multiple Privacy Coins in Europe</h2>
<p>Last month, Binance announced it would suspend access to privacy coins, making them unavailable for trading in Poland, France, Spain, and Italy. At the time, Binance said at least a dozen coins would stop trading.</p>
<p>The exchange named Dash (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/dash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DASH</a>), Zcash (ZEC), BEAM, Verge (XVG), Monero (XMR), PIVX, and MobileCoin (MOB). Other named coins are Horizon (ZEN), Firo (FIRO), Decred (DCR), Navcoin (NAV), and Secret (SCRT). Binance said it took the decision “as part of Binance’s ongoing compliance processes.”</p>
<p>The Binance announcement met with some resistance. For instance, Guy Zyskind, the co-founder and CEO of Secret Labs, said Secret has tried to rectify what it considers a misclassification. Zyskind <a href="https://decrypt.co/142973/binance-delist-monero-zcash-4-european-countries" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told Decrypt</a> that only data contained in smart contracts are confidential, while transactions remain public. According to him, “Secret is much more appropriate for GDPR-type applications in the blockchain setting.”</p>
<p>Privacy coins provide users with a lot more anonymity than is ordinarily available. These coins obscure user transactions such that surveillance becomes nearly impossible. Consequently, authorities have become considerably averse to privacy coins as they believe these assets are easily used for money laundering and other illegal transactions.</p>
<h2>The European Union and MiCA</h2>
<p>In April, the EU <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/eu-parliament-passes-mica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill to regulate the digital currency sector. The bill was first introduced in 2020 to provide much-needed clarity for Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs). While there are several arguments against MiCA, privacy coins may be more affected than other types of digital assets. For instance, MiCA would require exchanges to only support privacy coins if they verify user identities.</p>
<p>The EU Parliament voted 517-38 in favor of MiCA after multiple deliberations. For instance, Parliament postponed a final vote for the second time due to translation issues. A postponement in January followed a previous delay in November 2022 because the legal document had to be translated into all 24 official languages.</p>
<p>With MiCA, the EU has pioneered comprehensive crypto regulations and provided clarity that may be absent in other places like the US. Crypto firms in the US have been at loggerheads with authorities like the SEC for what many have described as a deliberate attempt to avoid providing clarity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/berkshire-hathaway-2-53m-byd/">Berkshire Hathaway Sells 2.53 Million of China’s BYD Shares</a></p>
<p>American multinational conglomerate <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/berkshire-hathaway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkshire Hathaway</a> (NYSE: BRK.B) sold 2.52 million shares of Chinese EV maker BYD listed in Hong Kong on the 19th of June. A stock exchange filing revealed that the investment company sold the shares for HKUS$ 675.80 million, equaling $86.3 million.</p>
<h2>Berkshire Cuts China&#8217;s BYD Shares Holdings</h2>
<p>Following the sale of the BYD share, Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in the Chinese company’s issued H-shares reduced from 9.21 % to 8.98%. Notably, Berkshire Hathaway is not new to selling part of its shares. As a matter of fact, it is not the first time this year the investment company will be selling its shareholdings in other companies. Before its move on BYD, Berkshire Hathaway traded most of its Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tsmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSMC</a>) stock. It performed a major cut, reducing its holdings by 86%. Meanwhile, it bought the shares around three months prior to the sale.</p>
<p>The American multinational conglomerate purchased the shares in November 2022, causing TSMC’s stock to surge. Shortly after the $5 billion investment, the semiconductor manufacturing company saw its stock decline 4% in Taipei amid broader market losses. Berkshire’s decision to offload TSMC’s stock came as a surprise to the market, including the co-president of Taishin Securities, Tony Huang, who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s surprising that Berkshire cut its holdings so much in just a quarter, which differs from its past practice of long-term investment and continuing to add shares.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Berkshire&#8217;s Selloffs</h2>
<p>As Huang said, the investment company typically holds on to its acquired shares on a long-term basis. It also buys more shares from the same company after the initial acquisition. However, the recent decision concerning TSMC is a deviation from the usual practice. As for BYD, Berkshire Hathaway purchased 225 million of the EV maker’s shares for $230 million in 2008. Since the acquisition, the American company’s investment has boomed. The last time the shares of BYD peaked in June 2022, Berkshire Hathaway’s investment was worth $9.5 billion.</p>
<p>In February, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3209740/buffetts-berkshire-reports-2nd-biggest-byd-stake-take-us26-billion-table-six-month-selling-spree" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> the second biggest of nine publicly disclosed transactions since Berkshire began to trim its BYD stake in August 2022. The SCMP noted that the cutback on the 3rd of February took $2.6 billion off the table within a six months selling spree. The spree included a $1.33 million BYD shares sold-off <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/berkshire-hathaway-reduces-stake-byd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by Coinspeaker. At the time, the sale was worth $34.43 million, and the company’s holdings dropped from 15.07% to 14.95% on the 8th of December, 2022.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-bernstein/">US Regulators Can Accommodate Spot Bitcoin ETF, Says Bernstein</a></p>
<p>In its latest research report on Monday, June 26, private wealth management giant Bernstein stated that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grayscale</a>&#8216;s dominant position in the crypto market could be under threat following <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a>&#8216;s recent filing of the spot Bitcoin ETF with the US SEC earlier this month.</p>
<p>Currently, Grayscale is the world&#8217;s largest crypto asset manager running a $19 billion BTC Trust (GBTC). Bernstein stated that Grayscale earns a total of around $380 million in annualized fees “despite the product being inefficient, illiquid, and has traded at a significant discount over the last 28 months&#8221;.</p>
<p>Grayscale has been willing to convert its GBTC product into a spot Bitcoin ETF. The asset manager has also dragged the US SEC to court over its refusal to approve this product.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US SEC</a> has given a go-ahead to the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> futures ETFs in the past, it has denied more than a dozen applications for the spot Bitcoin ETFs citing a lack of measures in ensuring customer protection. Commenting on the spot ETF market, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/us-has-room-for-a-compliant-crypto-etf-to-grow-market-share-as-a-bitcoin-on-ramp-bernstein/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If BlackRock and others manage to break through the spot ETF market, it would offer the most convenient, compliant and acceptable product for both retail and institutional players to gain bitcoin exposure.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>SEC Can Accommodate a Spot Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, BlackRock filed for the spot Bitcoin ETF with the US SEC under the iShares unit of fund management. Soon after BalckRock made the move, there have been a flood of applications hitting the market with asset managers such as Invesco and Wisdom Tree looking to reapply for a Bitcoin ETF product.</p>
<p>Bernstein stated that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) constitutes only 3% of the total market cap of Bitcoin. It further added that there is the “headroom for a compliant ETF to grow its share as a bitcoin on-ramp solving the pain of custody”.</p>
<p>The report suggests that the current annual fee for GBTC is 2%, which leaves room for aligning the pricing with more traditional asset ETFs. These ETFs are considerably cheaper, often below 0.5%.</p>
<p>James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence also made a similar argument earlier this month. Seyffart noted that “if BlackRock wins approval for their ETF, which isn’t guaranteed, it may decrease Grayscale&#8217;s valuation because Grayscale would be forced to lower fees sooner than might have been assumed. On top of that, if GBTC converts to an ETF then the fund will be subject to potential outflows&#8221;.</p>

<p>Bybit’s move is in stark contrast with that of the leading crypto exchange, Binance. Earlier this month, Binance announced it would cease its operations in Cyprus.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cyprus-crypto-license-bybit/">Cyprus Grants Crypto License to Bybit</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cyprus-crypto-license-bybit/">Cyprus Grants Crypto License to Bybit</a></p>

<p>Crypto exchange Bybit has obtained a license from the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) to operate a crypto exchange and provide custody services in the island nation. Bybit <a href="https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/companies-news/bybit-secures-license-to-operate-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-custody-services-in-cyprus-jj6mglsx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the news on Monday, June 26, stating that it will offer a full suite of services to its Cyprus customers. This will include trading between crypto pairs and fiat currency pairs, financial services related to crypto assets, and custody solutions tailored to clients&#8217; needs.</p>
<h2>Bybit: Committed to Compliance</h2>
<p>Securing the new crypto license underscores Bybit’s commitment to compliance and regulatory oversight in the crypto industry. The Dubai-based exchange has implemented enhanced KYC and AML procedures. It also obtained the ISO 27001:2013 certification for its robust security management system and launched a real-time, on-chain proof-of-reserves feature with a purpose-built Merkle tree.</p>
<p>Bybit&#8217;s Cyprus license approval will enhance its reputation as a trusted and regulated platform within the crypto ecosystem. After <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bybit-exit-canada-regulatory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exiting Canada</a> and the UK, the license will also boost its user base and trading volume in Europe.</p>
<h2>Cyprus’ Burgeoning Crypto Interest</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Bybit&#8217;s license approval coincides with increased interest in blockchain and crypto technologies by the Cyprus government. Instead of waiting for the MiCA bill, Cyprus recently introduced an advanced registration for crypto entities pending the time. The country unveiled its Distributed Ledger Technology Bill to provide a legal framework for blockchain-based applications and services. Likewise, former Deputy Minister to the President for Research, Innovation, and Digital Policy of Cyprus, Kyriacos Kokkinos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKVG104SaWg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that the country would become a hub for new disruptive technologies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Bybit’s move is in stark contrast with that of the leading crypto exchange Binance. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> announced it would cease its operations in Cyprus. Binance had been operating in Cyprus since 2018 but opted to leave amid increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>Bybit&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Ben Zhou, expressed his excitement about introducing the &#8216;Crypto Ark&#8217; to Cyprus. According to Zhou, Cyprus holds immense potential for crypto enthusiasts with its favorable regulatory environment. “Bybit recognizes the immense potential of the Cyprus market and is excited to bring its next-level reliability and opportunities to the local digital asset community,&#8221; Zhou said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gemini-withdrawals-voyager-customers/">Gemini Allows Withdrawals for Voyager Customers Whose Funds Have Been Trapped since Bankruptcy</a></p>
<p>Voyager customers who have been unable to access their funds since the company folded up last year may finally have something to cheer about. This follows after a recent <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-welcomes-voyager-customers-to-our-platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> hinted that customers affected by Voyager&#8217;s bankruptcy can now withdraw their funds.</p>
<p>According to the blog post, the 30-day window of opportunity opened on Sunday, June 25th, and would run till July 23rd. During this period, the customers can take out their trapped funds onto the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a> platform. However, any unclaimed crypto after the window will be liquidated to cash.</p>
<h2>Gemini Shares Recovery Process for Voyager Users</h2>
<p>In a statement, Gemini has shared its excitement about the new development. The firm claims that a promotional welcome is actively ongoing, encouraging Voyager customers to simply create an account on the Gemini platform to begin their withdrawals. Part of the statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>“New US customers from Voyager will receive $5 in BTC after they sign up and become verified within 30 days of opening their account.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, it appears that a little issue will inadvertently arise with the withdrawals. Gemini confirms that the withdrawal will only allow for the crypto assets its platform currently supports. That is, assets not included in the over 70 crypto assets on the Gemini exchange will be lost.</p>
<p>As Coinspeaker earlier <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/voyager-digital-chapter-11-bankruptcy-reorganization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, crypto broker Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy protection on July 5th, 2022. At the time, the firm claimed that the filing was part of its restructuring plans.</p>
<p>Since then, however, several firms have attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to acquire its assets. FTX US first <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-voyager-digital-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won an auction</a> for the assets in September 2022, before it went bankrupt itself by November.</p>
<p>Similarly, Binance also put out a $1.2 billion deal to acquire Voyager’s assets. But severe regulatory pushbacks and amendments would also see the giant exchange pull out of the race in April 2023.</p>
<p>After several unsuccessful attempts to sell its assets, the bankruptcy court finally approved plans to self-liquidate the platform in May 2023. As it stands though, Voyager estimates that customers will receive about 36% of the amount owed to them. It also considers a possibility that the figure goes higher if Voyager can resolve the ongoing dispute with FTX regarding a $445.8 million loan repayment.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mortgage-crisis-households/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
