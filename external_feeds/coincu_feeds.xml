<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance has laid off more than 1,000 employees worldwide in recent weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs, which could range from 1,500 to 3,000 employees worldwide, last until the end of the year.</em></li>



<li><em>The cause is speculated to be that the world&#8217;s leading exchange is struggling in a legal battle with the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, citing a source, due to regulatory investigations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory challenges, cryptocurrency exchange Binance has fired more than 1,000 people employees worldwide in recent weeks.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png" alt="Binance Has Fired Over 1,000 People In Recent Weeks: Report" class="wp-image-202998" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-750x393.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1140x597.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Has Fired Over 1,000 People In Recent Weeks: Report 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to sources, more than a third of Binance employees (about 8,000 people in total before layoffs) could eventually be affected by layoffs. A spokesperson for Binance confirmed the layoffs to The Wall Street Journal but did not disclose the number.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As we prepare for the next major bull market cycle, we clearly need to focus on talent density across the organization to ensure we stay agile and dynamic,&#8221;</p>
<cite>The spokesperson said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, CNBC quoted a current Binance employee familiar with the company&#8217;s plans as saying that the layoffs will eventually lay off 1,500 to 3,000 employees worldwide and that the layoffs will continue through the end of the year. Although CEO Changpeng Zhao previously shared that the company is still recruiting</p>



<p>CNBC attributed the layoffs to the US Department of Justice&#8217;s ongoing investigation into Binance, citing current employees saying the investigation could end with a consent order or an agreement on billions of dollars worth of deals. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted, adding that the exchange is &#8220;still hiring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://coincu.com/202868-binanceus-responds-to-ripples-crazy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sued</a> Binance and Director Changpeng Zhao for allegedly operating a &#8220;scam website.&#8221; Then, a lengthy Justice Department investigation into the company was also launched into its founder and chief executive officer.</p>



<p>It can be seen that Binance has taken decisive actions against the allegations to confirm the trust with users, but more or less top exchanges are still affected by the legal battle with crypto-biased regulators.</p>

<p>This groundbreaking app empowers over 4 million Shopify merchants to implement loyalty programs using blockchain technology directly from their storefronts. Powered by the Ethereum sidechain <a href="https://coincu.com/202510-polygon-unveils-proposed-upgrade/">Polygon</a>, the Web3 Rewards Tools app offers brands the opportunity to foster stronger connections with customers through NFTs and gamified experiences.</p>



<p>With the Web3 Rewards Tools app, brands can issue token-based rewards, leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology to enhance customer engagement. Additionally, businesses can tap into existing NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks, allowing them to release token-gated products and offer unique incentives to their customer base.</p>

<p>Co:Create&#8217;s application aims to onboard more brands into the web3 rewards ecosystem, enabling them to leverage the power of blockchain and NFTs to create immersive loyalty experiences for their customers. While Co:Create is an innovator in this space, it&#8217;s worth noting that other platforms have also ventured into bringing web3 rewards to Shopify. In March, Try Your Best (TYB), a community engagement platform built on the Avalanche network, launched its application on the Shopify app store. This integration provided brands with the opportunity to implement NFT-based loyalty programs seamlessly within their Shopify storefronts.</p>



<p>By integrating blockchain technology into loyalty and rewards programs, businesses can unlock new possibilities for customer engagement and loyalty. The utilization of NFTs and gamified experiences adds a layer of excitement and exclusivity, enhancing brand loyalty and customer retention.</p>



<p>Co:Create&#8217;s launch of the Web3 Rewards Tools app on Shopify, powered by Polygon, signifies a significant step forward in the adoption of blockchain-based loyalty solutions. As more brands embrace the potential of web3 rewards ecosystems, we can expect to see a transformation in customer loyalty programs, providing unique and immersive experiences for shoppers.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SHIB Burning Rate Soars: Shiba Inu&#8217;s burning rate (SHIB) experiences a significant surge of 2000%, with 31.7 million SHIB burned in the past 24 hours, contributing to increased network activity.</em></li>



<li><em>XRP Boost and Resistance Challenges: SHIB benefits from XRP&#8217;s bullish momentum, but struggles to break resistance at $0.000008. The upcoming launch of Shibarium holds potential for price growth, though an exact release date remains uncertain.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In the past 24 hours, a massive burn of 31.7 million SHIB was sent to dead wallets, contributing to this surge in burning activity. The reasons behind the sudden spike in burn numbers could be attributed to heightened network activity or a comparatively lower burn rate on the previous day. Interestingly, this surge in SHIB burning coincides with the positive impact of recent news from XRP, as SHIB has capitalized on the bullish momentum generated by XRP.</p>



<p>The recent US court ruling that declared XRP not as a security has caused excitement in the cryptocurrency industry. As a result, XRP has surged by 66.5% within the past 24 hours, surpassing other Altcoins in terms of trading volume. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is benefiting from this bullish wave, as it has experienced a 5.2% increase in the last 24 hours and a 9.1% gain in the weekly chart.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anh-chup-Man-hinh-2023-07-15-luc-00.40.10.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="616" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anh-chup-Man-hinh-2023-07-15-luc-00.40.10-1024x616.png" alt="Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burning Rate Surges By 2000% Amid XRP Boost" class="wp-image-202989" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anh-chup-Man-hinh-2023-07-15-luc-00.40.10-1024x616.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anh-chup-Man-hinh-2023-07-15-luc-00.40.10-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anh-chup-Man-hinh-2023-07-15-luc-00.40.10-768x462.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anh-chup-Man-hinh-2023-07-15-luc-00.40.10-750x451.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anh-chup-Man-hinh-2023-07-15-luc-00.40.10-1140x686.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anh-chup-Man-hinh-2023-07-15-luc-00.40.10.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burning Rate Surges By 2000% Amid XRP Boost 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, despite the ongoing rally, <a href="https://coincu.com/197113-shiba-inu-takes-nfts-to-the-next-level/">SHIB</a> is encountering resistance in breaking above the $0.000008 mark. Although it briefly surpassed this level earlier, it struggled to maintain its position. Notably, data from IntoTheBlock reveals that a significant amount of SHIBs, totaling 24 trillion, were purchased just below the current price level. Therefore, it becomes crucial for SHIB to sustain or increase its value from here. A drop below the current levels could potentially lead to intensified selling pressure, posing risks for the token.</p>



<p>While Shiba Inu has faced challenges in surpassing key resistance levels, the anticipated launch of the Shibarium layer-2 solution holds promise for driving up SHIB&#8217;s price. However, an exact release date for Shibarium remains speculative, with suggestions pointing to an August launch.</p>



<p>In summary, the remarkable surge in the SHIB burning rate, coupled with the positive impact of XRP&#8217;s bullish wave, presents an intriguing landscape for Shiba Inu (SHIB). As the token faces resistance in breaking key price levels, all eyes remain on the upcoming Shibarium launch as a potential catalyst for further price movement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US SEC acknowledges Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco, initiating the review process.</em></li>



<li><em>The inclusion of surveillance-sharing agreements in filings aims to address market manipulation concerns and increase the chances of approval.</em></li>



<li><em>Approval of Bitcoin ETFs would attract institutional and retail investors, reshape cryptocurrency investments, and set a precedent for future regulatory frameworks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1679863731952525314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> several applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-1024x683.jpg" alt="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF" class="wp-image-202982" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-1140x761.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>This acknowledgment signifies the beginning of the review process, which is expected to take around 240 days, during which the SEC will thoroughly evaluate the applications and make a decision on their approval or denial. This crucial step brings the race for the first US Bitcoin ETF one step closer to fruition and has the potential to reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency investments. Previously, the SEC <a href="https://coincu.com/202636-sec-now-reviews-bitwise-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recognized</a> Bitwiseâs application for a spot Bitcoin ETF product.</p>



<p>The inclusion of established asset management firms like <a href="https://coincu.com/198667-ark-invest-blackrock-locked-in-showdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/202622-fidelity-fires-up-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a> among the applicants underscores the growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial circles.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014.png" alt="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF" class="wp-image-202978" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>The prospect of Bitcoin ETFs has long been anticipated as a means to bridge the gap between digital assets and mainstream investors, offering a regulated and accessible investment vehicle for Bitcoin. While the acknowledgment from the SEC is a positive development, it is important to note that it does not guarantee approval at this stage, and the ultimate decision rests with the regulatory body.</p>



<p>One of the key concerns for the SEC has been the potential for market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space. To address this issue, the applicants have made concerted efforts to incorporate surveillance-sharing agreements in their filings. These agreements aim to provide enhanced oversight and monitoring of the underlying Bitcoin markets, thereby mitigating the risk of fraudulent activities. The inclusion of such measures demonstrates the applicants&#8217; commitment to maintaining market integrity and could potentially increase the likelihood of approval by the SEC.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1015-1024x768.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1015-1024x768.png" alt="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF" class="wp-image-202979" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1015-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1015-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1015-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1015-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1015-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1015.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The decision on Bitcoin ETFs holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry and broader financial markets. Approval of these ETFs would open the doors for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated and secure manner, potentially attracting billions of dollars in new investments. It would also provide retail investors with a more accessible avenue to participate in the cryptocurrency market, as ETFs are widely recognized and familiar investment instruments.</p>



<p>While the review process is underway, the cryptocurrency community and market participants eagerly await the SEC&#8217;s decision. The outcome will not only impact the applicants but also set a precedent for future cryptocurrency ETFs and the overall regulatory framework for digital assets. The acknowledgment of these applications by the SEC marks a significant milestone in the journey toward mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and highlights the increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset class.</p>

<li><em>BlackRock CEO predicts rising interest in cryptocurrencies among gold investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Fink sees crypto as an international asset with unique value.</em></li>



<li><em>BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF filing signals a potential shift in SEC approval.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently shared his positive outlook on cryptocurrencies during an appearance on <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<p>Fink noted the growing demand for digital assets among gold investors and highlighted the role of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in democratizing access to gold. He suggested that ETFs could play a similar role in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Describing crypto as an <a href="https://coincu.com/200412-blackrock-ceo-praises-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">international asset</a>, Fink emphasized its differentiating value compared to other asset classes. He expressed belief in the potential of cryptocurrencies to transcend national currencies, citing the depreciation of the US dollar and the global interest in digital assets. Fink noted that BlackRock is witnessing increasing interest in crypto, which is broad-based and worldwide.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199918-blackrock-chooses-coinbase-surveillance-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>, an $8.5 trillion asset management company, recently filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The filing includes a surveillance-sharing agreement, which could be a crucial factor in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approving such a product. The SEC has previously rejected numerous Bitcoin ETF applications.</p>



<p>Fink emphasized BlackRock&#8217;s commitment to safety and security in new markets. He stated that if the company&#8217;s name is associated with a product, they will ensure it is safe and protected. The company believes in democratizing investing and recognizes the transformative role of ETFs. Fink sees this as just the beginning of ETFs&#8217; impact on the investment landscape.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-1024x683.png" alt="BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Makes Bold Prediction For Cryptocurrencies&#039; Global Rise" class="wp-image-202970" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Makes Bold Prediction For Cryptocurrencies&#039; Global Rise 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>While Fink did not directly discuss the spot Bitcoin ETF filing, he mentioned that BlackRock is working with regulators and is dedicated to maintaining a safe and sound environment. The involvement of a prominent asset management firm like BlackRock and the proposed surveillance-sharing agreement indicate a potential shift in momentum toward Bitcoin ETF approval.</p>



<p>Fink&#8217;s stance on cryptocurrencies has evolved over time. In 2017, he expressed criticism, linking the popularity of digital currencies to money laundering. However, due to increasing client interest and the high costs associated with transactions, BlackRock decided to explore the cryptocurrency space. Fink also recognized the potential diversification benefits of including crypto assets in investor portfolios.</p>

<p>BlackRock reported its second-quarter results, revealing adjusted earnings per share of $9.28 on $4.46 billion in revenue. The company now manages over $9 trillion in assets.</p>



<p>While experts infer that BlackRock&#8217;s involvement may increase the likelihood of SEC approval for a <a href="https://coincu.com/202636-sec-now-reviews-bitwise-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETF</a>, recent signals from the regulatory body suggest that the approval process remains challenging. The creation of a market surveillance mechanism is seen as a crucial step in making Bitcoin ETF applications more likely to pass.</p>

<li><em>The database</em> is <em>being developed to identify user claims, salable assets list prepared, and asset distribution planned in stages.</em></li>

<p>Assets held by B&amp;S will take longer to recover. To this end, Haru Invest is collating the database of claims and liabilities and reviewing the asset allocation plan. At the same time, Haru Invest said a compensation plan needs to be developed for each product.</p>

<p>Haru Invest previously released an update on its official website stating that the company is developing a list of potentially salable company assets, with the goal of minimizing the loss of value when selling company assets, and is considering a phased sale company assets.

<p>The firm is also focusing on the recovery of assets under management, separate from B&amp;S holdings. Haru Invest aims to minimize losses and expects to recover these assets within a few weeks. In addition, the company is preparing a list of potential salable assets, with the goal of minimizing value loss during the sale process. This process is expected to take some time, and the company is considering selling its assets in phases.</p>



<p>Haru Invest is also working on organizing a database to clearly identify the credits and debts of its users. Once the amount of losses is confirmed and the asset distribution plan is finalized, the company plans to distribute the assets in phases. However, due to limited information on the exact amount of losses, the firm has not provided a specific timeline for this distribution.</p>



<p>The company has committed to providing weekly updates to its members, even if there are no major updates on the current situation. Haru Invest has also reassured its users that their legal rights will be equally protected, regardless of whether they belong to a class-action lawsuit group or not.</p>



<p>Haru Invest&#8217;s CEO, Hugo Lee, expressed his deepest regret for the inconvenience caused to investors and affirmed the company&#8217;s commitment to improving the situation.</p>



<p>Lawyer Lee Jeong-yeop of LKB &amp; Partners, a legal firm representing the victims, <a href="https://coincu.com/200193-haru-invest-delio-damage-up-to-230m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assessed</a> the loss to Haru Invest and <a href="https://coincu.com/199209-delio-under-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delio</a> (another crypto lending firm affected by Haru) at up to 300 billion won ($230 million). Haru Investment is worth around 150 billion won, while Delio is worth approximately 100 billion won. Despite having a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license, Delio did not handle client assets correctly. While Haru Invest is a firm founded abroad, legal processes may be followed in Korea. Haru Invest and Delio were both held in Korea.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Synthetix introduces Infinex, a decentralized perpetual contract trading platform to compete directly with centralized exchanges.</em></li>



<li><em>Infinex enhances user experience by eliminating the need for a crypto wallet and utilizing a username and password system.</em></li>



<li><em>Infinex aims to balance decentralization while addressing user concerns and regulatory challenges, with Synthetix&#8217;s SNX token governing the platform.</em></li>
</ul>

Infinex aims to compete directly with centralized exchanges (CEXs) and enhance the user experience in DeFi.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1004.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="585" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1004-1024x585.png" alt="Synthetix Launches Infinex, Decentralized Trading Platform Aiming To Challenge CEXs" class="wp-image-202953" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1004-1024x585.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1004-300x171.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1004-768x438.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1004-750x428.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1004-1140x651.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1004.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Synthetix Launches Infinex, Decentralized Trading Platform Aiming To Challenge CEXs 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>To address concerns about user experience, Infinex introduces a unique approach. Instead of using a crypto wallet to sign transactions, users will create a username and password, eliminating the need for complex wallet management. The private key, which is still required for transaction signing, will be securely stored in users&#8217; browsers. Importantly, the private key will not have the ability to withdraw funds.</p>



<p>The focus on user experience reflects a growing trend among web3 entrepreneurs who recognize the need to prioritize usability to drive the adoption and growth of DeFi. Another recent example of this trend is the launch of Oku, an exchange that prioritizes user experience and design.</p>



<p>However, Infinex faces several challenges. It must compete with the user experience offered by centralized exchanges while maintaining decentralization. Storing private keys in the browser may raise concerns among security-conscious users. Additionally, regulatory compliance remains a key consideration for Infinex, as the crypto industry faces increased scrutiny from organizations like the <a href="https://coincu.com/202636-sec-now-reviews-bitwise-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>.</p>

<p>Infinex will be governed by Synthetix&#8217;s SNX token and will not have its own token. Users can start trading on Infinex by depositing USDT or USDC stablecoins, which can be acquired from centralized exchanges or non-custodial wallets like Metamask. The platform will collect trading fees, integration fees from a rewards program, and fees from staking SNX.</p>



<p>Infinex utilizes deposited stablecoins as a margin and provides users with sUSD, Synthetix&#8217;s stablecoin, for trading. By combining user-friendly features with the power of DeFi, Infinex aims to bring decentralized perpetual contract trading to a broader audience.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Open Exchange (OPNX) has introduced trading for bankruptcy claims of FTX and Celsius Network, allowing users to monetize their claims and regain control over their funds.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX owes up to $8 billion to customers after its collapse, while Celsius Network owes around $4.7 billion, leading to the availability of immediate liquidity for these claims on the exchange.</em></li>



<li><em>By selling their claims on OPNX, users receive native tokens (reOX or oUSD) and can utilize them as collateral for trading, offering an alternative to waiting for the lengthy process of resolving bankruptcy claims.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a move aimed at providing relief to users affected by the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and lender Celsius Network, the Open Exchange (OPNX) has <a href="https://twitter.com/OPNX_Official/status/1679837501601755139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the availability of trading for their bankruptcy claims. This development allows users to monetize their claims and regain control over their funds, according to a press release.</strong></h5>

<p>FTX, which faced a substantial collapse in November, owes its customers as much as $8 billion, contributing to a broader market downturn. On the other hand, Celsius Network owes around $4.7 billion to its users, as stated in its bankruptcy filing. With the process of resolving bankruptcy claims often taking considerable time, OPNX offers an alternative by providing immediate liquidity for these claims.</p>

<p>By selling their claims on <a href="https://coincu.com/191524-3ac-founders-opnx-announces-celsius-claims-trading-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OPNX</a>, users will receive the platform&#8217;s native tokens, reborn OX (reOX) or oUSD, the profit-and-loss currency of the platform. These tokens can then be utilized as collateral for trading on OPNX. Claims are currently trading at approximately $0.30 per dollar on OPNX&#8217;s competitor, Claims Market.</p>



<p>Mark Lamb, the founder of OPNX, emphasized the benefits of claim tokenization, highlighting that it provides customers with liquidity, control over their funds, and the opportunity to participate in market activities once again. The platform was co-founded by Mark and Leslie Lamb, known for their involvement with CoinFlex, alongside Kyle Davies and Su Zhu from Three Arrows Capital.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the value of the claim tokens on OPNX may fluctuate based on market conditions and the progression of bankruptcy procedures. <a href="https://coincu.com/202425-ftx-bankruptcy-lawyers-claim-323m-ftx-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> and Celsius Network both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the latter half of the previous year as part of their efforts to pursue corporate rehabilitation.</p>

<p>While OPNX aims to offer a solution for users impacted by the bankruptcies, it should be noted that Celsius Network recently faced legal challenges. The company was indicted by regulatory authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice, and its former CEO, <a href="https://coincu.com/202741-celsius-network-founder-pleads-not-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Mashinsky</a>, was arrested on fraud charges. However, Celsius <a href="https://coincu.com/202720-celsius-network-faces-4-7b-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured</a> its customers that the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan would not hinder the reorganization or recovery of customer funds.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Monochrome and Vasco file for Australia&#8217;s first fully-licensed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund under new crypto provisions.</em></li>



<li><em>The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF provides regulated exposure for retail investors through directly holding Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>Renewed interest in Bitcoin ETFs is reflected in major US institutions filing for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/australian-spot-bitcoin-etf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blockworks.co/news/australian-spot-bitcoin-etf" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockworks</a>, Monochrome and Vasco Trustees file for the first Bitcoin ETF under new crypto provisions in Australia&#8217;s licensing regime, providing regulated exposure for retail investors.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-999.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="733" height="488" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-999.png" alt="ASX&#039;s First Spot Bitcoin ETF Application Marks Significant Milestone" class="wp-image-202940" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-999.png 733w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-999-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" title="ASX&#039;s First Spot Bitcoin ETF Application Marks Significant Milestone 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Australiaâs first fully-licensed spot Bitcoin ETF has been filed with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in partnership between Monochrome, a Bitcoin-focused asset management firm, and Vasco Trustees. The updated application for the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) is intended to provide regulated exposure for retail investors. </p>



<p>The move represents the first filing for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund on the ASX under a licensing regime featuring crypto provisions established almost two years ago. After Monochrome&#8217;s partner, Vasco received a financial license to operate crypto spot ETFs in the country, the application was lodged.</p>



<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) revised its Australian financial services (AFS) license rules in October 2021, promoting market transparency among crypto firms while enhancing investor protections. The rules dictate that institutional support and acceptance of the underlying crypto should exist for a spot ETF. &#8220;Reputable&#8221; and &#8220;experienced&#8221; service providers must be willing to support those products. Only two AFS licensees, including the issuer behind Monochrome&#8217;s ETF, have any retail crypto-asset license authorization. Others are listed as wholesale, meaning they are not yet green-lit to offer such products to mom-and-pop investors.</p>



<p>Cosmos Asset Managementâs Bitcoin exchange-traded fund attempted to become Australia&#8217;s first Bitcoin ETF last year. Still, it was established as a fund of funds offering exposure to one of Canada&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETFs managed by Purpose. Global X and 21Shares&#8217; Bitcoin ETF were the first to list in Australia, while Cosmos delisted its offering in November last year due to a lack of interest.</p>



<p>Jeff Yew, Monochrome CEO, said that what sets the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF apart from other fund structures is that it is authorized under the &#8220;crypto-asset&#8221; licensing category, which allows the fund to hold Bitcoin directly on the fund level. He added he was confident that a positive outcome would be reached.</p>



<p>Renewed interest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has also hit the US, with major institutions such as BlackRock, Invesco, and WisdomTree all filing over the past month. This renewed interest reflects the growing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs as a legitimate investment vehicle, which is expected to continue as more investors seek exposure to the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>The recent court ruling that XRP sales did not constitute investment contracts has ignited positive sentiment within the cryptocurrency community. This favorable ruling has generated a sense of optimism, prompting a rally across the crypto market. Ethereum, as the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-largest cryptocurrency</a> by market capitalization, has also benefited from this sentiment shift.</p>



<p>After a brief spike in April 2023, ETH has now surpassed the $2,000 mark for the first time since May. This swift price increase suggests a potential bullish trend for Ethereum, with the possibility of reaching new yearly highs in the future. The market&#8217;s reaction to the Ripple ruling has further reinforced ETH&#8217;s positive trajectory.</p>

<p>The current ETH price chart exhibits a bearish pin bar candlestick pattern, indicating rejection at the resistance level. However, despite this temporary setback, <a href="https://coincu.com/199228-ethereum-stable-at-1820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> has shown resilience and maintained an upward trend. The price has reclaimed the $1,950 horizontal area, which may serve as a support level and contribute to the continuation of the rally.</p>



<p>As ETH advances, key support and resistance levels become crucial. The $1,950 level has acted as support in the recent price movement, signaling bullish momentum. Additionally, the confluence of the 61.8% Fibonacci level adds further weight to the potential for sustained growth. If ETH bounces off the $1,950 support level, it could target the $2,030 and $2,050 resistance levels, with $2,030 representing the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.</p>

<p>With ETH&#8217;s price surge and the positive sentiment surrounding the Ripple ruling, the market outlook for ETH appears promising. However, it is important to closely monitor the price action and observe how ETH reacts to key support and resistance levels. Further price advancements could solidify the bullish trend, potentially leading ETH to explore new price territories in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>Ethereum has witnessed a notable surge, reaching a three-month high following the Ripple court ruling. This positive market sentiment, coupled with ETH&#8217;s technical strength, suggests the potential for further price gains. Traders and investors should keep a watchful eye on the support and resistance levels to gauge the sustainability of ETH&#8217;s upward trajectory in the coming days and weeks.</p>
