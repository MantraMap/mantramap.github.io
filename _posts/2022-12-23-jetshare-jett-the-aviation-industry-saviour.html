<p>There are quite a handful of industries that produce the world&rsquo;s richest people. One such industry is the aviation industry. Entering the industry is reserved for the wealthy and powerful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This goes to confirm the mantra, &ldquo;The rich keep getting richer." The average cost of a private aircraft is out of range for the average Joe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is completely changing, thanks to a new blockchain project - Jetshare. In this article, we'll talk about how the Jetshare protocol is saving the global airline industry one fractional NFT at a time.</p>
The Fractional NFT Protocol
<p>The fractional NFT protocol of Jetshare makes it possible for people to own private jets without having to spend millions of dollars. Instead, the company purchases private Jets through its SPV and stores them at high security, insured airport hangars across the world.</p>
<p>A digital version of these jets is minted and made available to native JETT$ token holders. Jet ownership is registered on international databases like the Civil Aviation Authority website and the tokens are visible on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Benefits &amp; Returns</p>
<p>It's safe to say that there are many reasons to invest in Jetshare, from its price to the community the project is building. Additionally, Jetshare's smart contract audit was completed and approved by renowned Canadian auditors Soken, making the platform a secure investment in the eyes of blockchain specialists. RJ Aleksandrs the founder has over 25 years experience buying/selling Jets and as a pilot.</p>
<p>Community members will have access to free sightseeing flights, discount private Jet charters, flying lesson, access to Aviator NFTs and many more benefits. The JETT$ token can be utilised in a number of ways including as payment for booking Jet charters from third party companies, access to worldwide private jet events and for payment of goods at airports around the world.</p>
<p>Shareowners receive capital growth through Jet sales or income from lease contracts as well as organic token price increases and trading of fractional NFTs. This industry has always been seen as private and luxury so it makes it even more timely that projects like Jetshare exist to decentralize and democratize ownership. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
