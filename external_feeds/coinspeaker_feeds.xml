<p>Payrolls rose 339,000 in May, exceeding expectations and indicating a resilient labor market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/job-may-payrolls-339k/">Job Growth Shines: May Payrolls Beat Predictions by 339K</a></p>
<p>The US economy continued to generate employment in May, despite macroeconomic challenges. Nonfarm payrolls increased to 339,000, significantly surpassing Dow Jones&#8217; expectations of 190,000, as a result, May marked the twenty-ninth consecutive month of positive job growth in the country.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, although the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% compared to the estimated 3.5%, the labor market remained strong. Similarly, average hourly earnings increased by 0.3%, as expected, while annual wages rose by 4.3%, slightly below the estimate.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;payrolls&#8221; refers to the total number of employees receiving a salary or wage during a specific period. This measure is used to assess workforce strength and job creation in an economy.</p>
<h2>The US Labor Market Defies Economic Challenges with Robust Job Growth</h2>
<p>Becky Frankiewicz, President and Chief Commercial Officer of Manpower Group, a Fortune 500 American multinational corporation headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/02/jobs-report-may-2023-.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">highlighted</a> the resilience of the US labor market amidst economic challenges such as inflation and high-profile layoffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US labor market continues to show resilience amid various challenges, from inflation to high-profile layoffs and rising gas prices. With 339,000 job openings, we&#8217;re still rewriting the rule book, and the US labor market continues to defy historical definitions,&#8221; said Frankiewicz.</p>
<p>The Department of Labor indicated that professional and business services led the job creation with 64,000 jobs, followed by the government with 56,000 jobs, and the healthcare sector with 52,000 jobs.</p>
<h2>Unemployment Rate Raises Concerns despite Positive Job Market Trends</h2>
<p>Not all news in the labor sector was positive, as the unemployment rate continued to increase significantly by 0.3% to reach 3.7% (6 million unemployed individuals), due to a decline in self-employed workers.</p>
<p>“The unemployment rate increased by 0.3 percentage point to 3.7 percent in May, and the number of unemployed persons rose by 440,000 to 6.1 million. The unemployment rate has ranged from 3.4 percent to 3.7 percent since March 2022,” <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_06022023.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reads</a> the employment situation news release.</p>
<p>Although some US politicians anticipate a future recession, as is already happening in some European countries like Germany, US consumers continue to spend, and the resilient labor market continues to support expenditure.</p>
<p>Despite mounting concerns voiced by experts and officials within the Federal Reserve, the central bank continues its pursuit of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-fed-25-basis-point-rate-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher interest rates</a> as a means to tackle the persistent inflationary pressures. However, these measures have fallen short of achieving the desired outcome and may pose greater long-term challenges.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though jobs increased to 339,000 in May, it is possible that the Federal Reserve will continue to apply its aggressive policy of economic tightening in the coming months, or at least until significant improvements are observed in inflation indicators.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zkpass-protocol-binance-web3-reality-show/">zkPass Protocol Wins First Season of Binance Web3 Reality Show</a></p>
<p>A decentralized open-source protocol that focuses on identity verification solutions zkPass has been crowned the winner of a metaverse show sponsored by the leading cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>. According to the announcement, the Binance metaverse show was seeking to crown the next big Web3 entrepreneur amongst a huge group of applicants. A panel of Judges in the Binance Web3 reality show had an easy time choosing the finalist winner as ZKPass received the highest votes throughout the seven episodes that featured 12 projects.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Binance also chose four other finalists including Mind Network, Kryptoskatt, Bracket Labs, and DappOS who will all receive a strategic investment from Binance Labs. Notably, the finalist had to rise through a huge group of applicants amounting to more than 900 during the metaverse shows.</p>
<p>The judging panel for Build The Block included Yi He, co-founder and CMO of Binance and head of Binance Labs; Yibo Ling, the chief business officer of Binance; Guy Turner, co-founder of Coin Bureau; Azeem Khan, a member of the World Economic Forum’s Crypto Sustainability Coalition and fundraising and partnership lead at Gitcoin; and Robby Yung, CEO of Animoca Brands and partner at Animoca Capital.</p>
<h2>Why zkPass Won the Binance Competition</h2>
<p>Powered by Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon, the zkPass protocol is currently running pre-alpha testnet registration to help obtain crucial feedback from the community. Notably, zkPass is a composable, privacy-preserving decentralized identity verification solution for Web3 based on Multi-party Computation (MPC) and Zero-knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology.</p>
<p>The protocol aims to provide a secure and privacy-preserving identity verification solution for Web3 applications using the latest in cryptographic technology.</p>
<p>The support from Binance Labs will help zkPass scale to more users in the future much more easily than the rest.</p>
<p>“We are not only thrilled to be a part of the first pitch ever done in a real-time metaverse series, but especially honored to win Build The Block and have the opportunity to work closer with Binance Labs,” said Joshua Peng, co-founder of zkPass. “This investment helps us immensely on our journey to be the infrastructure of this decentralized world.”</p>
<p>According to Ling, one of the judges of the Build The Block metaverse show, Binance is seeking to help Web3 developers with scalable ideas that specifically use Zero Knowledge technology.</p>
<p>“At Binance Labs, we’re looking to build the foundations to sustainable ecosystems that allow scalability, specifically those enabled by Zero-Knowledge proof techniques. We look forward to seeing zkPass’ growth as they continue to empower decentralized societies,” Ling <a href="https://www.nftgators.com/zkpass-wins-binances-first-season-of-build-the-block-web3-reality-show/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>

<p>Through its privacy commission, Japan issued a warning and threatened to take action against OpenAI if it violates any privacy regulation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japan-warning-chatgpt-openai/">Japan Sends Warning to ChatGPT Creator OpenAI about Collecting Private User Data without Consent</a></p>
<p>Japan’s privacy agency has announced it issued a warning to OpenAI on using or collecting user data. The Personal Information Protection Commission (PPC) urged the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> creator to only collect sensitive information with consent from users.</p>
<p>In the statement, the privacy watchdog suggests it is currently not investigating OpenAI for any breach of privacy or unauthorized collection of user data. However, it called on the company to “reduce the risk to the rights and interests of individuals”. The commission also said it would take action if any violation occurs.</p>
<p>In addition to warning OpenAI, the agency also cautioned firms in Japan about handling private data. The PPC urged companies that handle personal data and agencies using AI to function within the limits of lawful operations.</p>
<h2>OpenAI and Artificial Intelligence Regulation in Japan and Other Countries</h2>
<p>Although no specific regulations restrict AI in Japan, the government made a 2019 publication that delineates tenets AI must follow before implementation. According to the <a href="https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/jinkouchinou/pdf/humancentricai.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Social Principles of Human-Centric AI</a>, all implementations must follow three fundamental tenets. They include sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and human dignity.</p>
<p>Japan also has the <a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/2781" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Act on the Protection of Personal Information</a> (APPI) which has certain effects on AI implementation and usage. For instance, the entity responsible for developing or creating an AI system may be liable in tort under civil law if the AI’s negligence results in third-party damage. However, determining what exactly qualifies as negligence is a significant bottleneck to this.</p>
<p>Since the explosive growth of ChatGPT, many nations have begun creating regulations to guide AI usage. According to a Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6cc8a0f3-f2fc-4470-a881-8763451b47ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, the UK’s prime minister Rishi Sunak said that the country would spearhead robust regulations to protect users and grow the sector. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think the UK can play a leadership role because, ultimately, we’re only going to grapple with this problem and solve it if we work together &#8211; not just with the companies, but with countries around the world.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to an unnamed senior British official referenced in the report, the EU and the US are at two extremes of the regulatory battles. The official believes this puts the UK in the best possible position to take the leadership role:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The information we get from the companies is that the EU is going down quite a draconian route while the US is almost too blase about it. That leaves us in quite a good position in the middle.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Japan’s Semiconductor Manufacturing</h2>
<p>As demand for AI increases, Japan is trying to reclaim its spot as a powerhouse for semiconductor production. It may also be trying to compete with China’s ambitious plans in the artificial intelligence department. Decades ago, Japan was the world’s largest chip maker, with <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3221187/tech-war-japan-seeks-bigger-role-global-chip-supply-chain-us-tries-sideline-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 50% of the global market share</a> in 1988. As it tries to reclaim its lost glory, Japan is mulling restrictions on equipment necessary for semiconductor production. According to a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/768966d0-1082-4db4-b1bc-cca0c1982f9e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recent report</a>, this restriction is part of an agreement with the Netherlands and China, aimed at stifling China’s semiconductor production growth.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stock-futures-soar-may-job-report/">US Stock Futures Soar as May Job Report and Debt Ceiling Passage Shows Promises</a></p>
<p>In an exciting development, US <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stock-futures-slump-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stock futures</a> have continued to soar as traders make meaning of the highly anticipated May jobs report and celebrated the passing of a debt ceiling bill by United States lawmakers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, futures on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-index-djia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> (INDEXDJX: .DJI) rose by 180 points or 0.5%. Similarly, futures connected to both the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> (INDEXSP: .INX) and Nasdaq 100 both rose by 0.5%. These bullish signs set the tone for a potentially good trading day, fueled by encouraging news from a variety of companies.</p>
<p>One notable performer in the Pre-market was Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ: LULU), a popular athletic apparel retailer. The company&#8217;s shares experienced a remarkable 15.57% increase as investors reacted positively to strong financial results.</p>
<p>Another standout was MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ: MDB), a leading modern, general-purpose database platform. The company&#8217;s shares soared by an impressive 31% hours following the announcement of a blowout forecast.</p>
<p>The excitement for the May jobs report was obvious. Investors have been watching employment data intently as an indicator of economic growth and stability. With the labor market still recovering from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, any good indicators in job creation and unemployment data are welcome.</p>
<p>Notably, the May jobs report holds crucial implications for the Federal Reserve’s future policy decision. With the unemployment rate pegged at 3.7%, the report has provided valuable insights into the state of the labor market and is billed to potentially shape the Central Bank&#8217;s stance on interest rates.</p>
<p>Prior to the release, Economists surveyed by Dow Jones put forward their projections, indicating an expected easing in job growth for May compared to the previous month. The consensus suggests an addition of 190,000 jobs, a decline from the 253,000 gained in April. From the data released, a total of 339,000 jobs were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/02/may-jobs-report-2023-unemployment/#:~:text=The%20unemployment%20rate%20rose%20to,more%20unemployed%20workers%20in%20May.&amp;text=Employers%20added%20339%2C000%20jobs%20in%20May%2C%20in%20the%20latest%20sign,from%20slipping%20into%20a%20recession." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a> in the month of May, surpassing expectations.</p>
<h2>US Stock Futures and the Debt Ceiling Bill</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the debt ceiling bill&#8217;s approval provided even another reason for the positive rally in stock futures.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, there were fears that failure to reach an agreement on raising the debt ceiling could lead to a US default on its obligations, which had unsettled some investors. However, with the resolution of this issue, those concerns have been alleviated, leading to a sense of relief in the market.</p>
<p>Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones noted that the market had anticipated a settlement to the debt ceiling crisis. Furthermore, Mahajan revealed that the removal of this tail risk from the market equation has led to a collective sigh of relief. Moreover, she acknowledged that the limited economic impact expected from the debt ceiling fiasco and spending cap has contributed to the positive sentiment among investors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the trading week nears its end, the S&amp;P 500 and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-nasdaq-composite-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq Composite</a> (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) are poised to register gains of approximately 0.4% and 1% respectively.</p>

<p>Another story of hackers compromising the Twitter accounts of famous personalities to steal crypto has come to light with the news that OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati&#8217;s account was hacked. A yet-to-be-identified entity managed to gain unauthorized access to her account.</p>
<p>The hacker used Mira&#8217;s Twitter account to promote a fake $OPENAI token airdrop, claiming that the token was motivated through AI-based language and would promote decentralization and encourage more people to participate in the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> blockchain.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>The Twitter Hacker Used a Phishing Link to Fake OpenAI Website</h2>
<p>The link in the tweet led to a website that looked exactly like the official OpenAI site, making it hard to tell the difference between them. The main issue that someone who is very vigilant would have noticed was the prompt for connecting to a crypto wallet intended to be used to scam.</p>
<p>In addition to the wallet used was a draining kit that would drain all the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a> and ERC-20 tokens that victims had in their wallets once they signed in to the link. Scammers often use crypto drainers because they provide an automated and quick way of emptying wallets of funds. They use this tool by first having access to the private keys of victims when they click on the phishing link.</p>
<p>The scammer made sure to disallow comments on the tweet, which would have also prevented many people who noticed the scam from notifying others faster. The tweet, which was viewed by close to 80,000 people and had close to 90 retweets, was taken down within an hour. Although there are some tweets from a few individuals about being hacked, there have been no official reports that anyone fell for the trap.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/miramurati?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@miramurati</a> Hey Mira, my wallet was just drained from a tweet you posted.</p>
<p>— Shilly Burdy (@smackthelipwapa) <a href="https://twitter.com/smackthelipwapa/status/1664458022733635586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The incident raises the alarm for more vigilant practices among crypto service providers and users in the industry.</p>
<h2>Celebrity Twitter Hacks: Disturbing Trend in the Crypto World</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cryptocurrency-scam-hackers-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter accounts of notable figures</a> have been hacked. In the past year, the Twitter accounts of many famous people and crypto exchanges were hacked and tagged as one of the biggest Twitter hacks in history. The personalities involved included Elon Musk, now the owner of Twitter, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Joe Biden and exchanges like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>. These attacks were also carried out using fake links.</p>
<p>Beyond the few cases we have mentioned here, malicious actors have made much effort to steal crypto funds. Crypto has been a major target of many cyberattacks because of its nature. Since crypto technology is still in its infancy, much must be done to protect and regulate the market. Until proper regulatory procedures are generally accepted, it may still be a haven for criminals.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-twitter-rebranding-x-app/">Elon Musk Confirms Twitter Rebranding to X Super App for Microblogging and Financial Services</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> has confirmed that the microblogging website will rebrand to X sometime in the near future. Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1664320720288071691?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> with “True” to a tweet announcing the forthcoming rebranding. According to the tweet, the new X platform will do much more than allow users to send short tweets. Users will be able to enjoy long text, messaging, video, and varying financial services.</p>
<h2>Twitter Inc Is Now X</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.395023/gov.uscourts.cand.395023.123.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a> filed at a federal court in California, the “Twitter Inc.” name has been retired. The filing confirms that Twitter is now a part of X, which is part of a parent holding company. The document reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>“ …Twitter, Inc. has been merged into X Corp, and no longer exists. X Corp. is a privately held corporation. Its parent corporation is X Holdings Corp. No publicly traded corporation owns 10% or more of the stock of X Corp. or X Holdings Corp.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The recent confirmation is not Musk’s first time referencing the X app. In October last year, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that buying Twitter would accelerate the creation of “X, the everything app”. Although there are no official specifics of an X interface, Musk has said enough to create a working picture.</p>
<h2>X: The WeChat of the West</h2>
<p>X will be a super app &#8211; an app that integrates multiple seemingly unrelated services in one place. At his first town hall meeting with Twitter staff last year, Musk said he wants X to be a super app like WeChat. According to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s no WeChat equivalent out of China…There’s a real opportunity to create that.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Owned by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent Holdings Ltd</a> (HKG: 0700), WeChat is a super app that began as an instant messaging app for smartphones in 2011. Over the years, it has expanded its offerings such that users can do everything from buying groceries to scheduling doctors&#8217; appointments. So far, no app anywhere in the West functions as sufficient competition.</p>
<p>Speaking in a March interview, Musk told Morgan Stanley managing director Michael Grimes that he has lofty plans for X. He specifically said X could “become the biggest financial institution in the world”, where users can send money “effortlessly with one click”.</p>
<p>As of March, WeChat had more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255778/number-of-active-wechat-messenger-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">1.3 billion monthly active users</a> (MAU) and is expected to hit 1.671 billion this year. In January 2019, the platform recorded 45 billion daily messages. In July 2021, a quarter of all users <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/668386/china-amount-of-time-users-spent-on-wechat-daily/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spent more than 4 hours</a> on the app each day.</p>
<p>According to experts, Musk’s super app goal would face serious challenges. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/05/tech/everything-app-x-musk-china-wechat-learnings-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Analysts speaking to CNN</a> said the competition is fierce as other giants like TikTok, Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube are all trying to become super apps. In addition to the competition, they also noted that regulation would make it difficult for authorities to allow the kind of monopoly X will attain if it succeeds.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hong-kong-stock-market-rally/">Hong Kong Stock Market Takes Lead in Asia-Pacific Market Rally</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hong-kong-stock-market-rally/">Hong Kong Stock Market Takes Lead in Asia-Pacific Market Rally</a></p>
<p>The Hong Kong stock market featuring indices like the Hang Seng Index (INDEXHANGSENG: HSI) experienced a notable bullish surge in its recent trading session, as investors eagerly await the US May jobs report. The Hang Seng Index finished 4.02% higher at 18,949.94, creating significant market excitement and investor optimism.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/02/asia-pacific-markets-us-jobs-report-south-korea-cpi.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, the consumer and real estate sectors drove the index&#8217;s gains, with significant performances from businesses such as Longfor Group Holdings Ltd (HKG: 0960) and Zhongsheng Group Holdings Limited (HKG: 0881). Additionally, tech giants including Baidu Inc (HKG: 9888), JD.com Inc (HKG: 9618), and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HKG: 9988) also contributed to the rise.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this tremendous increase comes at a time when the world economy is dealing with a number of issues, including geopolitical tensions, concerns about <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/all-you-need-to-know-about-inflation-reasons-types-impact-on-the-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation</a>, and the passage of the bill to raise debt limits in the US. The market surge, however, demonstrates Hong Kong&#8217;s stock market&#8217;s robustness and attractiveness, attracting investors&#8217; attention to prospective growth prospects.</p>
<p>The property industry was critical in propelling the Hang Seng Index&#8217;s remarkable rise. Notably, Hong Kong has always been known for its healthy property market, and the recent spike demonstrates its ongoing appeal.</p>
<p>Additionally, the consumer sector also contributed significantly to the Hang Seng Index&#8217;s rise. As the city progressively recovers from the pandemic-induced downturn, consumer confidence is rising, resulting in higher spending and robust retail sales. This tendency has boosted the performance of consumer-related stocks for retailers, e-commerce platforms, and consumer goods companies.</p>
<p>Kenny Ng from Everbright Securities International noted that from a technical standpoint, the Hang Seng Index had been oversold before the rebound occurred. Ng’s observation suggests that the rebound may have been driven by technical factors rather than fundamental developments in the market.</p>
<p>Simply explained, when a stock or index is oversold, it signifies that the price has dropped drastically and rapidly owing to consistent selloff by investors. This oversold condition can lead to a technical bounce-back as traders and investors perceive the price levels as attractive and start buying, resulting in a price rally.</p>
<h2>Bullish Momentum Beyond the Hong Kong Stock Market</h2>
<p>Overall, the Asia-Pacific markets displayed a positive trend, with gains observed in South Korea, Japan, mainland China, and Australia. In South Korea, Kospi, the major stock market index in the country, closed 1.25% higher, driven by positive market sentiment. Markedly,  the consumer inflation for May in South Korea eased to a 19-month low.</p>
<p>Also, the Nikkei 225 (INDEXNIKKEI: NI225) traded up 1.21%, closing at 31,524.22. On the other hand, Shanghai Composite SSE Composite Index (SHA: 000001) in Mainland China closed at 3,230.07, up 0.79%. Furthermore, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Australia added 0.48%, closing at 7,145.1.</p>
<p>In the United States, all three major indexes rose, with the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> (INDEXSP: .INX) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-nasdaq-composite-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq Composite</a> (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) reaching their best levels since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose, indicating a favorable day-to-day performance. Remarkably, the adoption of the debt-ceiling bill and its approval in the Senate have contributed to the positive market sentiment.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-bitcoin-ethereum/">Coinbase Derivatives Exchange to Roll Out Bitcoin and Ethereum Futures Trading on June 5</a></p>
<p>Leading American crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> has announced its plans to introduce futures contracts for Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) and Ether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) in its newly launched derivative marketplace regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>).</p>
<p>The new venture, Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, officially debuted last month in Bermuda following approval from the country&#8217;s financial regulator, the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).</p>
<p>The company said the derivative platform would enable traders to speculate on the prices of BTC and Ether using perpetual futures contracts, offering leverage of up to 5X. Furthermore, all trades conducted on the marketplace will be settled in the stablecoin USDC, ensuring stability and reliable value representation for participants.</p>
<h2>Fixed Size of 1 BTC and 10 Ether</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> dated June 1, Coinbase said it is set to launch two contracts: Coinbase Bitcoin (BTI) and Coinbase Ether (ETI) on June 5. The product will have a fixed size of 1BTC and 10 Ether. According to the firm, the sizing strategy was designed to help customers effectively control their market exposures and achieve attractive returns with lower fees than other derivative exchanges.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the launch of these institutional-sized USD-settled contracts, we look to empower institutional participants with greater precision in managing crypto exposure, expressing directional views, or tracking Bitcoin and Ether returns in a capital-efficient way. Coinbase Derivatives Exchange is committed to delivering innovative solutions that cater specifically to the needs of institutional investors,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Coinbase stated that it is committed to delivering innovative solutions that cater specifically to the needs of institutional investors. On that note, the company has partnered with third-party institutional futures commission merchants (FCMs) and brokers to bring new futures contracts available to users. The exchange plans to offer these companies incentive programs for adopting the product.</p>
<p>Coinbase said its decision to introduce futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether was influenced by valuable feedback gathered during its launch of Nano Bitcoin futures and Nano Ether futures contracts. According to the blog post, the move was driven by insights and opinions shared by users, highlighting their importance and demand in the market.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Eyes International Expansion</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the launch of Coinbase Derivatives Exchange in Bermuda is part of the company&#8217;s strategic move towards international expansion due to regulatory hurdles in the US.</p>
<p>Besides Bermuda, Coinbase is gearing toward <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-europe-license-ireland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European expansion</a>, notably in the United Kingdom. In March, the exchange <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/our-8-week-international-expansion-drive-in-6-continents">unveiled</a> its global expansion plans in a program dubbed &#8220;Go Broad, Go Deep&#8221;, aiming to establish its presence across six continents in eight weeks.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> believes America is an important market for crypto. Still, the recent regulatory chaos in the nation could push many companies outside the region.</p>
<p>Aside from Coinbase, another crypto exchange Gemini is also exploring expansion outside the US. The company, led by the Winklevoss brothers, recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gemini-international-derivatives-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> an international derivatives marketplace for non-US customers to trade perpetual futures.</p>

<p>Stocks in Europe and Asia have risen in response to the debt ceiling increase approved by lawmakers in the US.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/europe-stocks-us-debt-ceiling/">Europe Stocks Climb Higher after US Congress Approve Bill to Increase Debt Ceiling</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/europe-stocks-us-debt-ceiling/">Europe Stocks Climb Higher after US Congress Approve Bill to Increase Debt Ceiling</a></p>
<p>Stocks in Europe opened higher today after the US Senate <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/senate-bill-31t-us-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved a bill</a> to suspend the government’s debt ceiling. Following a 63-36 vote, US lawmakers agreed to raise the debt ceiling to prevent the country’s first-ever debt default. Congress has now sent the approval to President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> for assent.</p>
<p>As of 9:30 am London time this morning, the STOXX Europe 600 climbed 0.7% after crashing to its lowest point in two months only a few days ago. Oil and gas also increased by 1.3%, while mining stocks rose 2.6% higher. In addition, France’s CAC40 and Germany’s DAX both climbed 0.7%. So far, reactions to the debt ceiling suspension have been favorable even though the votes at the House of Representatives and Senate were not landslide victories.</p>
<h2>Fears of Inflation Regardless of Climb in Europe Stock Following Debt Ceiling Approval</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding the current climate in Europe’s stock market, the Eurozone is still battling inflation. Although there is some respite in that regard, authorities are not convinced. Yesterday, flash figures <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ecb-president-euro-zone-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Eurozone headline inflation fell from 7% in April to 6.1% in May, its lowest point since February 2022. Economists had expected May to end at 6.3%.</p>
<p>In addition to a crash in headline inflation, core inflation minus food and energy also fell to 5.3% from April’s 5.6%. Regardless, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde is unmoved. According to her, inflation is still too high and would likely stay this way for a while. However, she stated that the ECB will continue working to bring the region’s inflation down to 2%.</p>
<p>Lagarde was <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230601~2740cf2320.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking</a> at the Deutscher Sparkassentag 2023 conference when she revealed the ECB’s position on inflation. According to her, the apex bank cannot stop increasing interest rates yet. Lagarde said the ECB will “continue our hiking cycle until we are sufficiently confident that inflation is on track to return to our target in a timely manner”. Nevertheless, she assured that the ECB is conscious of the effects monetary policies have on the economy.</p>
<p>Europe stocks also opened higher last week when the US House of Representatives passed the debt ceiling vote and sent it to the Senate. Following the 314 to 117 vote, the Stoxx 600 increased. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC40 also climbed 0.5%.</p>
<h2>Other Financial Markets</h2>
<p>Away from the increase in Europe stocks, other financial markets are reacting positively to the debt ceiling approval. In Asia, China’s CSI 200 index climbed 1.4%, with the Kospi in South Korea inching 1.3%. Also, Japan’s Topix recorded a 1.6% gain, no match for the 3.9% rise in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index.</p>
<p>In the US, the market will be waiting for the official unemployment report which should show non-farm payrolls increased by 190,000 last month. Furthermore, the likelihood of another rate hike is low this month. Fed officials might hold off on increasing this rate again until next month.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/circle-usdc-natively-arbitrum/">Stablecoin Issuer Circle to Launch USDC Natively on Arbitrum Next Week</a></p>
<p>In an announcement on Thursday, June 1, stablecoin issuer Circle announced its plans to launch the native version of its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/usd-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDC</a> stablecoin on the Arbitrum blockchain network.</p>
<h2>USDC on Arbitrum</h2>
<p>As per the official announcement, Circle shall replace the existing version of USD Coin, which is an Ethereum-based token bridged to Arbitrum, with a native token that runs and resides on the Arbitrum network.</p>
<p>The official blog post <a href="https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/usdc-to-come-natively-to-arbitrum-f751a30e3d83" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reads</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This will be the official version of USDC that is recognized within the Arbitrum ecosystem and will ultimately replace the currently circulating bridged version of USDC that comes from Ethereum.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ahead of the launch next week on June 8, Circle plans to rename the existing Ethereum-based version of USDC to “USDC.e&#8221;. Post that, the original version shall be listed as “bridged USDC&#8221;. On the other hand, the new Arbitrum-based version will get the “USDC” mantle.</p>
<p>The goal behind this shift to Arbitrum is to speed up transactions using the cross-chain transfer protocols (CCTPs). Basically, CCTPs are responsible for the handling of the transfer of assets between the blockchains. Besides, it also allows users to unify liquidity. The good thing about the CCTP protocols is that they support both Web3 and crypto assets across portfolios.</p>
<p>The Arbitrum team said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This will enable USDC to move natively to-and-from Ethereum (and other supported chains) in minutes, and no more withdrawal delays.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It added: &#8220;Arbitrum will be working with ecosystem apps to provide a smooth transition of liquidity from bridged USDC to native USDC over time. There will be no immediate changes to the Arbitrum Bridge, and it will continue to operate normally for bridging USDC to and from Ethereum&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Circle and the Stablecoin Market</h2>
<p>After the crypto winter of 2022 and overall market activity, the market for stablecoins remains quite subdued. Circle has also faced the heat of the changing market conditions.</p>
<p>Over the last year, Circle&#8217;s market share has been declining significantly. After hitting a high of $55 billion market cap last June 2022, Circle&#8217;s USDC has seen its market cap now dropping under $30 billion.</p>
<p>In another development, amid the current US debt ceiling showdown, Circle ditched all US Treasury bonds from its USD Coin (USDC) backing reserves. This came just ahead of the US Senate finalizing on raising the debt ceiling.</p>
<p>Circle also faced a major blow earlier this year amid the US banking crisis during the fall of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank. At this time, Circle lost its peg with the US Dollar for some time, leading to massive withdrawals. However, the stablecoin issuer handled the situation well thereafter.</p>
