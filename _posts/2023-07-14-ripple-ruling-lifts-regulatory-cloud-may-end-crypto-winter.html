<p>Ripple has come out victorious over the SEC, triggering a market surge not seen in a long time. The momentous win sees XRP become the first crypto with regulatory clarity and may be the catalyst to end the ongoing crypto winter. </p>
<p>July 13, 2023, becomes a date that many investors and people interested in the crypto market will remember.</p>
<p>Judge Analise Torres of the Southern District of New York handed a partial win over to Ripple Labs after its three-year-long battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
Crypto Industry Gets a Win Amid Regulatory Crusades
<p>Per the ruling issued by Judge Torres, Ripple&rsquo;s native $XRP token is &ldquo;not necessarily a security on its face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision declared that Ripple&rsquo;s XRP sales on public crypto exchanges were not offers of securities because buyers did not have a reasonable expectation of profit tied to Ripple&rsquo;s efforts, Reuters reports. &nbsp;In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, alleging it violated US securities laws leading many exchanges, such as Coinbase and Kraken, to delist XRP.</p>
<p>Judge Torres&rsquo; ruling sets a precedent for crypto regulation leading to a shift in market momentum.</p>
<p>Shortly after the decision was made public, Bitcoin and altcoins surged to highs after what seemed to be a never-ending market slump after the FTX collapse.</p>
<p>Bitcoin reached a one-year high, up more than 90% for the year and almost 30% in the past month.</p>
<p>XRP, which may now be legally sold on public cryptocurrency exchanges, skyrocketed over 70% over the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP was trading at $0.78 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>2023 has been plagued by a string of regulatory attacks on the industry, mostly from the SEC.</p>
<p>The agency recently sued crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase and labelled several cryptocurrencies as securities and trading platforms, such as Robinhood, to delist the tokens.</p>
<p>The SEC further took issue with recent Bitcoin spot ETF applications.</p>
<p>The crypto market has largely fallen victim to negative press, leading to declining consumer confidence. Ripple&rsquo;s win, however, may garner some positive momentum in the industry.</p>
<p>Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone brokerage in Melbourne, commented in an article published by Reuters:</p>

<p>We'd gone through this long period of just consistently negative news to make the space look pretty grimy.</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, it's been consistently positive news coming though and that means you've got momentum.</p>
