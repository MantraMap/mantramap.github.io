</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $1.00 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-upsides-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to rise if there is a clear move above $1.00.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, EOS price saw a sharp drop below the $1.008 support zone against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $1.000 and $0.98 levels to enter a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The price formed a top near the $1.068 before there was a bearish reaction. During the decline, there was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.9176 swing low to $1.068 high. The price is now trading below $1.00 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-bulls-aim-steady-increase-above-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>.</p>
<p>It is testing the $0.970 support zone. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.9650 on the 4-hours chart of the EOS/USD pair.</p>
<p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $0.988 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.00 level, above which the price might test the $1.065 level. Any more gains might send the price towards the $1.12 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $0.965 and the trend line zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.9176 swing low to $1.068 high is also near the $0.955 zone. The next key support is near the $0.915 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.915 support, the price could test the $0.85 support in the near term.</p>

<p><em>Litecoin price is struggling below $80 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-upsides-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. LTC price could start a decent increase if it gains pace above the $80 level.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, there was a fresh decline in bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-bulls-aim-upside-break-above-1300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-risk-of-another-bearish-wave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ripple</a>, and litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC was able to climb above the $70 and $75 resistance levels.</p>
<p>The bulls even pushed the price above the $80 level. However, they failed to clear the $85 resistance. A high was formed near $84.97 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a steady drop below the $82 and $80 levels. The decline gained pace below the $75 support and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $76.40 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair. The pair even traded below the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $71.14 swing low to $84.97 high.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $80 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Moreover, it is testing the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $71.14 swing low to $84.97 high.</p>
<p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $71.40 level. The next key support is near the $68.50 level. If there is a downside break below the $68.50 support, the price could accelerate lower towards the $60 level in the near term.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $80 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The next major resistance sits near the $85 level. A clear move above the $85 level could pump the price towards the $92 level or even $95. The next major resistance could be $100.</p>
<div id="attachment_75985" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2022/12/Litecoin-2.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75985" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-75985" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2022/12/Litecoin-2.png" alt="Litecoin (LTC) Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-75985" class="wp-caption-text">Litecoin (LTC) Price</p></div>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, litecoin price is clearly trading below $80 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Overall, the price could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $68.50 support zone.</p>
<h2>Technical indicators</h2>
<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD for LTC/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LTC/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>

<h2>Crypto Billionaires Are Happy with Elon Musk</h2>
<p>Musk has been turned into something of a villain by democrats and Hollywood celebrities who all claim he’s going to turn the social media platform into a haven for hate speech. By contrast, money hounds in the crypto space have a lot of hope that Musk is going to bring Twitter back to its roots and make it a true free speech company, which is what Musk has always said he’s going to do.</p>
<p>Among those who are happy about the recent takeover is venture capitalist and bitcoin bull Tim Draper, who stated in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Elon is awesome, and we are so lucky to have him on our planet. I believe he wants to save the planet with Tesla, make sure we can get off it with SpaceX, and now allow everyone free speech with Twitter, and he does it all profitably, so he can do it successfully. I hope he lives forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Changpeng Zhao – the man behind Binance, the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange by daily trading volume – also threw his two cents into the mix, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter is a free speech platform, which is global [and] very important. We want to support strong entrepreneurs. Elon Musk is a very strong entrepreneur… We want to make sure crypto has a seat at the table for free speech. We want to help bring Twitter into web3 when they’re ready.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brian Armstrong – the man who runs Coinbase, the largest digital currency exchange in the United States – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elon buying Twitter is a great win for free speech, and probably changes the trajectory of the world more than most people realize. Twitter is upstream of media and culture in many ways, and it was trending in a very dangerous direction on censorship.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Will He Bring the Platform Back to Its Roots?</h2>
<p>One of the crypto heads that is less optimistic about what Musk will allegedly do with Twitter is Sam Bankman-Fried, who runs the FTX crypto exchange. He turned down the opportunity to invest in Twitter and stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We ended up passing because ultimately, we were checking if he wanted a crypto partner to help with web3 payments. Is it the case that our visions here are complimentary, and that there’s something I can add to it? I didn’t feel like that was the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>It almost makes sense that Bankman-Fried would not be happy about Musk getting involved in the social media company given he recently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-billionaire-sam-bankman-fried-spends-big-in-the-name-of-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-billionaire-sam-bankman-fried-spends-big-in-the-name-of-politics/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540094488000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HX8a8JfPVwQZJCfDTxUyb" data-wpel-link="internal">plunked millions of dollars</a> into the midterm campaigns of several democrat politicians, and democrats have consistently been for censorship and limiting rights such as free speech.</p>

It has also denied rumors that two of its top executives have resigned in recent weeks.</p>
<h2>Huobi Global: We&#8217;re Keeping Our Workers</h2>
<p>2022 has been a rough year for crypto. The space has lost more than $2 trillion in overall valuation over the past several months alone, and assets like BTC – the world’s number one digital currency by market cap – have fallen by more than 70 percent from their all-time highs, which were achieved in November of last year.</p>
<p>As a result of what can arguably be labeled the heaviest bear market the digital currency arena has ever seen, many crypto companies and exchanges have been forced into rough positions, and they have had to lay off several employees as a means of remaining afloat and keeping money in their pockets.</p>
<p>Among the companies this year to lay off employees include Coinbase and Gemini, which are two of the largest digital currency exchanges in the United States. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-laying-off-several-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-laying-off-several-employees/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540094492000&amp;usg=AOvVaw063jap0nRbw-V4M7ietzlY" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase was forced to</a> lay off about 18 percent of its overall staff. Oddly, this was supposed to be a year in which the company grew its staff numbers to unprecedented levels, though all hiring plans <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-freezing-all-2022-hiring-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-freezing-all-2022-hiring-plans/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540094492000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OLidVjMoF99JTERB1Jf-H" data-wpel-link="internal">were eventually frozen</a> as a means of dealing with the weak market. From there, layoffs began.</p>
<p>In addition, Gemini laid off <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-exchange-says-major-layoffs-are-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-exchange-says-major-layoffs-are-coming/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540094492000&amp;usg=AOvVaw031HvNBw6JHGpPMkVEyHtH" data-wpel-link="internal">about ten percent</a> of its staff, thus bringing its numbers down from about 1,000 people to just over 900.</p>
<p>With so many crypto firms letting go of their workers, it appears Huobi Global has fallen into the same territory, though the company is saying that this should never have happened, and that it has no plans to let go of any people at the time of writing, claiming business is moving along as normal. In a recent statement, a spokesperson for Huobi Global described the situation surrounding the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>Huobi Global’s senior management team is performing their duties as per normal, and rumors of large-scale layoffs are untrue. At present, Huobi Global enjoys a healthy cash flow, and the new shareholders have completed the capital injection. Huobi has demonstrated positive development potential in key regional markets and will continue to invest in business innovation, exploring international markets and recruiting local employees.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Finding Other Ways to Save $$</h2>
<p>The spokesperson further acknowledged that the firm has endured some cost-cutting measures as a means of dealing with the current bear market, though getting rid of potential employees has not been an action it’s taken. The spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Huobi Global is in a sound financial position at present, but due to the current market downturn, Huobi will also make adjustments to reduce costs and increase efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huobi is a Chinese exchange founded in 2013 by Leon Li.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fintech firm Uala – based in the nation of Argentina – is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/fintech-uala-launches-cryptocurrency-trading-in-argentina/ar-AA13Ka3s" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/fintech-uala-launches-cryptocurrency-trading-in-argentina/ar-AA13Ka3s&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540094778000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3QL66aD2RF2B_m16HZK_Nn" data-wpel-link="external">venturing into crypto territory</a> and has stated it will allow customers to trade digital assets like BTC and ETH through its app.</p>
<h2>Uala in Argentina Is Giving Way to Crypto Trades</h2>
<p>Valued at roughly $2.5 billion following its last funding round, Uala is becoming one of the largest financial technology companies in South America. Customers that utilize the app will be able to trade pesos for mainstream assets like those mentioned above. At the time of writing, the company enjoys more than five million customers throughout nations like Mexico, Colombia, and (naturally) Argentina.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO of the firm Pierpaolo Barbieri explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Argentina is the best market to make this investment given it’s one of the region’s countries where adoption is growing fastest.</p></blockquote>
<p>The digital currency arena has been in a rather poor position as of late. Over just the last several months alone, the industry has lost more than $2 trillion in overall valuation, and mainstream currencies like BTC – the world’s largest and most popular digital currency by market cap – have fallen by more than 70 percent from their all-time highs, which were achieved in November of last year. It’s a sad and ugly sight to see, but the fact remains that many people are still intrigued by the growing space, and the above news is proof of this.</p>
<p>In addition, Rodriguez Ledermann – the wealth management vice president with Uala – stated that the company’s customers have been begging for crypto and blockchain-related services for some time, another testament to how strong the digital currency scene has become despite the bearish conditions it’s currently facing. Ledermann commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Users asked us to invest in crypto through our app a long time ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Argentina is becoming a growing hub for crypto companies and innovation. Not long ago, a region within the country called Mendoza announced <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/mendoza-argentina-will-permit-crypto-tax-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/mendoza-argentina-will-permit-crypto-tax-payments/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540094778000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2v8Ry7YySlqmJ0ig6pPWhg" data-wpel-link="internal">that crypto assets</a> could be utilized to make tax payments, thus paving the way for cryptocurrencies to be utilized as payment tools.</p>
<p>In addition, Argentina – like many nations at the time of writing – is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/why-btc-use-is-growing-in-argentina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/why-btc-use-is-growing-in-argentina/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540094778000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ENLtegadekIAysogXanv-" data-wpel-link="internal">suffering from the effects</a> of deflation, in which its native currency has become practically worthless over the years. As a result, many have found cause to turn to bitcoin and related digital assets as a means of obtaining the items and services they need to survive.</p>
<h2>The Nation Keeps Getting Busier</h2>
<p>Marcos Buscaglia – a national economist in Buenos Aires, the capital of the region – joked about the present state of the peso, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Money here is like ice cream. If you keep a peso for too long, it melts in terms of how much you can buy with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is believed the country will reach a 100 percent inflation rate by the end of the year.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>TRON price started a fresh increase above $0.054 against the US Dollar, similar <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-upsides-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. TRX price could rise further if it clears the $0.056 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past month, tron price started a decent increase from the $0.052 zone against the US Dollar. TRX price formed a base above the $0.052 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>It traded above the $0.0535 and $0.0540 resistance levels to move into a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-key-support-intact-bulls-aim-fresh-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">positive zone</a>. The price even moved above the 55 simple moving average (4-hours), but the bulls were active near the $0.055 zone. A high was formed near $0.0552 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>
<p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.0544 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0519 swing low to $0.0551 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is now forming near $0.0535 or the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0519 swing low to $0.0551 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.0535 support, the price might revisit the $0.0520 support.</p>
<p>Any more losses might call for a move towards the $0.0500 zone in the near term. On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.0552 level.</p>
<p>There is also a key connecting trend line forming with resistance near $0.0552 on the 4-hours chart. The first major resistance is near the $0.056 level. A close above $0.056 is must for a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could rise towards the $0.0600 resistance in the near term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dexsport, a Web3 betting platform that supports cryptocurrency payment, reported a hacking incident that ended up in $400,000 in BUSD being stolen. According to the Dexsport team, on November 30, hackers exploited a vulnerability in the off-chain part related to the case-sensitive recording of unique transaction identifiers for processing deposits and improperly increased the balance of their wallets on the platform. After that they withdrew illicitly obtained coins.</p>
<p>The breach was quickly detected and fixed, with additional security mechanisms added. User funds were not compromised or affected.</p>
<p>“The vulnerability was not on the side of our smart contracts as they are constantly tested and audited by the leading security firms Certik and Pessimistic,” Dexsport spokesperson is quoted as saying. “We know that, in a trustless environment, the reputation is one of the main treasures, especially in a bear market. Therefore, we pay maximum attention to the high level of user experience and safety of user funds.”</p>
<p>Stolen coins were the platform&#8217;s own assets used as additional liquidity.</p>
<p>Operations were paused for a few hours, but currently all the workflow is retrieved. Withdrawals and deposits are delivered without delays.</p>
<p><a href="https://go.dexsport.io/go/f59e603e" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dexsport</a> is a Web3 cryptocurrency-supporting betting platform. It is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain, OKX, Polygon, and Avalanche blockchains. The project provides a secure and transparent betting system via smart contracts and blockchain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Santander – a UK-based financial institution – has <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-11-04/santander-to-block-uk-transfers-to-crypto-exchanges-in-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-11-04/santander-to-block-uk-transfers-to-crypto-exchanges-in-2023&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540095509000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3K3hDc5vetVI30IdUNpGQ6" data-wpel-link="external">announced it’s not going</a> to allow any crypto exchange payments beginning in 2023. Thus, anyone who has a crypto wallet tied to their traditional bank account that tries to wire money to an attached crypto exchange to purchase assets will instantly be blocked.</p>
<h2>Santander Clearly Doesn&#8217;t Like Crypto</h2>
<p>The organization is taking a lot of flak for the maneuver, with many traders and investors claiming that the bank should not be allowed to decide what its customers can spend their money on. Beginning next year, all real-time payments to crypto exchanges will not be permitted through Santander accounts, and this is just another notch on the old “England hates crypto” ladder that’s been growing exponentially over the last few years.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Santander issued the following statement regarding the company’s recent decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>Keeping our customers safe from cryptocurrency scams is a top priority. We intend to further protect customers by blocking all faster payments we identify to cryptocurrency exchanges from Santander accounts. This will be implemented during 2023.</p></blockquote>
<p>The United Kingdom has not always been the friendliest country when it comes to digital assets. Not long ago, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – a regulatory agency for the United Kingdom – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/fca-rules-all-crypto-atms-in-the-uk-are-operating-illegally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/fca-rules-all-crypto-atms-in-the-uk-are-operating-illegally/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540095509000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dxgpYbSFF-010TVxK1K6t" data-wpel-link="internal">announced that all bitcoin</a> and crypto-based ATMs would be illegal in the country. In a statement, the FCA explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>None of the crypto asset firms registered with us have been approved to offer crypto ATM services, meaning that any of them operating in the U.K. are doing so illegally and consumers should not be using them… We regularly warn consumers that crypto assets are unregulated and high-risk, which means people are very unlikely to have any protection if things go wrong, so people should be prepared to lose all their money if they choose to invest in them.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FCA and the United Kingdom regularly stand against crypto trading and all related issues claiming that as they are not regulated, they cannot be trusted. This has been the main reason both entities have taken such hard stances against this growing industry, and while to an extent we can understand where they’re coming, it can be argued that the United Kingdom is suffering from a lack of crypto innovation.</p>
<h2>The UK Isn&#8217;t Kind to Crypto</h2>
<p>While Santander is now making headlines with its decision, it’s not the first bank in the UK to limit crypto-based activity. Customers will still be able to receive payouts to their bank accounts from crypto exchanges, though sending companies money directly through Santander is another story.</p>
<p>This is still more than what the company will allow with firms like Binance, which continues to see all its transactions from Santander-based accounts blocked fully following the implementation of new regulatory tactics in July of last year.</p>
