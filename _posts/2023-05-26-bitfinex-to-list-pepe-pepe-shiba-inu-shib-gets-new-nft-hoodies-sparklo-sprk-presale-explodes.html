<p class="s7">As initial hype fades, Pepe (PEPE) has now maintained a new red color, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues its long-term battle with the bears. In light of the recent struggles of meme coins, investors have become increasingly cautious when considering investment opportunities. One project that has stood out from the pack because of its utility is Sparklo.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Sparklo (SPRK) offers unrivaled utility to investors</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo is developing the first blockchain platform that will allow both low and high-income earners to assess the precious metals industry by eliminating the obstacles that plague the traditional investment market. Using fractional NFTs, Sparklo will give investors the chance to own gold, silver, and platinum.</p>
<p class="s7">At current prices, gold has a market cap of $13.02 trillion, silver $1.3 trillion, and platinum$267.92 billion. Exploring these markets gives Sparklo an unrivaled utility. Sparklo will also collaborate with jewelry stores to provide investors with early access to some jewelry products before they are made available on the market.</p>
<p class="s7">Now in the second presale stage, Sparklo (SPRK) currently trades at $0.026 with up to 50% rewards on purchases. Given the potential of Sparklo, experts have predicted a price jump of up to 40x within the first year of launch.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">The red Pepe (PEPE) color despite Bitfinex listing</p>
<p class="s7">Following an explosive performance early this month, Pepe (PEPE) has been sliding deeper into bear territory. As a popular meme coin, Pepe (PEPE) continues to receive support from crypto exchanges. Bitfinex has announced that Pepe (PEPE) will be listed on the exchange on May 22. Trading Pepe (PEPE) against US Dollar and Tether (USDT) pairs will open on May 24. </p>
<p class="s7">The massive Pepe (PEPE) rally was followed by an even bigger dump as investors cashed out their gains. Despite Bifinex announcing the listing of Pepe (PEPE) has lost more than 5% of its value in the last 24 hours. Over the last week, the price of Pepe (PEPE) has declined by 13%, making it one of the biggest losers. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">John Richmond teases new Shiba Inu (SHIB) NFT hoodie</p>
<p class="s7">An equally popular meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to see more developments than Pepe (PEPE). John Richmond, the famous Italian-English fashion designer has announced that he will launch a new NFT hoodie collection exclusively for the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community. According to Richmond, the hoodies are part of the Cyberpunk LegendsLiveForever collection.</p>
<p class="s7">Like NFTs, each hoodie will be unique. The announcement has turned the negative sentiments of Shiba Inu (SHIB) positive. Over the last 24 hours, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained 2.7%, pushing its price up to $0.000008778. However, in the long term, Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains bearish, losing 16% of its value in the last 30 days. The poor performance of meme coins has fueled the migration of investors to projects with more utility like Sparklo. </p>
