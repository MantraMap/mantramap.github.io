										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/prime-trust-bankruptcy-protection/">Prime Trust Files for Bankruptcy Protection amidst Financial Struggles</a></p>
<p>Prime Trust, a crypto custodian company based in the United States, has officially <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X274/12452/PLEADINGS/1245208152380000000024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to its financial challenges. The filing was made in Delaware on August 15, with the company citing a significant shortfall in customer funds as the primary reason behind its drastic decision.</p>
<p>The latest filing comes a few weeks after the company&#8217;s subsidiary Banq filed for separate <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/banq-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bankruptcy</a> protection at the United States Bankruptcy Court in Nevada in June. Its parent company Prime Trust has followed in its footsteps, seeking Chapter 11 protection.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing revealed the company&#8217;s complex financial situation, estimating its liabilities to fall within $100 million to $500 million. The figure far outweighed its estimated assets worth between $50 million and $100 million. The company&#8217;s dire circumstances have compelled it to take action to address these financial discrepancies.</p>
<h2>$105M to Be Paid to Unsecured Creditors</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prime-trust-llc-files-voluntary-010000180.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> accompanying the filing, Prime Trust announced its intention to present a series of motions to the court. These motions aim to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of strategic alternatives available to the company. Among these options is the potential sale of its assets and operations, which could help stabilize its financial standing.</p>
<p>Part of the motion also includes plans to continue paying employees wages without restricting their full benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is anticipated that these motions will include requests to continue to pay wages and provide benefits to ongoing employees as usual,&#8221; Prime Trust said.</p>
<p>According to the court document, Prime Trust has between 25,000 and 50,000 creditors. This massive number of creditors highlights the wide-ranging impact of the company&#8217;s financial instability, affecting a substantial network of stakeholders.</p>
<p>In terms of creditors, the company&#8217;s top five unsecured creditors have asserted claims totaling around $105 million, with the largest single claim amounting to $55 million. The entities filing for Chapter 11 relief include Prime Core Technologies Inc., Prime Trust, LLC, Prime IRA LLC, and Prime Digital LLC.</p>
<h2>Genesis of Prime Trust&#8217;s Financial Woes</h2>
<p>Prime Trust&#8217;s financial woes started with crypto lender Celsius during the 2022 crypto winter, prompting the firm to shut down operations and subsequently initiate bankruptcy protection in a US court. According to reports, Prime Trust held up to $119 million of Celsius assets which it returned to the company after its business contract ended in 2021.</p>
<p>However, Celsius claimed that the company still held $17 million in crypto, which Prime Trust has refused to pay back. In August 2022, the bankrupt lender brought legal action against the Prime Trust to claw back the funds. The company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-provider-prime-17m-celsius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to return the crypto assets two months after the suit.</p>
<p>Aside from Celsius, Prime Trust faced other challenges. Most notably, Nevada&#8217;s Department of Business and Industry regulators issued a cease and desist order against the company on June 21, citing its inability to honor the customer&#8217;s withdrawal request.</p>
<p>According to the regulators, the company&#8217;s financial condition has significantly deteriorated, causing Prime Trust to default on withdrawal requests.</p>
<p>Shortly after the cease and desist order, the regulator took legal action against the company, successfully placing Prime Trust into receivership on July 18. This decision was based on the substantial disparity between the company&#8217;s assets and liabilities, revealing a significant financial gap.</p>
<h2>BitGo Backs Out Acquisition Deal with Prime Trust</h2>
<p>Aside from Prime Trust&#8217;s issues with Nevada regulators, the company also faced challenges when its rival BitGo, which wanted to buy out the firm, suddenly changed its heart and backed out of the deal in June. The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitgo-cancels-acquisition-prime-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">termination</a> of the supposed acquisition deal further heightened the company&#8217;s financial challenges.</p>
<p>The Prime Trust situation was exacerbated by regulatory findings that the firm had improperly utilized customer funds to fulfill withdrawals. The misuse of the funds allegedly began in December 2021, further adding to the company&#8217;s financial strain.</p>
<p>While the bankruptcy filing aims to provide a platform for evaluating strategic alternatives, the litany of problems faced by Prime Trust over the past year may complicate the search for a suitable buyer.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/grayscale-bitcoin-spot-etf-week/">Court Verdict on Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF Expected by End of This Week</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/grayscale-bitcoin-spot-etf-week/">Court Verdict on Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF Expected by End of This Week</a></p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) is expected to announce its decision on the Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF this week, according to pundits.</p>
<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF was filed by Grayscale Investments, the largest digital currency asset manager, in 2016. The fund is a proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would track the price of Bitcoin directly. The Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF would also convert the existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which holds over 636,000 Bitcoins (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>), into an ETF.</p>
<p>In June 2022, the SEC rejected Grayscale’s application. In return, Grayscale sued the regulator for inconsistency in its treatment of investment vehicles. Several industry commentators including ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood believe Grayscale will win the lawsuit.</p>
<h2>History-Backed August</h2>
<p>According to Finance Lawyer Scott Johnsson, law clerks in US District Courts generally cycle out in August. Consequently, judges push to clear their workload before the change happens.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mr. Johnson <a href="https://twitter.com/SGJohnsson/status/1691178323399905280" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">pointed out</a> that 30 out of 32 cases in March of 2021 and 2022 were heard by United States District Courts within 160 days of oral testimony. Interestingly,  it has also been 160 days since Grayscale delivered its oral arguments in its suit against the SEC.</p>
<p>Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also noted the decision could come as early as Aug. 15 according to his analysis.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Could Spur Bitcoin Adoption</h2>
<p>If approved, the asset class would be the first of its kind in the US and could potentially boost the demand and adoption of Bitcoin among institutional and retail investors. This would eliminate the premium or discount that GBTC often trades at compared to the spot price of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>However, the approval is not guaranteed, as the SEC has repeatedly delayed or rejected previous Bitcoin ETF applications. The SEC has been known to cite concerns over market manipulation, fraud, and investor protection. The regulator is also skeptical about the reliability and transparency of the ‘unregulated’ Bitcoin spot market.</p>
<p>Aside from the Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF, the SEC is also reviewing other Bitcoin ETF proposals. VanEck, BlackRock, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and Valkyrie have all submitted proposals for their spot ETFs. Thus, the approval could also pave the way for those of the other companies. This is especially true because Grayscale has opined that the SEC should approve all Bitcoin spot ETF applications simultaneously to reduce first-mover advantage between applicants.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analysts find a strong visibility for Nvidia for the next 3-4 quarters amid the AI boom. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/morgan-stanley-nvidia-ai/">Morgan Stanley: Nvidia to Benefit from &#8216;Massive Shift&#8217; in AI, NVDA Stock Jumps 7%</a></p>
<p>On Monday, August 14, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia</a> (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price gained by a straight 7% after banking giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/morgan-stanley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morgan Stanley</a> reported that the chip manufacturer would immensely benefit from the &#8216;massive shift&#8217; in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The company stands to benefit from the rapid developments in the generative AI space. Monday&#8217;s NVDA stock price surge suggests investors believe that Nvidia&#8217;s GPUs will be the most popular computer chips powering large language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>In their report on Monday, Morgan Stanley said that Nvidia continues to be their &#8220;Top Pick&#8221;. This bullishness comes following Nvidia&#8217;s earnings report which offers a better-than-expected forecast. The Morgan Stanley analysts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/14/nvidia-shares-up-7percent-on-morgan-stanley-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We think the recent selloff is a good entry point, as despite supply constraints, we still expect a meaningful beat and raise quarter &#8211; and, more importantly, strong visibility over the next 3-4 quarters. Nvidia remains our Top Pick, with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards AI, and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters.”</p></blockquote>
<div>
<h2 id="JTPWx" role="tablist" data-hveid="CBIQAA">Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Rally</h2>
<p>Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks on Wall Street this year in 2023. Since the beginning of the year, the NVDA stock price is already up by a staggering 205% and is currently trading at $437.</p>
<p>The company has registered a massive rebound following the tech slump of 2022. In fact, the NVDA stock price is trading much higher than the peak of the 2021 bull run. As a result, the company has managed to join the trillion-dollar club in terms of its valuations.</p>
<p>Despite a slight decrease of over 10% in Nvidia&#8217;s stock this month, which is in part due to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nvidia-stock-plunges-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supply limitations</a> and ongoing worries about the overall economy and its potential recovery, the analysts at Morgan Stanley anticipate that Nvidia will gain advantages in the long term. The analysts wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The bottom line is that this is a very positive situation, October numbers are entirely gated by supply, and the upper end of the buy side consensus has been reined in. We see numbers are going up at least enough that this stock will trade at P/Es more similar to the upper end of semis, with material upside still ahead.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The company is already <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nvidia-ai-chip-llms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working on new chips</a> that are set to cut the costs of running LLMs. At present, Nvidia holds a commanding position in the AI chips sector, commanding a market share exceeding 80%. This dominance can be attributed to their expertise in producing graphics processing units (GPUs), which have emerged as the preferred chips for significant AI models like OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT and Google&#8217;s Bard, both pivotal in generative AI software.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-sec-protective-order/">Binance Counters SEC&#8217;s Discovery Requests by Seeking Protective Order</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has filed for the court to grant it a protective order against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This follows after the financial regulator has made several attempts to lay its hands on all of Binance&#8217;s documents that may have anything to do with customer assets.</p>
<h2>Binance Takes Issues with SEC&#8217;s Multiple Requests</h2>
<p>According to the August 14 <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67474542/95/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-binance-holdings-limited/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a>, Binance suggested that the regulator&#8217;s requests are more like undertaking a “fishing expedition”.</p>
<p>Recall that in June, Binance agreed to a Consent Order with the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>. This was after the regulator initially <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-freezing-binance-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted to freeze all of its assets</a>, citing concerns over the safety of customer funds.</p>
<p>The exchange now believes that, while it has worked tirelessly in line with that same order, the SEC may have misunderstood the essence of it in the first place. Part of the filing reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>“BAM has worked in good faith, but the SEC has been steadfast in its belief that the Consent Order gives it carte blanche to investigate every aspect of BAM’s asset custody practices without any discernible limitation whatsoever.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Binance also claims that since the June order, it has handed over information about customer assets to the SEC. And while the SEC is yet to find any evidence of misuse, the request still feels ‘inappropriate’ in that it has no bearing on the ongoing suit.</p>
<p>But the requests have not been limited to the discovery of Binance&#8217;s custody, security, and availability of customer assets alone. Binance claims that the SEC is also requesting all communications dating as far back as November 2022 for topics that seemingly have no relevance to customer assets.</p>
<p>And, lastly, the regulator is also asking the exchange to produce six of its employees, including CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), for deposition. Interestingly, Binance claims that it has offered the depositions of senior employees in positions that are directly associated with customer funds. However, so far, the SEC has appeared unimpressed about the offer.</p>
<p>Defending its top executives and the decision to produce other employees for the deposition, Binance says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“They do not have unique firsthand knowledge about the facts surrounding the security, custody, and transfer of customer assets.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Details About the Protective Order</h2>
<p>Overall, there are three major things that Binance seeks to achieve with the protective order, if it&#8217;s granted. It hopes to limit the SEC to deposing four employees that would not include CZ or the exchange&#8217;s chief financial officer. The order would bar the SEC from asking questions beyond matters outside of the order. And, lastly, it would also stop requests for communications about things not related to customer assets.</p>

<p>Hut 8 Mining reported a revenue of about $19.2 million in Q2, a significant decline from $43.8 million recorded in the same period last year, mainly caused by increased mining difficulty.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hut-8-mining-q2-2023-earnings/">Hut 8 Mining Corp Announces Disappointing Q2 2023 Earnings Results, HUT Shares Drop Over 4%</a></p>
<p>Toronto, Canada-based Bitcoin mining and blockchain infrastructure company, Hut 8 Mining Corporation (NASDAQ: HUT) released its Q2 2023 financial results on Monday, August, 14. According to the announcement, the company experienced significant Bitcoin mining challenges, which reflected a sharp decline in total revenue. As a result, HUT shares closed Monday trading at $2.78, down 6.4 percent from the day’s opening price. However, HUT shares regained about 2.52 percent during the after-hours session to trade around $2.85.</p>
<p>The heightened demand for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> and other digital assets amid mainstream adoption has significantly increased the number of crypto miners around the world, hence causing a sharp uptick in mining difficulty. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin network had a total hash rate of about 415.17 EH/sd thus a mining difficulty of about 52.39 T, with the halving event about 255 days away.</p>
<h2>Hut 8 Mining Q2 2023 Financial Highlights</h2>
<p>During the second quarter that ended on June 30, Hut 8 announced that it mined about 399 Bitcoins, which represented a decline of approximately 58 percent during the same period last year. The company noted the suspension of operation at its North Bay Facility, and ongoing electrical issues at its Drumheller facility significantly contributed to the decline in Bitcoin mined. Notably, the company announced that it sold about 396 of the 399 Bitcoin mined during the second quarter and received proceeds of about  $14.7 million.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the company announced that it continues to push beyond its boundaries to ensure its long-term growth prospects. Moreover, mainstream adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors is expected to take place in the coming years.</p>
<p>“We continued to build momentum toward closing our transaction with USBTC by progressing toward receiving regulatory approvals to proceed and improving our projected post-merger self-mining capacity to 7.5 EH/s,&#8221; said Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut 8.</p>
<p>Notably, the company&#8217;s high-performance computing operations generated $4.2 million of primarily monthly recurring revenue during the second quarter compared to about $4.7 million in Q2 2022. During the three months that ended on June 30, Hut 8 announced that it installed a total hash rate of about 2.6 EH/s, excluding the company&#8217;s North Bay facility.</p>
<p>“While we continued to face mining challenges during the second quarter at Drumheller, which are reflected in decreased revenue and fewer Bitcoin mined, we were successful in strategically managing our costs,” <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hut-8-reports-operating-and-financial-results-for-q2-2023-847470762.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Shenif Visram, CFO of Hut 8.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price has oscillated around $29k in the past five months despite the ETF frenzy and crypto regulatory clarity in the United States.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-btc-volatility-drops-atl/">Bitcoin (BTC) Volatility Drops to ATL, to Around 15%, amid Short-Term Crypto Market Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>After enjoying a bullish first half of the year, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and the altcoins prices have struggled to maintain momentum in the second half. According to the latest crypto market data, Bitcoin price traded around $29.3k on Tuesday, a crucial support level for the bullish uptrend to continue in the coming weeks. However, the possibility of a double top on the weekly time frame and the falling divergence on the RSI has most analysts and investors convinced of an incoming Bitcoin correction towards $25k.</p>
<p>In this regard, experts have argued if the altcoin market will take over the bullish trend as funds flow from top digital assets to mid and low-cap cryptos. On the other hand, sudden weaknesses in the Bitcoin market have historically pulled the altcoin industry with it amid fear of uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Volatility Drops amid Increased Cash Inflows</h2>
<p>According to market data <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/244644/bitcoin-volatility-hits-all-time-low-as-trading-volume-slumps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">provided</a> by The Block, Bitcoin (BTC) volatility has dropped to an all-time low of around 15 percent as the bulls and bears contend with the price action. For comparison purposes, the average annualized 30-day volatility for Bitcoin in 2022 was about 61.4 percent, whereas the figures averaged about 43.8 percent in 2023. Nevertheless, there were several high-impact news &#8211; including the collapse of TerraLunaUST, FTX, and Alameda Research, among others &#8211; that saw over $100 billion wiped out of the crypto market.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.coinspeaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bitcoin-btc-volatility-drops-atl-1.jpg" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Volatility Drops to ATL, to Around 15%, amid Short-Term Crypto Market Uncertainty" width="1024" height="968" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: The Block</p></div>
<p>The notable decline in Bitcoin (BTC) volatility comes amid mixed cash flow returns as observed by CoinShares. Reportedly, Bitcoin managed to get the attention of investors in the past week with a total inflow of about $27 million. However, the top coin had recorded a total outflow of about $144 million during the prior three weeks.</p>
<p>“Digital asset investment products saw inflows this week totaling US$29m, likely due to the recent US inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,” the report <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-144-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-7d29c8c04df5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<h2>Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price is expected to continue consolidating horizontally with a range of (+/-) $10k from current levels until after next year’s halving. Although most crypto analysts do not seem to agree on the next course of action for Bitcoin, one thing that remains unanimous is the macro bullish outlook triggered by the halving event. Meanwhile, the debate on the regulatory framework in the United States remains a huge impediment to the institutional and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets products.</p>
<p>Moreover, the US SEC has continued to delay the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, whereas other markets like Canada have a running similar product. As a result, the CoinShares report concluded that Canada recorded the most crypto activity with $24 million in inflows YTD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/intuit-alex-chriss-paypal/">Intuit Executive Alex Chriss Becomes New PayPal CEO and President</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal Holdings Inc</a> (NASDAQ: PYPL) has <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-14-PayPal-Names-Alex-Chriss-as-Next-President-and-CEO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Alex Chriss will become its new CEO and president. Previously, Alex Chriss served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of Intuit QuickBooks, one of the leading small business fintech platforms. The appointment will take effect starting from September 27, 2023.</p>
<p>John Donahoe, Chair of the PayPal Board of Directors, commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With his depth of experience in product development, his passion for serving customers and his longstanding commitment to empowering and enabling small businesses, and his proven track record of developing and inspiring his team, Alex is the perfect leader to take PayPal forward and accelerate the company&#8217;s growth opportunities. The Board search committee worked diligently and thoroughly to find the right candidate to take PayPal into its next stage of growth and expansion, and we are confident Alex is that person.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In his role, Alex Chriss will replace Daniel Schulman who <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dan-schulman-paypal-ceo-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to leave the company in February, with retirement effective from December 31, 2023. In April, PayPal cut Schulman&#8217;s remuneration in a cost-cutting move as a result of the poor performance of the company in the past financial year.</p>
<p>After leaving, Schulman will continue working with the Board of Directors on &#8220;a smooth leadership transition&#8221;.</p>
<p>Daniel Schulman joined PayPal back in 2014. Under his leadership, PayPal made a number of acquisitions, including digital money transfer company Xoom Corporation, Swedish payment processor iZettle, tech company Honey,  dispute automation and fraud prevention company Chargehound, and more. Besides, since Schulman joined PayPal, its shares have also skyrocketed by about 130% since 2015.</p>
<p>Now, Alex Chriss will be in charge of PayPal&#8217;s growth. Within the 19 years he spent at Intuit, Alex Chriss has become an expert in serving the global population of small businesses and self-employed businesses. Since January 2019, Chriss has been leading Intuit&#8217;s flagship QuickBooks business. Under his governance, Intuit <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/intuit-buy-mailchimp-12-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Mailchimp, a leading email marketing platform, for $12 billion.</p>
<p>Alex Chriss stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;PayPal is an extraordinary company that plays a critical role in the lives of consumers and merchants all over the world. Throughout my career, I have championed small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs, who are the backbone of every economy in the world. I am proud to take the baton from Dan and thrilled to have the opportunity to work with PayPal&#8217;s talented and committed team to build on PayPal&#8217;s remarkable history and draw on its unique capabilities to deliver outstanding products and services to businesses and consumers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>On August 2, PayPal announced its Q2 2023 report which disappointed investors. Its adjusted operating margin for Q2 2023 came at 21.4%, lower than the 22% expected. PayPal&#8217;s earnings per diluted share totaled $0.92, while net revenue was $7.287 billion, up 7% from $6.806 billion in Q2 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sbf-100m-donations-indictment/">SBF Accused of Using $100M for Political Donations in New Indictment</a></p>
<p>Former <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/">FTX</a> CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/">SBF</a>) has found himself facing seven counts of conspiracy and fraud in a recent indictment brought against him by US prosecutors following allegations that he utilized $100 million for political donations.</p>
<h2>The Superseding Indictment against SBF</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-used-customer-funds-100-mln-us-political-donations-prosecutors-say-2023-08-14/#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20Aug%2014%20(Reuters,federal%20prosecutors%20said%20on%20Monday.">new indictment</a> adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing legal proceedings involving SBF. Originally known for his role in the crypto ecosystem, Bankman-Fried’s legal troubles have escalated with the introduction of these new charges.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges that SBF orchestrated a complex web of deception to disguise the source of the funds used for political contributions. It claims that some of the political donations were made to Democrats and Republicans in the name of FTX executives, giving the appearance that they were legitimate contributions from individuals rather than misappropriated customer funds.</p>
<p>Additionally, the indictment suggests that SBF leveraged his political contributions to exert influence over legislative and regulatory decisions. This allegedly included pushing Congress and regulatory agencies to shape legislation and rules in ways that would aid FTX’s business operations, thus allowing the continuation of his misappropriation.</p>
<p>Prior to the fall of FTX in November 2022, SBF stated that he intended to donate between $100 million and $1 billion to political campaigns influencing the 2024 elections. He gave more than $5 million to then-presidential candidate Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign and described himself as a “significant donor” to both Democratic and Republican politicians.</p>
<h2>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Fall from Crypto Darling to Incarceration</h2>
<p>Bankman-Fried’s rise to prominence within the crypto landscape was nothing short of remarkable. With a knack for trading and a deep understanding of the intricacies of cryptocurrencies, he earned the name “crypto darling” and admiration from peers and investors alike.</p>
<p>His active participation in hearings before lawmakers and his involvement in regulators’ roundtable meetings painted him as a credible and influential figure in the burgeoning industry. In a sequence of events that seemed to defy his previous success, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">FTX filed for bankruptcy</a> in a shocking turn of events that sent shockwaves through the crypto community.</p>
<p>As if the FTX bankruptcy were not enough, the story took an even darker turn with Bankman-Fried&#8217;s recent detention. Once seen as a prominent and respected figure, he found himself facing accusations that shattered his public image. At the moment, a Federal Judge has revoked his bail and remanded him into the custody of the US Marshal, underscoring the severity of the allegations against him.</p>
<p>The decision to incarcerate Bankman-Fried came shortly after he was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-doj-bankman-fried-ellison-diary/">accused</a> by the Department of Justice (DOJ) of leaking the private diary of a former colleague and ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, to The New York Times.</p>
<p>The alleged disclosure of sensitive material poses major ethical and legal concerns, adding another degree of complication to the existing legal procedures.</p>

<p>The new Celsius company will operate Celsius' mining operations while taking over private equity, institutional loans, and venture capital investments. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-celsius-new-user-company/">Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Network Plans New User-Owned Company</a></p>
<p>As per the latest Bloomberg report bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network LLC has started polling its account holders to restart a new user-owned company.</p>
<p>Soon after getting approval from US Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, Celsius Networks will start sending ballots to account holders. Along with sending ballots to account holders, Celsius will provide voting materials with clear explanations about the company&#8217;s plans to repay its customers.</p>
<p>Judge Martin Glenn mentioned that he will give his approval if the company advisors give more details about the ups and downs of the crypto industry and any difficulties that might affect Celsius&#8217; crypto mining activities. Crypto lender Celsius Network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, under the leadership of Arrington Capital, the company is planning a fresh start. Arrington Capital had won the crypto lender&#8217;s assets at a bankruptcy auction earlier this year.</p>
<h2>How Shall Celsius Network Repay Customers?</h2>
<p>In the latest hearing, Celsius lawyer Chris Koenig said that the company is on track to repay customers by the end of this year. The bankrupt crypto lender shall repay its customers by offering equity in the new company.</p>
<p>This company will operate Celsius&#8217; mining operations while taking over private equity, institutional loans, and venture capital investments along with $500 million in “liquid cryptocurrency” investments, notes the court documents.</p>
<p>However, Judge Glenn stated that there&#8217;s still a lot of work pending to proceed with the plan. Additionally, some of the customers at Celsius Network have opposed this repayment plan while other creditors could potentially challenge it in court.</p>
<h2>Creditors of Crypto Lender Celsius Voice Displeasure</h2>
<p>As Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-14/celsius-to-poll-customers-on-launching-new-user-owned-company" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>, individual creditors have voiced displeasure over Celsius&#8217; repayment plan. They think that they are being forced to take an equity stake in a risky new company. A number of customers have expressed the view that Celsius should return their native CEL tokens and are against the company&#8217;s proposal to value CEL tokens at 25 cents each.</p>
<p>However, Judge Glenn has outrightly denied that Celsius account holders won&#8217;t get their CEL tokens back. The Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) has claimed that Celsius and its former CEO treated CEL similarly to stock in a public company, which is typically affected in Chapter 11 proceedings. The issuance of CEL tokens might not be possible since they relied on Celsius&#8217; value, and after Chapter 11, there might not be a Celsius entity anymore, as Judge Glenn stated.</p>

<p>It is very likely that Kraken Ventures will support many projects rather than making a few large-sized investments.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kraken-ventures-100m-crypto-businesses/">Kraken Ventures Floats $100M to Support &#8216;Early Stage&#8217; Crypto Businesses</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kraken-ventures-100m-crypto-businesses/">Kraken Ventures Floats $100M to Support &#8216;Early Stage&#8217; Crypto Businesses</a></p>
<p>Kraken Ventures, the investment arm of one of the world&#8217;s leading crypto exchanges, is set to raise $100 million as its second fund. This comes barely two years after its first raise of $65 million back in December 2021.</p>
<p>According to the investment firm, the new fund it proposes would be targeted at early-stage founders. However, it will not be a one-time investment, says Brandon Gath, managing partner for Kraken Ventures. While the fund must have been dispensed to a business at the startup stage, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken</a> would continue to offer support to the business through its journey. Gath wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Kraken Ventures’ (KV) next fund will double down on our existing thesis and continue to support founders through their full journey from initial capital to IPO.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Kraken Ventures to Invest in Numerous Projects</h2>
<p>According to Gath, Kraken has been involved in “hundreds of early-stage investments”. But its next fund is still a major deal considering that it is a massive upgrade to its previous fund. More so, the venture market for blockchain and crypto-based projects has been somewhat on a general decline.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Kraken Ventures will be seeking to support as many startups as possible with the fund.
