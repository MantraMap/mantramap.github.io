<p class="s7">Avalanche's (AVAX) number of daily active users goes up</p>
<p>Several new additions in the number of people using Avalanche (AVAX) this past week. The number of people who use Avalanche (AVAX) every day has reached a 6-month high, according to the most recent statistics. Experts say that Avalanche's (AVAX) new development work is the main reason for its strong performance on the market. </p>
<p>In April, there were a lot more NFT deals on the Avalanche (AVAX) network. So, the price of Avalanche (AVAX) has been going up this month and it has been in the green zone. On the monthly price chart, the value of Avalanche (AVAX) has gone up by 5%. Right now, Avalanche (AVAX) is worth $17.22.</p>
<p class="s7">Aptos (APT) adds a new function</p>
<p>Concerns have been raised in the Aptos (APT) community as of late due to the network rolling back all the gains it gained at the turn of the year 2023. Aptos (APT) has been going down since January when it reached an all-time high of $19.90 and a growth rate of over 400%. In the past week, the price of Aptos (APT) has dropped by 20%. </p>
<p>Because of this, Aptos (APT) has lost about 50% of its value since its high point and is now worth $9.98. Aptos (APT) recently added a new feature called "delegated staking" to stop this drop and get more people to join its network. The purpose of this new function added is to make it easier for people to stake on the Aptos (APT) network. But the effect on the price of Aptos (APT) is not likely to be seen for a few weeks.</p>
