The market maker seems to have bought the dip after crypto prices slumped on the back of SEC lawsuits. Binance and Coinbase are accused of operating unregistered security exchanges in violation of U.S. laws. Both platforms deny the allegations and say the SEC would rather regulate through enforcement action than create a clear rule book for crypto registration. Market maker Cumberland withdrew around $46 million in Ether (ETH) [&#8230;]
