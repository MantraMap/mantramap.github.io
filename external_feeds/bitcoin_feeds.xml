Adoption of crypto by Moroccan residents is now inevitable hence a regulatory framework is needed.</strong></p>
<h2>BAM to Hold Discussions With the Capital and Insurance Market Regulators</h2>
<p>According to Abdellatif Jouahiri, the governor of the Moroccan central bank also known as Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), the country’s draft law on crypto is now ready, and will soon be presented to interested parties. In his comments reportedly made during a press conference, Jouahiri insisted the draft law seeks to protect individuals from risks that come with crypto investing.</p>
<p>As per a <a href="https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2022/12/353154/moroccos-central-bank-says-crypto-regulating-draft-law-is-ready">report</a> by Morocco World News, the Moroccan Capital Markets Authority (AMMC) and the Insurance Supervisory Authority, and Social Security (ACAPS) are some of the stakeholders the central bank is expected to engage before taking steps to implement the proposed law.</p>

<p>Commenting on the BAM’s journey in drafting the document as well as the planned discussions with other regulators, Jouhari reportedly said:</p>
<blockquote><p>For cryptocurrencies, I can assure you that the project is ready. We worked with the World Bank and the consultant to make it happen. The different chapters are completed. Now we are engaged in the discussion with the different stakeholders. It is long, but necessary to allow everyone to adhere to this project.</p></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-morocco-central-bank-discusses-crypto-regulation-best-practices-with-imf-and-world-bank/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in early 2022, the BAM sought both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank’s perspectives on what would be considered crypto regulation best practices. In addition, the central bank was also reported to have created a council that oversaw regulations governing both cryptos and central bank digital currencies.</p>
<p>By taking these steps, the BAM appeared to be preparing for a scenario where more Moroccans embraced crypto. In fact, as suggested by the same report, the Moroccan central bank believed the adoption of cryptocurrency by local residents was inevitable therefore a regulatory framework was needed.</p>

He expects the U.S. economy to be in a recession &#8220;by any definition.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Michael Burry&#8217;s 2023 Economic Predictions</h2>
<p>Famous investor and founder of investment firm Scion Asset Management, Michael Burry, has shared his 2023 economic predictions. Burry is best known for being the first investor to foresee and profit from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2010. He is profiled in &#8220;The Big Short,&#8221; a book by Michael Lewis about the mortgage crisis, which was made into a movie starring Christian Bale.</p>
<p>Burry tweeted Sunday: &#8220;Inflation peaked. But it is not the last peak of this cycle.&#8221; He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are likely to see CPI lower, possibly negative in 2H 2023, and the U.S. in recession by any definition. Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It&#8217;s not hard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people on Twitter agreed with Burry. Lawyer John E. Deaton tweeted: &#8220;I believe this is accurate.&#8221; Economist Peter St. Onge wrote: &#8220;The smart kids agree: lower inflation will be transitory, then Fed cranks up the money printers and does it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investment specialist Karel Mercx commented: &#8220;Michael Burry has a point &#8230; Inflation usually comes in waves, and there is rarely one wave (see 1970s CPI chart). The five most dangerous words in investing are still: &#8216;this time it is different.'&#8221;</p>


<p>Investor Kerry Balenthiran concurred with Burry, tweeting: &#8220;Agreed, but the next inflationary spike could end in a decade or more. This is very much like the 1947 to 1965 secular bull market. In that case, there was a post-war inflation that quietened down, followed by an inflationary environment that ultimately peaked in 1980.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people offered alternative viewpoints. Former broker Rob Bezdjian, for example, believes there will be deflation. &#8220;I will take the other side of his inflation prediction … We will be in deflation for a long time. Bubbles take a very long time to re-inflate,&#8221; he opined.</p>
<p>Burry has shared numerous warnings about the U.S. economy. In November 2022, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-of-extended-multi-year-recession-in-us/">warned</a> of &#8220;an extended multi-year recession.&#8221; In May, the Big Short investor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-of-looming-consumer-recession-more-earnings-trouble/" target="_self" rel="noopener">cautioned</a> about a looming consumer recession and more earnings trouble. In April, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-the-fed-has-no-intention-of-fighting-inflation/" target="_self" rel="noopener">said</a> the Federal Reserve &#8220;has no intention of fighting inflation,&#8221; emphasizing: &#8220;The Fed&#8217;s all about reloading the monetary bazooka so it can ride to the rescue &amp; finance the fiscal put.&#8221;</p>

These included the top price of bitcoin, the influence of the cryptocurrency on U.S. elections, the issuance of the volcano bonds, and also the construction of Bitcoin City. However, he missed the mark on most of them.</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Bukele&#x2019;s Predictions for 2022</h2>&#13;
<p>The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, one of the biggest promotors of bitcoin in Latam, and the man behind the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in his country, made a series of predictions about the cryptocurrency world and its movements for 2022. The predictions touched on issues like bitcoin pricing, the influence of bitcoin on politics, and also the development of several El Salvador-specific developments related to Bitcoin.</p>&#13;
<p>The first prediction, revealed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1477464599612076038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on Jan. 1, 2022, had to do with the price that bitcoin would reach, calculated by Bukele to be around $100,000. This did not become true, as the maximum price that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> was around $47,500.</p>&#13;
<p>The second of Bukele&#x2019;s predictions stated that two more countries would adopt bitcoin as legal tender. This also failed to become reality. However, St. Kitts and Nevis did <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/st-kitts-and-nevis-to-explore-possibility-of-making-bitcoin-cash-legal-tender-by-march-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> it would be exploring the possibility of making bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) legal tender by March 2023, &#x201C;once the safeguards to our country and our people are guaranteed,&#x201D; as Prime Minister Terrance Drew stated on Nov. 12.</p>&#13;
<p>Another prediction was that bitcoin would &#x201C;become a major electoral issue in U.S. elections this year.&#x201D; While bitcoin-related issues have been part of the political and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-urges-congress-to-pass-her-crypto-bill-claims-it-wouldve-prevented-ftx-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory</a> landscape of the U.S. during 2022, more with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-cryptocurrency-cannot-be-stopped-ftx-collapse-isnt-an-indictment-of-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demise</a> of FTX during these last two months, this prediction also missed its mark by quite a bit.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>El Salvador-Specific Predictions</h2>&#13;
<p>The second half of the predictions made by Bukele had to do more with Salvador-specific issues, including the status of the volcano bonds, which would be issued by the government to finance the construction of Bitcoin City, and also with the construction of the city itself.</p>&#13;
<p>The fourth prediction that Bukele stated was that the construction of the Bitcoin City, the geothermal-powered, bitcoin mining-friendly city, would start last year. However, this also failed to happen, with one of the last statements related to its construction happening on Jan. 9, 2022, when Bukele <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-to-add-more-geothermal-energy-sources-to-power-bitcoin-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> they were drilling more geothermal wells to secure the energy needed to run the city.</p>&#13;
<p>This also has to do with his fifth prediction, which explained that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-to-issue-1-billion-bitcoin-bond-to-fund-bitcoin-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volcano bonds</a> would be oversubscribed. However, the issuance of volcano bonds did not occur in 2022, with Treasury Minister Alejandro Zelaya blaming the postponements of the issuance on the Russia-Ukraine <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-treasury-minister-states-ukraine-russia-conflict-disrupted-bitcoin-prices-volcano-bonds-still-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a> and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvadors-bitcoin-volcano-bonds-launch-still-on-hold-according-to-treasury-minister/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall</a> of the cryptocurrency market. In September, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitfinex-cto-paolo-ardoino-states-salvadoran-bitcoin-bonds-to-be-further-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that these bonds would be further delayed because the laws supporting the issuance were still not ready</p>&#13;
<p>Its sixth and final prediction stated a surprise to be revealed at The Bitcoin Conference, which was held in April in Miami. However, Bukele was not able to <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBitcoinConf/status/1511751005377073154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appear</a> in the event, as El Salvador faced an onslaught of gang violence that started in March, with a response from the government <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1115562" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified</a> as &#x201C;cruel and inhuman&#x201D; by the United Nations.</p>&#13;

Furthermore, in 2020 and 2021, an early miner from 2010 spent strings of 20 ancient block rewards. In 2022, however, only 17 block rewards from 2010 were spent. Alongside this, on March 10, 2022, an entity moved 489.091 bitcoin that sat dormant in a wallet since 2010. In April 2022, five block rewards from 2009 were spent as well and they were the first 2009 blocks spent since 2020.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Record High Spending of Ancient Bitcoin Block Rewards in 2020 and 2021, but Activity Slows in 2022</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
According to statistics, fewer old block rewards were spent in 2022 in terms of block subsidies that stemmed from 2009-2010 compared to the two years prior. In fact, only 17 block rewards from 2010, totaling 850 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, were moved after being dormant for over a decade.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The first 2010 block subsidy spent in 2022 was moved at block height 719,822 on Jan. 22 and came from the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/14Bdw4YgHpda7qHMT6GrDkvXF8QHVUYhUM">14Bdw</a>,&#x201D; which was created on Nov. 22, 2010. Three block rewards from 2010 were moved the following month on Feb. 4, 17, and 18.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On March 10, 2022, a large cache of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mega-awakening-whale-transfers-429-sleeping-bitcoin-from-2010-worth-over-16-8-million/">489.091 bitcoin</a>, worth over $16.8 million at that time, moved from an address created on Oct. 28, 2010. Zero 2010 block rewards were spent in April, but the month was special because a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/250-bitcoin-from-2009-moved-after-12-4-years-rare-btc-mined-over-a-2-day-span/">total of five block rewards</a> were moved that derived from 2009.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
It was the first 2009 coinbase reward spends since May 20, 2020. At the time, the 250 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> that derived from 2009 block subsidies were worth roughly $10.8 million at the time of transfer.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The following month on May 9, 2022, the address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1LNqDKATpZ2kzAo4Wc6NJi8AJUHprJ5mA2">1LNqD</a>&#x201D; created on May 24, 2010, spent approximately 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at block height 735,645. <a href="https://btcparser.com/">Btcparser.com data</a> shows that five block rewards worth 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> each were spent on June 13 (block height 740,549)and June 24, 2022.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Four out of the five block rewards were spent on June 24 at block height 742,183. On Aug. 22, 2022, a single block reward was moved at block height 750,594. Much later on Nov. 11, 2022, another 2010 block reward was spent at block height 762,711.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Last month in Dec. 2022, approximately two 2010 block rewards were spent. The first occurred on Dec. 21, at block height 768,302, and the second took place on Dec. 30, at block height 769,482.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The 17 2010 coinbase rewards plus the 489.091 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from the same year equates to &#x200B;&#x200B;1339.091 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in total, and with the 2009 blocks, the aggregate spent from 2009 and 2010 is approximately 1589.091 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Using current bitcoin exchange rates, the value of the 1,589.091 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> moved represents $26.30 million in USD value.&#13;<br />

However, much of that perception may have been a facade as a recent report details that Alameda suffered from financial troubles as early as 2018. People familiar with the matter said Alameda was losing money back then and a massive loss from a failed xrp trade in mid-2018 cut the company&#x2019;s assets by more than two-thirds.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Alameda Research&#x2019;s Fa&#xE7;ade as a Top Quantitative Crypto Trading Firm Crumbles With Reveal of Early Financial Struggles</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>&#x2019;s (SBF) Alameda Research reportedly lost large sums of money as early as 2018, according to a report published by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Alameda Research was a quantitive trading firm that was officially launched in Sept. 2017 with Tara Mac Aulay. Prior to launching Alameda, SBF worked for Jane Street and he traded international exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until he started his position as the director of development at the Centre for Effective Altruism.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html">Reports</a> detail that when SBF started Alameda, the trading firm was making millions by trades via arbitrage. As an arbitrageur, SBF claimed that opportunities stemmed from countries like Japan and South Korea as bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was trading for a premium in those regions. Because of the so-called &#x201C;Kimchi premium&#x201D; in South Korea, SBF said <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was 30% higher at times and in Japan, it was 10% higher. There&#x2019;s a slew of reports that highlight Alameda making millions from crypto arbitrage, but a recent report from the Wall Street Journal published on Dec. 31, 2022, details Alameda&#x2019;s trades were not always profitable.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The report says that while SBF stepped down as chief executive from Alameda, he was still very much in control of the company until the very end. The WSJ reporter Vicky Ge Huang detailed that Alameda &#x201C;took big gambles, winning some and losing plenty.&#x201D; Further, the WSJ report says SBF continuously borrowed money to bolster such bets and he promised investors double-digit returns if they helped him. According to Austin Campbell, Citigroup&#x2019;s former co-head of digital assets rates trading, the firm was looking to partner with market makers like Alameda, but Campbell said he grew skeptical of SBF&#x2019;s firm.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The thing that I picked up on immediately that was causing us heartburn was the complete lack of a risk-management framework that they could articulate in any meaningful way,&#x201D; Campbell detailed.&#13;</p>
<h2>SBF&#x2019;s Solicitation of Lenders Raised Questions About Company&#x2019;s Financial Stability</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
According to people familiar with the matter and Alameda&#x2019;s trading, the arbitrage opportunities quickly stopped and Alameda&#x2019;s trading algorithm allegedly made a lot of bad bets. In the spring of 2018, Alameda took a huge hit betting on xrp (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>) losing over two-thirds of Alameda&#x2019;s assets. So SBF reportedly started to solicit loans again with pitches promising 20% returns, the people familiar with the matter explained. A document reviewed by the WSJ shows SBF&#x2019;s lawyer explained how Alameda was a top market maker in one specific pitch to a lender, but the lawyer did not reveal any financial information.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Other people familiar with the matter said SBF sought lenders in Jan. 2019 at a Binance Blockchain Week event in Singapore. While Alameda sponsored the event with $150K, the conference was allegedly used by SBF to solicit lenders and a pamphlet was handed out to potential investors. The pamphlet claimed Alameda held $55 million in assets under management (AUM) but whether or not that data was factual remains to be seen. By Feb. 2019, SBF decided to move Alameda from California to Hong Kong. Former associates said that during the crypto bull run in 2021, Alameda made roughly $1 billion in profits, but when the bull run ended, SBF&#x2019;s bets began to sour.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/document-claims-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-ftx-margin-position-was-negative-1-3b-in-may-2022/">Reports</a> also show that Alameda&#x2019;s former CEO Caroline Ellison had a significant negative balance on FTX in May 2022, months before the FTX fallout. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-co-founder-indicted-by-federal-grand-jury-in-manhattan-bahamian-magistrate-denies-sbfs-bail/">Complaints</a> from the indictment in Manhattan, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charges</a>, and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-follows-sec-by-filing-a-lawsuit-against-disgraced-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">lawsuit filed</a> by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), indicate that Alameda&#x2019;s losses were so large, it pushed SBF to allegedly borrow funds from FTX customers to bolster the company after the losses. The WSJ further notes that SBF contemplated shutting Alameda down months before the two companies collapsed but the idea never came to fruition.&#13;<br />

The 31 tons of gold have been the subject of dispute between the current president Nicolas Maduro and Juan Guaido since 2019, when Guaido integrated a parallel government.</strong></p>
<h2>Status of Venezuelan Gold in the Bank of England Uncertain</h2>
<p>The status of the Venezuelan gold stash guarded in the vaults of the Bank of England in London is uncertain after the dissolution of the interim government of the country. The 31 tons of gold (1.02 millon troy ounces), valued at more than $1.85 billion, were disputed by the two governments of the country, one presided over by Nicolas Maduro, and the other by interim president Juan Guaido, who integrated a provisional government in 2019 after disputing the legality of the presidential ballot.</p>
<p>While U.K. courts had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-battle-for-the-2-billion-venezuelan-gold-stash-continues-london-rules-in-favor-of-opposition-leader-guaido/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> in favor of Guaido in July, the dissolution of the government executed in a session of the Legislative Assembly elected back in 2015, casts doubts on the possible future of this gold and other Venezuelan properties offshore, with some legislators claiming that might open the doors for Maduro to have a valid claim on these.</p>
<p>Deputy Freddy Guevara hinted at this possibility during the session. He <a href="https://www.bancaynegocios.com/guaido-recordo-a-cap-al-dejar-la-presidencia-interina-quiera-dios-que-no-tengan-que-arrepentirse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no prior consultation with the international community on the recognition of this reform. They have clearly told us abroad that, with this reform, the protection of foreign assets is not guaranteed. How is it possible to take a leap into the void?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>72 deputies voted to disintegrate the interim government, while 29 were against this measure, and eight deputies abstained.</p>

<h2>Protective Measures</h2>
<p>While the interim government was disbanded, the parallel Legislative Assembly constituted a Board of Directors and Asset Protection, that would have the task of safeguarding and organizing Venezuelan properties and companies abroad. The board, which will be integrated by five members, will have ample powers to deal with these responsibilities, supported by the legality of the assembly.</p>
<p>However, this structure is new and does not figure in any of the 52 trials all over the world where there is more than $40 billion in dispute between the two governments. Deputy Juan Miguel Matheus criticized this idea, stating that these assets were not in danger because they were under the custody of governments that back the &#8220;democratic struggle&#8221; that the Venezuelan people are currently fighting.</p>
<p>This, however, brought heavy criticism from other deputies, who argued that the interim government was the only warranty of recovering these assets due to the international recognition that Guaido had.</p>

<h2>Italian Parliament Passes Capital Gains Tax for Crypto</h2>
<p>The Italian parliament greenlighted a new tax for cryptocurrency on Dec. 29, as part of its budget law for the year 2023. Senators <a href="https://www.rainews.it/articoli/2022/12/ecco-tutte-le-novit-introdotte-dalla-legge-di-bilancio-2023-9d0ba89b-0c3f-4d4c-b9bc-a77055c57e52.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> the document presented on Dec. 24, which approved a 26% aliquot for cryptocurrency gains above 2,000 euros (approx. $2,060) during a tax period.</p>
<p>The capital gains tax for crypto had been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/italy-wants-to-tax-crypto-gains-at-26-from-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> since Dec 1, when the draft for the budget law was presented. The approved document includes a series of incentives for taxpayers to declare their cryptocurrency holdings, proposing an amnesty on gains achieved, paying a &#8220;substitute tax&#8221; of 3.5%, and adding a 0.5% as a fine for each year.</p>
<p>Another incentive included in the budget law will allow taxpayers to cancel their capital gains tax at 14% of the price of cryptocurrency held on Jan. 1, 2023, which would be significantly lower than the price paid when the cryptocurrency was purchased.</p>
<p>In the same way, cryptocurrency losses higher than 2000 euros in a tax period will count as tax deductions and will be able to be carried out to the next tax periods.</p>

<h2>Italy&#8217;s New Cryptocurrency Tax Law Leaves Room for Interpretation</h2>
<p>The law is clear about most of the key circumstances in which cryptocurrencies will be taxed. However, the law mentions that &#8220;the exchange between crypto assets having the same characteristics and functions does not constitute a taxable event.&#8221; This means that users will have to receive guidance to present their tax statements, as these assets having the same characteristics and functions have not been defined in the body of the law.</p>
<p>Italy, which lacks comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation, is following in the footsteps of Portugal. The European country <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/portugal-prepares-to-tax-crypto-gains-at-rate-of-28-draft-budget-unveils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included</a> a similar capital gains tax at a rate of 28% as part of its budget law for 2023, a decision that might put in danger the status of the country as a haven for cryptocurrency companies and holders.</p>
<p>This proposal, revealed in October, also contemplates taxes on the free transfer of cryptocurrency and on the commissions charged by cryptocurrency exchanges and other crypto operations for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions.</p>

Philion insists that the lack of such secure solutions has constrained the growth and use of defi products.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Lack of Communication Between Chains</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In written responses sent to Bitcoin.com News, Philion claimed that the large-scale, cross-chain experimentation primarily seen in 2020 and 2021 potentially explains why more than $2 billion has been lost via the so-called bridge exploits of the past 12 months. However, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hugophilion">Flare CEO</a>, while it may not be possible to completely eliminate risks for users, bridges could &#x201C;be made substantially safer.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Besides addressing security-related issues, Philion also offered his thoughts on many other issues that range from the possible use of non-smart contract digital assets in defi and Web3, to insuring digital assets when they are moved across chains.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Below are Philion&#x2019;s responses to the questions sent.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Can you explain why no one has been able to securely unify the ecosystem yet?</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>Hugo Philion (HP):</strong> Blockchains have historically been designed as distributed ledgers processing native transactions, i.e. for bitcoin, the movement of the native asset bitcoin from address A to address B. They haven&#x2019;t been designed to relay information between themselves, i.e., the Bitcoin chain cannot tell you what happened on the Ethereum chain at block #1083483. This creates a communication problem: how can information about different chains be reliably gathered and validated with decentralization analogues to the chains themselves? Furthermore, how can this be achieved while accounting for the risk of chain rollback?&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
To date, sufficiently secure and decentralized mechanisms to acquire and confirm state between disparate blockchains, apart from rollups, have not been built. A single solution likely does not exist. Instead, potentially multiple, different solutions will suit different use cases.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>BCN: How does the lack of efficient communication mechanisms between chains affect dapp (decentralized app) developers? </strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>HP:</strong> Today the biggest use case in the blockchain is decentralized finance (Defi). The lack of adequate cross-chain communication has constrained the size, participation, and efficiency of the Defi market. Not only have existing designs resulted in the loss of billions of dollars of capital, but they are also hard to use, limiting participation to more sophisticated users. As a result, market size, liquidity, and returns have been constrained.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Furthermore, use cases leveraging communication that could drive adoption have remained undiscovered. A simple example could be assets purchased or traded on a smart contract chain with direct payment in bitcoin. For blockchain engineers, this could enable a number of protocols that could ultimately revolutionize the digital ticketing market, gaming, or payment gateway technologies, for example. With high-integrity communication between chains, this simple example is just the starting point.&#13;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>&#13;<br />
<strong>BCN: Do cross-chain activities pose systemic risks to the industry? And if so, how?</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>HP:</strong> Yes. A case in point is how a cross-chain communication failure can wreak havoc on an entire downstream blockchain ecosystem. We have seen this recently with multiple bridge exploits. Without sufficiently secure and decentralized mechanisms for acquiring and reliably moving data between siloed blockchains, false information can be reported and relied upon to inform the movement of assets. If information is revealed to be incorrect after transactions have been validated and assets have subsequently been reallocated to more established chains, the risk is introduced to the entire system.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>BCN: What do you think made cross-chain bridges quite notorious in 2022 and are there any innovations that could help restore users&#x2019; faith in bridges? Also, can bridging solutions give users a fair degree of protection against the risk of losing their assets?</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>HP:</strong> [The years] 2021 and 2022 have witnessed large-scale cross-chain experimentation. As a result, cross-chain bridges received their first real stress tests. Ultimately, many performed abysmally with more than $2 billion of funds exploited in the last 12 months. The general inability to safely move assets across chains has likely hampered development in the space.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
I believe that by integrating suitably decentralized cross-chain communication akin to the underlying blockchain consensus mechanisms themselves, bridges could be made substantially safer. Furthermore, if assets are insured at the protocol level as they move across chains, additional risk can be mitigated.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Protection is thus a two-step process. First, risk must be minimized at the protocol level. Second, where possible, usage should be insured. In any complex financial system, risk will likely never be zero, but users must be protected where possible.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>BCN: How can the non-smart contract chains be connected with one another and is it possible to upgrade or to make crypto assets like bitcoin compatible with the defi world?</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>HP:</strong> Blockchains are siloed public databases that cannot natively read or report external transactions. At Flare, we are working on two general models to upgrade non-smart contract chains: payment triggers and bridging.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A payment trigger involves a smart contract function being triggered on one chain by a transaction on another chain. This delivers simple and useful functionality, such as paying for a collectable on a smart-contract platform with bitcoin or any other token. To do this well, a sufficiently decentralized data acquisition protocol requiring a number of participating validators to prove a transaction on a specific chain is required. At this point, data can be queried, acquired and securely reported to another chain. Then, other blockchain events can be triggered. Such a mechanism can be implemented for multiple non-smart contract chains so they can be referenced and connected.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In contrast, bridging brings full smart-contract features to a token such as bitcoin. With secure data acquisition and natively-available on-chain decentralized prices, it then becomes possible to create synthetic versions of these assets on a smart-contract chain. Crucially, in Flare&#x2019;s proposed model, unlike previous synthetic models, the user is only required to provide the underlying token itself, such as bitcoin. This removes the over-collateralization requirements and eliminates the direct market risk from the user, meaning that they do not need to actively manage the position. These 1:1 representations of assets like bitcoin can then be deployed in Defi and other decentralized applications.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>BCN: So what novel opportunities and use cases do you foresee if non-smart contract assets can be used for defi and Web3 activities?</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>HP:</strong> Approximately 70% of the total market capitalization of digital assets is composed of bitcoin, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, and dogecoin. Wide-scale usage of non-smart contract assets in Defi would mean greater liquidity for the market and reduced reliance on centralized services for users.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
For creators, there would be a larger available market and for token holders, decentralized access to this market. Additionally, on-ramping non-smart contract tokens onto a scalable chain also enables an alternative payment rail beyond efforts like Lightning. We also believe that Web3 needs greater scope, utility and consumer appeal through sufficiently decentralized and reliable communication protocols between blockchains and non-blockchain networks. We want to enable tokens like bitcoin to be used with these applications.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>BCN: In very simple terms, can you explain what native interoperability protocols are all about? </strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>HP:</strong> Flare has two unique protocols built natively into the network: the State Connector and the Flare Time Series Oracle. They are native because they are built directly into the blockchain using the FLR token to incentivize data provision, and they use the network itself to secure accurate data provision.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In simpler terms, for an actual five-year-old, these protocols are Flare&#x2019;s sensors, allowing it to reliably &#x201C;see&#x201D; what is taking place across other blockchains, make a note of it for future reference, and base decisions upon it. This is similar to how our senses allow us to see what&#x2019;s going on around us and interact with the world.&#13;<br />

<h2>IMF&#8217;s 2023 Economic Predictions</h2>
<p>International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva shared the IMF&#8217;s predictions on the U.S., the EU, China, and the world economy in an interview with CBS, aired Sunday. She detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is what we see in 2023. For most of the world economy, this is going to be a tough year, tougher than the year we leave behind. Why? Because the three big economies, U.S., EU, China, are all slowing down simultaneously.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. is most resilient. The U.S. may avoid recession. We see the labor market remaining quite strong. This is, however, a mixed blessing because if the labor market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,&#8221; the IMF chief continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU was very severely hit by the war in Ukraine. Half of the European Union will be in recession next year. China is going to slow down this year further,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Moreover, the IMF boss said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Next year will be a tough year for China. And that translates into negative trends globally.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;When we look at the emerging markets in developing economies, there, the picture is even direr. Why? Because on top of everything else, they get hit by high interest rates and by the appreciation of the dollar. For those economies that have high level of that, this is a devastation,&#8221; she cautioned.</p>
<p>Regarding China specifically, Georgieva described: &#8220;In the short term, bad news. China has slowed down dramatically in 2022 because of this tight zero Covid policy. For the first time in 40 years, China&#8217;s growth in 2022 is likely to be at or below global growth. That has never happened before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emphasizing that she hopes the U.S. economy &#8220;is not going to slip into recession despite all these risks,&#8221; the IMF managing director shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect one third of the world economy to be in recession … Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Georgieva added that &#8220;the world has changed dramatically,&#8221; noting that &#8220;it is a more shock-prone world.&#8221; She explained that these shocks include Covid, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;My message [is] don&#8217;t think that we are going to go back to pre-Covid predictability. More uncertainty, more overlap of crises wait for us … We have to buckle up and act in that more agile, precautionary manner,&#8221; she concluded.</p>

<h2>Peter Schiff&#8217;s 2023 Economic Predictions</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff shared his 2023 predictions about the U.S. economy, the dollar, and the stock market in a series of tweets Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. dollar index may have had a strong year, but it ended the year on a six-month low, down 10% from its November high,&#8221; he began, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>This weakness will likely continue in 2023, with the dollar having one of its worst years ever. If I&#8217;m right the inflation problem is about to get much worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiff also disagreed with Wharton University&#8217;s finance professor Jeremy Siegel who shared his economic view on CNBC last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeremy Siegel is wrong,&#8221; Schiff contended. Siegel &#8220;thinks falling real estate prices means the inflation threat is over. That&#8217;s falling asset prices. Consumer prices will keep rising, including those associated with homeownership like rent, mortgage rates, insurance, taxes, utilities, and maintenance,&#8221; Schiff argued.</p>
<p>Regarding the stock market, Schiff predicted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The worst-performing sectors of the stock market in 2022 will likely repeat as the worst-performing sectors in 2023.</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiff has repeatedly warned about the U.S. economy and the dollar crashing. In October, he cautioned about the rising national debt that the U.S. cannot repay. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to default,&#8221; he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-the-us-dollar-will-crash-says-were-going-to-default/">warned</a>. &#8220;We have much more debt now than we had in 2008 … so this is going to be a much bigger crisis when the defaults start,&#8221; he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-warns-us-faces-a-massive-financial-crisis-economist-expects-much-larger-problems-than-2008-when-the-defaults-start/">described</a>. The economist also predicted that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s recent actions could <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-fed-action-could-lead-to-market-crashes-massive-financial-crisis-severe-recession/">lead to</a> market crashes, a massive financial crisis, and a severe recession.</p>
