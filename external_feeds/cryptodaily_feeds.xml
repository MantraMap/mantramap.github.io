			  <description><![CDATA[<p>What is Interoperability?</p>
<p>Interoperability in the context of Web 3.0 refers to the ability of different systems, platforms, or networks to work together and exchange information and data in a decentralized environment. Web 3.0 is the third generation of the World Wide Web, which is characterized by the use of blockchain technology and decentralized platforms.</p>
<p>In this context, interoperability is critical because Web 3.0 systems, such as decentralized exchanges, operate on different blockchain networks and protocols, which can make it difficult for them to communicate and exchange data with each other.</p>
<p>Web 3.0 interoperability solutions aim to enable different systems to work together and exchange data in a seamless and efficient manner. This includes the use of cross-chain protocols, which allow different blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple, to name a few, to communicate and exchange information, as well as the development of open standards and APIs that enable different systems to work together.</p>
<p>Overall, interoperability is a key factor that enables Web 3.0 systems to function effectively and unlock the full potential of decentralized platforms, which is why exchanges like MetaX are putting interoperability at the forefront &ndash; to foster a fully immersive experience within the GameFi, NFT, and Metaverse realm to its users who can buy, sell, and trade with ease.</p>
<p>By enabling users to access a wider range of products and services, reducing friction in the exchange process, and fostering innovation and collaboration within the digital ecosystem, interoperability is critical for the growth and development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Why Interoperability matters</p>
<p>Although the most important aspect of Web 3.0 is interoperability &ndash; it is still one of the key challenges facing Web 3.0 exchanges. Since these exchanges operate on different blockchain networks and protocols, it can be difficult for them to communicate and exchange data with each other. This can create barriers for users who want to access a wide range of products and services, as they may need to navigate multiple exchanges and networks in order to complete transactions.</p>
<p>Web3 exchanges are decentralized platforms that allow users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets using blockchain technology. These exchanges operate on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, which means that they are not controlled by a central authority. This decentralized model enables Web3 exchanges to offer a number of benefits over traditional centralized exchanges, including increased security, transparency, and control for users.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges facing Web3 exchanges, however, is interoperability. Since these exchanges operate on different blockchain networks and protocols, it can be difficult for them to communicate and exchange data with each other. This can create barriers for users who want to access a wide range of products and services, as they may need to navigate multiple exchanges and networks in order to complete transactions.</p>
<p>Enter MetaX: A digital exchange that specializes in GameFi, Metaverse, and NFT projects. One of the key features of MetaX is its focus on interoperability, which refers to the ability of different systems, platforms, or networks to work together and exchange information and data.</p>
<p>In the world of digital exchanges, interoperability is critical for a number of reasons. Firstly, it allows users to access a wider range of products and services, as they can easily move between different exchanges and platforms. This is particularly important for the types of projects that MetaX focuses on, as the GameFi, Metaverse, and NFT markets are rapidly evolving and often involve multiple platforms and networks.</p>
<p>Secondly, interoperability helps to reduce friction and increase efficiency in the exchange process. By enabling seamless communication and data exchange between different systems, interoperability allows users to easily complete transactions and access the services they need without encountering barriers or delays.</p>
<p>Finally, interoperability helps to foster innovation and collaboration within the digital exchange ecosystem. By allowing different platforms and networks to work together, interoperability creates opportunities for new ideas and partnerships to emerge, which can drive growth and development in the industry.</p>
<p>By enabling users to access a wider range of products and services, reducing friction in the exchange process, and fostering innovation and collaboration within the digital ecosystem, interoperability is a key factor that sets Web3 exchanges like MetaX apart from traditional centralized exchanges. As the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve and grow, interoperability will continue to play a critical role in driving innovation and enabling users to access the full potential of decentralized platforms.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) softened below the 17000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair encountered selling pressure after peaking around the 16988 area, its strongest print since 20 December.&nbsp; The move higher also represents further gains above the 16880.44 level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the broad depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, and it was off more than 3% in December.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16721.41 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16786.71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the latest court ruling, Celsius Network has been rewarded the rights to interest-bearing accounts, pushing actual account holders to the end of the repayment queue.&nbsp;</p>
Big Blow For Earn Account Holders&nbsp;
<p>Celsius customers can forget about getting their funds back from the defunct crypto lending platform as the new year has brought even more unfavorable tidings for them. On January 4, a New York judge ruled in Celsius&rsquo;s favor, establishing its rights to earn deposits on interest-bearing accounts held on the lending platform. This spells bad news for the customers as this means that Celsius Earn account holders can only get a fraction of their initial investment back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Celsius is also currently under fire because of its pending bills with the mining company Core Scientific. According to an agreement between the two, Core Scientific has turned off power to 37,000 mining rigs belonging to Celsius due to non-payment of electricity bills.&nbsp;</p>
Judge Rules In Favor Of Celsius
<p>The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in July 2022 after taking major hits in the Terra LUNA debacle. According to the bankruptcy filings, the Celsius platform held around 600,000 accounts with total assets valued at a sizeable $4.2 billion. The latest ruling comes from bankruptcy judge Martin Glenn, who referenced the company&rsquo;s terms and conditions and declared that the funds in Earn accounts were company property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The judge ruled,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Court concludes, based on Celsius&rsquo;s unambiguous Terms of Use &hellip; that when the cryptocurrency assets were deposited in Earn Accounts, the cryptocurrency assets became Celsius&rsquo;s property; and the cryptocurrency assets remaining in the Earn Accounts on the Petition Date became property of the Debtors&rsquo; bankruptcy estates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the judge, the company&rsquo;s terms of service clearly stated that all customer deposits into Earn Accounts were under the company&rsquo;s ownership and would be treated as unsecured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. This means that repaying these customers is not high on Celsius&rsquo;s priority list and that the company will repay its higher-priority debts first with the available funds.&nbsp;</p>
Previously Directed To Return Funds
<p>However, it is interesting to note that Judge Martin Glenn had previously directed Celsius to refund customer funds. Not long ago, in December 2022, Judge Glenn addressed the lending platform and advised it to return investors&rsquo; money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judge said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want this case to move forward. I want creditors to recover as much as they possibly can as soon as they possibly can.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The judge had also stated that the funds held in escrow accounts must be returned to customers, even if they did not enter the company&rsquo;s interest-bearing accounts.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto bank Silvergate sees its share value fall as the crypto bear market continues to plague the sector.</p>
<p>Silvergate Capital Corp, a crypto-focused bank, has reported a significant drop in its fourth-quarter crypto-related deposits and announced plans to cut its workforce by 40%, or approximately 200 employees. This news comes as the company's shares have lost 88% of their value in 2022 and were down 40% in premarket trading.</p>
<p>According to a report by Reuters, preliminary earnings highlight that total deposits from digital asset customers declined to $3.8 billion at the end of December 2022, compared with $11.9 billion at the end of September 2022. In order to maintain liquidity, the bank sold $5.2 billion of debt securities in the fourth quarter, incurring a loss of $718 million.</p>
<p>The decline in the crypto sector, which saw over $1 trillion wiped out in value last year, has been attributed to rising interest rates and concerns of an economic downturn. The crash has also led to the demise of key industry players including crypto hedge funds, lending platforms, and exchanges.</p>
<p>A more recent calamity in the sector came when major crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November, leading to increased regulatory scrutiny of how crypto firms hold funds and conduct business operations. Silvergate has also faced regulatory scrutiny in the wake of the FTX collapse.</p>
<p>Despite experiencing rapid growth in 2020 and 2021, bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, saw widespread declines last year, affecting the entire crypto industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Top 5 blockchain ThunderCore is making an ecosystem-development push, partnering with a host of new validators as the chain rolls out its new cryptocurrency staking model. At the same time, ThunderCore is leveraging these promising developments to expand its presence in decentralized finance (DeFi), making overtures to leading protocols.</p>
<p>The newest ThunderCore validators include the famous virtual asset exchange Huobi and one of the earliest staking platforms in the space, MyCointainer. Users of both will now be able to stake ThunderCore&rsquo;s native asset TT to earn rewards.</p>
<p>Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, ThunderCore is an environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) chain, which means that its consensus mechanism for validating transactions is based on incentivized crypto staking.</p>
<p>ThunderCore&rsquo;s new PoS staking model, also known as ThunderCore 2.0, will dramatically increase both user staking and validator nodes. Such decentralization is crucial to secure PoSchains like ThunderCore, which must withstand coordinated attacks by malicious actors seeking to control two-thirds of the network, while adding more trustworthy validators also improves scalability and accelerates user growth.</p>
<p class="s9">Validator expansion</p>
<p>As a new partner, Huobi will implement and maintain a ThunderCore node, further securing the ThunderCore ecosystem. Additionally, Huobi's tens of millions of users will have access to ThunderCore PoS staking, while TT will be available to stake on Huobi Earn.</p>
<p>On top of operating a node, MyCointainer will allow for deposits and withdrawals on the platform. MyCointainer users will have access to TT trading pairs against BTC, USDT, and other major cryptos and fiat pairs.</p>
<p>The expansion of the validator network represents a significant step forward for ThunderCore, solidifying its position as a leading blockchain.</p>
<p class="s9">DeFi outreach</p>
<p>With the new ThunderCore 2.0 PoS staking model, the popular blockchain has overhauled its tokenomics, aiming to become an even bigger DeFi player in the years to come. Having already nurtured its native DeFi ecosystem, the ThunderCore developers are now seeking to court top DeFi protocols such as Curve Finance, AAVE, SushiSwap, Stargate and many others.</p>
<p>The ThunderCore team has begun this effort with making approaches to the leading DeFi projects. Here&rsquo;s one proposal from the developers presenting their case as to why the protocol should deploy on ThunderCore. Diversifying ThunderCore&rsquo;s native DeFi ecosystem allows the team to build a brighter future with the support of the project&rsquo;s multi-chain feature, decentralization, and community-driven economics.</p>
<p>The team offers ThunderCore's user-retention and mass-adoption strategy (over 400K monthly active users), one-stop-shop TT Wallet, high levels of interoperability, extensive partnerships, and range of developer incentives and tools, among other points.</p>
<p>Corresponding proposals are in the works for the other major DeFi protocols.</p>
<p class="s9">Future expectations</p>
<p>ThunderCore will continue to welcome new validators to its PoS network. This aligns with the team&rsquo;s commitment to providing a secure and decentralized platform for its users. Adding new, reputable organizations to the validator network enhances the security of the blockchain, making it a top choice for decentralized applications. Meanwhile, increased staking rewards under the new tokenomics are a tangible benefit to the community that furthers the same goals.</p>
<p>ThunderCore will also be encouraging more DeFi projects to open up shop. The high-performance chain offers many benefits for DeFi, including sub-second transactions, gas fees at a fraction of a cent, and massive scalability. These features make ThunderCore an ideal home for DeFi developers looking to build and grow on a reliable and secure network.</p>
<p class="s9">ThunderCore for developers</p>
<p>ThunderCore is among the most hospitable homes for developers in the Web3 industry. The company has long believed that if you attract the best developers, then the users will follow. To that end, they have made various efforts to nurture their developer community:</p>
<p class="s14">ThunderGene API Tool</p>
<p>ThunderCore&rsquo;s groundbreaking API tool allows for the easy integration of Web3 features into Web2 apps. With ThunderGene, it&rsquo;s possible to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens inside a Web2 app while outsourcing the burden of wallet security to the cutting-edge TT Wallet.</p>
<p class="s14">$100M Web3 Fund</p>
<p>Along with partners 886 Studios and Outliers Fund, ThunderCore maintains a $100M fund to assist those who would like to build decentralized applications on its chain.</p>
<p class="s14">Developer Growth Fund</p>
<p>In addition to the $100M Web3 Fund, ThunderCore also operates a Developer Growth Fund, which is about to undergo a major update. The fund guides projects to completion with technical, promotional, financial, and operational assistance.</p>
<p>Stay tuned over at the ThunderCore blog for the latest on the fund and other news.</p>
<p class="s15">About ThunderCore</p>
<p class="s16">ThunderCore is among the world&rsquo;s top 5 blockchains and the only platform growing DApp users organically through ecosystem retention, which will be the key driving force behind the real mass adoption of blockchain. Its proof-of-stake (PoS) architecture, EVM compatibility, entertainment-first ethos, and deep developer support provide a battle-tested home for the next generation of crypto innovators across Web3, DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, and the metaverse.</p>
<p class="s16">Thanks to its unique PaLa consensus mechanism, ThunderCore can handle 4,000+ TPS with sub-second confirmation times and ultra-low gas fees kept at a fraction of a cent.</p>
<p class="s16">ThunderCore Token (TT), the chain&rsquo;s popular native asset, can be stored in the feature-rich TT Wallet, together with other supported ecosystem assets.</p>
<p class="s16">Created in 2017 by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Chris Wang to help solve Ethereum&rsquo;s scalability issues, ThunderCore was able to reach such an achievement in ecosystem retention because of the proven, stable, scalable, and secure blockchain technology built over the last five years.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>There are many options when it comes to digital assets, and it can be difficult to decide which ones are the best investments. While both AAVE and Hex Coin (HEX) are two popular digital asset options, investors are increasingly turning to Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) during the final phase of its public presale.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">AAVE</p>
<p>Aave (AAVE) provides cryptocurrency users with a comprehensive liquidity platform to borrow, lend, and stake their digital assets securely. Flash loans, fixed-term deposits, yield optimization strategies, and more &mdash; the Defi space offers an array of options for you to take advantage of.</p>
<p>As a decentralized project, Aave (AAVE) uses an automated market maker (AMM) &nbsp;tomanage liquidity and pricing. There is also a governance system in place, which allows AAVE holders to make decisions about the project.</p>
<p>While Aave (AAVE) is leading the way in Defi, the bear market has caused the token to drop by more than 90% since hitting an all-time high of $666 in 2021. &nbsp;Aave (AAVE) still has a future, but holders are getting impatient, especially with the likes of OrbeonProtocol (ORBN) growing so well.</p>
<p class="s9">Hex Coin (HEX)</p>
<p>Founded by Richard Hart, Hex Coin (HEX) is a decentralized savings platform that rewards users for holding their tokens. Hex Coin offers high returns over time, with the potential to earn an annual return of over 100% p.a.</p>
<p>Hex Coin is powered by Ethereum smart contracts and utilizes a hybrid PoW + PoSconsensus mechanism, allowing users to earn rewards when they stake Hex Coin tokens to secure the network.</p>
<p>However, while Hex Coin (HEX) saw impressive gains during the 2021 bull run, the Hex Coin price has since retraced and is currently trading down 96% since last November. While the bear market can take a lot of the blame, Hex Coin (HEX) is under fire for being a &ldquo;scam&rdquo; project and failing to deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>By introducing blockchain technology to the venture capital industry, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is revolutionizing the investing landscape and disrupting traditional venture capital models.</p>
<p>On Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), startups can access the funding they need by minting their equity as fractionalized NFTs. Investors can then purchase these NFTs for as low as $1, reducing the amount of risk and providing more liquidity to venture capital investments.</p>
<p>No longer do startups have to contend with strict venture capital requirements or expensive financing options. With Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), startups can access funding from a larger pool of investors, and investors have the opportunity to diversify their portfolios.</p>
<p>The Orbeon platform utilizes its own digital asset, the ORBN token, to reward platform users. By staking their ORBN tokens, token holders can earn a share of the fees generated on the platform, and holding the token allows users to gain access to exclusive investment opportunities, and governance rights. </p>
<p>Given how quickly news of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is spreading, it&rsquo;s no surprise that phases 1 and 2 of the presale have sold out quickly and seen a price increase from $0.0004 to $0.0362. Phase 3 looks to be no different, as analysts forecast ORBN will rise by a total of &nbsp;6000% by the time it hits exchanges.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A blog post by Fabio Panneta of the ECB gave the view that trading in cryptocurrencies was akin to gambling, and should be treated as such by regulators.</p>
<p>According to Panneta, the recent collapse of the crypto market left investors with significant losses and raised concerns about the costs to society of an unregulated industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He called TerraUSD, a stablecoin that proved to be unstable, and said that it was one of the first casualties in a chain of failures that led to the collapse of several lending platforms, a hedge fund, a major crypto exchange, and a US-listed crypto mining company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His belief is that other crypto companies may also be added to this list in the coming months, and that these failures highlight the high leverage and interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem, as well as the lack of governance structures in place.</p>
Regulation is a step in the right direction
<p>He continues by stating that despite their fundamental flaws, it is not certain that crypto assets will ultimately self-destruct. He accuses unbacked crypto assets of having no intrinsic value and says that they are primarily used for speculative purposes rather than payments or funding consumption or investment. Instead, he maintains that they may, however, continue to be a vehicle for gambling in the digital era.</p>
<p>He says that the cost to society of an unregulated crypto industry is too high to ignore. In addition to causing significant losses for investors, unregulated crypto assets can be used for tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He believes that they also have a high environmental cost, and states that it is therefore crucial that regulatory gaps are addressed and the social costs of cryptos are addressed.</p>
<p>Panneta thinks that the EU's Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) is a step in the right direction, but that more needs to be done to ensure that all segments of the industry are regulated, including decentralised finance activities such as crypto asset lending or non-custodial wallet services.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto is gambling
<p>He is of the view that unbacked crypto assets should be treated as gambling activities and regulated accordingly, with vulnerable consumers protected through principles similar to those recommended by the European Commission for online gambling.</p>
<p>He sees that global regulation is also necessary to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure that the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee for the treatment of banks' exposures to crypto assets are implemented.</p>
Opinion
<p>Fabio Panneta is an ardent opponent of cryptocurrencies and even though he maintains that they have not yet impacted on the traditional financial system, he is likely of the belief that they could eventually be rival forms of currency.</p>
<p>Publishing a blog that accuses the crypto sector of being a place for gamblers is not helpful. It belittles the truly innovative technologies that have come out of the industry and is aimed at scaring retail investors away.</p>
<p>If trading in cryptocurrencies is gambling, then trading in stocks, bonds, and all the other traditional financial assets must also be so. For such a high ranking official to be attempting to muddy the waters in such a way is surely puerile in the extreme.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Singapore, SG, 5th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Web3 infrastructure company AAG has officially launched its flagship product - the MetaOne&reg; Wallet. In order to simplify and ease the onboarding of new users into the Metaverse economy, the MetaOne Wallet gets rid of the requirement for users to remember or safely store their private keys and seed phrases. Further user friendly features include fiat on-ramps provided by industry giants Coinbase Pay and Simplex, an integrated decentralized application (dApp) marketplace serving only approved dApps, and AAG&rsquo;s own educational AAG Academy.</p>
<p>With the AAG team rolling out support for multiple blockchains in the coming weeks and the AAG Academy spearheading the efforts to raise awareness about crypto and Web3, MetaOne intends to play a vital role in helping drive the mainstream use and acceptance of Web3 primitives.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I truly believe MetaOne will be a game-changer for both consumers and businesses. When businesses are able to provide a more seamless onboarding experience and consumers can feel safe to enter and discover what they can do with Web3, we will be able to take a giant leap toward mainstream adoption.&rdquo; said Jack Vinijtrongjit, Co-Founder and CEO of AAG.</p>
<p>The central focus of the MetaOne Wallet is to simplify the user experience, enabling everyone to start their Web3 and crypto journey. Strategically designed to suit the needs of both beginners and experienced users, MetaOne makes it easy to acquire, monitor, and manage a wide range of digital assets and NFTs. Moreover, Simplex and Coinbase Pay integrations assure users can purchase their first digital assets through secure and tested fiat-based payment methods. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To shorten the wallet learning curve, MetaOne eliminates the need for users to remember their private keys and seed phrases. Instead, users can log into their wallets via several different alternatives, including email and password, as well as a device&rsquo;s passcode and biometrics. </p>
<p>The AAG team has placed substantial emphasis on the safety, security, and efficiency of the MetaOne Wallet. Built on top of AAG&rsquo;s scam detector software, MetaOne Wallet can detect and mitigate potential scams from malicious smart contracts and bad actors. The MetaOne Wallet also has a built-in feature that warns users of common mistakes, allowing them to double-check before committing to a transaction.</p>
<p>The MetaOne Wallet features an integrated dApp store, the MetaOne dApp Store, offering more than 1,100 dApps across several categories. Each dApp is individually verified for quality and safety to guarantee users&rsquo; safety from scams and rug pulls. Developers can also contribute to the ecosystem, leveraging the MetaOne API to provide newer experiences for users, such as requesting access to move assets cross-chain and cross-wallet without requiring users to bridge or move all digital assets into the same wallet. 

At launch the MetaOne wallet will be able to support tokens &amp; NFTs from 5 blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Harmony, BNB Chain - with many more set to be added in 2023.</p>
<p>AAG CEO Jack Vinijtrongjit will be hosting an AMA on 11th January at 11am UTC to answer questions about the AAG product ecosystem. Register Here.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>South Korean tech giant LG Electronics has announced a partnership with the cloud-based technology platform Oorbit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership will aim to bring the metaverse directly into the living room of TV viewers.&nbsp;</p>
An Easy Way To Interact With The Metaverse
<p>LG Electronics has announced that it has teamed up with the cloud-based technology platform Oorbit to bring the metaverse experience directly to living rooms. The collaboration will allow users to seamlessly view interconnected virtual worlds, concerts, and artificial intelligence (AI) multiplayer games directly through their LG TVs, making it easy for users to access and interact in the metaverse. According to a press release, users will be able to access super high-fidelity interconnected virtual worlds and experiences such as virtual concerts and AI-generative multiplayer games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LG&rsquo;s endorsement of the metaverse comes at a time when there are a growing number of critics of the technology. However, the metaverse is getting a significant boost at CES 23, which is where LG made the announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief technology officer of Oorbit, Pooya Koosha, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working on the hardware, networking, and software layers to create the metaverse for almost a decade &ndash; it just wasn&rsquo;t called the metaverse back then. Our proprietary technology is the connective tissue that links virtual worlds together and makes it easy for developers and brands to bring their experiences into the metaverse. Scaling our technology for millions of LG TV customers is the next step in making the metaverse accessible for all.&rdquo;</p>

LG Actively Exploring Blockchain-Based Software&nbsp;
<p>LG has been actively exploring cryptocurrency and blockchain-based software and updated its business development goals to reflect the same. According to a South Korean news source, the company added two crypto-specific objectives during its annual general meeting.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean tech giant LG Electronics has announced a partnership with the cloud-based technology platform Oorbit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership will aim to bring the metaverse directly into the living room of TV viewers.&nbsp;</p>
An Easy Way To Interact With The Metaverse
<p>LG Electronics has announced that it has teamed up with the cloud-based technology platform Oorbit to bring the metaverse experience directly to living rooms. The collaboration will allow users to seamlessly view interconnected virtual worlds, concerts, and artificial intelligence (AI) multiplayer games directly through their LG TVs, making it easy for users to access and interact in the metaverse. According to a press release, users will be able to access super high-fidelity interconnected virtual worlds and experiences such as virtual concerts and AI-generative multiplayer games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LG&rsquo;s endorsement of the metaverse comes at a time when there are a growing number of critics of the technology. However, the metaverse is getting a significant boost at CES 23, which is where LG made the announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief technology officer of Oorbit, Pooya Koosha, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working on the hardware, networking, and software layers to create the metaverse for almost a decade &ndash; it just wasn&rsquo;t called the metaverse back then. Our proprietary technology is the connective tissue that links virtual worlds together and makes it easy for developers and brands to bring their experiences into the metaverse. Scaling our technology for millions of LG TV customers is the next step in making the metaverse accessible for all.&rdquo;</p>

LG Actively Exploring Blockchain-Based Software&nbsp;
<p>LG has been actively exploring cryptocurrency and blockchain-based software and updated its business development goals to reflect the same. According to a South Korean news source, the company added two crypto-specific objectives during its annual general meeting. These were the &ldquo;development and selling of blockchain-based software&rdquo; and &ldquo;the sale and brokerage of cryptocurrency.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership with Oorbit, and its vision, the head of content service division at LG Electronics Home Entertainment Company, Jung Sung-Hyun, stated,&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US government has seized hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of shares in Robinhood Markets Inc. as part of the fraud case against Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>According to a report on Bloomberg, the shares, which are now worth more than $460 million, are being contested by various creditors of FTX who have filed court cases in an effort to claim ownership of the shares. A hearing will be held at a later date to determine the fate of the seized shares and assets. The seizures are part of the fraud case against Bankman-Fried and other top FTX officials.</p>
<p>The shares were originally purchased by Sam Bankman-Fried in May 2022, and were a substantial amount, forming around 17.6% of Robinhood. Rumours are that SBF borrowed more than $1.5 billion from Alameda Research in order to finance the purchase.</p>
Seized bank accounts
<p>In addition to the seizure of the Robinhood shares, the government is also taking control of a number of bank accounts that were linked to an FTX unit in the Bahamas. It is unclear at this time what assets are contained within these accounts, but it is likely that they will be subject to scrutiny as part of the fraud case against Bankman-Fried and other top FTX officials.</p>
<p>The future of the seized shares and assets is currently up in the air, as a court hearing has yet to be scheduled to determine their fate. It is possible that the shares will be sold off to pay off the debts of FTX, or they may be returned to the rightful owners if it is determined that they were acquired illegally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also possible that the assets in the bank accounts could be sold off or returned to their owners depending on the outcome of the fraud case. Regardless of the outcome, the seizure of these assets is a major blow to Bankman-Fried.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Brian Armstrong-led cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has reached a $100 million settlement with New York&rsquo;s Department of Financial Services (DFS), according to statements released by both parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the news, the Coinbase stock saw a considerable jump, rising over 12%.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase Settles New York State Investigation&nbsp;
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced that it has reached a $100 million settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS). The exchange and the regulator announced the news through separate statements released on Wednesday. Under the terms of the settlement, Coinbase will pay a $50 million fine, and invest a further $50 million towards compliance efforts, and look to block any potential criminal or malicious actor from using the exchange. Coinbase will also be required to work with a third-party monitor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This agreement includes a $50 million penalty and a separate commitment from Coinbase to invest $50 million in our compliance program over two years.&rdquo;</p>

Close Scrutiny Of Coinbase
<p>According to regulators from New York&rsquo;s Department of Financial Services, Coinbase had long-standing failures in its anti-money laundering program. The DFS also found that Coinbase treated its onboarding requirements for customers as a simple &ldquo;check-the-box&rdquo; and had not carried out sufficient background checks on its users. In a statement, Coinbase&rsquo;s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, stated that the firm had taken substantial measures to address &ldquo;historical shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enforcement action by authorities comes as state and federal regulators have ramped up their efforts following the spectacular collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX exchange, which was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.&nbsp;</p>
Significant Compliance Shortcomings&nbsp;
<p>According to regulators, shortcomings in Coinbase&rsquo;s compliance processes led to considerable suspicious and unlawful conduct facilitated through the platform. Regulators cited a case where one Coinbase customer was charged with crimes related to child sexual abuse but was not flagged by the Coinbase system when they joined the platform. Regulators added that the user in question could access the exchange and engage in &ldquo;suspicious transactions potentially associated with illicit activity without detection.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase eventually identified the user, closed the account, and reported the user to law enforcement authorities. On its part, Coinbase has committed to identifying and rectifying issues that regulators have flagged. Furthermore, Coinbase management has consistently pushed for broader and clearer regulations of the crypto industry. In an op-ed, the Coinbase CEO wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Despite the prevailing notion that crypto companies don&rsquo;t want to be regulated, many &mdash; if not most &mdash; companies have been working with policymakers for years.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase Stock Jumps&nbsp;
<p>Following the settlement news, the Coinbase stock price jumped nearly 12%. The platform is the only publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the United States and had disclosed the probe in its 2021 10-K filing with the SEC. Additionally, several other major players, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, rely on Coinbase for the custody of their assets in cold storage. Coinbase holds licenses across the United States and globally.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A hack that exploited and drained GMX tokens from a whale enabled the perpetrator to exchange the assets for 2,627 Ether.</p>
<p>The hacks go on and on. It seems that exploits are being found in the code of DeFi protocols left, right and centre, and it must be wondered just when will the space reach the maturity and breadth of security whereby the hacks stop happening.</p>
GMX whale hack
<p>Hackers have stolen $3.4 million worth of GMX tokens from a whale, according to security firms CertiK and PeckShield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hack saw the perpetrators take control of 82,519 GMX tokens and exchange them for 2,627 Ether. The assets were then transferred to the Ethereum network via the Hop Protocol and Across Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hack led to a sudden drop in the value of the GMX token to $38, but it has since recovered to $41.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An administrator in the GMX Telegram group confirmed that a phishing attack had taken place, clarifying that there were no security vulnerabilities on the GMX platform itself. A moderator in the group stated that they were in communication with the victim of the attack.</p>
Holiday period hacks
<p>On January 1, Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin core developer, announced that he had fallen victim to hackers and lost BTC as a result. This news sparked discussions within the cryptocurrency community about the dangers of self-custodying digital assets. Some community members argued that if even a top developer like Dashjr couldn't secure his BTC, it would be difficult for the average person to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeFi hackers have been active over the holiday season, with $12m worth of digital assets taken in a flash loan attack on Dec. 25 and $8m drained from Bitkeep wallets in another hack on Dec. 26.</p>

<p>Hackers have stolen $3.4 million worth of GMX tokens from a whale, according to security firms CertiK and PeckShield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hack saw the perpetrators take control of 82,519 GMX tokens and exchange them for 2,627 Ether. The assets were then transferred to the Ethereum network via the Hop Protocol and Across Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hack led to a sudden drop in the value of the GMX token to $38, but it has since recovered to $41.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An administrator in the GMX Telegram group confirmed that a phishing attack had taken place, clarifying that there were no security vulnerabilities on the GMX platform itself. A moderator in the group stated that they were in communication with the victim of the attack.</p>
Holiday period hacks
<p>On January 1, Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin core developer, announced that he had fallen victim to hackers and lost BTC as a result. This news sparked discussions within the cryptocurrency community about the dangers of self-custodying digital assets. Some community members argued that if even a top developer like Dashjr couldn't secure his BTC, it would be difficult for the average person to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeFi hackers have been active over the holiday season, with $12m worth of digital assets taken in a flash loan attack on Dec. 25 and $8m drained from Bitkeep wallets in another hack on Dec. 26.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap's newly implemented bug bounty program has been a roaring success, as it helped uncover and subsequently resolve an existing vulnerability in its Universal Router smart contract.</p>
<p>The two new smart contracts, Permit2 and Universal Router, were released back in November 2022. Through token approval sharing and management, the Permit2 smart contract grants applications with access to an array of secure authorization capabilities. On the other hand, Universal Router compile ERC-20 and NFT transactions into a single swap router, giving Uniswap a more efficient method for exchanging between various types of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>With the introduction of these new smart contracts, Uniswap also announced a bug bounty program which would help the platform detect any potential vulnerabilities. As the digital currency and blockchain market continues to evolve, bug bounties have become a way for firms to ensure their software, systems, and critical infrastructure are secure.</p>
<p>DeFi security auditing firm Dedaub was among the first to receive a hefty award for their work on identifying a vulnerability on the Universal Router smart contract. The vulnerability was flagged as having the ability to permit reentrancy during a transaction's confirmation time, which could be exploited by threat actors to then drain a wallet's funds.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Dedaub team has disclosed a Critical vulnerability to the Uniswap team!Funds are safe - Uniswap addressed the issue and redeployed the Universal Router smart contracts on all its chains 👏The vulnerability allows re-entertrancy to drain the user's funds, mid-tx.🧵 pic.twitter.com/wFSFsohPvy</p>
&mdash; Dedaub (@dedaub) January 2, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Dedaub explains that the Universal Router provides users with the opportunity to make numerous transactions at once, such as exchanging multiple tokens and NFTs in a single go. The router's integrated scripting language is capable of a vast array of token activities including transfers to external payees. When done correctly step by step, these funds would be delivered right away should the transaction meet the criteria set by the smart contract's parameters.</p>
<p>By design, this means that a third-part code, when invoked during the transfer, could allow the code to re-enter the Universal Router and manage or pull tokens that are on the smart contract for a temporary period. This prompted the Dedaub whitehats to advise Uniswap of a resolution, which involved patching the smart contract with a reentrancy lock for the core execution module of Universal Router.</p>
<p>Uniswap then swiftly awarded $40,000 to the Dedaub team for their prompt disclosure. According to Uniswap, the issue was of medium-level severity, while further assessment of the vulnerability pointed to a low-chance, high-impact scenario. Dedaub confirms that the attack vector can be considered as user-end error, because the scenario would only happen if a user directly sends NFTs to an untrusted recipient.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the crypto winter showing no signs of abating, crypto payment companies Wyre and EmpireDAO have become its latest casualties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wyre informed employees about its plans during the holiday season, while EmpireDAO will look to make a &ldquo;clean exodus&rdquo; from its Manhattan location.&nbsp;</p>
Wyre To Shut Operations?
<p>As the ongoing crypto winter continues, crypto and Web3 businesses are feeling the pinch. The latest to be impacted are crypto payments firm Wyre, and EmpireDAO, a crypto co-working space that was dubbed as the WeWork of Web3. Founded nearly a decade ago, Wyre recently let go of several employees, with two former employees confirming plans that the company intended to shutter its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to one former employee who cited an email from the CEO of Wyre, Ioannis Giannaros, the company was planning on liquidating and would terminate services as early as the ongoing month. Employees also revealed that no severance package had been offered to them by the company. However, Giannaros stated that the company was still operating but would be scaling back to plan the way forward.&nbsp;</p>
EmpireDAO Planning A Clean Exodus&nbsp;
<p>More evidence of the market&rsquo;s downturn was presented in the form of EmpireDAO announcing the end of its tenancy at 190 Bowery in New York. The crypto co-working space was founded by Mike Fraietta, with its office building tapped to become the WeWork of Web3. However, the company is already looking to move, under a year after its opening. The space at 190 Bowery has amassed 1500 members, with 300 daily visitors. The firm is now looking to move elsewhere, with Fraietta stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tried every which way to get new sponsors, partnerships, and even crowdfunding. But we needed more help to sustain at 190 Bowery.&rdquo;</p>

Last Ditch Effort&nbsp;
<p>To save its tenancy, Fraietta even attempted a last-minute crowdfunding campaign, aiming to raise around 215 ETH ($260,000.) However, this effort fell short, as the campaign received a lukewarm response. In the end, the effort was able to galvanize a total of 6.27 ETH, which is around $8100. The donations will be returned to the donors with the campaign failing to achieve its target.&nbsp;</p>
The Future For EmpireDAO&nbsp;
<p>With EmpireDAO closing its current location, Fraietta stated that there are plans to reopen at another location for &ldquo;Season 2.&rdquo; He also highlighted plans for potential EmpireDAO pop-ups at various crypto conferences and at this year&rsquo;s SXSW in Austin, Texas. The announcement of EmpireDAO&rsquo;s closure received several supportive messages from users on the group&rsquo;s Telegram chat. One user wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for opening the doors both literally and figuratively to so many people, projects, minds, and movements.&rdquo;</p>

Other Companies Feeling The Pinch&nbsp;
<p>The news about Wyre and EmpireDAO comes against the backdrop of an unrelenting crypto winter that has impacted several other startups and seen capital dry up. The underlying blockchain for many projects that worked on EmpireDAO, Solana, has also taken a significant hit, with its native SOL cryptocurrency down nearly 90%. Another recent casualty of the ongoing bear market is crypto investment firm Midas, which announced that it is shutting down its DeFi platform after suffering cataclysmic losses during the Terra, Celsius, and FTX crashes.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web3 research tool and NFT community platform NFT Inspect has announced that it will be shutting down on January 17, a move that coincides with the global decline in NFT trades.</p>
<p>According to a tweet from the project's team, the shutdown includes both their website and the web browser extension. NFT Inspect's toolset allowed NFT traders and enthusiasts to properly gauge and assess NFT values, in terms of how it is performing within the NFT market in general, as well as, specifically, in terms of their popularity on Crypto Twitter. This was done by tracking changes in NFT Twitter profile photos and extracting analytics based on these changes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After months of working and reworking, we&rsquo;ve come to the difficult conclusion that we cannot maintain Inspect going forward [...] we want to sincerely thank each and every one of you for your support over the rollercoaster of this last year," the NFT Inspect team stated.</p>

<p>Following a drastic market downturn in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the decision to end this project has been finalized. According to a recent report, NFT trading globally experienced an alarming 77% dip between Q2 and Q3 of 2022, resulting in total global volume of only $1.7 billion during that quarter.</p>
<p>What's more concerning is that there was also an 84% decrease in profits from reselling these tokens during the same period &mdash; clearly demonstrating how quickly investor sentiment can change within this sector.</p>
<p>Data aggregated from CryptoSlam.io reveals how roughly $650 million worth of NFTs were sold in December 2022, a considerable decrease as compared to the whopping $2.6 billion figure observed in December 2021.</p>
<p>It is still unclear as to how this crypto space will evolve in the near future, however certain experts are exploring new avenues and possibilities for NFTs. As of now, however, it looks like crypto investors may have to look elsewhere for hopes of a more lucrative sector to carve on.</p>
<p>The crypto industry is taking notice of the declining trade dynamics in NFTs, and projects like NFT Inspect have been forced to make tough decisions that best suit their particular business model. Nevertheless, the crypto industry has a lot more to offer beyond NFTs with emerging use cases in other areas such as DeFi continuing to show promise for investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 16880 Resistance:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 5 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) gave back some recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair retreated to the 16799.44 area after trading as high as the 16916.87 level, representing a test of the 61.8% retracement of the appreciating range from 15992.64 to 18385.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;The ongoing move higher also represented a test of the 23.6% retracement of the broad depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, and it was off more than 3% in December.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16715.49 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16726.21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Core Scientific has come to an agreement with Celsius Network to shut down the 37,000 mining rigs that it was hosting for the latter.&nbsp;</p>
Power Cut To Celsius&rsquo;s Rigs
<p>The Celsius Network has agreed to let the Bitcoin miner Core Scientific cut power to the 37,000 mining rigs it was hosting for the defunct crypto platform due to Celsius&rsquo;s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. The mining company initiated this move by filing a revised proposed order on January 3, claiming that all Celsius mining rigs would be powered down immediately. The filing also stated that the powered-down rigs would not be restarted during the transition period.&nbsp;</p>
Celsius Defaulted On Electricity Fees
<p>This move comes after several months of Celsius defaulting on power bills, for which Core Scientific even accused Celsius on October 21. In fact, the lack of payment had even created liquidity issues for the Bitcoin miner, for which it had to declare bankruptcy on December 21.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Core Scientific filed a motion on December 28 to reject the contract since Celsius had been in breach of contract due to non-payment of bills. The court filings have revealed that Core Scientific has covered around $7.8 million of power fees for Celsius till December 28 and claimed that it could not afford to continue shouldering the burden of Celsius&rsquo;s unpaid power costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By terminating the Celsius contract, Core Scientific would be able to generate a revenue of $2 million per month by renting out the space currently occupied by the Celsius mining rigs.&nbsp;</p>
BTC Mining Not Profitable Anymore
<p>Bitcoin mining is not a profitable expedition anymore. Costs of production have increased while Bitcoin prices have dropped. The Russia-Ukraine war has been a major factor leading to the rising costs of electricity, something that Bitcoin mining rigs need lots of. On top of that, the plummeting value of Bitcoin has also eaten into miners&rsquo; profits. In fact, Bitcoin&rsquo;s hash price, which is the revenue miners can earn per unit of hash rate, has dropped by 75% in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, share prices have also dropped, with Core Scientific itself losing almost 99.15% in its share prices throughout 2022. On the other hand, bankrupt crypto firm Celsius has already been ordered by a judge to refund customers' crypto assets worth $44 million. It is to be seen if Celsius returns any of the fees that it owes to the mining company.&nbsp;</p>
