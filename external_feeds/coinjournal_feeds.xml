<li dir="ltr">Chancer presale sees strong investor interest with over $835k raised just weeks into the token sale.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Chancer could disrupt the online betting industry via a revolutionary P2P betting model.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Early buyers of $CHANCER can now do so with ETH, USDT, BUSD and BNB.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">A recent<a href="https://k33.com/research/articles/the-global-crypto-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>report</u></a> from K33 Research revealed that the global crypto industry currently stands at $180 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the global online betting and gambling market is worth over $60 billion. Growth projections for these sectors point to an average of 11% CAGR to 2030. It is a scenario that alludes to the unprecedented growth investors anticipate for both crypto and online betting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tucked in between and out to underscore this future is <a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chancer</a>, one of the most exciting crypto project for the betting industry whose presale has seen incredible interest and investment.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s unique approach to the online betting</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to its<a href="https://chancer.com/whitepaper.pdf">&nbsp;<u>whitepaper</u></a>, Chancer is building the &ldquo;<em>world&rsquo;s first decentralized social predictive markets platform</em>.&rdquo; The goal is to redefine the online betting market with a new peer-to-peer (P2P) model that puts control over market making into the hands of the user.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project leverages blockchain technology to allow users be in charge of their markets, odds and rules &ndash; simply play your game at your own rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">No centralised power as is the case with current market where bookmaker have the biggest say in what bettors can access and how they do it. On Chancer, users can create a predictive market on any event, right from the local market&rsquo;s most mundane occurences, to the world&rsquo;s biggest sports and entertainment events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is also not just another betting platform &ndash; it is designed to grow into a robust community spanning the global market. Its core features of blockchain and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrency</a> support enhance the outlook of a project set to revolutionise the predictive markets space, likely attracting more and more users as all that is deficient with the traditional online betting platforms is essentially removed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Powering Chancer&rsquo;s P2P betting model is its native token $CHANCER. Apart from handing control to the user, $CHANCER opens up the platform to true decentralisation. It also promises to democratise social betting with integration of bet sharing and livestreaming features.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">$CHANCER&rsquo;s blockbuster presale</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto space currently has numerous token presales for projects looking to raise funds from prospective early backers. At any given time, these projects see varying degrees of success, including reaching targeted amounts to support roadmap milestones.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s presale is proving to be one of the success stories already, less than six weeks into the event. After surpassing the $750k mark last week, the amount of $CHANCER sold has topped $835k and is poised to hit the landmark $1 million in record time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The total supply for $CHANCER is 1.5 billion tokens, 65% of which will be available throughout the 12 stage presale phase. Investors can buy tokens using ETH, USDT, BUSD and BNB, the first two buy options recently added in a step that could see more people easily buy $CHANCER.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Buy $CHANCER <a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Will $CHANCER price reach $1 in 2024?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">At present, the Chancer presale price is $0.01 and will jump to $0.011 in the next stage. The token&rsquo;s price at the end of the presale is set to be $0.021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto investors might view these prices as an ideal entry point, particularly for a project that&rsquo;s projected to take a big bite from a market expected to see significant growth all through to 2030.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With interest so high and crypto flying following Ripple&rsquo;s recent victory against the SEC, it&rsquo;s likely the token will sell out faster than anticipated. This even as investors eye a position in what could be the biggest investment opportunity of 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for price, its difficult to pinpoint future performance due to the factors that can be at play during given market scenarios. A confluence of factors could help catapult Chancer price higher, including a raging bull market fueled by approval for first US spot Bitcoin ETF, regulatory clarity and the mainnet launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, while a token launching in a bull market phase &ndash; as $CHANCER is likely when it goes live in Q1, 2024 &ndash; opposite market conditions could hinder the would be price discovery. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Interested in buying $CHANCER? <a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Join the presale</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The AI industry is expected to grow to almost $2 trillion by 2030.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals has raised more than $1.1 million in its second phase of the token sale</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The Artificial Intelligence (AI) market is expected to continue growing in the coming years as demand from individuals and corporations rises. The most recent intelligence <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1365145/artificial-intelligence-market-size/"><u>report</u></a> on the industry showed that the market size stood at $207 billion in 2023 and that it will soar to almost $2 trillion by 2030.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/21/1689916826814-3deb6567-09f0-4aa5-ab13-ad6562e58a88.jpg" style="width: 648px;height: 410.4px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="648" height="410.4"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AI market to grow</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The AI industry will continue growing as demand rises internationally. Analysts believe that AI models will disrupt all industries. For example, Hollywood actors and writers have gone on strike to protest the use of AI models in their work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many news organizations are now implementing AI in their operations. Besides, a well-trained AI model can now do a better job than most individuals. Most importantly, AI models will likely replace many financial analysts. Some quant hedge funds have found a lot of success using these models.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, many companies are now investing heavily in AI. Microsoft spent over $10 billion investing in ChatGPT while Google has launched a similar platform. Apple has also built its own ChatGPT rival and is testing it internally.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, Elon Musk has launched xAI, a company that will build AI tools. And Nvidia, the biggest semiconductor company in the world, is building technologies that will power the AI industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is unclear how the AI industry will affect the world in the future. While some analysts see it leading to job losses, others believe that it will create jobs in the long run.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals token sale continues</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, investors from around the world are still investing in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.altsignals.io/"><u>AltSignals</u></a>. The token sale has now raised over $1.19 million in its second stage. This means that the developers have sold over 53% of their $2.25 million target. Each ASI token is going for 0.01875 USDT and the price will rise by 12.05% in the next stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is a financial services company that is seeking to incorporate artificial intelligence in its processes. The existing product, which is highly accurate and has thousands of customers, will be upgraded with a more advanced AI one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to AltSignals&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/whitepaper.pdf"><u>white paper</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>the developers will use several advanced technologies like natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to come up with predictions. The ecosystem will be powered by the ASI token.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, customers with more ASI tokens will receive more features like ActualizeAI, AltScalpPro, and discounts on all AI products. In the future, they will also be able to vote on key details in the ecosystem. You can buy the AltSignals token&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is it safe to buy ASI?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are three main reasons why AltSignals will be the next big thing in the crypto industry. First, unlike meme coins that don&rsquo;t have a utility, ASI has a real use in that it powers the AltSignals ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Second, AltSignals is in industries that are growing fast: finance and AI. This year, we have seen many AI coins like SingularityNET and Fetch AI jump by more than 500%. Finally, AltSignals is a genuine company with thousands of customers and positive Trustpilot reviews.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Still, you should be cautious when investing in AltSignals and other token presales. One way to mitigate risks is to ensure that you are investing a small portion of your funds in it.</p>

<li>Michael Novogratz puts Bitcoin and Gold in the same bucket.</li>
<li>Wolfe Research strategist reiterated his bullish view on BTC.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is currently up 80% versus the start of the year 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>Owning <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> today is nowhere as scary as it was about six months ago, says Michael Novogratz &ndash; the Chief Executive of Galaxy Digital.</p>
<h2>Novogratz shares his view on Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Interest rates continued to go up this year; FTX collapsed; the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission came down hard on <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/the-sec-strikes-again-first-binance-now-coinbase/">bellwethers</a> of the crypto space.</p>
<p>And yet, Bitcoin has outperformed every other financial asset &ndash; now up 80% year-to-date.</p>
<p>What that establishes beyond doubt, as per Novogratz, is that the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency is here to stay. On CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/20/im-more-comfortable-being-along-bitcoin-today-than-i-was-6-months-ago-galaxy-digital-ceo-novogratz.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squawk Box</a>&rdquo;, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The normalization of 5.0% budget deficit &hellip; is why Bitcoin, gold, silver trade great. I put them all in the same bucket. Bitcoin has got the additional adoption cycle.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Novogratz sees Bitcoin as digital gold</h2>
<p>Novogratz drives his optimism also from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/blackrock-s-bitcoin-etf-application-is-refiled-by-nasdaq-to-sec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> that has recently filed with the regulator for a Spot Bitcoin ETF which could boost institutional interest in the digital asset.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m more comfortable being long Bitcoin today than I was six months ago. I like to think of BTC as digital gold to store value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1d1de06a-a904-4db3-9017-4c061bd6854d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacobi Asset Management</a> is all set to debut its Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund in Europe by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, Wolfe Research strategist Rob Ginsberg reiterated his bullish view on BTC. He agreed, though, that the cryptocurrency has to fight an uphill battle to reclaim its former highs.</p>

<li>The newly launched FedNow Service aims to empower banks and credit unions.</li>
<li>FedNow will allow for the execution of transactions 24/7 365 days a year.</li>
<li>35 banks and credit unions, including the U Bureau of the Fiscal Service of the US Department of the Treasury, are already equipped to handle payments through the FedNow Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>The FedNow&reg; Service, the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s instant payment platform, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230720a.htm?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">went live</a> officially on Thursday morning. The service will allow banks and credit unions of all sizes instantly process the transactions of their clients.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve asserts that FedNow transactions can be carried out every day of the year, around the clock.</p>
<p>To begin with, 35 banks and credit unions and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service of the US Department of the Treasury are among those who are already prepared to handle payments through the FedNow Service. Furthermore, a group of 16 service providers is prepared to support banks and credit unions with payment processing.</p>
<h2>Prudent payments for individuals and companies via FedNow</h2>
<p>Explaining the benefits of the instant payment system, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Federal Reserve built the FedNow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient. Over time, as more banks choose to use this new tool, the benefits to individuals and businesses will include enabling a person to immediately receive a paycheck, or a company to instantly access funds when an invoice is paid.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Jerome Powell, however, clarified that the newly launched system is not attempting to replace fiat money. He said that FedNow is &ldquo;not related to a digital currency.&rdquo; He added that &ldquo;it is like other Federal Reserve payment services, such as Fedwire and FedACH. The FedNow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.&rdquo;</p>

<li dir="ltr">Binance Labs&rsquo; strategic investment in Radiant Capital will help the DeFi protocol expands its product to more EVM chains.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The price of Radiant&rsquo;s native token RDNT rose 10% following the news.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Labs, the venture capital arm of world&rsquo;s leading crypto exchange <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/"><u>Binance</u></a>, has invested $10 million in decentralised crypto lender Radiant Capital (RDNT).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Radiant&rsquo;s lending and borrowing protocol is built on top of LayerZero, one of Binance Labs&rsquo; portfolio companies.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Radiant to use funds to expand its DeFi product</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-%2410-million-in-radiant-to-support--its-mission-to-lead-the-next-era-of-defi-lending-1438479277678345894" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announcement</u></a> from Binance, the strategic funding round continues Binance Labs&rsquo; commitment towards crypto innovation, including in supporting next-generation chain-agnostic DeFi projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Radiant brings this goal to the market by taking on the fragmented liquidity that beleaguers the DeFi ecosystem. The platform promotes this by allowing users to tap into a bridging innovation to borrow and lend across any chain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Binance Labs actively seeks out promising DeFi projects that not only advance the industry but also push the boundaries of innovation. Radiant Capital&rsquo;s commitment to facilitating seamless cross-chain transactions for DeFi, and performance on Arbitrum and BNB Chain demonstrates its potential for driving mass adoption</em>,&rdquo; Binance co-founder and head of Binance Labs Yi He said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-report-shows-crypto-industry-in-good-health-in-h1-2023/"><u>reported</u></a> today, Binance has released a mid-year report for the crypto industry in which the exchange highlights growth in the past six months. One of the areas to see significant growth is DeFi.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Radiant team says the funding comes at a crucial time as the platform looks to expand its product to more EVM chains. This will add to the traction seen on Arbitrum and BNB Chain, with the protocol looking to become of the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-defi-projects/"><u>best DeFi platforms</u></a> in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Growth is expected to include expansion of oracle support, collateral, cross liquidations and abstract repayments. Also crucial in the product development is deployment on Ethereum mainnet and full integration with LayerZero&rsquo;s messaging support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Radiant believes the developments will see the next 100 million users come into and benefit from DeFi. Commenting on this milestone, Radiant Capital founder George Macallan said that the partnership with Binance Labs allows his platform to benefit from Binance&rsquo;s &ldquo;extensive expertise, resources, and strategic support.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Their investment will play a crucial role in propelling Radiant to new heights as the protocol expands to new chains, continues to scale, and drives utility back into the ecosystem</em>,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Radiant&rsquo;s native token RDNT reacted positively to the news, with its value jumping 10% to near $0.32.</p>

<li>After the July 19 circular, it is illegal to engage in any cryptocurrency activities in Kuwait.</li>
<li>Kuwait has joined Thailand, Indonesia, and Turkey to ban crypto activities.</li>
<li>Violators are to face penalties as stipulated in Kuwait&rsquo;s AML and terrorist financing laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kuwait&rsquo;s financial watchdog, the Central Markets Authority (CMA), issued a circular on July 19 declaring that all cryptocurrency activities including <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/invest/">crypto investment</a>, crypto payments, and crypto mining as described <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/mine/">here</a> were illegal in the Middle Eastern country.</p>
<p>The CMA also banned local regulators from granting licences to anyone attempting to &ldquo;provide cryptocurrency services as a commercial business.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Tough penalties for violators</h2>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws carry harsh punishments, the financial regulator warned. The circular made it clear that &ldquo;securities regulated by the Central Bank of Kuwait and other securities and financial instruments regulated by the Capital Markets Authority&rdquo; are exempt from the prohibitions.</p>
<p>In addition to forbidding cryptocurrency-related activities within the nation, the Kuwaiti regulator informed clients of the dangers posed by cryptocurrencies. &ldquo;They do not carry a legal status and are not issued or supported,&rdquo; it declared.</p>
<p>Kuwait has joined the list of nations like Thailand, Indonesia, and Turkey that forbid accepting cryptocurrency payments.</p>
<p>Kuwait&rsquo;s move to ban cryptocurrencies comes after the National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism concluded its study that aimed at implementing Recommendation 15 of the International Requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). However, it is essential to note that the FATF does not mandate that nations outlaw cryptocurrency.</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">FCA&rsquo;s digital sandbox is set to launch on August 1st.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The sandbox will serve as a testing environment for firms before rolling out their products.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">UK&rsquo;s financial regulator launches a digital sandbox</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/launch-permanent-digital-sandbox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> on Thursday, July 20th, that it will launch a digital sandbox.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The regulator said the permanent digital sandbox will be made available on August 1st, 2023, opening up the platform to an even broader range of innovative businesses, start-ups and data providers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The platform will serve as a testing environment for firms to see how their products would perform at an early stage of development.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> comes nearly three years after the regulator launched the sandbox on a trial basis. The FCA said the sandbox would also be available to data providers and would offer firms access to data sets, application program interfaces (API) and data security protection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCA said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Until now, the platform has only been available temporarily to those participating in pilots and TechSprints.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The Digital Sandbox works to foster innovation and growth &ndash; more than half of the previous Small to Medium Enterprise participants in the pilots and TechSprints made positive developments, including launching new products, securing funding and partnerships, or receiving industry awards or recognitions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The digital sandbox provides data security protection</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The regulatory agency pointed out that its digital sandbox has numerous features that would benefit developers. The sandbox&rsquo;s integrated development environment allows experimentation while safeguarding the data assets on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, developers would have access to over 200 synthetic, public or anonymised data sets and over 1000 APIs to enable testing and validation of technology solutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The observation deck feature allows interested parties such as regulators, incumbents and others&#8239;to observe in-flight testing at a technical level.&#8239;Finally, the FCA believes that the sandbox could promote diversity of thought, share learnings and foster an ecosystem between teams, observers and mentors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former Economic Secretary John Glen rolled out the plans for the sandbox in 2022 with the aim of making the UK a cryptocurrency innovation hub. Previously, the sandbox was available only during pilots and TechSprints, which brought people from the financial industry together to address industry challenges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The crypto industry experienced growth across Bitcoin and other L1s, L2s, stablecoins, DeFi, and NFTs.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin network growth included trading volume, transaction count, fees and hashrate.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Solana, BNB Chain led L1s, while Liquid staking emerged as a key DeFi component.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> has released a report covering the first half of 2023, with details suggesting that the overall global crypto industry showed remarkable resilience following the crypto winter.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto growth in H1, 2023</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Published on July 20, the<a href="https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/half-year-2023" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>120-page report</u></a> highlights growth metrics across key industry verticals, including <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, stablecoins, DeFi, and NFTs. The H1, 2023 report also details developments within the gaming and metaverse, as well as institutional adoption and funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For instance, DeFi has seen a 43% year-to-date increase, while NFT volume &ndash; despite diminishing floor prices, rose compared to the second half of 2022. &nbsp;In fundraising, the report highlights that the top 10 funds raised $3.6 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">USDT, the leading stablecoin by market cap increased its market share by 26% even as the global stablecoin market dipped 7%. USDD, crvUSD, GHO and LUSD all saw significant increases. The report also details key pilot cases for CBDCs and tokenization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also trending in H1 and today is the liquid staking and LSDfi, with the new subsector of LSDfi experiencing a 460% jump in total value locked between April and end of June.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s continued network growth</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to Binance, the state of crypto in terms of adoption, usage, and innovation as observed in the first six months of the year portends an even better half of the year and into 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the indicators of a better H1 for crypto in 2023 is Bitcoin&rsquo;s network growth. Binance says this was evident through metrics such as the 185% year-to-date jump in trading volume and 58% spike in transactions count. Also significant during the period was the 143% increase in average transaction fees, 40% YTD hashrate increase and 43% jump in mining difficulty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal recently reported, Bitcoin&rsquo;s network growth was partially fueled by the surge in Ordinals. [Read more<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-and-ethereum-network-revenues-spiked-in-may-despite-significant-headwinds-etc-group-report/">&nbsp;<u>here</u></a> and<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/why-are-bitcoin-transaction-fees-rising-and-what-are-brc-20-tokens/">&nbsp;<u>here</u></a>].</p>
<p dir="ltr">In terms of market performance, Bitcoin dominance peaked to levels last seen in April 2021. Meanwhile, the flagship cryptocurrency&rsquo;s correlation with TradFi fell to a three-year low.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Solana, BNB and other Layer-1s</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Growth was also witnessed across leading layer-1 chains, with Solana outpacing other L1s in relation to the increase of its market capitalization. Binance&rsquo;s BNB Chain topped others in terms of best network performance YTD overall, with daily transactions increasing 113% compared to 48% for Ethereum. BNB Chain active addresses increased by 118%, compared to Ethereum&rsquo;s 63%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also notable during the first six months of 2023 was the growth of subnets on Avalanche and shared security models by Cosmos.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The last few weeks have seen a bullish flip in crypto sentiment, particularly with the filing of a spot Bitcoin ETF by $9 trillion asset manager BlackRock. Ripple&rsquo;s landmark win against the SEC last week is also a key factor driving market confidence today. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance notes the &ldquo;Bitcoin ETF season&rdquo; could continue to bolster momentum even as the second half of the year sees greater adoption and innovation</p>

<p dir="ltr">Chainlink crypto price surged to the highest level since April.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Whales have started accumulating the coin after the CCIP launch.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Open interest in the futures market has jumped to 2021 highs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/chainlink"><u>Chainlink</u></a> price went parabolic on Thursday as investors cheered the recent product news and purchases by whales. LINK token soared to a high of $8.20, the highest level since April 20th this year. It has jumped by more than 65% from the lowest level in June.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">LINK whales are buying</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chainlink price is surging for two main reasons. First, the developers unveiled plans to introduce a new Cross-Chain Interoperable Protocol (CCIP), as I wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/chainlink-price-prediction-link-just-formed-a-double-top-pattern/"><u>here</u></a>. This is an important upgrade in the network that seeks to join traditional finance companies to the blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CCIP will expand Chainlink&rsquo;s use case by making it possible for companies like banks and insurance firms to join the blockchain. The announcement came a &nbsp;month after Chainlink announced that it was running a trial of linking banks to the blockchain through its partnership with Swift.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Second, there are signs that whales have started buying the coin. Data shows that two whales acquired 788,877 LINK tokens this week. They bought these tokens by swapping their stETH and ETH tokens for LINK. Historically, accumulation by whales is usually one of the best buy signals in the market.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chainlink open interest is rising</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, data by Coinglass shows that open interest in the futures market jumped to the highest level since November. Open interest is an important metric in the futures market that denotes the number of futures contracts held by market participants. A higher figure is usually a bullish sign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chainlink&rsquo;s open interest has jumped to more than $267 million, with most of them being from Binance. The other leading exchanges are Bybit, OKX, and Bitget among others.</p>
