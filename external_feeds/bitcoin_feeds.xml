His recommendations followed a series of enforcement actions by the securities watchdog, which included charging the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase.</strong></p>
<h2>Mark Cuban&#8217;s Suggestions for SEC&#8217;s Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has engaged in a lengthy discussion on Twitter about how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could regulate the crypto sector. The discussion followed a series of enforcement actions taken by the SEC against a number of prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, including  and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a>.</p>
<p>Citing how the securities watchdog went after the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase for securities law violations as an example, the billionaire described in a tweet Saturday that the current non-crypto-specific registration process offered by the SEC &#8220;doesn&#8217;t deal with how the token will be traded after the fact.” He suggested:</p>
<blockquote><p>By doing a crypto-specific registration process, the transparency for the enterprise could increase dramatically. They could eliminate anonymity. Require disclosure on how wallets are secured and maintained. What the wallet addresses are. How and where the token will be traded. Etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase and several other crypto firms have insisted that they tried to register with the SEC but were unable to. &#8220;There is no path to ‘come in and register’ — we tried, repeatedly,&#8221; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ceo-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-accusing-crypto-exchange-of-securities-law-violations/">stated</a> after the SEC filed charges against his crypto trading platform.</p>
<p>Cuban also responded to a tweet by lawyer John E. Deaton, who described Saturday: &#8220;If you read the Hinman speech still on the SEC website, it states &#8216;strictly speaking, the token — or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called — all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not.&#8217; Jay Clayton wrote a letter to Ted Budd in 2019 publicly agreeing with Hinman that the investment contract does not &#8216;strictly inhere to the asset&#8217; and it&#8217;s only about how the asset is packaged and offered.&#8221; However, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said on multiple occasions that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, other than bitcoin, are securities.</p>
<h2>Regulating Multi-Function Crypto Tokens</h2>
<p>The Dallas Mavericks owner tweeted on Sunday in reply to Deaton: &#8220;I think the other common element of all the assets mentioned in Howey is that they are single function. There has never been a test of the multi-function utility of a token. When an asset is multi-function, it&#8217;s impossible to determine the intent of the owner, buyer, or seller, which is why the SEC needs to offer a registration process that is specific to crypto tokens and future multi-function digital assets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cuban added: &#8220;Thinking more of the need for a different form of registration for multi-function tokens by the SEC, there is a legal precedent. Look at content. There are trademark, copyright, clearance permissions, music licensing for live, music licensing for on-demand or for sale, video licensing rules, public domain, and more. All content is now digital. All will remain digital.” The Shark Tank star opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we can have a legal framework for digital content that encompasses different media types, the SEC can do the same for token registration for different types of tokens.</p></blockquote>

The platform offers the trading of four cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>
<h2>EDX Crypto Exchange Launches</h2>
<p>EDX Markets announced Tuesday &#x201C;the successful launch of its digital asset market and the completion of an investment round with new equity partners.&#x201D; According to the announcement and the new exchange&#x2019;s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Products traded on EDX include bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>), and bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p>EDX offers &#x201C;a unique, non-custodial model designed to mitigate conflicts of interest,&#x201D; the announcement adds. In addition, the platform has &#x201C;introduced a retail-only quote to the crypto markets, allowing participants the benefit of better pricing for retail-originated orders&#x201D; and plans to launch EDX Clearing later this year &#x201C;to settle trades matched on EDX Markets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The company also recently closed a funding round with the participation of new strategic investors, including Miami International Holdings, DV Crypto, GTS, GSR Markets Ltd., and HRT Technology. The firm&#x2019;s founding investors include Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital, and Virtu Financial. Bitcoin.com News first reported Schwab, Citadel, and Fidelity <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/citadel-charles-schwab-fidelity-join-forces-to-build-cryptocurrency-trading-platform/">planning</a> to launch a cryptocurrency trading platform in June last year.</p>

<p>EDX Markets launched at a time when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on unregistered cryptocurrency trading platforms and securities tokens. The securities regulator has charged the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a> with several securities law violations. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has also stated that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, other than bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), are securities.</p>
<p>Supporters of EDX Markets are not the only ones remaining bullish about the U.S. crypto industry despite regulatory uncertainty. Blackrock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, filed to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">launch</a> a bitcoin trust with the SEC last week. This move is widely regarded as an application for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which the SEC has so far rejected all applications for.</p>

The move comes as the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange takes steps to focus on fewer European markets amid increased scrutiny from regulators and ahead of Europe’s new crypto rules. </strong></p>
<h2>Binance No Longer Authorized to Provide Regulated Activities and Products in the U.K., FCA Says</h2>
<p>Binance’s subsidiary in Britain, Binance Markets Limited (BML), has recently filed a cancellation request for its regulatory authorization. On June 7, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the request was completed on May 30, 2023.</p>
<p>According the FCA’s Financial Services Register, the entity, which was previously authorized by the regulator, “can no longer provide regulated activities and products.” In an <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-warning-binance-markets-limited-and-binance-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> on its interactions with the company, the Authority stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the completion of the cancellation of permissions the firm is no longer authorized by the FCA.</p></blockquote>
<p>No other entity in the Binance Group, except Binance Markets Limited, holds any form of authorization or registration to conduct regulated business in the United Kingdom, according to the exchange’s listing on the FCA website.</p>
<p>Even before the cancellation, BML was not operating in the U.K. as on June 25, 2021 the FCA imposed certain requirements which prohibited the company from carrying out any regulated activities without its prior written consent.</p>
<p>At the same time, “the Binance Group appear to be offering U.K. customers a range of products and services via a website, Binance.com,” the Authority remarked in its <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/supervisory-notices/first-supervisory-notice-binance-markets-limited.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supervisory notice</a> two years ago. It has since warned Brits against trading on the exchange.</p>

<h2>Binance’s U.K. Move Coincides With Exit From the Netherlands, Cyprus</h2>
<p>The news of the cancelled license comes when the world’s largest crypto exchange finds itself under increased scrutiny by regulatory bodies in various jurisdictions. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">sued</a> the entities operating its American subsidiary for violating securities laws. Binance US recently avoided the freezing of its assets thanks to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-cz-agree-to-repatriate-us-customer-assets-sec-secures-court-order/">deal</a> with the SEC.</p>
<p>In Europe, Binance has been taking steps to reduce its footprint in terms of maintaining a number of subsidiaries seeking regulated status in multiple jurisdictions, ahead of the implementation of the European Union’s newly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-parliament-greenlights-markets-in-crypto-assets-law-tracing-rules/">adopted</a> Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation. The exchange said it intends to focus on some regulated units in EU countries such those in France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>Last week,  announced it’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">exiting</a> the Dutch market as it has been unable to register as a crypto service provider. It had been fined by the central bank of the Netherlands for operating without registration. Earlier, Binance’s entity in Cyprus applied to be removed from the country’s register of digital asset service providers.</p>

Moreover, the number of individual buyers purchasing NFTs in the past seven days has jumped 95.20%, reaching a total of 664,096 buyers.</strong></p>
<h2>This Week&#x2019;s NFT Sales See a Modest Rise of More Than 11%, Bitcoin-NFTs Still Hold Second Position</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">data</a> from cryptoslam.io on June 20, 2023, the past week has seen a modest increase in NFT sales, with a recorded total of just over $146 million. This marks an approximate rise of 11.60% compared to the previous seven days.</p>
<p>Despite a slight dip of 1.99% in the number of NFT transactions, which amounted to 2,271,293 last week, there has been a surge of over 95% in the number of NFT buyers. Statistics show approximately 664,096 buyers have been recorded in the past seven days.</p>

<p>Out of the total NFT sales amounting to $146 million, a significant portion of $85.43 million was attributed to ETH-based NFTs, while $21.38 million came from BTC-centric NFTs. It is worth noting that Bitcoin-based NFTs have consistently maintained their second position among blockchains in terms of sales for several consecutive weeks.</p>

<p>Notably, ETH-based NFT sales experienced a spike of 18.11% within a week, whereas BTC-based NFT sales saw a jump of 10.84% compared to the previous week. Rounding out the top five blockchains for weekly NFT sales, we have Solana, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain, and Mythos following behind <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>This week, the leading position for NFT sales belongs to the collection called <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/uncategorized-ordinals">Uncategorized ordinals</a>, which amassed $12.18 million in sales. Following closely behind is the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/the-grails-ii">Grails II</a> collection sold by the luxury auction house <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sothebys-to-auction-3acs-nft-collection-including-larva-labs-zombie-punk-and-dmitri-cherniaks-golden-goose/">Sotheby&#x2019;s</a>, which generated approximately $7.67 million in sales.</p>

<p>Completing the roster of the top five collections include the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/bored-ape-yacht-club">Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)</a>, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/dmarket">Dmarket</a>, and <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/gods-unchained-cards">Gods Unchained</a> NFT card sales. <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/mutant-ape-yacht-club">Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/azuki">Azuki</a> are right on the heels of the top five contenders.</p>
<p>Additionally, among the five most expensive NFT sales this week, two noteworthy NFTs from Sotheby&#x2019;s Grails II collection secured spots on the list, with the top sale reaching $5.4 million. Additionally, two NFTs originated from the Uncategorized ordinals collection, while one NFT <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/lbt-56/mint/8">emerged</a> from the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> chain.</p>

The British-American ex-kickboxer, who gained a significant online presence, was charged with grave offenses of human trafficking and rape on December 29, 2022. Despite the charges, Tate vehemently denies all accusations leveled against him and his associates.</strong></p>
<h2>Luxury Cars, Watches, and Bitcoin: Prosecutors Target Andrew Tate&#x2019;s Assets in Ongoing Legal Battle</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.diicot.ro/mass-media/4082-comunicat-de-presa-2-20-06-2023">press release</a> issued by Romania&#x2019;s Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism on June 20, 2023, Andrew Tate, along with three co-defendants, has officially been indicted.</p>
<p>Tate, a polarizing personality recognized as a former world kickboxing champion, garnered attention as a prominent social media influencer on platforms like Twitter and Tiktok.</p>
<p>His involvement in a high-profile case emerged in December 2022 when he was apprehended as a suspect in a complex legal matter involving human trafficking and rape. The charges against him also encompassed the accusation of leading an organized crime group.</p>
<p>On April 3, 2023, Andrew Tate and his cohorts were released from incarceration and placed under house arrest. Presently, Romanian prosecutors have formally levied charges against Tate, accusing him of &#x201C;committing the crimes of constituting an organized criminal group, [and] human trafficking.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the allegations, Tate and his associates are purported to have deceitfully lured women into the sex trade, operating not only within Romania but also extending their activities to other nations.</p>
<p>The prosecutors are seeking the court&#x2019;s authorization to confiscate Andrew Tate&#x2019;s stash of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, estimated to be approximately 21.080 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, valued at just over $563,000 based on current exchange rates.</p>

<p>In addition to the crypto assets, law enforcement aims to seize a considerable number of luxury automobiles and watches, four of Tate&#x2019;s operating companies, and multiple caches of cash consisting of U.S. dollars, European euros, and British pounds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prosecutors requested that Tate and his enterprise contribute upfront to cover some of the legal expenses. As part of the ongoing legal proceedings within the Bucharest court, prosecutors strongly advised that Tate and his associates remain under house arrest.</p>

CME&#8217;s Fedwatch tool indicated on Tuesday that market predictions imply a 25bps increase during the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting set for July 25 and 26.</strong></p>
<h2>Federal Reserve Pauses, but 2 Rate Hikes Loom, 76.9% Probability of a 25bps Increase in July</h2>
<p>Consequent to ten uninterrupted rate hikes since March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">halt in June</a> but acknowledged that additional increases were anticipated in 2023. Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that &#8220;nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year.&#8221; Currently, the federal funds rate is at a 16-year peak, and although there was no rise in June, the impact of the previous ten is evident among market participants.</p>

<p>Inflation in the U.S. has decelerated for 11 consecutive months but remains <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-inflation-cools-to-4-annual-rate-setting-stage-for-feds-decision-on-interest-rates/">elevated at 4%</a>, while the interest rate for a 30-year mortgage ranges between <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates/">6.99% and 7.14%</a>. The countrywide average for a 30-year loan term is 7.08%. This implies that for every $100,000 borrowed, debtors must pay $660 to $685 monthly in interest. With the federal funds rate at 5% to 5.25%, an extra two rate hikes totaling 50bps would likely push lending rates higher, making credit in the U.S. considerably tighter.</p>
<p>During the last FOMC meeting&#8217;s press conference, Powell mentioned that Fed board members did not reach a consensus on July. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t make a decision about July,&#8221; Powell <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20230614.pdf">informed</a> reporters last Wednesday. &#8220;I do expect that it will be a live meeting. It may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace, but we have made no decision about a hike or pause at the July meeting.”</p>

<p>Despite earlier forecasts of a shift, most market analysts do not foresee a rate reduction this year. Asawari Sathe, Vanguard&#8217;s senior economist, expresses skepticism that the federal funds rate will be lowered in 2023. “We believe inflation will continue to moderate but remain above 3% through year-end, and unemployment will trend higher to a still reasonable 4.5%,” the Vanguard economist <a href="https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/whythefedwillnotcutratesthisyear">penned</a>. Vanguard&#8217;s machine learning prediction tool also anticipates that the Fed will not reduce rates until the following year. Sathe stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vanguard&#8217;s model anticipates that the Fed won&#8217;t be in a position to cut rates until the middle of 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday, CME&#8217;s Fedwatch presented a <a href="https://archive.ph/3o5gI#selection-2527.0-2527.5">76.9% probability</a> of the Fed raising the rate by 25bps at the July FOMC meeting. Approximately 23.1% expect no alteration to transpire in July and that the rate will stay unchanged at 5% to 5.25%. Should the 5.6% threshold be attained within this year, it will surpass the Federal Reserve&#8217;s previous March prediction by a notable 50bps.</p>

<p>However, by the conclusion of May, numerous economists started asserting that the central bank would undergo a significant shift in its approach. “Chair Powell right now does not want to talk about (reducing rates),” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/05/19/fed-says-wont-lower-rates-recession/70230496007/#:~:text=Fed%20says%20it%27s%20unlikely%20to,Markets%20don%27t%20buy%20it&amp;text=If%20the%20U.S.%20economy%20slips,love%20instead%20of%20a%20lifeline.">conveyed</a> Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, to his clients just last month. The Pantheon executive added:</p>
<blockquote><p>But that will change; the Fed will do what the data tell them to do, and the data are heading south.</p></blockquote>

A Deutsche Bank executive explained that the digital asset move is part of the giant lender&#8217;s broader strategy to boost fee income. </strong></p>
<h2>Deutsche Bank Applies for Digital Asset License</h2>
<p>Germany’s largest bank by total assets, Deutsche Bank AG, has submitted an application to the country’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) seeking regulatory approval to offer custody services for digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>“We’re building out our digital assets and custody business,” David Lynne, head of Deutsche Bank&#8217;s commercial banking unit, said at a conference Tuesday. The executive added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We just put our application into the Bafin for the digital asset license.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lynne further shared that the move is part of the giant lender’s wider strategy aimed at boosting fee income within Deutsche Bank&#8217;s corporate bank. Additionally, it reflects similar efforts by Deutsche Bank&#8217;s asset management arm, DWS Group, to enhance revenue through digital asset-related offerings, the publication conveyed.</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank&#8217;s corporate bank division initially indicated a plan to offer digital asset custody in late 2020 without providing a specific timeline for the service&#8217;s launch. At that time, the division was under the leadership of Stefan Hoops, who later joined DWS as CEO, and Lynne took over the division a year ago.</p>
<p>In Germany, Bafin is responsible for issuing licenses to entities wanting to offer crypto services in the country. The new Germany Money Laundering Act, which went into effect at the beginning of 2020, allows financial institutions to offer crypto products to their customers alongside traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. At the time, Bafin reportedly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/banks-germany-crypto/">received</a> more than 40 &#8220;expressions of interest&#8221; from banks for approval to operate a crypto custody business in the future.</p>

Bullish sentiment continues to make a gradual return, following recent market weakness. Ethereum remained over the $1,700 level during today&#x2019;s session.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin rose to a two-week high on Tuesday, as bullish sentiment made a gradual return to the marketplace.</p>
<p>Following a low of $26,338.54 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday high of $27,147.47 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As a result of the surge in price, bitcoin rose to its strongest point since June 7, when it peaked at $27,402.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that today&#x2019;s rally coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) also breaking out of a ceiling of its own at the 50.00 mark.</p>
<p>Price strength now stands at 51.71 at the time of writing, with the next visible resistance level at 57.00.</p>
<p>In the event bulls are able to send the index to this point, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will be above $27,500.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was marginally in the green in today&#x2019;s session, with price hovering close to a recent support point.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit an intraday peak of $1,748.64 earlier in the day, before retreating to a low less than 24 hours after climbing from a floor at $1,705.81.</p>
<p>Since this earlier high, ethereum has slipped back to a support point at $1,725, a point where it has consolidated for the past four days.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this retreat occurred as the RSI ran into a ceiling of its own at the 44.00 mark.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index now sits at the 42.21 mark, and appears to be heading to a lower floor at 40.00.</p>
<p>Should strength fall below that mark, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will drop below $1,700 in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Binance Disassociates Itself From Banned Nigerian Entity</h2>
<p>The CEO of Binance, Changpeng (CZ) Zhao, recently said his firm had issued a &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; notice against Binance Nigeria Limited, the supposed affiliate of the crypto exchange platform. In a June 18 <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1670369403223900160">tweet</a>, CZ also told his followers not to believe everything they read in the news. However, the tweet did not explain how Binance is going to enforce the order against the &#8220;scammer entity.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Binance have issued cease &amp; desist notice to the scammer entity &quot;Binance Nigeria Limited&quot;.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t believe everything you read in the news. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1670369403223900160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Binance chief’s clarification about the crypto exchange’s relationship with the Nigerian entity came just over a week after the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (NSEC) declared Binance Nigeria Limited’s operations in the country illegal. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-regulator-labels-binance-affiliates-local-operations-illegal/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the Nigerian regulator also told Binance Nigeria Limited to &#8220;stop soliciting Nigerian investors in any form whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the NSEC’s declaration and warning to the Nigerian public, a spokesperson for Binance was quoted in a report distancing the leading crypto exchange from the Nigerian entity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the same <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/sec-shut-binance-down-in-nigeria-but-it-was-wrong-binance/">report</a>, an individual known as Ahassan Ifzal Mughal is quoted confirming Binance Nigeria Limited’s non-affiliation with Binance. According to the report, Mughal had registered Binance Nigeria Limited with the hope of eventually selling the incorporated entity to CZ’s Binance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are willing to hand over full control of Binance Nigeria Limited to binance.com should they choose to legally enter into the Nigerian market, and are further available to provide our legal services to them in obtaining legal regulatory compliance in Nigeria,&#8221; Mughal reportedly said.</p>
<p>While some have questioned CZ’s belated move to disown the &#8220;scammer entity,&#8221; a Nigeria crypto industry insider told Bitcoin.com News that it is possible that Binance was not aware that the now-banned entity had been using its name. To support this assertion, the insider pointed to 6 Nigerian organizations on the Corporate Affairs Commission portal which use the name Binance.</p>
<p>Senator Ihenyen, the lead partner at Infusion Lawyers, said while Binance&#8217;s move may seem surprising to some, the illegal use of well-known brands or trademarks is &#8220;a menace genuine companies or brand owners face across the world, including Nigeria.&#8221; Ihenyen stated that his firm has handled many cases wherein this practice which is known as cybersquatting has been perpetrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the Lead Partner of a law firm in the African market, we have handled similar matters involving cybersquatting in and outside the blockchain space. Here, an entity&#8217;s name, domain name, trademark, etc. is registered without due authorization in the hope of reselling them for profit. So &#8220;Binance Nigeria Limited&#8221; may just be one of many instances of this menace. This is Cybersquatting.,&#8221; Ihenyen explained.</p>
<p>The lawyer also stated that while this practice is illegal in Nigeria, many still see it as a legitimate practice.</p>

<p><strong>The Changing Landscape of Investor Portfolios</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, investor portfolios consisted of a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. However, as technological advancements and new asset classes emerge, the need to adapt and diversify becomes increasingly vital. Leading portfolio experts, have recognized the potential benefits of including cryptocurrencies in investment portfolios. This acknowledgment reflects the shifting mindset among investors, as they seek to harness the advantages offered by this innovative asset class.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Significance of Cryptocurrencies</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have gained significant traction and mainstream recognition in recent years. These digital assets operate on blockchain technology, offering decentralized and secure transactions. The potential for high returns and the ability to hedge against traditional market risks have made cryptocurrencies an appealing investment option.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Diversification with Cryptocurrencies</strong></p>
<p>Diversification is a cornerstone of sound investment strategy, aiming to reduce risk and maximize returns. Many leading portfolio experts advocate for including cryptocurrencies in portfolios to achieve optimal diversification. By adding cryptocurrencies to a mix of traditional assets, such as stocks and bonds, investors can access an asset class with low correlation to the broader market. This low correlation provides a potential hedge against market volatility and can help smooth out the overall performance of the portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Capturing the Growth Potential</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have demonstrated remarkable growth potential, with substantial returns generated over the past decade. While this market is known for its volatility, the potential rewards can be significant for those who embrace it wisely. Leading portfolio experts recognize this growth potential and recommend allocating a portion of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies as a means to capture these opportunities. By doing so, investors position themselves to benefit from the innovative technologies and disruptive potential of blockchain-based assets.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigating Risk with a Balanced Approach</strong></p>
<p>While cryptocurrencies offer exciting growth prospects, it’s important to approach their inclusion in a portfolio with a balanced perspective. An allocation between 5% and 20% to cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to participate in the potential upside while still maintaining a diversified portfolio. This balanced approach helps mitigate the risks associated with the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p><strong>Staying Informed and Educated</strong></p>
<p>Investing in cryptocurrencies requires a solid understanding of the market dynamics and associated risks. Leading portfolio experts emphasize the importance of staying informed and educated about this evolving asset class. By conducting thorough research, engaging with reputable sources, and consulting with financial advisors, investors can make informed decisions and navigate the cryptocurrency market with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Finance: Embracing Digital Transformation</strong></p>
<p>The inclusion of cryptocurrencies in investment portfolios goes beyond mere diversification. It reflects a broader trend of embracing digital transformation in the financial industry. As blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies continue to mature, they have the potential to disrupt various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and more. By allocating a portion of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies, you position yourself at the forefront of this digital revolution, embracing the future of finance and capitalizing on the transformative power of innovative technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Thesis &#8211; the case for traditional and alternative</strong></p>
<p>We believe that adding this new alternative investment to a well-diversified traditional portfolio when actively managed will improve the benefits of diversification at any level because a portfolio with alternative assets tends to have a lower risk for a given level of return than the benchmark portfolio consisting solely of mega-cap stocks and bonds. A portfolio with low-correlated assets is an efficient way to hedge against market volatility and provides a higher return in the short and long term.</p>
<p>Diversification plays an indispensable role in a portfolio’s construction. It helps investors allocate capital in a way that is limiting the exposure to a single asset’s risk, unsystematic risk. The rationale behind this risk management strategy is that a well-diversified portfolio consisting of low-correlated multifarious assets will generate a long-term higher return with mitigating unsystematic risk. In general, low-correlated assets in a portfolio are an efficient way to hedge against market volatility and provides a higher return in the long term.</p>
<p><strong>The case for crypto and blockchain strategies</strong></p>
<p>Schopenhauer defines the three stages of any revolution as Ridiculous, Frightening and then Obvious. The nascent crypto and blockchain ecosystem is in its Spring, burgeoning at a brisk pace, and now exhibits characteristics of all three stages. We expect disruption in most industries, with a revolution for those dealing in transfer, storage, and accretion of value. A multi-trillion-dollar ecosystem will likely be built with cryptocurrencies and on the blockchain. Growth and system inefficiencies abound and can be harvested via many high yielding strategies. Better yet, these returns show manageable cross-correlations and negligible correlations with traditional assets, allowing the creation of portfolios with superior risk/return characteristics. Yes, the blockchain ecosystem is young, volatile, and contains specific threats. Nevertheless, this blockchain ecosystem holds fantastic potential for the long view investor. The Rollman Mining strategies seek to capture these returns in the most conservative way by making this revolution of passive income available to everyone.</p>
