<ul><li>BlockFi has filed objections to repayment sought by fellow bankrupt firms FTX and 3AC.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt crypto lender has claimed that its clients and creditors are FTX’s ultimate victims.&nbsp;</li><li>As per the lender’s estimates, the legal battles with FTX and 3AC could cost its customers $1 billion.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>BlockFi has stated that it is ready to stop attempts by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-users-175-million-genesis-settlement/">FTX</a> and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) to claw back billions of dollars in an attempt to repay their own stranded creditors. The defunct crypto lender has argued that its bankruptcy was the result of the fraud perpetrated by fellow bankrupt crypto firms. </p>



<h2><strong>BlockFi: Litigation With FTX &amp; 3AC Could Cost $1 Billion</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MjQ2MzI3OA==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, BlockFi claims that its clients and creditors are the “ultimate victims” of FTX’s fraud. The bankrupt crypto lender added that FTX’s attempts to recover claims worth $5 billion from its bankruptcy estate would do injustice to its creditors. </p>



<p>BlockFi pointed out that it was a victim of FTX and urged the bankruptcy court to reject the bankrupt crypto exchange’s claims under the doctrine of unclean hands. FTX previously stated that it would actively pursue the amount repaid to crypto lender before it collapsed in November last year. </p>



<p>The $5 billion in question refers to the amount lent to FTX, which it allegedly misappropriated. FTX attempted to remedy the situation by paying $400 million to BlockFi in June 2022, apart from acquiring equity in the troubled crypto lender via a loan agreement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Just because FTX’s fraudulent actions caused FTX’s bet to fail does not mean BlockFi’s creditors are now somehow liable to refund the purchase price.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Similarly, the bankrupt crypto lender argued that Three Arrows Capital was not entitled to repayment, claiming that the crypto hedge fund used fraud to borrow the funds in question. 3AC previously took out loans from the crypto lender in June last year, which were subsequently defaulted. This prompted the foreclosure on the collateral, leading to what 3AC’s liquidators described as a $220 million “preferential payment to BlockFi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BlockFi also informed the bankruptcy court that litigation with FTX and 3AC would reduce the payout to its stranded customers by as much as $1 billion. The bankrupt lender owes between $1 billion and $10 billion to its creditors.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A former OpenSea executive has been sentenced to three months in prison for insider trading.&nbsp;</li><li>The executive, Nathaniel Chastain, reportedly made over $50,000 in 2021 from his NFT insider trading scheme.&nbsp;</li><li>Chastain pled not guilty last year, claiming that no one told him he couldn&#8217;t use the insider information.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A former OpenSea executive has been sentenced to three months in prison for perpetrating the first-ever insider trading scheme involving NFTs. Nathaniel Chastain, who worked as the Head of Product for the NFT marketplace, was found guilty of fraud and money laundering by a federal grand jury earlier this year. The former executive was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ex-opensea-exec-guilty-insider-trading/">convicted</a> less than two weeks after his trial began in April this year. </p>



<h2><strong>3 Years Supervised Release For Ex-OpenSea Executive After Jail</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-sentenced-prison-first-ever-digital-asset-insider" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, Nathaniel Chastain’s three-month-long prison term will be followed by another three months of home confinement. The former OpenSea executive will then face three years of supervised release. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Today’s sentence should serve as a warning to other corporate insiders that insider trading – in any marketplace – will not be tolerated.”</p><cite>Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney SDNY</cite></blockquote>



<p>Federal prosecutors sought a two-year sentence for Chastain, citing a similar insider trading case involving a Coinbase manager who was sentenced earlier this year. However, the judge overseeing the ex-OpenSea executive’s case gave a lenient sentence, stating that he was a first-time offender and the proceeds from his NFT insider trading were considerably less than the Coinbase case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chastain was indicted by federal prosecutors in June last year. He was accused of abusing his position at OpenSea to buy NFTs that were set to be featured on the marketplace’s homepage. The former executive made more than $50,000 between June 2021 and September 2021 through his insider trading scheme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chastain reportedly used multiple wallets to route his funds and cover his tracks. After the former OpenSea executive was formally charged, his lawyers entered a not-guilty plea and later argued that no one told him that he couldn’t use or share the insider information in question.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Binance US recently partnered with crypto startup MoonPay to enable crypto purchases via fiat.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange has been a “crypto-only” exchange since June 2023 after losing banking partners.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange’s customers have been unable to deposit or withdraw dollars for more than two months.&nbsp;</li><li>The new USD on-ramp offered by MoonPay will allow users to exchange USD for USDT.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance US recently partnered with crypto payments startup MoonPay to allow its customers to buy crypto assets on its trading platform. The American arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, which transitioned to a “crypto-only” exchange earlier this year, is likely hoping to circumvent the payment disruptions that have prevented its customers from depositing or withdrawing US Dollars from the platform for more than two months.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance US To Use MoonPay’s USD On-Ramp</strong></h2>



<p>Binance US stated on its official website’s <a href="https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/16783463877655-MoonPay-FAQs" rel="nofollow noopener">FAQ</a> section that it had tapped MoonPay to enable efficient buying and selling of crypto assets for its users. The platform will continue to remain a crypto-only exchange for the time being but partnered with the crypto startup to make interacting with crypto easier for its customers. </p>



<p>MoonPay’s USD is integrated into the crypto exchange’s buy &amp; sell crypto feature, which will allow its users to purchase Tether (USDT) using conventional payment methods, including debit/credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. The USDT can subsequently be exchanged for the 150+ crypto assets listed on Binance US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance US <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-us-suspend-usd-withdrawal-june-13/">suspended</a> US Dollar deposits in early June after its banking partners ended support for fiat withdrawal channels. At the time, the payment disruption was blamed on the enforcement action initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>



<p>Binance US stated that the legal troubles and complications stemming from the securities regulator’s actions led to challenges with its banking partners. Citing consumer protection, the crypto exchange announced a transition to a crypto-only exchange and subsequently began delisting USD trading pairs from its trading platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2022, decentralized exchange Uniswap partnered with MoonPay to enable crypto purchases through fiat channels. The “Direct to DeFi” feature allowed the DEX’s users to directly purchase crypto using bank cards and transfers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Collectors have continued to shy away from NFTs</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The year so far has been marked by a general decline in interest in NFTs as a category of digital assets. On a year-to-date, interest peaked around February, and NFT market capitalization and sales volume have since trended downward.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to <a href="https://nftgo.io/analytics/market-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NFTGo</a>, the sum of the market capitalization of all collections has fallen by 46% in the past seven months. Also, the daily total volume of NFT sales across all collections has dropped by 98% within the same period. For context, this was $420.48 million on 19 February. As of 19 August, the sales volume recorded was less than $5 million.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amid the waning interest, the values of blue-chip NFTs have also been affected. For example, as of this writing, the floor price of an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club [BAYC] collection stood at 24 ETH. The last time the average price was this low was in August 2021, three months after it launched. This year alone, the collection’s floor price has plummeted by 64%.&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul><li>Binance has confirmed that Euro withdrawals through the SEPA system will continue till September 25.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange previously stated that it had temporarily suspended Euro withdrawals and deposits via SEPA.&nbsp;</li><li>Some users may experience account closure, as part of the platform’s routine compliance checks.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange is currently working to secure an alternative before the September deadline.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance’s users in the European Union will be able to use the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) system to make Euro withdrawals from their trading account till next month. The crypto exchange confirmed earlier today that SEPA withdrawal and deposit service will remain live for users till September 25, 2023. The clarification came a day after the exchange stated that it had temporarily suspended EUR withdrawals and deposits.</p>



<h2><strong>Binance: Withdrawal Suspension Message Was Sent In Error</strong></h2>



<p>On August 20, Binance Customer Support on X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/1693567598284144950" rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> a user that EUR withdrawals and deposits via the SEPA system had been temporarily suspended. The decision was taken after a Euro provider stopped supporting the crypto exchange’s transactions. At the time, the exchange stated that there was no ETA on the restoration of SEPA transfers, and encouraged users to use alternative methods to trade crypto. </p>



<p>Earlier today, the Binance Customer Support account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1693659553383223553" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that the SEPA suspension message in the now-deleted tweet was sent in error. The account confirmed that SEPA withdrawals and deposits would be available for existing users till September 25. However, the service has been disabled for new users since June 25, 2023. </p>



<p>The exchange added that in the run-up to the September deadline, some users may be asked for additional information as part of the platform’s routine compliance checks. These checks can potentially lead to “early account closures” for some users. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/srm-snm-yfii-down-25-binance-delisting/">Binance</a> reportedly plans to secure an alternate service provider before September 25. </p>



<p>Paysafe, Binance’s banking partner in Europe, confirmed to Decrypt earlier today that Euro withdrawals and deposits through the SEPA system would be available for European users till September. The decision to stop supporting the crypto exchange was reportedly taken back in June 2023 following a strategic review.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wrapper-versions-friendtech-coingecko/">Friend.tech</a>, the web3 social platform recently launched on Coinbase’s layer 2 Base, has called out crypto news website The Block for incorrectly reporting a database leak. The website published an article earlier today, claiming that a data leak had revealed the ETH addresses of more than 100,000 friend.tech users. </p>



<h2><strong>Friend.tech Says “Leaked” Addresses Were Publicly Available</strong></h2>



<p>Friend.tech took to X (formerly Twitter) earlier today to call out The Block for alleging a database leak that supposedly revealed information about 101,000 of its users, including wallet addresses on Base, X usernames, X name, etc. The news outlet cited a Github repository shared by Yearn Finance developer Banteng, which contained the user database in question.</p>



<p>Friend.tech clarified that the user information was gathered by scraping their public API, which reportedly shows the association between public wallet addresses and public Twitter usernames. “It’s like saying someone hacked you by looking at your public Twitter feed,” the social platform added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The news website has since altered its article and made corrections suggesting that the user data was publicly available and not obtained from a leak. However, the crypto community on X criticized the website for spreading FUD through inaccurate reports. The Block’s Director of Research got into a heated debate while defending the actions of his team. </p>

<p>The incident highlighted friend/tech’s popularity, given that it managed to accumulate more than 100,000 users since its launch on August 10, 2023. Data from <a href="https://defillama.com/fees" rel="nofollow noopener">DeFiLlama</a> showed that the fees generated by the social platform exceeded $25 million. Data from Dune Analytics showed that the platform’s cumulative trading volume was nearly $56 million. The social platform has added more than 17,000 new users over the past 24 hours. </p>

<h2>Friend.tech Hype</h2>



<p>The mobile app launched with an invite-only beta a day after Base opened for public access. The platform allows users to tokenize their X (formerly Twitter) accounts and sell a feature called &#8220;shares&#8221;. Shareholders are then afforded access to a private chat room owned by the account whose shares they bought. Users have drawn comparisons with a similar dapp called Bitclout.</p>



<p>The project has garnered attention and participation from DeFi users, reaching over 100,000 unique users shortly after launch per a Dune Analytics dashboard. </p>



<p>Observers also raised eyebrows regarding the long-term value proposition of the project and its pricing mechanism. Friend.tech employs a bonding curve that prices each share based on the number of shareholders. This also means the price of each share could increase as more users buy the shares of an account.</p>



<p>Bitclout, another platform that tokenized users&#8217; social media presence, offered a similar platform that eventually faded after the initial hype.</p>



<p>Community members also raised privacy concerns after a so-called leak of users&#8217; on-chain addresses. &#8220;This is just someone scraping our public API that shows the association between public wallet addresses and public Twitter usernames&#8221;, the team responded.</p>



<p>Friend dot tech </p>



<p>The mobile-only social media decentralized app currently has no privacy policy page, leaving questions about the project&#8217;s approach to one of crypto&#8217;s most talked about topics. </p>

<ul><li>OpenSea is set to disable the royalty enforcement function on its platform starting next month.&nbsp;</li><li>The NFT marketplace will remove its Operator Filter, making royalties optional for new collections.</li><li>Royalties will be enforced for collections that enable the Operator Filter before August 31, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>NFT creators online have expressed frustration with the policy change.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>OpenSea has reversed its policy on royalties for NFT artists by making creator fees optional, citing competition from rival marketplaces, including Blur, LooksRare, and Dew. The leading <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-suku-launch-nft-minted-on-twitter/">NFT</a> marketplace announced earlier today that the changes would go into effect on August 31, 2023. Post this date, NFT artists who sell digital art on the platform will receive royalties on secondary sales only if the buyer chooses to pay it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>OpenSea Operator Filter To Be Disabled&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to making royalties optional, the OpenSea Operator Filter will also be shut down, the NFT marketplace stated in a <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/articles/creator-fees-update" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>. Operator Filter, which was launched in November last year, is a tool used by NFT artists to restrict the sale of their collections to marketplaces that don&#8217;t enforce creator fees in secondary sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective of the Operator Filter was to empower NFT creators by giving them control over their artwork and web3 business models. But OpenSea claimed that the tool required the participation of everyone in the web3 ecosystem, which did not happen, prompting the change in the royalty policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to OpenSea, the option creator fees would be more in line with the choice and ownership in the DeFi space. Starting August 31, the Operator Filter will not block any web3 marketplaces, making it easier for potential NFT buyers to identify secondary listings. This would include the creator’s preferred fees, as well as the option for buyers to modify the creator fees payment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, for NFT creators who enable the OpenSea Operator Filter for their collection before August 31, the NFT marketplace will enforce the creator’s preferred royalty on all secondary sales till February 29, 2024. This option will also be extended to existing collections on all non-Ethereum blockchains.</p>

<p>Coinbase clarified that the trading suspension will not affect Canadian customers’ access to USDT, DAI, and RAI and that the users will be able to deposit and withdraw the stable assets from their wallets following the suspension. None of the stable assets had a considerable change in their prices following the announcement of the suspension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase’s announcement comes less than a week after it officially launched its services in Canada’s crypto market. The move came after months of collaboration between the California-based crypto exchange and Canadian regulators and policymakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, fellow crypto exchange Crypto.com ended support for USDT after it was directed to do so by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). In December 2022, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) stated that value-pegged crypto assets, including Tether, qualified as securities in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ironically, Tether <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-makes-strategic-transition-to-meet-community-demands-and-foster-innovation/" rel="nofollow noopener">withdrew</a> support for Bitcoin Cash SLP, Omni Layer, and Kusama. The decision was reportedly part of a strategic transition based on the crypto industry’s demands. </p>

<p>A Thursday ruling <a href="https://twitter.com/eleanorterrett/status/1692229671725723998?s=46&amp;t=TMI07H21nqgKjjcESnhqEQ" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/eleanorterrett/status/1692229671725723998?s=46&amp;t=TMI07H21nqgKjjcESnhqEQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">granted</a> the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission permission to file an interlocutory appeal in its case against XRP issuer and blockchain company, Ripple Labs. The SEC has until August 18th to file its motion.</p>



<p>This approval comes a day after Ripple Labs and co-defendants Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ripple-opposes-sec-interlocutory-appeal/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ripple-opposes-sec-interlocutory-appeal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed</a> the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal, per court documents seen on August 16. </p>



<p>The co-defendants argued that the SEC failed to meet the burden of proof to support classifying programmatic sales of XRP as securities.</p>



<p>After the SEC files its motion on Friday, the digital asset company is expected to submit opposition arguments by September 1.  Thursday&#8217;s ruling allows the SEC to file a motion to appeal, not to be mistaken for Judge Torres&#8217;s approval of the appeal itself.</p>

<h2>SEC vs Ripple Headed To Trial</h2>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s interlocutory motion seeks to appeal a specific ruling from Judge Torres. Previously, Judge Torres issued a summary judgment in partial favor of Ripple Labs. The verdict said programmatic sales of XRP did not qualify as securities considering the Howey test. </p>



<p>However, XRP sales to institutional investors met the Howey standard for classifying securities. SEC vs Ripple Labs et all is scheduled for trial in the Southern District of New York by Q2 2024. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a deadline of December 4, 2023 for all parties to submit any filings and motions to exclude evidence from a jury, per court documents. </p>



<p>Garlinghouse and Larsen, Ripple co-founders, also face charges of aiding and abetting violations of U.S. securities laws. </p>
