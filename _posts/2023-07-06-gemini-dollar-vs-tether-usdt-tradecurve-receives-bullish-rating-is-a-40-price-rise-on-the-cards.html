<p>Gemini Dollar and Tether are two of the world's most popular stablecoins. Both have gained traction during the recent banking crisis, in which several high-profile banks collapsed. However, their reliance on the U.S. dollar could potentially cause issues in the future. If inflation continues to rise throughout financial markets, both Gemini Dollar and Tether could struggle in the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, new projects like Tradecurve are making waves in the DeFi space. Tradecurve has raised $3 million during its presale, and following an 80% surge in value, analysts now believe that an additional 40% price rise could be on the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tether Makes A Huge Investment In Bitcoin Mining&nbsp;
<p>As the world's number one most traded cryptocurrency, Tether is considered an extremely safe crypto investment. The project recently invested $1 billion into a new Bitcoin mining farm in El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This investment is designed to help create an eco-friendly mining solution, with Tether offering expertise in green energy alternatives. This particular farm will utilize Volcano energy to produce 241 MW of power and will also install photovoltaic cells to produce solar energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This investment is a huge development in the Tether ecosystem, and has helped to solidify the project's reputation. As Tether continues to invest in DeFi, its popularity is only going to grow, which has made Tether the number one option for investors looking to buy stablecoins,&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Gemini Dollar Trading Volume Surges&nbsp;
<p>Gemini Dollar is an alternative to Tether with a number of benefits. It&rsquo;s been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, which makes it a safe investment despite the recent SEC lawsuits. Furthermore, Gemini Dollar has been audited by Trail of Bits Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gemini Dollar is also a stable investment due to being pegged to the U.S. Dollar. As of July 2023, Gemini Dollar has a daily trading volume of $1.8 million, a significant increase from June. This increase suggests that more investors are looking for stable investments, with Gemini Dollar becoming a top option in the process.&nbsp;</p>
Tradecurve Attracts Thousands Of New Investors&nbsp;
<p>Although Tradecurve may not be as stable as Gemini Dollar or Tether, the project offers significantly higher returns. Since its presale started, Tradecurve has raised over $3 million and offered investors returns of 80%. This ROI is expected to increase again soon, with stage four of the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale already 60% sold out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve offers an exciting new alternative to traditional investing. Its hybrid exchange lets investors buy the widest range of assets of any platform, including traditional and DeFi options. Assets such as commodities, forex, and CFDs can be traded by investors who can use cryptocurrency as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a decentralized platform, all of these assets can be traded anonymously. Tradecurve lets investors trade assets without needing to pass KYC or intrusive background checks. This is expected to be a big selling point for the project, as thousands of investors left centralized platforms following lawsuits from the SEC in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve Is Predicted To 100x Post Presale
<p>Tradecurve is now ranked among the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in the DeFi market. Its value has continuously increased in June, and now experts believe its value could 50x before its presale ends. Post presale, price predictions are going as high as 100x once TCRV tokens are listed on major exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With such high price predictions, Tradecurve&rsquo;s current price of $0.018 is believed to be a huge bargain, though, with hundreds of investors buying tokens daily, TCRV is expected to increase in value again before mid-July.&nbsp;</p>
