					<description><![CDATA[In recent times, the Solana price has witnessed a considerable upward push, which made the coin breach important resistance levels. Over the last 24 hours, SOL has rallied close to 20%, and in a week&#8217;s time, the altcoin has appreciated close to 40%. As Bitcoin&#8217;s price has remained above $20,000, most altcoins have shown positive price momentum on their respective charts. If Bitcoin continues to climb higher, then short-term bullish momentum will prevail across the market. Related Reading: Polkadot Could Present Buying Opportunity As Bullish Outlook Continues The technical outlook of Solana has pointed towards the bulls, but the chart also reveals that as the coin has been overbought, SOL would eventually witness a price correction. Accumulation remains high on the chart as demand for the coin has been at a multi-month high. Solana could present its buyers with buying opportunities; the coin might retrace on its chart and then rise again. The market capitalization of Solana increased, which meant that there had been an increase in buying strength. Currently, Solana has been trading at a 90% discount to its all-time high, which was secured in 2021. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was priced at $25 at the time of writing. Solana pierced through many resistance levels. The $25 price mark has acted as stiff resistance for the coin; it is imperative that SOL stay put above that region to avoid bullish momentum from fading. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $31, but before the altcoin gets to that level, SOL is bound to trade south. Local support for the coin stood at $21. The support region that ranges between $21 and $18 will present traders with entry opportunities. The amount of Solana traded in the last session increased and was green, which meant that the coin depicted bullish momentum. Technical Analysis SOL continued to display overbought tendencies, the asset was overvalued. Despite a tiny correction in demand, accumulation for the coin shot past the overbought region again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was parked at the 70-mark, which was a sign that buyers exceeded sellers heavily on the daily chart. Similarly, the price of the asset was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Solana was also above the 50-SMA line (yellow), which is a sign of a bullish extension. On the flip side, SOL displayed a death cross where the 50-SMA crossed above the 20-SMA line, and that meant an incoming fall in price. Bulls were still around for Solana, but buy signals for the altcoin were declining in size. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) depicts price momentum and reversals. The MACD displayed decreasing green histograms, which meant that buy signals were declining on the chart.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market has been remarkably bullish since the turn of the new year. In the last three weeks, several assets have experienced price rallies, like Bitcoin, which gained over 37% to trade above $21,000 for the first time in two months. While that is an impressive feat, altcoins have been the real stars of the market, with many pulling off a stunning market performance. Aptos (APT), one of the trailblazing tokens of 2023, has just recorded a 54.73% gain in the last 24 hours based on data from CoinMarketCap. APT has been one of the best-performing coins in 2023, gaining by over 248% since the start of the year. Although it is a relatively new token, Its price growth in 2023 outshines that of many market giants, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) and, of course &#8211; Bitcoin (BTC). At the time of writing, Aptos (APT) is trading at a market price of $12.60. According to CoinMarketCap, the token’s daily trading volume has also gone up by 373.99%, attaining a value of $1.82 billion.  APT trading $12.64 &#124; Source: APTUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: What Is SingularityNET And Why Is Its AGIX Token Exploding By 116%? What Is Behind APT’s Rise? Aptos was launched on October 22, 2023, making it one of the newest projects in the crypto space. On October 23, the APT token attained its ATH value of $10.25. However, APT began the new year trading at $3.43 due to the FTX crisis that occurred in November.  That said, the dramatic rise in APT’s price so far can be attributed to many factors. One of which is growing support from various crypto projects. On January 6, PancakeSwap, the biggest DEX on the BNB Chain, announced its deployment on the Aptos blockchain following approval by its user community.  The following week after this announcement, the price of APT surged by 97.6%, marking the beginning of APT’s price rally in 2023. During this period, Atomic Wallet, one of the top cold crypto wallets with over 3 million users, also announced they would be providing support for APT with immediate effect. Another contributing factor to APT’s impressive price rally is the constant buzz around the project due to its origins stemming from the now-defunct Meta Diem blockchain initiative.  Moreover, Aptos is designed with many intriguing features, including its unique programming language &#8211; Move &#8211; that makes many investors consider it as a blockchain with massive potential to become a major competitor to Ethereum, Solana, and other established smart contract-compatible platforms. Related Reading: Polkadot Could Present Buying Opportunity As Bullish Outlook Continues What To Expect From Aptos In 2023 The Aptos blockchain is definitely one to look out for in 2023. According to the project’s roadmap, the major focus of the developer’s team will be the implementation of demand-driven gas costs in a bid to drastically reduce the current gas fees on the network. If successful, it is expected that such an upgrade could exert a positive effect on an APT token that is already soaring high in the clouds. However, it goes without saying that this is merely speculation and should not be relied upon in making investment decisions.  Feature Image: Boxmining, Chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, has been crossing multiple crucial resistances since the start of the year. According to CoinGecko, the coin is now up 14% in the weekly timeframe, and trading at $23,008, making BTC break through the $22,000 and $23,000 resistance levels that have limited the crypto&#8217;s ascent.  This year witnessed a complete U-turn in investor sentiment on cryptocurrencies as both Ethereum and Bitcoin reaped massive gains, along with the other top altcoins. This led to the entire crypto market to experience a resurgence in almost all aspects. At the time of writing, the current market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market is at $1.05 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Related Reading: What Is SingularityNET And Why Is Its AGIX Token Exploding By 116%?

Bitcoin is heavily connected to the traditional financial space. This means if major indices like the NASDAQ continue to go up, Bitcoin will follow suit along with the entire cryptocurrencies.  With the broader financial space eyeing an economic soft-landing, bullishness on both the crypto and stock market will continue as the situation improves. December’s Consumer Price Data (CPI) contributed to the optimistic mood. Image: Crypto News What’s Next For The Alpha Coin? Bitcoin’s price movement is expected to slow down a bit in the short term, some analysts said, as the next target will be $30k in the coming weeks or months. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin bulls should try and consolidate above its current support at $22,661 which will be retested by the bears in the next few days as $23,328 resisted today’s bullishness. Chart: Tradingview Investors and traders should also keep an eye on consolidation for now as market momentum might slow down. Bitcoin’s halving – an event that would cut the total supply of the coin in the market – would also place upward pressure as it happens.  BTC total market cap at $442 billion on the weekend chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration Bulls should also keep tabs of the current situation in the traditional financial space. With the coin’s high correlation with the stock market, Bitcoin’s future will be reliant on the movement of the stock market along with improving macroeconomic trends.  For now, Bitcoin holders should have enough strength to consolidate and target $24.5k and $25k resistances.  Featured image by Helvetia]]></description>

<p>Just this few hours ago, the NASDAQ index <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/stock-market-news-live-updates-stock-futures-mixed-as-wall-street-looks-to-rebound/ar-AA16yKSl" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">jumped</a> almost 3% as tech stocks led the market rally. Bitcoin is heavily connected to the traditional financial space. This means if major indices like the NASDAQ continue to go up, Bitcoin will follow suit along with the entire cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>With the broader financial space <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/fed-s-george-says-a-soft-landing-still-possible-for-us-economy#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eyeing</a> an economic soft-landing, bullishness on both the crypto and stock market will continue as the situation improves. <a href="https://ph.news.yahoo.com/december-consumer-prices-inflation-data-cpi-january-12-125134163.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">December’s</a> Consumer Price Data (CPI) contributed to the optimistic mood.</p>

<h2><strong>What’s Next For The Alpha Coin?</strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin’s price movement is expected to slow down a bit in the short term, some analysts said, as the next target will be $30k in the coming weeks or months.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Bitcoin bulls should try and consolidate above its current support at $22,661 which will be retested by the bears in the next few days as $23,328 resisted today’s bullishness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-517031 size-large" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-63-860x437.png" alt="" width="860" height="437" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-63-860x437.png 860w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-63-460x234.png 460w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-63-768x390.png 768w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-63-750x381.png 750w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-63-1140x579.png 1140w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-63.png 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>

<p>Investors and traders should also keep an eye on consolidation for now as market momentum might slow down. Bitcoin’s halving – an event that would cut the total supply of the coin in the market – would also place upward pressure as it happens. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/sgGlpmTw/" width="2047" height="979" /></p>


<p>Bulls should also keep tabs of the current situation in the traditional financial space. With the coin’s <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-rally-shows-that-where-tech-stocks-go-cryptocurrencies-follow/ar-AA16fTES" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">high correlation</a> with the stock market, Bitcoin’s future will be reliant on the movement of the stock market along with improving macroeconomic trends. </p>
<p>For now, Bitcoin holders should have enough strength to consolidate and target $24.5k and $25k resistances. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The popularity of artificial intelligence applications has been growing as popular platforms like SingularityNET and ChatGPT become mainstream. With Microsoft investing $10 billion on ChatGPT, we should expect AI applications to become more mainstream in the next few years.  AGIX, the native token of the SingularityNET, is capitalizing on this as it tallied huge gains since the start of 2023. According to CoinGecko, the token is up 116% in the past week (at the time of writing, Friday) with the biggest gains made at the bi-weekly time frame at 360%.  Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration What Is SingularityNET? SingularityNET is the first decentralized AI market that is built on top of the Cardano blockchain. The project was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel, a cognitive scientist and one of the leading figures in AI research. The project is set to create an AGI or an artificial general intelligence.  Image: SingularityNET/Twitter As of writing, the SingularityNET ecosystem comprises 13 protocols that are either being built or are already deployed as a full-fledged component of the ecosystem.  Getting Smarter By The Day On-chain developments have been very bullish for the SingularityNET ecosystem. According to the ecosystem’s recent blog post, the journey of SingularityNET in creating an AGI is getting closer by the day.  The development of the MeTTa, a custom coding language specifically built for SingularityNET’s goals, have been successful so far. Image: Thoughtworks Arts The alpha release of the coding language will be accompanied by the release of the Distributed Atomspace (DAS) knowledge store this 2023.  This technology would enable the AGI to store data for the long-term. These developments in the realm of AI will certainly make the creation of SingularityNET’s AGI easier.  How Did These Affect AGIX?  The ecosystem’s native token AGIX is currently one of the most bullish tokens on the market. As of Saturday, AGIX is trading at $0.2139, rising 32% in the last week, and facing rejection at two strong resistances at $0.2362 and $0.2546.  The current rally of the token is unsustainable and bears might be able to retest its support $0.1404. This support is shaky as any breakthrough on this level might force AGIX to drop at $0.0822 in the medium term.  AGIX/US Dollar trading at $0.2139 on the weekend chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Decentraland (MANA) Swells 55% – Are Metaverse Tokens Back?

					<description><![CDATA[The Polkadot price has breached the $5 resistance mark in the past trading sessions. Over the last 24 hours, DOT has appreciated by 3.8%. The price of Bitcoin has been surging, which has caused other altcoins to also move upward on their respective charts. When Bitcoin crossed the $18,000 price mark, other altcoins broke past their immediate resistance marks. Polkadot price momentum remains bullish in the shorter time frame. The technical outlook for DOT showed that despite a price correction, accumulation on the chart increased. Related Reading: This Metric Suggests Bitcoin Could Be In Danger Of Another Selloff Polkadot demand also showed an increase on its chart. The asset&#8217;s price has to remain above the $5.40 support line and breach the $6.20 resistance level if the coin has to maintain a bullish stance for a longer time frame. The daily chart of DOT also points towards an incoming fall in price, which means that traders might be presented with shorting opportunities. Currently, DOT is trading at an 89% discount from its all-time high secured in 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was exchanging hands at $5.89 at the time of writing. Polkadot had formed a cup and handle pattern, which means that the bullish momentum can continue, which is why Polkadot resumed its northbound journey on the daily chart. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $6. Toppling the $6 mark can take the coin to $6.20. As Polkadot was overbought, demand for the coin could trickle down. This can cause the price to fall for a few trading sessions before it starts to rise again. In case of a price retracement, DOT will encounter its local support at $5.40 and then at $5.33. These two levels can be an entry point for buyers, as the altcoin will rise in value after it touches these support lines. The amount of Polkadot traded in the last session was still green, indicating that buying pressure remained. Technical Analysis The asset had secured a multi-month high in registering demand in the past week. The coin was overvalued a week ago, and as a result, demand has retraced slightly. The Relative Strength Index fell back from the 80 mark, which was a sign of the asset being overbought. At press time, DOT again registered an uptick, indicating that buying strength was building again. On that note, the price of DOT was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, hinting that buyers were driving price momentum in the market. The coin was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) line. Despite that, the 50-SMA line crossed above the 20-SMA line, which signified a death cross. A death cross means an incoming fall in value. This reading corresponds to traders finding the chance to short the asset. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which depicts price momentum and reversals, showed declining buy signals. This means that the price will fall over the next trading session. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Up 4% As Lead Dev Teases Exact Beta Launch Date The Parabolic SAR also sides with the MACD as the dotted lines were formed above the price candlestick, indicating that the asset&#8217;s price direction was starting to become negative.

					<description><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has levied a $45 million fine on Nexo Capital Inc. The SEC explains the reason for the fine in a tweet, Today we charged Nexo Capital Inc. with failing to register the offer and sale of its retail crypto asset lending product, the Earn Interest Product (EIP). To settle charges, Nexo agreed to pay $22.5 million and cease its unregistered offer and sale of the EIP to U.S. investors. The $22.5 million fine for selling EIP to US investors. Moreover, the $22 million fine will go through settling the claims by State Regulatory Authorities. The SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler, reinforces that crypto organizations must comply with its policies. Failure to do so will allow the SEC to hold the defaulters accountable.  Related Reading: JPMorgan Taps Former Celsius Exec As Crypto Regulatory Policy Director What Is EIP And Why The Fine? Starting in June 2020, Nexo is marketing and selling its Earn Interest Product (EIP) in the USA. Nexo operates so that it lends money to its customers, and interest becomes its primary source of income. Nexo uses this interest income to pay interest on its loans further. However, several states in the USA alleged that Nexo’s earn-interest service is not registered as a Security.  As a result, the states of California, Oklahoma, Vermont, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Maryland took the company to court. They demanded a cease-and-desist order on the company’s EIP service.  Related Reading: California State Kills Main Crypto Bill, Why? The SEC order says that Nexo used its EIP service to fund interest payments and inject it into its other businesses. Moreover, the SEC holds Nexo at fault because their EIP Security fails to meet the requirements for an exemption from the regulatory authority.  Today we charged Nexo Capital Inc. with failing to register the offer and sale of its retail crypto asset lending product, the Earn Interest Product (EIP). To settle charges, Nexo agreed to pay $22.5 million and cease its unregistered offer and sale of the EIP to U.S. investors. &#8212; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) January 19, 2023 Even though Nexo agrees to pay the fine and stop the EIP service, they have not confirmed the allegations. In response to the penalty, Nexo also published a settlement tweet confirming that they agree to a no-admit-no-deny settlement.  Nexo has reached a final landmark resolution with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), consisting of all 50 U.S. States &#38; 3 territories and the Attorney General of New York.🧵https://t.co/modjbPsOdV &#8212; Nexo (@Nexo) January 19, 2023 Further, Nexo’s Co-Founder Antoni Trenchev says, We are content with this unified resolution which unequivocally puts an end to all speculations around Nexo’s relations with the United States. We can now focus on what we do best – build seamless financial solutions for our worldwide audience. SEC Is Getting More Vigilant And Strict Noting some of the SEC’s previous actions on crypto companies, it can be said that it is tightening the noose. In February 2022, SEC fined BlockFi $100 million for its unregistered securities offerings. The BlockFi fine acted as a warning for several other crypto firms offering similar products.  A Cornerstone Research finds several proceedings in which the SEC holds crypto companies accountable for their services, solutions, and actions. Over 30 such enforcement proceedings came under the chairmanship of Gary Gensler in 2022. Similar to the Nexo case, the SEC also charged Gemini for its unregistered service in the form of sales of securities. Featured Image From UnSplash, Chart From TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>The $22.5 million fine for selling EIP to US investors. Moreover, the $22 million fine will go through settling the claims by State Regulatory Authorities. The SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler, reinforces that crypto organizations must comply with its policies. Failure to do so will allow the SEC to hold the defaulters accountable. </p>

<h2><b>What Is EIP And Why The Fine?</b></h2>
<p>Starting in June 2020, Nexo is marketing and selling its Earn Interest Product (EIP) in the USA. Nexo operates so that it lends money to its customers, and interest becomes its primary source of income.  Nexo uses this interest income to pay interest on its loans further. However, several states in the USA alleged that Nexo’s earn-interest service is not registered as a Security. </p>
<p>As a result, the states of California, Oklahoma, Vermont, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Maryland took the company to court. They demanded a cease-and-desist order on the company’s EIP service. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SEC order</a> says that Nexo used its EIP service to fund interest payments and inject it into its other businesses. Moreover, the SEC holds Nexo at fault because their EIP Security fails to meet the requirements for an exemption from the regulatory authority. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Even though Nexo agrees to pay the fine and stop the EIP service, they have not confirmed the allegations. In response to the penalty, Nexo also published a <a href="https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1616195610046070792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1616195610046070792%7Ctwgr%5E6948fd2f082e6abc6a4a4a8132d8417b4c679b81%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcrypto.news%2Fnexo-reaches-22-5m-settlement-with-us-sec%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">settlement tweet</a> confirming that they agree to a no-admit-no-deny settlement. </p>

<h2><b>SEC Is Getting More Vigilant And Strict</b></h2>
<p>Noting some of the SEC’s previous actions on crypto companies, it can be said that it is tightening the noose. In February 2022, <a href="https://newsbtc.com/interview/adalend-ceo-kaspars-koskins-100m-fine-for-blockfi-canada-banking-freeze-highlights-the-importance-of-decentralized-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC fined BlockFi $100 million</a> for its unregistered securities offerings. The BlockFi fine acted as a warning for several other crypto firms offering similar products. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cornerstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SEC-Cryptocurrency-Enforcement-2022-Update.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cornerstone Research</a> finds several proceedings in which the SEC holds crypto companies accountable for their services, solutions, and actions. Over 30 such enforcement proceedings came under the chairmanship of Gary Gensler in 2022. Similar to the Nexo case, the <a href="https://newsbtc.com/sponsored/gemini-earn-users-want-justice-exchange-ignores-them-to-buy-ledgerx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC also charged Gemini</a> for its unregistered service in the form of sales of securities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As Bitcoin breaks out of the $21k level, many crypto analysts have begun projecting further rallies for the asset. One of the famous crypto strategists, Crypto Kaleo, recently gave a high price prediction for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Addressing his over 550,000 followers on Twitter, Kaleo says BTC is preparing for a rally to $30,000. Bitcoin last saw $30,000 during the bear market in June 2022. However, the crypto strategist believes there would be fluctuations as Bitcoin targets $30,000, albeit his bullish stance. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration In his words, the market should expect more falls before Bitcoin reaches $30,000. According to Kaleo, there would be some lows beneath $20k, which would trigger lower positions before Bitcoin can be ready for the short squeeze.  A short squeeze occurs when crypto traders borrow assets at a particular price, hoping to sell them lower and keep the difference. These traders often use overleverage short positions in the futures market. However, the traders would have no choice but to buy the borrowed assets as price propulsion pushes against them, sparking more rallies as market makers take out their liquidity to keep the momentum.  Kaleo is confident that the short squeeze is approaching since the BTC price has already jumped above 23% within seven days. Bitcoin Rally Could Signal Increased Volatility BTC has witnessed several bullish indicators since the beginning of 2023, bringing it to a year-high of over $21,000. Bitcoin’s bullish rallies have boosted crypto traders’ hopes that the long-running bear market could end soon.  There has been a reduction in the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index to neutral, which might cause an increase in trading volume. A massive increase in Bitcoin trading volume followed the recent price surge. Throughout the past week, Bitcoin trading volume has climbed above double the initial value, reaching $10.8 billion, a 114% increase.  An increase in trading volume often leads to a spike in volatility. Bitcoin’s current seven-day volatility level of 2.4% is below the 2022 value of 3.1% but remained stable during the recent rally. There is a likelihood that the constantly increasing trading volume during the rally may cause a spike in volatility. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) had to battle with low trading volume, which means lower transaction fees and revenue, including staff layoffs. Therefore, the rising trading volume is a welcomed development for the exchanges and BTC traders.  Bitcoin Recovery Underway As Realized Profit And Trading Volume Increase According to Glassnode’s data, on-chain realized profits for BTC return to the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR) value of 1.0. Some analysts believe it is the critical resistance level. The aSOPR historically indicates a shift in the total market cycle when increasing demands (trading volumes) absorb profits. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration BTC’s on-chain realized profit and loss ratio has jumped over the 1.0 mark, recording 1.56 profits against the January 16 losses. This marked a reversal of the downtrend that started in May 2022. An increase in realized gain without a price drop indicates market strength. On-chain analytics by Glassnode also suggest that a BTC price recovery is underway. As the market absorbs more selling pressure without a fall in price, the overall fear and macro shift will reduce. Technically, volatility, trading volume, and realized profits are pushing BTC decoupling from equities. Bitcoin’s previous price action correlates to US equities. The correlation to equities might have been due to asset accumulation by institutional investors. The correlation has reduced now that institutional investors hold fewer BTC and might exit the market in the future.  Featured Image From Pixabay, Charts From Tradingview.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple has reached a new milestone in Australia with its native token, XRP, recording the highest trading volumes on exchanges. With this, Ripple now dominates Australian crypto exchanges as the XRP community anticipates a final court ruling in the lawsuit with the U.S. SEC (Securities And Exchange Commission). The news came from Financial Review, an Australian media outlet shared on Twitter by Neil Smith, Ripple’s partner engineer, and Aussie firm, Blockchain Australia. Ripple now dominates Australian crypto exchange volumes #XRP https://t.co/yaeFIqsNIn &#8212; Neil Smith (@nsmithau) January 18, 2023 Reason For XRP Performance In Australia According to the report, Ripple’s cross-border remittance payment (ODL) use case adoption gets the credit for this achievement. Ripple on-demand liquidity makes XRP suitable for cross-border payments as it helps customers access liquidity using this token. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration  XRP itself serves as a bridge token between fiat currencies. It allows users to make payments in local currency at the payment destination within seconds, hence the name, on-demand liquidity. Following the report&#8217;s details, Ripple&#8217;s native coin contributed to 62% of the trading volumes on the BTC Market, a Melbourne-based exchange. It also accounted for 82% of the Independent Reserve Exchange over the past day.  CEO of BTC Markets Caroline Bowler said her crypto exchange is a Ripple on-demand (ODL) liquidity partner in Australia. That explains XRP&#8217;s dominance in the exchanges&#8217; trading volume. According to Bowler, Ripple ODL helps firms to run cross-border payments without incurring banking or pre-funding costs. It uses Ripple&#8217;s native coin to power part of the process, which explains the trading volumes on the BTC Market platform. As Bowler further explained, Ripple&#8217;s native coin shares a higher percentage on their platform while the overall transaction volumes in the crypto market remain down. Meanwhile, XRP transactions score a 24-hour volume of $10.2 million on the Sydney-based crypto exchange, Independent Reserve. This number is more than other countries&#8217; trading volumes put together. CEO of Independent Research, Adrian Prezelozny, said market makers and international remitters on the ODL network are part of their XRP trading clients. Status Of Long-Standing Ripple/SEC Lawsuit While XRP scores these wins in Australia, Ripple is still in a legal battle with the SEC over the token&#8217;s status as a security. According to Stuart Alderoty, chief attorney for Ripple in the lawsuit, the outcome will significantly impact the entire cryptocurrency market.  Bloomberg also stated that the soon-to-come ruling would clarify who should handle crypto oversight. It would also define assets that qualify as securities or those that do not. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration Both parties in the Ripple case have filed motions for summary judgment. According to Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, and Stuart Alderoty, the ruling is expected to come in the first half of 2023. James K. Filan said the court ruling might go as early as March. Irrespective of the time, Alderoty believes it will impact the future of the crypto industry in the United States. Meanwhile, XRP is still on its way up and currently trading at $0.3933, with slight gains on the chart. Featured Image From Pixabay/ SalesBlog, Charts From Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) recovered from the slight pullback yesterday, even when the general crypto market cap dropped today. SOL which has been on an uptrend in the past week saw a 28.44% increase during this time. This increase might be due to combined economic factors and Solana&#8217;s growing utility among crypto users. What Is Driving The Price Of Solana? The Solana network is enjoying more attention from the increased crypto awareness and adoption among individual and institutional investors. The network has rolled out plans for 2023, creating excitement among its online community. Related Reading: XRP Vs. Cardano (ADA), Which Is The Better Investment In 2023? The SOL network provides developers access and a framework to build DApps on its blockchain. For instance, Phantom, a crypto wallet, is hosted on the Solana blockchain. The wallet supports decentralized finance, staking, and NFT transactions for Solana users.  Also, SolanaMobile, on Twitter, announced its intention to launch Solana Mobile Stack and Saga phones. The mobile phone will bring the Solana blockchain to the fingertips of users. Users are keen on the launch of the device, slated for this early this year.  Additionally, as an altcoin, Solana correlates to bitcoin in price action. So, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent rally and other economic factors might be influencing SOL&#8217;s price. The macroeconomic factors affecting SOL price include a low Consumer Price Index (CPI) value for December 2022. The CPI notes the overall change in consumer prices in a specific timeframe. These factors combined could be responsible for SOL&#8217;s price surge in the past few weeks. Solana Price Prediction: Will SOL Break Its Resistance? SOL is recovering from yesterday&#8217;s slight pullback, trading at $21.28. The support levels are $19.60, $20.09, and $20.75, while the resistance levels are $21.90, $22.40, and $23.05. SOL is trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 200-day SMA on the weekly charts. These signs point to a bearish trend or slight reversal in the price of SOL ahead. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is close to the oversold region at 43.04 and might continue to descend if the bears sustain their charge. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and giving off negative values, indicating a bearish reversal despite the rally. The price of SOL might dip further and touch the $19.69 support. The next rally will likely surpass the first resistance level of $21.90 in the coming days. At press time, the price of SOL was trading at $21.42. Its trading volume is down over 50% in the last 24 hours to be sitting at $638.8 million.

					<description><![CDATA[A Bitcoin on-chain indicator is currently forming a pattern that has previously led to significant selloffs of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin 100-Day SMA Supply Adjusted Dormancy Has Rapidly Gone Up As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the selloff could potentially be even stronger than the one seen in November 2018. A relevant concept here is of a &#8220;coin day,&#8221; which is the amount of 1 BTC accumulated after sitting still on the chain for 1 day. Thus, when a token stays dormant for a certain number of days, it gains coin days of the same amount. However, when this coin is finally moved, its coin days naturally reset back to zero, and the coin days it had previously accumulated are said to be destroyed. An indicator called the &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) measures the total amount of such coin days being destroyed through transfers on the entire Bitcoin network. When the CDD is divided by the total number of coins being involved in transactions, a new metric called the &#8220;average dormancy&#8221; is obtained. This metric is so named because it tells us how dormant the average coin being transferred on the chain currently is (as dormancy is nothing but the number of coin days). When the average dormancy is high, it means coins being moved right now are quite aged on average. On the other hand, low values imply investors are currently transferring coins that they only recently acquired.

Related Reading: Binance USD (BUSD) Exchange Reserves Dry Up, Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Slowdown? The reason behind this change lies in the fact that the supply of the crypto isn&#8217;t constant, but rather moving up with time. So, accounting for this adjustment makes it so that comparisons with previous cycles are easier to do. As you can see in the above chart, the Bitcoin supply-adjusted dormancy has been on a steady uptrend since the lows observed following the FTX crash. This means that the old supply has been observing rising activity recently, suggesting that the long-term holders might be exerting selling pressure on the market. The quant notes that a similar trend in the indicator was also seen back in August 2018, where the metric started on an uptrend from the lows seen early in that month. Three months after this uptrend started, BTC observed its final leg down of the bear market, during the crash of November 2018. If this previous trend is anything to go by, then Bitcoin could be at risk for another selloff soon. And since the uptrend in the metric this time around is even sharper, a potential plunge might be deeper as well.

<h2>Bitcoin 100-Day SMA Supply Adjusted Dormancy Has Rapidly Gone Up</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63c9fc7abf0caf3db205ba35-Bitcoins-Supply-Adjusted-Dormancy-rapid-rise-points-to-a-likely-sell-off" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, the selloff could potentially be even stronger than the one seen in November 2018.

<p>When the average dormancy is high, it means coins being moved right now are quite aged on average. On the other hand, low values imply investors are currently transferring coins that they only recently acquired.</p>
