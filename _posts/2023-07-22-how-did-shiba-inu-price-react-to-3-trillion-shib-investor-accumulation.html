Shiba Inu (SHIB) has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the digital asset landscape despite the lack of significant bullish momentum in the past few weeks. However, recent events have catapulted this canine-inspired cryptocurrency into the spotlight, as an astonishing 3 trillion SHIB tokens were accumulated by investors.  Cryptocurrencies are renowned for their inherent volatility, and Shiba Inu is no exception. The token&#8217;s meteoric popularity and the passionate community backing it have contributed to its roller-coaster journey on the market. But with the recent accumulation of such an astronomical number of SHIB tokens, questions arise about how this development will reverberate throughout the ecosystem and influence its market value.

This phenomenon, commonly known as &#8220;sitting ducks,&#8221; can hinder the overall liquidity and dynamism of the SHIB market. SHIB feeling the pain on the weekly timeframe.
