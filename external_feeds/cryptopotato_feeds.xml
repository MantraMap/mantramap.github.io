			            <description><![CDATA[After making investors believe that wallet storage foe bitcoin was free, Coin Cafe charged users for the service without their knowledge. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Brooklyn-based crypto firm Coin Cafe has been ordered by the office of the Attorney General to refund over $4 million to cryptocurrency investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The restitution comes after investigations revealed that the company charged users exorbitant fees without their consent.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">&#8220;Free&#8221; but not Free</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-secures-43-million-cryptocurrency-company-defrauding" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">press release</a> on May 18, the New York Attorney General&#8217;s office claimed that Coin Cafe charged investors high fees to store bitcoin with the company&#8217;s wallet, despite advertising the service as &#8220;free&#8221; on their website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coin Cafe, which recently received approval for a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) in January 2023, also known as BitLicense, claimed to offer free storage services for investors but started charging fees for crypto storage in September 2020 without informing customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on investigations, the company increased the fee four different times, each one higher than the previous charge. In October 2020, Coin Cafe carried out what the press release described as the &#8220;most drastic fee structure,&#8221; where the platform charged users $99 in bitcoin monthly if they did not trade or transfer BTC on its site within one month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, one New York customer paid $10,000 in fees in one month, while the crypto trading company charged more investor fees of up to $51,000 over 13 months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Subsequently, Coin Cafe&#8217;s exorbitant charges left investors&#8217; accounts with nothing. According to a statement from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Ultimately, Coin Cafe took storage fees from more than 300 New York investors. Coin Cafe took hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin from its investors and completely wiped out hundreds of investor accounts down to a zero balance.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 dir="ltr">Coin Cafe to Reduce Wallet Storage Service to 0.002% per BTC</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Coin Cafe entered an agreement with the New York Attorney General&#8217;s office to refund defrauded investors. Part of the agreement will see the firm pay back $4.3 million to all affected investors, which includes $508,000 to over 340 New York users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coin Cafe will also limit fees for its wallet service to 0.002 percent per Bitcoin monthly, with the company also being transparent about its fees to investors. In addition, the crypto firm will provide monthly updates to the Office of the Attorney General about the status of the refunds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a statement from the New York Attorney General Letitia James,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Coin Cafe defrauded hundreds of New Yorkers out of thousands of dollars with its deceptive marketing and due to a lack of effective regulation. This is yet another example of why the cryptocurrency industry needs to be better regulated, just like any other financial institution where New York investors put their hard-earned money.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Also, James&#8217; office claimed that Coin Cafe did not register as a commodity dealer-broker with the New York Attorney General&#8217;s office, as required by the state&#8217;s law.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Tai and Hoang reportedly received life imprisonment for kidnapping a person and abducting $1.5 million in BTC from him. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Ho Chi Minh City People&#8217;s Court ruled that the Vietnamese residents &#8211; Ho Ngoc Tai and Tran Ngoc Hoang &#8211; will spend their lives in prison for kidnapping an individual and stealing $1.5 million worth of bitcoin from him.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">14 other people who also took part in the crime received sentences between 9 and 19 years. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No Mercy </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 34-year-old Tai and the 40-year-old Hoang were </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2023/05/16/two-men-sentenced-to-life-for-stealing-us15mil-in-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">slammed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with life imprisonment for orchestrating a sophisticated kidnapping and later draining $1.5 million in BTC from the victim. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to local law, digital assets are illegal in Vietnam, meaning individuals or businesses can not accept them as a currency or a means of payment. Nonetheless, the defendants managed to convert the stolen BTC to VND18.8 billion (approximately $800,000). The court ruled that the criminals should compensate the victim with that amount.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tai and Hoang were not the only people behind the affair. They were supported by 14 other associates, who will go to prison, too. However, none of them will stay behind bars for life, with sentences varying from 9 to 19 years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is interesting to note that two of them &#8211; Nguyen Quoc Dung and Nguyen Anh Tuan &#8211; served as police officers a few years back. The former was sentenced to 17 years, while the latter will stay in a correctional facility for 12 years. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Retrospection of the Crime</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CryptoPotato</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/vietnamese-residents-accused-of-1-5-million-crypto-theft-and-kidnapping-to-face-justice-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> last week, the saga started five years ago when Le Duc Nguyen advised Ho Ndoc Tai to sell 1,000 BTC (equivalent to over $4 million at the time) so he could buy other digital assets. The investment, though, did not turn profitable, and Tai suggested he had become a victim of a fraudulent scheme. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He assembled a gang in an attempt to retrieve his funds, using sophisticated methods to track Nguyen&#8217;s location. The team also hired a van, purchased weapons, and kidnapped the target at gunpoint.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The criminals ordered the victim&#8217;s brother to transfer the original amount of 1,000 BTC to Tai&#8217;s wallet, but he could not provide the entire amount. Once restoring $1.5 million in bitcoin, they abandoned the man in the city of Thu Duc: not far from Ho Chi Minh City. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Vietnamese police, though, were quick to detect the crime and detained the 16 suspects. While Tai initially admitted to running the operation, he later reversed his confession. On the other hand, his associates said they thought they would only collect the debt from the victim and not participate in a kidnapping.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto is still in its early days and needs comprehensive regulations to prosper, Managing Director Staub argued.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Christian Staub &#8211; Managing Director for Fidelity International&#8217;s business in Europe &#8211; said the investment giant intends to remain part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, he added that it will not urge people to buy bitcoin due to its &#8220;volatile and nascent&#8221; nature. The lack of pertinent regulation in the space is another present obstacle for the firm.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto to Become &#8216;More Sophisticated&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The multinational investment firm that has introduced several cryptocurrency opportunities to clients over the past few years will most likely remain committed to the asset class. In a recent <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/amp/articles/fidelity-still-cautious-on-crypto-were-not-pounding-the-table-telling-everyone-to-buy-bitcoin-20230517" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">interview</a>, Managing Director Staub assured the organization will keep enabling access to crypto to interested customers. On the other hand, he said Fidelity will not &#8220;pound the table telling everyone to buy bitcoin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While Staub expects to see the industry &#8220;more sophisticated&#8221; in the years to come, he warned that it is still in its early days, meaning investors should be ready for enhanced volatility. Another existent setback is the absence of appropriate rules in the space:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We expect this asset class to become more sophisticated, but due to their nascent nature, digital assets are still lightly regulated. Over time, regulatory coherence should act as an enabler of digital asset adoption.&#8221;<br />
</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 16px;">Staub thinks it is hard to forecast which digital assets will stand the test of time and overcome the current uncertainty:</span><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to predict which coins — even the credible ones — will do well. As a traditional financial institution, we want to stay on top of this topic and educate, but we need to be careful about coming out with products,&#8221; he said.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, he stressed that crypto is a &#8220;critical topic&#8221; for Fidelity and that the company will stay at the forefront when the sector unleashes its potential. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fidelity: a Crypto Participant for Almost a Decade</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity made its first steps in the sector in 2014 when it started researching cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It doubled down four years later by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/10/15/fidelity-launches-institutional-platform-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">establishing</a> its subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of its most significant moves in the space happened last spring when it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-to-allow-investors-to-add-bitcoin-to-retirement-401k-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allowed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> investors to add bitcoin to their 401(k) retirement accounts. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has been stuck in a range in the last few days following a rejection from the $30K resistance level. There are various points for market participants to look forward to in the short term.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has been consolidating in a very tight range over the last week. This comes after the $30K resistance level rejected the market to the downside. The 50-day moving average was also broken down around the $29K mark.</p>
<p>Currently, the most probable target is $25Kl. Yet, the price could retest the 50-day moving average first before continuing lower toward that level.</p>
<p>The RSI is also trending below the 50% threshold, pointing to the current dominance of sellers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251566" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-251566 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_2005231" width="2560" height="1441" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-2048x1153.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-20-2023-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251566" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price has been struggling to break back above $27,500 over the last few days, following multiple attempts that resulted in a rejection.</p>
<p>As things stand, the lower boundary of the large flag pattern could be tested soon. On the other hand, if the price finally climbs above the $27,500 level, a rally towards the higher trendline of the pattern could be expected.</p>
<p>The RSI is offering little clue on this timeframe, as it has been running relatively flat, around the 50% mark.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<h3>Bitcoin Miners Position Index</h3>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been recovering since the beginning of the year, following a gruesome bear market in 2022. The main question now is if the bear market is really over. Will there be more downtrends to come before the next cycle begins?</p>
<p>This chart demonstrates the miner&#8217;s position index, which is the ratio of total miner outflow to its one-year moving average of total miner outflow. High values are interpreted as miners selling their coins aggressively.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, there have been multiple peaks in this metric, indicating that the miners are using the recent price rally to offload massive amounts of BTC, potentially to cover their costs.</p>
<p>This could point to their pessimism about the short-term future of BTC&#8217;s price and could also trigger a sell-off if things remain the same. Therefore, while the price has rebounded substantially over the past few months, investors should be wary as there are negative signals shown by some on-chain metrics.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a turbulent few weeks in the meme coin market, with coins like Pepe, Wojak, and MIlady seeing huge price pumps before crashing, with most of these and similar tokens currently on a downturn.</p>
<p>However, meme coin season certainly isn’t over, with other tokens still showing strong growth. Here are 5 of the most promising meme coins to watch right now.</p>
<h2><strong>Copium (COPIUM)</strong></h2>
<p>COPIUM is a brand new straight-to-DEX meme coin that has just launched on Uniswap and has already seen huge interest in the community.</p>
<p>The token has attracted more than $40 million in trading volume in less than 24 hours since it was made available and is currently 400% up over its launch price, as shown on Dextools.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251553" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="287" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>COPIUM has also seen major players and whales from Web3 declare their interest in the project. FaZe Banks, a popular YouTuber and one of the founders of FaZe Clan, told his 3 million Instagram follwers that having sold his initial stake, he is now all in on the project.</p>
<p>Copium has also drawn interest because of its robust tokenomics, hyped invite-only presale, and NFT drop &#8211; as well as its fair launch that allowed those who missed the presale to avoid being dumped on.</p>
<p>Presale investors only had 10% of their tokens immediately released to them, with the remaining 90% released linearly over the next three weeks. The presale sold 30% of the small 1 billion supply, and the developers only kept a meme-worthy 0.69% for themselves &#8211; avoiding any talk of a rug pull.</p>
<p>The NFT collection has not yet been revealed but has already attracted 30 ETH of volume on OpenSea, with the majority of those who were airdropped holding until after reveal.</p>
<p>With huge volume and community interest, major exchange listings are expected in the very near future, which should see the price soar even further.</p>

<h2><strong>AiDoge (AI)</strong></h2>
<p>AiDoge (AI) best captures two of the hottest investment trends of the year &#8211; artificial intelligence and memes.</p>
<p>The token, which is still in its presale stage, has already raised more than $9.5 million from interest buyers in just over three weeks. Unlike other coins, AI isn’t only speculative but offers actual utility by powering the AiDoge platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251554" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="324" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-300x161.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Specifically, AI lets holders purchase credits from the AiDoge meme generation platform to generate viral memes. The platform does this using a combination of powerful artificial intelligence, machine learning, and a dataset of images and crypto-related news. When users provide a text-based prompt, the platform will automatically generate a meme based on the prompt.</p>
<p>Over time the AI also learns which memes have more success of going viral and applies that knowledge to its future creations, while users are able to earn AI tokens as a reward for the best creations, with other users upvoting and downvoting them.</p>
<p>Holders can also choose to stake their AI tokens to earn credits gradually over time rather than redeeming them outright. Done en masse, staking can encourage a lockup of AI that helps pump its price over time.</p>
<p>AI can currently be bought for $0.0000312, but its cost is going up fast. The token will ultimately be listed for $0.0000336 and is expected to see huge interest when it reaches the wider market.</p>

<h2><strong>Love Hate Inu (LHINU)</strong></h2>
<p>The next meme coin on our list is Love Hate Inu (LHINU), the native token of a new vote-to-earn cryptocurrency platform. By staking LHINU, the native token, users can access voting rights on online meme polls.</p>
<p>The platform rewards users each time they take part on the meme polls by distributing free LHINU tokens. One can also access the ecosystem’s vote submission platform to submit poll ideas and host their own polls.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251555" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="294" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Before voting on the platform, users will be required to stake tokens for a minimum of 30 days. Love Hate Inu also uses a real-time staking mechanism to prevent any fraud in the voting process and keep the user’s funds safe.</p>
<p>LHINU recently completed its cryptocurrency presale and managed to raise more than $10 million. From a total supply of 100 billion, 90 billion tokens were allocated for the presale round.</p>
<p>On May 19th, LHINU conducted its initial exchange offering on OKX and Huobi exchange. After listing at $0.000145 per token, the price has soared to $0.000276 per token. This equates to a price jump of more than 90%, with some crypto analysts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8TKsIUlMrU" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">backing it to 10x</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bs_c828361b.cryptopotato.care/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Visit Love Hate Inu</strong></a></p>
<h2><strong>Generational Wealth (GEN)</strong></h2>
<p>Generational Wealth (GEN) has been one of the top performing coins in the whole space since its launch on May 15 and is currently up more than 600%.</p>
<p>However, that price follows a big dip, with GEN having been up as much as 1,500% from its initial price &#8211; which could mean a good time to buy if the project gains momentum again.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251556" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="239" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-300x119.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The project is based on the popular ‘Chad’ meme and, unlike some other meme coin projects, does have a roadmap and some plans for the future.</p>
<p>The website claims that, along with merchandise and rewards for meme creators, it will launch an exchange, host events for the community, and also mentions a gym &#8211; although further details are unclear.</p>
<p>The project has quickly risen to a market cap of more than $12 million and with volume over $30 million, which has continued to increase in the last couple of days.</p>
<p>It is also already listed on centralized exchanges such as LBank and BitForex and is believed to be working on more for the coming days and weeks.</p>
<h2><strong style="font-size: 24px;">MongCoin (MONG)</strong></h2>
<p>For its relatively small market cap, MongCoin (MONG)’s trading volume is incredibly high, generating $51 million in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>That trails only Dogecoin, Pepe and Shiba Inu &#8211; the three top meme coins in the space by market cap.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251557" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="259" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-300x129.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-50x22.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Its price has been surging but, in the last couple of days, has dipped, meaning it could be a good opportunity to buy in. It is currently up 64% in seven days but is down more than 28% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>MongCoin launched in late April 2023, taking off as one of many memecoin alongside Pepe, Wojak, and others. It&#8217;s technically a spinoff of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/80000-roi-mongoose-coin-mong-was-created-as-rep-sherman-mentioned-it-on-congerssional-hearing/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mongoose Coin</a>, which was coined after the incoherent ramblings of crypto skeptic and congressman Brad Sherman in December 2021.</p>
<p>Sherman has taken a front seat during congressional hearings lately to discuss the vices of crypto. Some clips of his have been making the rounds on crypto Twitter, where he criticizes “billionaire crypto bros” for printing their own money and defends the Federal Reserve’s right to do the same.</p>
<p>Having become something of a popular meme himself, there’s a good chance that memes around Sherman – and MongCoin – aren’t quite dead yet. If more make the rounds, they might prompt another rally for this token and others like it!</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Despite being the so-called “king of Defi”, Ethereum’s structure isn’t exactly optimized for building and scaling financial applications. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the slew of smart contract hacks that netted attackers over $3 billion in 2022 has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that decentralized finance (DeFi) is still an immature industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides exploits, DeFi still faces scaling issues related to the computational power needed to power complex transactions, and the throughput needed to support the worldwide financial system in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the current king of DeFi, the Ethereum network is worth assessing to identify the problems and limitations contributing to the industry’s current roadblocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Consensus 2023, CryptoPotato sat down with Piers Ridyard – CEO of RDX Works – to discuss ways in which Ethereum is not truly optimized for DeFi. He explained some of the better-suited technology underlying modern blockchains, including the newly popular smart contract platform Radix. </span></p>
<h2>Ethereum’s Clunky Programming Language</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ridyard, DeFi in crypto is currently lacking in three major areas: user experience, developer experience, and scalability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first two issues largely stem from the less-than-ideal programming languages for developers to express their ideas for particular financial applications. One such language, he said, is Ethereum’s Solidity. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Solidity is like banging your head against a brick wall,” he stated. “If you want to build assets that are highly secure and you want to build financial applications that are highly secure, it&#8217;s basically impossible to make it secure in a way that is easy for developers to use.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridyard’s company RDX Works is a core developer for Radix – a DeFi-focused blockchain whose native token, XRD, roared upwards by over 200% from early to mid-April. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_250469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-250469" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1.jpeg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-250469 size-large" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1-239x239.jpeg 239w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1-50x50.jpeg 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1-45x45.jpeg 45w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chart-1.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-250469" class="wp-caption-text">XRD / USD. Source: CoinGecko</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Ethereum and other chains, Radix uses a unique programming language called Scrypto, which is specifically focused on making financial applications easier to build and use. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underneath Scrypto is the Radix engine which includes primitives that are part of the ledger itself, providing the essential building blocks for developers to build apps without having to start complex development from scratch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are not creating your own smart contract that then defines what it means to be a token, what it means to be a token transfer and tracking balances,” said Ridyard. “All of that is done by the ledger itself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Radix engine also protects applications on the platform from “reentrancy attacks,&#8221;  a common DeFi loophole that lets a hacker continually withdraw from a smart contract until the victim goes bankrupt. Specifically, the engine prevents infinite callbacks that lead to recursive loops which let hackers drain a contract to zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the DeFi protocol dforce </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/defi-protocol-dforce-loses-3-6m-in-reentrancy-attack/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $3.6 million to such a bug. “A whole host of maybe half a billion dollars worth of hacks that have just been from reentrancy disappear just because of how we&#8217;ve implemented the architecture,” said Ridyard. </span></p>
<h2>Ethereum’s Consensus Mechanism</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum’s “</span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-post-merge-over-100k-coins-eliminated-from-eths-supply/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” upgrade in September – which changed its consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake – was widely praised as the greatest technical feat in the history of crypto. However, in 2023, even proof of stake may be proving less advanced of a mechanism than what newer chains can offer – especially on the scalability front. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Ethereum doesn’t allow for the parallel execution of transactions that would enable massive throughput. All transactions must be ordered, even if they are unrelated to each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, Radix uses the “Cerberus” consensus mechanism, which obviates the need for ordering. “They can start and end whenever they need to start and end, and you don&#8217;t need to agree between them which one came first and which one came second,” said Ridyard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radix still comes baked in with a delegated proof of stake system that protects Cerberus. However, Ridyard doesn’t consider either proof of work or proof of stake to be “consensus mechanisms,” but rather “civil protection mechanisms.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A consensus mechanism, is how do the nodes come to an agreement. The civil mechanism is about, how do you defend those nodes from being maliciously attacked in the process of coming to an agreement,” he elaborated. </span></p></blockquote>
<figure style="width: 4032px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/693983534737522688/1101160934787002438/20230426_134030.jpg" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/693983534737522688/1101160934787002438/20230426_134030.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="2268" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Piers Ridyard (Right)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridyard said he admired proof of stake for its energy efficiency, but noted that proof of work chains – like Bitcoin – solve certain “bootstrapping” and “randomization” problems. </span></p>
<h2>DeFi and the SEC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides technological limitations, DeFi and the blockchains underpinning it are currently under immense regulatory pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency currently </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-seeks-to-regulate-dexs-under-existing-exchange-laws-crypto-mom-responds/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to regulate DeFi exchanges under existing securities exchange laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Ridyard sees a possibility that regulators “kill” DeFi in America for a period, he doesn’t envision the industry dying globally due to the overwhelming benefit it can provide certain economies. Ultimately, he believes “reading the tea leaves” of how regulators will interpret certain enforcement rules is a bit of a distraction, and that DeFi will ultimately adapt to best conform to each country’s political and economic will. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the regulators are trying to do is find the handles in which they can exercise enforcement against what the government and by and large, what the voting public could consider to be the things they want and they don&#8217;t,” he said. &#8220;There is going to be some give and take.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[The CBDC platform will let users mint, manage, transact as well as redeem CBDCs and stablecoins.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ramping up its CBDC game, Ripple announced the launch of a new platform for central banks, governments, and financial institutions to issue their own central bank digital currency.</p>
<p>Dubbed &#8216;Ripple CBDC Platform,&#8217; the offering will leverage the same blockchain technology used on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The platform is developed to address multiple use cases, such as wholesale and retail CBDCs on a private ledger or issuing a stablecoin.</p>
<h2>Ripple CBDC Platform</h2>
<p>According to the San Francisco-based blockchain company, the aim is to &#8220;holistically manage and customize the entire life cycle of fiat-based central bank digital currency, transaction, and distribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the development, James Wallis, Ripple&#8217;s VP of Central Bank Engagements &amp; CBDCs, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230518005115/en/Ripple-Launches-CBDC-Platform-for-the-Development-of-CBDCs-and-Stablecoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a trusted partner to several central banks, we believe this platform will help solve problems for many central banks and governments who are devising plans and developing a technology strategy for CBDC Implementations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The exec added that innovative capabilities of the platform are expected to help facilitate instant settlement of both domestic and cross-border payments, mitigate risk vectors, and enhance the user experience of sending and receiving digital currency on either side of a transaction.</p>
<p>As part of its global push for its CBDC platform, Ripple has onboarded the Republic of Palau to develop the country&#8217;s national digital currency on it. Surangel Whipps Jr, President of the Republic of Palau, commented,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Partnering with Ripple to help create our national digital currency is part of our commitment to lead in financial innovation and technologies, which will provide the citizens of Palau with greater financial access.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Palau&#8217;s and Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/featured/republic-of-palau-partners-with-ripple-to-develop-digital-currency-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">partnership</a> dates back to November 2021, when the two parties announced teaming up to focus on developing strategies for cross-border payments and a USD-backed digital currency for the island nation.</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s Participation in Digital Hong Kong Dollar</h2>
<p>In a parallel announcement, Ripple said it will demonstrate the use case for its CBDC platform through the inaugural e-HKD Pilot Programme led by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). It is also working with Taiwan&#8217;s Fubon Bank to build a product for real estate asset tokenization and equity distribution under the e-HKD pilot.</p>
<p>The company has teamed up with Taiwan&#8217;s Fubon Bank to develop a product under the pilot program, with a focus on real estate asset tokenization and equity release leveraging the e-HKD.</p>
<p>XRP&#8217;s price remains trending upwards and has maintained its gains in an otherwise choppy market that has remained mostly flat over the past 24 hours.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SingularityNET (AGIX) has found a place within the top 100 alts following a 15% daily surge. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aside from a brief pump and dump of around $500 yesterday, bitcoin has remained relatively stagnant at just under $27,000.</p>
<p>Although generally more volatile by nature, the altcoins have also failed to produce any significant moves in the past day. Injective is among the few exceptions.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Stalls Below $27K</h2>
<p>After the enhanced volatility at the end of last week, which resulted in BTC dumping to a two-month low of under $26,000, the cryptocurrency has been trading with a lot fewer fluctuations. Last weekend was predominantly calmer as the asset recovered some losses and spent it around $27,000.</p>
<p>Monday saw a price jump to just over $27,600, but that was short-lived. A day later, bitcoin dropped by over a grand. However, it initiated <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-pushes-past-27k-render-rndr-explodes-20-daily-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">another leg-up</a> that was stopped at $27,500. This time, the rejection was even more violent and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-defies-market-sentiment-with-3-increase-btc-drops-below-27k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">pushed</a> the asset south to under $26,400.</p>
<p>The bulls intercepted the move and didn&#8217;t allow any further declines. They recovered some ground and bitcoin returned to familiar ground at around $27,000 once again. It briefly pumped and dumped yesterday but overall has remained stuck at its current position.</p>
<p>As such, its market cap still stands at $520 billion, and its dominance over the alts is at 46.3%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251535" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSD-19.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251535" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSD-19.png" alt="BTCUSD.

<h2>INJ Shoots Up 20% Weekly</h2>
<p>Similar to bitcoin, most altcoins have also remained stagnant on a daily scale. ETH was close to dumping below $1,800 yesterday, but it has managed to defend that level and currently sits inches above it.</p>
<p>Binance Coin has slipped below $310 after a minor daily decline. Dogecoin, Polygon, Polkadot, Ripple, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche are also slightly in the red.</p>
<p>Cardano, Solana, and Litecoin have dropped a bit more today, with losses of up to 2%.</p>
<p>In contrast, AGIX has entered the top 100 after a massive 15% daily surge. KAVA and INJ follow in terms of daily gains &#8211; 7% each. Moreover, INJ is up by 20% for the past seven days.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap, though, is stuck at just over $1.120 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Strike now supports India, New Zealand, Guatemala, Honduras, and over 40 more countries. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strike – a Bitcoin payments company and remittance app – announced Friday that it is now available for download to over 3 billion people worldwide, including dozens of new countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The international expansion will allow wallet users in India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and other countries to remit payments to one another in both USD and BTC. </span></p>
<h2>Targeting the Global South</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, Strike CEO Jack Mallers </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qRWurFaUD0&amp;ab_channel=BitcoinMagazine" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the company’s expansion efforts were primarily targeted toward those that needed better payment tools and technology the most. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a lot of the global south,” said Mallers. “The global south has a lot to do with Bitcoin – they have a lot to say for where the world is going.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An inexhaustive list of 47 supported countries presented during Mallers’ presentation included Bhutan, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Kenya, New Zealand, Paraguay, and Uganda, alongside formerly announced expansions like </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/strike-brings-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-to-argentina/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argentina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Nigeria, Kenya, and </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/strike-brings-lightning-based-remittance-payments-to-africa/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ghana</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within those countries, Strike leverages the Bitcoin lightning network to enable fast and immediate Bitcoin and dollar-based remittances worldwide. Lightning is a layer 2 network that bypasses the fees of Bitcoin’s base chain, which can </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-fees-explode-amid-brc-20-memecoin-mania-miners-benefit/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to levels that make small transactions infeasible when placed under stress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Global outreach for Strike was a two-and-a-half-year effort, which partly involved working with regulators in El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office to create a licensing structure for Bitcoin companies to legally operate. The nation was the first besides the United States to support Strike, and is now home to the headquarters of Mallers’ company E4. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maller stressed the importance of giving the global south access to a “money app,” rather than an existing “exchange” like Binance, FTX, or Coinbase, which encourages “speculative gambling.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We wanna compete with Binance,” said Mallers. “We know that the 3 billion people we’re serving – they got their first experience and their first Bitcoin from FTX, from Binance, from a lot of these exchanges that haven’t been totally proven to be trustworthy.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strike also now supports Lightning Address, which lets users set up an email-like identifier for sending them Bitcoin over lightning, rather than using a QR code.</span></p>
<h2>Strike’s Previous Announcements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Announcements at the Bitcoin conference have become something of a tradition for Mallers: In June 2021, he announced that El Salvador would make Bitcoin legal tender, which was an international first at the time. </span></p>
