<ul>
<li>Joe Biden takes a swipe at cryptocurrency traders and “wealthy tax cheats”, insisting they remain undeserving of tax cuts and similar benefits.</li>



<li>The comments have drawn speculations among industry executives on the stance of the White House as budget negotiations resumed on May 22.</li>



<li>Joe Biden reiterated his commitment to ensuring the country does not default on its debt to prevent a looming economic meltdown.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The Biden administration has maintained a tough stance against digital assets over the years. The first blow landed on miners and then traders. How far will the administration stretch this anti-crypto rhetoric?</p>



<p>Joe Biden <a href="https://zycrypto.com/biden-throws-crypto-traders-under-the-bus-in-debt-deal/">criticized</a> digital asset traders and <em>wealthy tax cheats</em> as he wrapped up the G7 summit in Japan. Speaking at a press conference, the President insisted that these crypto traders are not worthy beneficiaries of the tax cuts proposed by Republicans.</p>



<p><em>“Let me be clear, I&#8217;m not going to agree to&#8230; a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly 1 million Americans,&#8221; </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“It&#8217;s time for Republicans to accept that there&#8217;s no bipartisan deal to be made solely on their partisan terms,</em>&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Strong indicators have been that some Republicans are pushing to support “<em>tax loopholes” </em>to aid digital asset investors, including miners. In Biden’s $6.9 billion budget plan, the President has stressed the importance of restructuring the rules relating to digital assets to protect Americans.</p>



<p>The comments come in as budget negotiations intensify ahead of the United States deadline to raise the debt ceiling or risk defaulting on her debts for the first time. Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin Macarthy agreed to resume negotiations on Sunday to prevent an “<em>economic catastrophe as few as 11 days away.&#8221;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dame-tax-is-only-the-first-kick">DAME Tax is only the first kick</h2>



<p>This year, the White House <a href="https://zycrypto.com/white-house-makes-case-for-30-crypto-mining-tax-cites-economic-and-energy-factors-as-key-drive-behind-policy/">released</a> a proposed 30% tax on digital asset miners coupled with a report justifying its position. The administration based the decision on the amount of energy consumed in mining digital assets adding that it creates a hardship for American communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others. It encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,”</em> the report reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposed DAME tax will come into effect in 2024 and will require miners to pay a 10% tax before it grows to 30% in subsequent years. The digital asset community has criticized this move as an attempt to stifle the growth of the sector with many saying the administration has “<em>misplaced priorities.”</em></p>



<p>With the President&#8217;s recent comments, many wonder where the line will be drawn after proposing new regulations, miners&#8217; and trader&#8217;s taxes, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol, Uniswap, has announced its decision to expand its operations onto the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polkadot-tops-rivals-in-developer-activity-following-influx-from-solana/">Polkadot network</a> via the &#8220;Moonbeam&#8221; parachain in a momentous move that promises to revolutionize the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene. This strategic choice could usher in a new era of cross-chain liquidity, improving the DeFi ecosystem&#8217;s effectiveness and scalability.</p>



<p>Uniswap hopes to take advantage of the special features and interoperability provided by Polkadot by utilizing the Moonbeam parachain, thereby providing seamless connectivity with other blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem. The announcement has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community, with industry experts applauding Uniswap&#8217;s pioneering decision. This strategic move is expected to bring about a myriad of benefits, including increased liquidity, reduced transaction costs, enhanced scalability, and improved overall user experience within the DeFi space.</p>



<p>With Uniswap&#8217;s connection with Polkadot through Moonbeam, users can transact assets between blockchains without difficulty. The limits now imposed by segregated blockchains are eliminated by this interoperability, enabling users to access a larger pool of assets and trading opportunities.</p>



<p>Decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts can be created more easily because of the developer-friendly environment offered by the Moonbeam parachain, based on the Polkadot network. When Uniswap uses the Moonbeam parachain, it has access to Polkadot&#8217;s robust infrastructure, security features, and scalability solutions, all of which strengthen and improve the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>The move further emphasizes the rising significance of cross-chain solutions and interoperability within the blockchain sector. Bridging the gap between various blockchains is becoming increasingly crucial for realizing the full promise of decentralized finance as the crypto industry continues to develop and mature. Adding Polkadot to Uniswap establishes a precedent for other DeFi protocols and initiatives, inspiring them to investigate cross-chain partnerships and capitalize on interoperability.</p>



<p>Users can anticipate the exciting potential for smooth asset transfers, effective cross-chain liquidity provision, and cutting-edge financial products thanks to Uniswap&#8217;s participation in the Polkadot network. The adoption of cutting-edge protocols on well-known blockchain networks like Polkadot lays the door for a more integrated and vibrant ecosystem as the DeFi market expands and changes.</p>



<p>Finally, Uniswap&#8217;s plan to expand its company to Polkadot via the Moonbeam parachain is a huge step forward in the evolution of decentralized finance. Uniswap is leading a new wave of innovation in the DeFi industry by embracing interoperability and cross-chain liquidity. The partnership between Uniswap, Polkadot, and Moonbeam has the potential to reshape the future of decentralized finance, unlocking unmatched opportunities for users and catapulting the industry to greater heights as the market eagerly awaits the implementation of this ground-breaking move.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-expands-into-the-institutional-crypto-custody-market-following-250-million-acquisition-of-metaco/">cryptocurrency market</a> has continued to face a period of cautious sentiment as historically low levels of weekly trading volume persist this quarter.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has remained stagnant, trapped within a tight range that started on May 11. This lack of volatility has extended to Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, contributing to overall market weakness. However, despite these prevailing market conditions, Bitcoin enthusiasts have keenly watched various pivotal developments that could potentially shake up the market.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, May 23, renowned onchain analyst Onchain Edge highlighted an intriguing insight for traders from the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). According to the former Ernest &amp; Young (EY) analyst, aSOPR (30DMA) has surged above 1.0 and is retesting the area, signalling a potential bull run.</p>



<p>As ZyCrypto previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-kicks-off-march-in-the-green-as-crypto-markets-see-favorable-capital-inflows/">reported</a>, this indicator has historically proved efficient, with price rallying after the ratio moves above the 1.0 mark and vice versa. According to the pundit, Bitcoin could face a major bull run, akin to the 2020 and 2021 ones, if this ratio stays atop that level.</p>



<p><em>“Want to know when to buy or sell Bitcoin? When aSOPR (30DMA) is above 1.0, it signals a profitable &amp; strong market. Now the aSOPR is at another critical support level at 1.01. This was the level from which BTC started the 2020/21 rally.”</em> Tweeted Onchain Edge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="630" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1024x630.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81244" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1024x630.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-300x185.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-768x473.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1536x946.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-356x220.png 356w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Elsewhere Glassnode, another data analysis firm, likewise shared insight into the ongoing decline of the Bitcoin balance on exchanges. As per the firm, the current epoch has recorded a decline of -680K BTC. This represents a 28% decline from its peak of 3.2M BTC at its peak in 2020 to the current balance of 2.3M BTC. It is important to note that when Bitcoin leaves exchanges, it reduces the likelihood, which, in turn, may contribute to upward price pressure as the scarcity of available Bitcoin increases.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, various industry experts have also begun speculating that Bitcoin may have reached a bottom. Rekt Capital, a well-known figure in the crypto space, highlighted the formation of an &#8220;exaggerated&#8221; bullish divergence on the Daily RSI (Relative Strength Index). According to him, this potentially positive sign hints at the possibility of upside movement.</p>



<p><em>“A potentially positive sign for some upside movement, however important to realize that the key resistance to beat is $27,600,”</em> he tweeted.</p>



<p>Material Indicators, another onchain analyst termed the ongoing sideways movement by BTC a “healthy consolidation”, which he noted strengthens the current zone as a key resistance/support area. He went on to highlight the importance of the 100-Day MA holding as strong support while cautioning that breaking the 200-Week MA could pose difficulties in reclaiming previous levels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81245" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, as the crypto community eagerly awaits the market&#8217;s next move, all eyes are on Bitcoin&#8217;s price action and its ability to stand its ground against bearish pressures. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,178, up roughly 1.65% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Prominent speechwriter and Forbes contributor Sam Lyman believes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may have underestimated the challenges it would face in its legal battle against Ripple. The pundit made his observations known on Sunday, May 21, after tweeting that <em>“the SEC may have bitten off more than it can chew in its campaign against XRP.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>His statement comes in light of an article he recently published on Forbes discussing how the &#8220;ripple effects&#8221; from the lawsuit could benefit not just the XRP Army but also Coinbase and the industry as a whole.</p>



<p>Led by Chair Gary Gensler, SEC’s attempts to classify digital assets as securities have faced unexpected opposition from its past statements and internal documents, which now have to be made public due to a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">recent court ruling</a>. In his article, Lyman suggested that releasing the Hinman documents, which the SEC wanted to keep hidden, could strengthen Ripple&#8217;s case by revealing that even SEC staff believed XRP should not be considered a security.</p>



<p><em>“The documents are likely to reveal dissenting opinions within the agency’s own ranks as to which cryptocurrencies are securities and why. And by so doing, they are likely to bolster Ripple’s case,” </em>wrote Lyman.</p>



<p>The pundit further noted that if the Hinman documents provide more evidence of internal communications contradicting the SEC&#8217;s current position on digital asset regulation, it could create significant obstacles for the agency&#8217;s case and reputation. Additionally, it would bolster Ripple&#8217;s argument that the absence of regulatory clarity hindered their understanding of legal boundaries in the industry.</p>



<p>Lyman further noted that the implications of the Hinman documents extend beyond the XRP lawsuit and could impact Coinbase&#8217;s position in future litigation against the SEC. According to him, the SEC&#8217;s approval of Coinbase&#8217;s IPO, despite their listing of assets similar to XRP without a broker-dealer license, raises doubts about the agency&#8217;s position. To this end, he noted that the documents in question could provide insight into whether the SEC considered these assets unregistered securities or if investor protection was overlooked.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, outspoken pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton expressed his agreement with Layman&#8217;s views, stating that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-and-sec-request-additional-time-to-disclose-hinman-files-is-a-settlement-looming/">the lawsuit</a> was not solely about enforcing U.S. securities laws but seemed to have other underlying motives.</p>



<p>“<em>The lawsuit was NOT only about enforcing U.S. Securities laws. If it was, the case would have been limited to specific sales made by Ripple and it would’ve settled by now. The lawsuit was used as a weapon with bad motive,”</em> tweeted Deaton.</p>



<p>The lawyer also hailed the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-coinbase-asks-court-for-permission-to-support-ripple/">unexpected support</a> Ripple received from the XRP community, expressing confidence in a win due to their collective efforts. That said, as the XRP lawsuit progresses and the Hinman documents come to light, the crypto industry eagerly awaits the potential outcomes that could shape the future regulatory landscape.</p>

<p>On May 17th, Ripple, the company behind XRP, announced the acquisition of Metaco, a Swiss provider of digital asset custody and tokenization technology. The move is one step forward in the company’s intention to enter the cryptocurrency custody market.</p>



<p>According to Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-takes-on-the-crypto-custody-market-with-metaco/">statement</a>, this acquisition will allow them to expand their business offering by providing customers with the ability to custody, issue, and settle tokenized assets.</p>



<p>Both companies have a strong and recognized track record in the cryptocurrency industry, so their union will facilitate the growing institutional demand, creating secure high-level business solutions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-wants-to-enter-the-institutional-cryptocurrency-custody-market"><strong>Ripple wants to enter the institutional cryptocurrency custody market</strong></h2>



<p>Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said that the acquisition of Metaco, a leading company in institutional digital asset custody, is a milestone in achieving their global expansion goals.</p>



<p><em>“Through our strong financial position, Ripple will continue to leverage our advantage in critical areas of crypto infrastructure. The addition of Metaco is a significant step for our expanding product suite and global footprint.”</em></p>



<p>Sagar Shah, Head of Custody at Ripple, stated that the company considers Metaco as the perfect partner due to their technology, market fit, customer base, and exceptional team. He further added that Ripple is excited to support Metaco in delivering &#8220;high-quality products and services&#8221; while enabling faster and more efficient business growth.</p>



<p><em>“Metaco&#8217;s technology, product-market fit, customer base, and exceptional team make them the perfect partner for Ripple as we aim to provide essential crypto infrastructure to enterprises.”</em></p>



<p>Adrien Treccani, founder and CEO of Metaco, affirmed that the alliance with Ripple would allow Metaco to thrive in the digital asset economy by providing greater value to their customers, and leveraging Ripple&#8217;s market scale and strength.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Metaco offers tools for tokenization and custody infrastructure</strong></h2>



<p>Metaco is a company known for its secure and versatile custody infrastructure, with its “Harmonize” solution being the preferred choice of institutional clients for digital asset custody.</p>



<p>Metaco&#8217;s technological solutions are available in various jurisdictions worldwide, including Switzerland, Germany, Turkey, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, among others.</p>



<p>Therefore, the acquisition of Metaco could help Ripple achieve faster global commercial growth, offering new services to its customers while maintaining its leadership in enterprise cryptocurrency solutions.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, Ripple recently achieved a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">victory</a> as a court denied the SEC&#8217;s request to prevent them from being compelled to disclose documents in which their former executive explained why he believed Ethereum was not a security. This could strengthen their argument that XRP meets the same criteria as ETH, providing a strong basis for their victory. XRP experienced a percentage increase following the publication of this news.</p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s new management, led by CEO John J. Ray III, is considering a rebirth of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defunct crypto exchange, according to the latest legal billings.</p>



<p>The new CEO reportedly spent several hours last month examining and working on what seems to be FTX 2.0 materials.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ftx-2-0-latest-court-filings-hint-there-is-work-underway-to-reboot-collapsed-crypto-giant"><strong>FTX 2.0: Latest Court Filings Hint There Is Work Underway To Reboot Collapsed Crypto Giant</strong></h2>



<p>The FTX crypto enterprise<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-top-exec-makes-surprising-offer-to-ftx-employees-as-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/"> filed for bankruptcy</a> last November, shocking the global crypto markets, with its founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sam-bankman-fried-blames-crypto-winter-for-ftx-collapse-in-attempt-to-dodge-most-fraud-charges/">facing </a>fraud charges in the United States.</p>



<p>Now, the struggling crypto exchange is considering reopening at some point in the future.</p>



<p>The monthly staffing report and compensation details for the new CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, shows that during this time, he engaged in a series of activities that might enable the reboot of the cryptocurrency trading platform.</p>



<p>Ray first <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ftx-chief-says-crypto-exchange-could-restart-11674143168">floated </a>the idea of restarting FTX in January this year. “Everything is on the table. If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it,” Ray posited. At the time, there were reports that the failed exchange had uncovered and retrieved $5.5 billion in liquid assets and that Ray was working with creditors on a potential revival plan. Then last month, another report said FTX had recovered $7.3 billion in assets and was thus considering reviving its crypto exchange operations sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p>



<p>The new court documents indicate that a reboot plan is indeed in the works. In the “Summary of Time and Fees by Professional&#8221;, Ray charged $1,040 for less than an hour of work to &#8220;Review and finalize 2.0 reboot of exchange material for distribution” to investors. These included seeking help from cybersecurity firm Sygnia to improve the security of the crypto exchange, as well as analyzing a term sheet for restructuring the company as part of the plan.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fresh Capital Injection Needed</strong></h2>



<p>In April, FTX&#8217;s lead attorney Andy Dietderich also advocated for an FTX reboot. According to Dietderich, restarting the exchange would require substantial capital, regardless of whether it would offer services to only U.S.-based customers or operate internationally.</p>



<p>The latest court filings suggest FTX will likely be entering a bidding process.</p>



<p>San Francisco-based VC firm Tribe Capital, which was an investor in the exchange before it went under, is allegedly considering leading a fund-raising campaign to jump-start revival efforts. Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-18/ftx-crypto-exchange-restart-plan-draws-interest-from-tribe-capital-vc"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the rebooted exchange would keep the FTX name.</p>



<p>Members of the crypto community have touted the relaunch plan as an opportunity for over a million FTX creditors to be made whole. For one creditor <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1660809999466250242">DegenSpartan</a>, FTX 2.0 “is the most likely path to maximum recovery”.</p>



<p>FTX’s native token, FTT, surged 12.8% on Monday following the news of a potential reboot of the collapsed crypto empire of SBF. At press time, FTT is trading at $1.13, according to CoinGecko. The bankrupt exchange’s token was down 98.68% from its $84.18 all-time high set back in September 2021.</p>

<p>In light of the recent Ledger controversy, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, has shared his perspective on the matter, emphasizing the importance of open-source software, simplicity in design, and honouring security promises.</p>



<p>Ledger is a France-based security firm that specializes in manufacturing crypto storage devices. For most of this week, the firm has come under fire from the crypto community after it deleted a May 17 tweet stating that it was “possible” for Ledger to write firmware that could extract users’ private keys.</p>



<p>The controversy surrounding the matter began on May 16 when the company introduced its latest service, &#8220;Ledger Recover.&#8221; The following day, the firm&#8217;s customer support tweeted, acknowledging that it was “possible” for Ledger to develop firmware capable of extracting users&#8217; private keys. However, the tweet was subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger_Support/status/1659218986314366976">deleted,</a> amplifying the ongoing debate surrounding the topic, particularly because it directly addressed the introduction of the new feature.</p>



<p>The firm team, however, attempted to clarify the situation with Ledger chief technology officer Charles Guillemet emphasizing in a May 18 tweet that Ledger&#8217;s operating system (OS) mandates user consent whenever the OS interacts with a private key. This means that the OS cannot copy the device&#8217;s private key without the explicit consent of the user.</p>



<p>That said, despite the assurances, most people still seem unconvinced, with other observers now offering what they perceive will be a lasting solution to Ledger’s woes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoskinson-s-advice-to-ledger"><strong>Hoskinson&#8217;s Advice to Ledger</strong></h2>



<p>Late Friday, May 19, Hoskinson weighed in on the situation, highlighting key considerations for individuals seeking secure cryptocurrency storage solutions.</p>



<p>Firstly, Hoskinson encouraged the adoption of open-source software that has undergone regular audits by multiple sources. According to him, by choosing such software, users can benefit from enhanced transparency and the collective efforts of the developer community to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>He also emphasized the principle that security often stems from simplicity, asking developers of hardware wallets to “Design the smallest possible footprint” in a bid to minimize attack vectors and potential points of weakness.</p>



<p>Addressing the issue of firmware updates, Hoskinson emphasized the significance of non-updateable firmware in cases where a company explicitly promises a specific security model. While he acknowledges the difficulty of replicating this concept in cryptocurrencies, he suggested that decentralizing the update process could significantly bolster security measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, Hoskinson emphasized the importance of not breaking social contracts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This serves as a reminder for developers and service providers to uphold their promises to users, fostering trust and accountability within the community.</p>



<p>That said, as the Ledger controversy unfolds, the ultimate redemption of the firm&#8217;s reputation hangs in the balance. Nevertheless, on Friday, Éric Larchevêque, Ledger co-founder and CEO, apologized, terming the events as “a total PR failure.” He further requested users to be patient, stating <em>that the meltdown was “absolutely not a technical one.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Some amount of trust must be placed into Ledger to use their product. If you don&#8217;t trust Ledger, meaning you treat your HW manufacturer as an adversary, that can&#8217;t work at all,”</em> he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13ldgcl/my_personal_view_on_the_pr_disaster_from_a_ledger/">wrote</a> on Reddit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dogecoin and Litecoin recorded surging daily transaction volumes for the third consecutive week after marking their Ordinal debuts.&nbsp;</li>



<li>DOGE hit a daily volume of 1.2 million transactions, while LTC hit 584,000, setting a new all-time high for both networks.</li>



<li>Dogecoin bulls are speculating a stellar finish to the year at $0.1, but that remains a long shot even with the integration of Ordinals.</li>
</ul>



<p>Popular among Bitcoin (BTC) users as Ordinals, Dogecoin (DOGE) users have copied the architecture to create Doginals, which has the community all excited with few dissenting voices.</p>



<p>The introduction of Ordinals to Dogecoin and Litecoin has led to surging daily volumes for the third consecutive week. On May 18, transaction volumes on Dogecoin hit a new daily record of 1.2 million, according to <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-ltc-doge-dogecoin.html#3m">data</a> from BitinfoCharts.</p>



<p>Litecoin, on the other hand, has also recorded a volume pump to 584,000 transactions across a 24-hour time frame. Ordinals debuted on Litecoin after Twitter user Indigo Nakamoto promised 5 LTC to anyone who ports the Ordinals to the Litecoin network.</p>



<p>On Feb 19, developer Anthony Guerrero successfully created the Litecoin protocol; similarly, Dogecoin followed suit. Increased network activity began after both networks introduced LRC 20 and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/drc-20-is-it-time-for-dogecoin-to-shine-again-amidst-the-latest-meme-coin-wave/">DRC-20 standard tokens</a>, respectively, enabling users to create meme coins and other “<em>assets” </em>on both networks.</p>



<p>DOGE derived inspiration from Ordinals to create what they term Doginals, driving up network activity just as it did on Bitcoin. Due to surging network activity, gas fees on Bitcoin hit highs not recorded in years, leading to congestion of the mempool.</p>



<p>Before now, daily DOGE transactions averaged between 20,000-25,000 before spiking to 700,000 and now setting a new record above 1 million transactions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doge-bulls-are-ready-to-pounce">DOGE bulls are ready to pounce</h2>



<p>The meme coin started the year recovering from losses recorded in 2022 and is still shy from its all-time high of 2021. Currently exchanging hands at $0.0736, the coin has gained 6.69% this year and is down by 13% from its price in May last year. Despite this slow growth, the community has moved around Doginals with bulls looking to ignite a run hinged on the Ordinal copycat.</p>



<p>Though the majority of users seem united in favor of Doginals, a core developer remains sceptical. Dogecoin developer Patrick Lodder shared his views on Doginals becoming short-lived.</p>



<p>“<em>Something like this cannot become a real ‘feature’ because it has not had enough thought given to it. The sustained and growing pressure on Dogecoin will cause this to die off quickly,” </em>he noted. He further added that the main issue is engineering, and he is yet to “<em>haven’t discovered a good way to program these tokens and give it actual function in a trustless way like you can on an ERC-20 token.”</em></p>

<p>A former executive at Ripple believes that despite the odds tilting in the blockchain payments firm’s favor, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could still win the legal battle. This comes after Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">ruled </a>that William Hinman&#8217;s documents are “judicial documents” subject to a strong presumption of public access and denied the SEC’s motion to keep them hidden.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-sec-could-win"><strong>Why The SEC Could Win</strong></h2>



<p>Recent developments in the XRP lawsuit have made investors and observers confident of Ripple’s victory over SEC.</p>



<p>Ripple has been tied up <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">in a lawsuit</a> with the SEC for over two years after the regulator accused the firm of illegally selling XRP — the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a total market cap of over $23 billion as of Monday — without registering it as a security.</p>



<p>The former Director of Developer Relations at Ripple, Matt Hamilton, remarked that the potential unsealing of the Hinman docs for public access could tip the balance. Hamilton noted that the whole situation “looks pretty bad” for the SEC’s case against Ripple.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In our hearts we all knew this, but alas that doesn’t reflect the vagaries of the US regulatory and legal system. We could still be right, but the SEC could still win the case.</p>&mdash; Matt Hamilton (@HammerToe) <a href="https://twitter.com/HammerToe/status/1660101387567366144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>However, the ex-Ripple official believes the outcome of the lawsuit might not align with many people&#8217;s expectations because of the complexities of the U.S. regulatory and legal system. Hamilton stressed that Ripple might still be right, but there&#8217;s a chance the SEC could emerge victorious.</p>



<p>The Hinman documents pertain to a controversial speech given in June 2018 by the former director of the SEC’s corporation finance division William Hinman. During the speech, Hinman declared that Ether is not a security. These docs contain the SEC’s internal discussions and deliberations encompassing the speech in question.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Could The Lawsuit Finally Be Reaching Its Conclusion?</strong></h2>



<p>While it’s still too early to tell what the ultimate outcome of the case will be, recent findings in court filings cast doubt on whether XRP passes the infamous Howey Test. This means the unsealing of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-good-chance-sec-will-settle-with-ripple-to-avoid-exposing-hinman-documents-says-legal-expert/">Hinman emails</a> could have a major legal impact on Ripple and its long-standing dispute with the SEC.</p>



<p>As the case unfolds, well-known pro-crypto attorney Fred Rispoli suggested that the summary judgment verdict is already written and could be given “any day now”. Rispoli thinks an outright win for either Ripple or the SEC remains low, but the Hinman emails ruling&#8217;s tone appears favourable to the crypto firm.</p>



<p>Echoing Rispoli&#8217;s opinion, XRP holders&#8217; representative John Deaton said during a recent Twitter Space that a pivotal court decision in the XRP suit could come down at any time, but he added that it could take another month or longer.</p>



<p>That being said, if the presiding judge does decide that XRP qualifies as a security, the scope could go beyond XRP to other crypto assets, as it would further establish a precedent for future rulings over other tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As budget negotiations in the US progress, President Joe Biden has made it clear that crypto can wait.</p>



<p>On Sunday, the POTUS did not mince words when addressing budget negotiations during his speech at the G7 summit stating he will not protect wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders. According to the president, he had already met with all four congressional leaders and stressed the need for bipartisan cooperation to move forward prior to departing for the summit.</p>



<p>President Biden had put forth a proposal that exceeds 2 trillion dollars in spending cuts and new revenues in early March before proposing to cut a further $1 trillion in his pursuit of fiscal responsibility. However, he expressed dissatisfaction with various other proposals, such as excess payments to pharmaceutical companies as well as hefty tax breaks for the oil industry and crypto traders, deeming them unacceptable.</p>



<p><em>“Now its time for the other side to move from their extreme positions because much of what they’ve already proposed is simply, quite frankly unacceptable…. I’m not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistants at risk for nearly 1 million Americans,”</em> Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1660225824262434816">said</a> on Sunday.</p>



<p>This statement comes at a time when US regulators are intensifying their scrutiny of the cryptocurrency realm and clearly indicates that the forthcoming debt deal will not safeguard crypto investors within the country. Notably, Biden’s assertions also have the ability to undermine his administration’s efforts to pursue crypto regulations, as he directed in his March 2022 <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-the-whole-bushel-of-bidens-groundbreaking-executive-order-for-cryptocurrencies/">executive order</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while Biden’s proposal underscores his commitment to prioritizing the well-being of ordinary Americans, the crypto community have perceived it as a way of gaining political mileage, given he is seeking re-election next year.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, various US presidential candidates seem to be taking his administration’s outright hostility towards crypto to their advantage, vowing to champion pro-crypto reforms when elected. Earlier this week, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a Democratic presidential candidate, noted that he is committed to upholding people’s right to hold Bitcoin.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Everybody is so passionate about Bitcoin, not just because it’s a currency but because it’s an exercise in democracy,&#8221;</em> Kennedy said at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami Saturday. <em>“As president, I will make sure that you got your own wallet that the government can’t interfere with. Nobody is going to be taxing your electricity 30% and that we can nature this product in America where it’s going to create wealth for Americans.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivek Ramaswamy, another presidential candidate, announced at the same event that they had officially started accepting Bitcoin donations for his campaign, saying <em>“Let’s make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency.”</em></p>

<p>Cardano is set to experience significant growth following notable developments within its network. Several key advancements were highlighted in the latest weekly development report released Friday, May 19.</p>



<p>According to the report, in scaling efforts, the Hydra team achieved significant milestones with the release of the first mainnet-compatible <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-releases-first-mainnet-compatible-version-of-hydra-node-ada-looks-to-ride-the-wave-to-major-gains/">Hydra</a> node version. These advancements address critical issues that need resolution before integrating Hydra Head with real ADA, ensuring users&#8217; smooth and secure experience.</p>



<p>Voltaire workshops also commenced, providing opportunities for collaboration and networking among local Cardano communities. Voltaire is a big upgrade for Cardano in the future. As per the Cardano website, the Voltaire era&nbsp;of Cardano “will provide the final pieces required for the Cardano network to become a self-sustaining system.”</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the team responsible for making decisions worked with the research and networking teams to improve the Ouroboros Genesis design. They improved how they select the starting point, how they choose candidates, and how they use important connections. These changes were made to make the whole system work better and be more stable.</p>



<p>Notably, the Daedalus team completed work on the proxy server, guaranteeing ADA conversion rates from the CoinGecko API are dependable. As per the report, this team is preparing to release an updated version of Daedalus that will smoothly switch to this new endpoint.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, amid the developments, Cardano continued to witness significant progress, with various teams actively working on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-impressive-fundamentals-fuel-speculation-for-ada-reaching-1-price-milestone/">numerous projects</a>, all contributing to the platform&#8217;s overall advancement.</p>



<p>The latest report reveals some impressive numbers for Cardano. So far, 127 projects have been launched on the platform, creating over 8.28 million native tokens. Additionally, there have been 8,277 Plutus scripts executed, showcasing the versatility and functionality of Cardano.</p>



<p>Notably, Cardano is now home to a whopping 1,242 active projects in various development stages. These projects collectively process a remarkable 66.7 million transactions, highlighting the platform&#8217;s growing popularity and widespread use.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="572" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22-1024x572.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81179" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22-1024x572.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22-300x168.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22-768x429.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22.png 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This substantial increase in activity demonstrates the growing interest and adoption of Cardano as a preferred blockchain platform. The Cardano team has also been championing more decentralization, as evidenced by an upcoming Stake Pool Operators (SPO) vote, enabling SPOs to vote on important decisions about the network&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>With these notable developments and ongoing initiatives, Cardano is set to offer a robust infrastructure and foster innovation in the decentralized ecosystem, which is bullish for the entire ecosystem amid price watchtower to $1.</p>



<p>Proponents of the network’s native token ADA could also enjoy massive returns on their assets soon as the network continues to attract more users. The cryptocurrency was trading at $0.36 at press time, down 1.31% in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bryan Lee, an executive associated with crypto exchange CoinDeal, has been charged in connection with a cryptocurrency investment fraud scheme that defrauded more than 10,000 victims and resulted in losses exceeding $45 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a Friday statement by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Lee is accused of collaborating with Neil Chandran and others to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1584496/download">deceive</a> investors in companies controlled by Chandran, collectively known as &#8220;ViRSE.&#8221;</p>



<p>These companies allegedly claimed to be developing virtual-world technologies and their cryptocurrency for use in a metaverse. To entice potential investors, the fraudulent operation promised substantial returns upon the acquisition of these companies by wealthy individuals. </p>



<p>The firms even propagated false assertions that two billionaires, one affiliated with a well-known online retail company and the other with an electric car company, were supporting the ventures in a bid to substantiate their claims. However, the DOJ alleged that these claims were entirely fabricated, designed solely to deceive unsuspecting individuals.</p>



<p>Lee,57, as the nominee owner and director of ViMarket, allegedly followed Chandran&#8217;s instructions in handling investor funds deposited into ViMarket&#8217;s bank accounts. CoinDeal was the primary vehicle through which the fraudulent investment opportunity was marketed to potential victims. Lee and Chandran then proceeded to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ohio-man-who-stole-713-bitcoins-from-us-authorities-is-set-to-plead-guilty-of-theft/">misappropriate</a> millions of dollars by purchasing luxury cars and real estate.</p>



<p>According to the DOJ, Lee faces multiple charges, including conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and engaging in monetary transactions involving unlawfully obtained assets. If convicted, he could face over 60 years in prison.</p>



<p>Notably, Chandran was arrested in June 2022 and charged accordingly. Michael Glaspie, another individual involved with the scheme, pleaded guilty to wire fraud for his role in marketing the investment under the name &#8220;CoinDeal&#8221; and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while Lee made his initial appearance in federal court on Friday, May 19, Chandran is scheduled for a status conference on June 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, as the legal process unfolds, it is anticipated that further revelations regarding the extent of the alleged fraudulent activities will come to light, with the DOJ calling on victims to present themselves.</p>

<ul>
<li>New data shows that over 53% of Bitcoin has not moved in the last two years despite price swings in recent months.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The activities of sophisticated investors and whales, coupled with increased lost assets, are significant for the figure.</li>
</ul>



<p>The hodling culture is deeply rooted in digital assets and current indicators show growth across multiple cryptocurrencies amid recent bear markets.</p>



<p>Recent data released by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that holders have not moved more than half the number of Bitcoin (BTC) in circulation in two years. The figure, which stands at 53.14% is at an all-time high which points to the growing desire by investors to hold assets on a long-term basis.</p>



<p>While 19.3 million BTC has been mined since 2009, the report shows that 10.2 million BTC are still sitting in wallets. The factors responsible for over $300 billion worth of BTC going dormant are the trading patterns of whales and, unfortunately, lost assets.</p>



<p>The CEO of Arkham Intelligence, commenting on the report, stated that dormant coins will eventually come back in circulation over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Coins have organically transferred from those with high-time and liquidity preference to those with low-time and liquidity preference. Through all the shake-ups, for every seller, there’s a buyer.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This data comes up as the price of the market leader <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">moves</a> past the $30,000 mark for the first time in eight months after a positive start in Q1 2023. An increase in the price of BTC can lead dormant assets to come back into the scene as long-term holders will look to trade for profits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-hodling-continue">Will hodling continue?</h2>



<p>In the last decade, several whales resurfaced huge crypto holdings making shocking returns by moving assets to new wallets. Glassnode indicated investors are less likely to spend coins after 155 days and will hold those assets for a long time.</p>



<p>Records also show long-term ‘sophisticated investors’ make more money than retail investors. Morel also stated that some assets will never return to circulation because they have simply been lost. This is a major problem attributed to amateur investors who forget their wallet’s private keys.</p>

<p>Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have jointly requested additional time to disclose the Hinman documents, raising speculation about a potential settlement in their ongoing legal battle.</p>



<p>In a Friday, May 19 letter to District Judge Analisa Torres, both parties argued that the voluminous nature of the materials and the necessary redactions necessitate more time. Notably, while the original deadline had been set for June 6 2023, by the court, the parties sought a one-week extension to June 13.</p>



<p>This development follows a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">recent decision</a> by Judge Torres to deny the SEC&#8217;s motion to seal the Hinman documents earlier this week. On May 16, Judge Torres ruled that the documents were judicial and subject to a strong presumption of public access. The decision was welcomed by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who called it “another win for transparency.”</p>



<p>The documents in question are tied to a controversial 2018 speech by Bill Hinman, a former SEC director, where he stated that he did not consider Bitcoin or Ethereum as securities. Ripple has sought access to these documents, believing they support their argument that XRP should not be classified as a security.</p>



<p>The SEC had previously claimed that Hinman&#8217;s speech represented his personal views rather than the Commission&#8217;s policy, and thus the documents should be withheld from public scrutiny. However, the recent ruling by Judge Torres has brought them into the public domain. This decision marks another setback for the SEC&#8217;s attempt to seal these documents, as a judge had previously ruled against their efforts last year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-settlement-in-the-horizon"><strong>A Settlement in the Horizon?</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, following this week’s events, the possibility of public access to these documents has added fuel to the speculation about a potential settlement between Ripple and the SEC.</p>



<p><em>“Whiff of settlement talks &#8211; since this is a joint filing. The SEC does not want the Kraken released here… Still feels most like a mutually beneficial delay to work on settlement,”</em> tweeted long-term Ripple supporter Hugh Breslin.</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>My thoughts exactly</em>!” another Ripple proponent wrote, replying to Breslin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, it is important to note that the outcome of this <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">high-profile lawsuit</a> holds significant implications for the regulation of digital assets, not only in the United States but also globally. This is because it has the potential to provide clarity on the classification of cryptocurrencies and shape future regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>That said, as the Parties await a decision from Judge Torres regarding the requested extension, the Ripple adherents await eagerly as the decision may provide crucial insights into the SEC&#8217;s stance on digital assets and the future of Ripple&#8217;s XRP.</p>
