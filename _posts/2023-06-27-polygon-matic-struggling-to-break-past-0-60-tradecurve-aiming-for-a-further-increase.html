<p>Despite the recent price recovery in the crypto market, Polygon is still struggling with bearish pressure as the bulls try to surpass the $0.60 mark, leaving investors and supporters eagerly awaiting a potential breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tradecurve (TCRV) has emerged as a promising player in the crypto market, fueled by its unique approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). Tradecurve's native token is aiming for a more bullish price movement after crossing the $0.018 mark.&nbsp;</p>

Polygon (MATIC) Struggling To Break Past $0.60
<p>In recent days, Polygon has experienced a significant price decline, dropping below the crucial $0.750 support level and entering a bearish zone. However, the cryptocurrency has found some stability as a low point formed near $0.5432. Currently, it is attempting to regain its value and follow the upward trend observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notably, there has been a positive development in Polygon's price movement. At first, bulls struggled to cross the resistance around $0.605 before finally soaring above&nbsp; $0.64 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), signaling a potential recovery. However, it faced resistance around the $0.725 level. To continue its upward momentum, MATIC would need to break above this resistance level with the next significant resistance awaiting near $0.78.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, failure to surpass the $0.725 resistance level could lead to a fresh decline in MATIC's price. In such a scenario, immediate support can be expected around the $0.65 level. At present, Polygon is trading at $0.666567, a decline of 4.40% in the last 24 hours.</p>

Tradecurve Aiming For A Further Increase
<p>While Polygon is aiming to surpass the $0.725 resistance, Tradecurve's utility token, TCRV, is aiming for a further increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last week, the TCRV token experienced a 20% price surge to set a new trading high of $0.018. Based on its current trajectory, market analysts have predicted that the token has gathered enough momentum to potentially reach $0.025 in the coming week.</p>
<p>The strong bullish performance of TCRV can be linked to the growing attention its parent Tradecurve exchange is enjoying. Unlike other exchanges such as OKX and Kraken, Tradecurve offers more tradable assets apart from cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>These tradable assets include forex, commodities, stocks, indices, and CFDs. Additionally, Tradecurve offers several advantageous features, including low trading fees and access to a diverse range of tradable assets and derivatives. As a hybrid trading platform, Tradecurve will also allow users from around the world to trade anonymously.</p>
<p>TCRV token holders enjoy various benefits, such as staking rewards, voting rights, and discounts. Now in the fourth stage of its presale, crypto market experts predict that the price of the token price could increase by a further 40% in the fifth stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As demand for Tradecurve and its TCRV token increases, leading industry experts predict a potential 50x increase in value before the end of its presale. Furthermore, market analysts anticipate a remarkable surge of 100x by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
