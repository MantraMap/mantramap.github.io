<p>The frequent name on Steam&rsquo;s Global bestseller list is now entering web3, porting the first batch of its world famous simulator games into OuterLife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PlayWay, the global gaming giant, has teamed up with GameSwift to introduce and launch OuterLife as their entry into the web3 gaming world on Polygon network</p>
<p>OuterLife is an innovative Web3 gaming accelerator and incubator, and it will allow PlayWay to integrate blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into its famous simulator titles such as Animal Shelter, Farming Life, Cafe Owner Simulator and more.. PlayWay commented that it will port some of its existing catalogue of games, providing new, engaging and fresh experiences for its gamers with constantly evolving storylines and added productions. OuterLife also gives opportunity to other gaming studios producing simulators to join the incubator and using a zk-powered Polygon Supernet, to also build their own blockchains.</p>
<p>Paweł Łaskarzewski, COO at OuterLife expressed that the gaming industry is &ldquo;ripe for disruption,&rdquo; in this case led by blockchain and NFT based initiatives. He said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blockchain technology has the ability to provide new and engaging enhancements to tried and tested gaming models that have worked over the years, allowing players to get close to the game more than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Marek Parzyński, PlayWay, conveyed his delight in being part of the OuterLife launch and looks forward to a promising future in collaboration with both Polygon Labs and GameSwift.</p>
What does this mean for players and developers?&nbsp;
<p>Through the collaboration, existing and new developers within PlayWay&rsquo;s ecosystem and beyond will be able to connect their games to a world of interconnected digital reality, simply by an SDK, creating a truly open world. For players, OuterLife will offer an all new gaming experience where players can enhance statistics, acquire in-game items as non-fungible tokens and establish interconnected gaming simulations.</p>
<p>CEO of GameSwift Wojciech Gruszka known also under his Twitter handle as Pan Paragraf comments, </p>

<p>&ldquo;With OuterLife, character developments and upgrades in one game simulator will also have an impact in another - creating a truly interconnected digital reality with the power of blockchain.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Healthy Supply and Demand
<p>Major strides are being made to bring blockchain technology to mainstream gaming, with over $739M invested in Q1 2023 alone, according to a DappRadar report. Driving forces for mass adoption are games that are fun, and not complicated for user onboarding, regardless of its usage of blockchain technology. In addition to fun, trends suggest healthy supply and demand for ownership, privacy, creator empowerment and ecosystem growth.</p>
<p>OuterLife will use a zk-powered Polygon Supernet integration, which will address those to create a winning economic formula, while ensuring a seamless, scalable, easy to onboard and privacy-focused ecosystem for players, developers and gaming studios alike.&nbsp;</p>
Not Far Off
<p>PlayWay, the leading company behind gaming boom, was listed as the third-largest games company&mdash;trailing only CD Projekt Red, developers of The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077, and Techland with Dying Light. It is worth to highlight that PlayWay has around 4 times bigger capitalization than Ten Square Games, the mobile giant behind Let&rsquo;s Fish and Fishing Clash. The Global Giant has been home to some of the most successful gaming titles on Steam marketplace, with more than 100 titles in development, having partnered with more than 120 studios worldwide. While it's unclear on when the watershed mass-adoption moment will arrive, it's clear to see it having a major push with one of the biggest game studios in the world making heaps with the technology.&nbsp;</p>
