					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price is correcting gains from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could start a fresh rally if it clears the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels. Ethereum is still struggling to clear the $1,920 resistance zone. The price is trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a substantial decline if it breaks the $1,870 support. Ethereum Price Reaches Key Support Ethereum’s price started a downside correction after it failed to clear the $1,920 resistance zone. ETH corrected lower below the $1,900 level, similar to Bitcoin. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. However, the bulls were active above the $1,870 support zone. There is also a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether is now trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,920 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,930 level. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A proper move above the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels might send Ether toward $2,000. The next resistance sits near $2,050, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,120. Any more gains above the $2,120 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,250 resistance. An intermediate resistance might be $2,200. Downside Break in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,890 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $1,870 zone or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. If there is a close below the $1,870 support, the price could decline toward the $1,840 support.

					<description><![CDATA[RAY, the native governance token of Raydium, the automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, soared 30% on May 17 before reversing gains, plunging to spot rates.  RAY Prices Under Pressure According to CoinMarketCap data on May 30, RAY is changing hands at $0.19, stable against the USD, Bitcoin, and Ethereum on the last trading day.  RAY has a market capitalization of $41.2 million at this rate, with an average trading volume of $2 million in the past 24 hours.  At this pace, RAY remains in a bearish formation as bears peeled back gains posted on May 17, aligning the token with bears from mid-February 2023.  Related Reading: Can This THORChain New Feature Push Back RUNE Bears? Like Solana and tokens based on this network, RAY&#8217;s bearish price action has persisted and hasn&#8217;t reversed losses from mid-November 2022.  The collapse of FTX, a crypto exchange, and Alameda Research, the investment wing of FTX, which was heavily invested in Solana, triggered a sharp sell-off of SOL, weighing negatively on RAY and other ecosystems. Raydium Updates The sharp expansion of RAY prices on May 17 coincided with the upgrade of the Raydium DEX to version V.2.10.11.  According to the development team, the decision was reached following a server load due to API abuse. Specifically, there was a nearly 3X jump in API pings in April than in March 2023. The extra load stressed Raydium&#8217;s servers, disrupting the connection. The team behind the project stated: Raydium&#8217;s APIs were pinged more than 50 billion times in April, up from 18 billion in March. May figures are set to surpass April highs. This highlights how much stress servers have been under and why issues have popped up. Nearly 2,000 new pools were created in the first two weeks of May, bringing Raydium&#8217;s total pool count to nearly 8,000. This update, V.2.10.11, served to correct this issue. Besides increasing the server capacity by 11X, there were several bug fixes that the exchange expects to &#8220;greatly improve user interface responsiveness.&#8221; While the update was received enthusiastically, momentum has waned, and RAY is trading near May 2023 lows. Trackers show that Raydium&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) is around $30 million as of May 30, down from $2.2 billion recorded in mid-November 2021. Meanwhile, there has been a noticeable drop in the number of unique active wallets (UAW) from early May 2023, according to DappRadar.  Related Reading: Rare Crypto Signal Emerges That Could Spark Another 2017-Style Boom The contraction in the number of users coincides with the closure of the RAY Claim Portal on May 14. This portal was opened following the hack in December 2022, when the DEX lost over $2 million. The hacker drained user funds from various Raydium liquidity pools without burning or owning any liquidity pool (LP) tokens. Feature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chainlink Price has been attempting to reverse its recent losses over the past few weeks. Currently, Chainlink is trading under a crucial resistance mark which has caused the altcoin to face rejection. Over the last 24 hours, Chainlink has managed to appreciate by only 0.4%, signifying that it has been consolidating. On the weekly chart, LINK has already increased by 1.8%. Continued price consolidation will cause the bears to take over the price completely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Receive Inflows Of 7,000 BTC, What Does It Mean? The technical outlook of the altcoin has also sided with the bears as buying strength showed signs of struggle. Both demand and accumulation have therefore remained low on the chart. As Bitcoin trades inside the $ 27,000 price zone, major altcoins have also been trying to move north on their respective charts. If Bitcoin does not stabilize above the $ 27,500 price, sellers can exert another pull on Chainlink, causing the price to fall further. The market capitalization of Chainlink declined, which indicated that buying strength remained low at press time. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart When writing, Chainlink (LINK) was trading at $6.60. However, this price level has proven to resist the altcoin strongly. Despite this, the bulls have managed to prevent further price retracement. The overhead resistance for LINK is currently set at $6.80. LINK has been trading between $6.20 and $6.80 in recent weeks. Breaking above the upper boundary of this trading range is crucial for LINK bulls. Failing to breach the $6.80 resistance level would likely result in the dominance of the bears. If the price declines, the initial support level is $6.20. Further downside movement could see LINK trading near the $6.00 price level. The trading volume of Chainlink in the last session was low, indicating a limited number of buyers in the market. Technical Analysis For LINK Chainlink (LINK) faced difficulties attracting buyers during May and most of April. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has consistently remained below the 50-level, suggesting buyers have lost interest in LINK due to recent price rejections. Additionally, LINK has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. To regain bullish momentum, it is crucial for LINK to move above the $6.60 level, which would enable the altcoin to trade above the 20-SMA line. In contrast to other technical indicators, Chainlink (LINK) exhibited the emergence of a buy signal on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed the formation of green histograms, suggesting the potential for bullish momentum to develop.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink Price has been attempting to reverse its recent losses over the past few weeks. Currently, Chainlink is trading under a crucial resistance mark which has caused the altcoin to face rejection.</p>
<p>Over the last 24 hours, Chainlink has managed to appreciate by only 0.4%, signifying that it has been consolidating. On the weekly chart, LINK has already increased by 1.8%. Continued price consolidation will cause the bears to take over the price completely.</p>

<p>The technical outlook of the altcoin has also sided with the bears as buying strength showed signs of struggle. Both demand and accumulation have therefore remained low on the chart. As Bitcoin trades inside the $ 27,000 price zone, major altcoins have also been trying to move north on their respective charts.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin does not stabilize above the $ 27,500 price, sellers can exert another pull on Chainlink, causing the price to fall further. The market capitalization of Chainlink declined, which indicated that buying strength remained low at press time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently showing signs of a new momentum refresh and the beginning of a newly formed bull run. Market analyst Justin Bennet accurately predicted this move, citing recent range highs and a cluster of short liquidations in the $27,500 area. However, Bennet suggests an expected market between $27,500 and $28,250. He further claimed:  Bitcoin&#8217;s pullback today is not surprising, given the aggressiveness of the weekend rally. The pullback will remain constructive as long as Bitcoin can stay above $27,500 on a 4-hour and daily closing basis. Related Reading: Can This THORChain New Feature Push Back RUNE Bears? Is Bitcoin On The Verge Of Reaching $30,000 Again? Furthermore, Bennet suggests a sustained break below Bitcoin’s current trading area would confirm a deviation and expose the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap at $26,900. To understand what a CME gap is, it&#8217;s important to know that Bitcoin futures are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. When the CME closes for the weekend, there can be price movements in Bitcoin that are not reflected in the futures market. This can create a gap between the Friday close and Monday open on the CME chart, known as a CME gap. However, Bitcoin is trading above a key resistance level, as indicated by the 50-day Moving Average (MA), noted in the chart below by the brown line. This level could support Bitcoin in the short term and prevent further price drops in the $27,440 area. It remains to be seen if Bitcoin can consolidate above this key indicator and maintain its momentum. If it successfully manages to do so, the next target could be to consolidate above $28,000 and break out of the current range, as suggested by analyst Justin Bennet. This could pave the way for Bitcoin to reconquer the $30,000 level.  BTC Could Reach $300,000 Or Drop To $3,000 Moreover, Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility has been compressing over time, according to trader Jackis, who believes this compression could lead to a significant price movement in 2024. He predicts that once Bitcoin leaves this compression phase in 2024, it could drop to $3,000 or soar to $300,000. Jackis further claimed that this potential price movement could mark the next stage of Bitcoin&#8217;s evolution, as it moves from the &#8220;Early adopters&#8221; phase to the &#8220;Vast majority&#8221; stage. As more individuals and institutions adopt Bitcoin, its price and volatility will likely be impacted. However, according to Glassnode co-founder James Check, the headwinds that have kept Bitcoin&#8217;s price under $30,000 include the strength of the US Dollar (DXY), a bounce in interest rates, and the risk of further Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, he believes that the market may be about to turn and that Bitcoin may be poised for a rally. While the Nasdaq has been used as an indicator of Bitcoin&#8217;s potential rally, the Glassnode co-founder believes other factors are at play. He sees a potential turn in the DXY at levels of 106-107, potentially leading to a reversal in interest rates. The US Dollar Index measures the value of the US Dollar against a basket of other currencies. A stronger DXY can be seen as a headwind for Bitcoin, making the cryptocurrency relatively more expensive for holders of other currencies.

					<description><![CDATA[Despite the lingering bearish sentiment in the market, the Avalanche (AVAX) price has shown some upward movement. AVAX is hovering around a significant support line that has historically propelled its price in previous months. AVAX has experienced a slight 0.1% downward movement on the daily chart, while the weekly chart reflects a loss of approximately 2% in value. Related Reading: Polkadot Experiences Correction After Reaching $5.54: What’s Next In Store? Technical indicators for Avalanche indicate a bearish influence, with demand and accumulation remaining low. For buyers to regain confidence in the market, AVAX must maintain its support level and attempt to break through its resistance level. The appreciation of Bitcoin has also influenced altcoins, prompting some attempts at price increases. However, if Bitcoin&#8217;s price falls below the $27,500 mark, it is unlikely that Avalanche will be able to surpass its next price ceiling. On the other hand, if AVAX manages to break through the overhead resistance, it may experience a rally. The decrease in the AVAX market capitalization suggests that selling pressure still exists in the market. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, AVAX was priced at $14.48. If sellers do not exert further pressure, the altcoin will likely make gradual progress on its chart. The immediate overhead resistance for AVAX is set at $14.70, and surpassing this level could pave the way for further upward movement toward $15 and beyond. On the other hand, a decline from the current price level could bring AVAX down to $14 and potentially lower. However, if buyers step in and provide a slight push, AVAX bulls can strengthen their position in the market. The trading volume of AVAX in the last session was in red, indicating that selling strength was influencing the price action. Technical Analysis Throughout May, AVAX has experienced a lack of positive demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has remained below the 50-mark, indicating that sellers have outnumbered buyers. The consistent rejection at the current price level could further diminish demand. Furthermore, AVAX has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, suggesting that sellers have been dictating the price momentum at the time of writing. This indicates a bearish sentiment in the market. In line with other technical indicators, the buy signal for AVAX has been diminishing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures price momentum and reversals, has shown declining green histograms, indicating a decrease in buy signals. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which depict price volatility and the potential for price fluctuations, have significantly narrowed. This suggests that AVAX may experience a period of consolidation, with the potential for explosive price action in the upcoming trading sessions. Related Reading: Rare Crypto Signal Emerges That Could Spark Another 2017-Style Boom If AVAX can maintain its position above the current price level, there is a possibility that it might attempt a rally. However, the success of this rally will depend largely on the overall strength of the broader market and the support from buyers.

<p>In line with other technical indicators, the buy signal for AVAX has been diminishing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures price momentum and reversals, has shown declining green histograms, indicating a decrease in buy signals.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which depict price volatility and the potential for price fluctuations, have significantly narrowed. This suggests that AVAX may experience a period of consolidation, with the potential for explosive price action in the upcoming trading sessions.</p>

<p>If AVAX can maintain its position above the current price level, there is a possibility that it might attempt a rally. However, the success of this rally will depend largely on the overall strength of the broader market and the support from buyers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantom (FTM), a leading Layer 1 (L1) blockchain platform, has launched a new Gas Monetization program to incentivize high-quality Decentralized Applications (dApps) and attract top talent to the ecosystem.  With the recent announcement of the long-term vision for the protocol by Andre Cronje, co-founder of the blockchain platform, the community is buzzing with excitement for the future of Fantom. Fantom’s Gas Monetization, which just went live on May 28th, is one of the most highly anticipated updates for the platform. The governance proposal was first approved in January 2023, with an overwhelming 99.8% of the votes, showcasing the community&#8217;s support for the initiative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Receive Inflows Of 7,000 BTC, What Does It Mean? Fantom Launches Gas Monetization Program Gas monetization is an incentive program to reward high-quality dApps for their generated fees. These dApps will receive a 15% kickback on all the gas fees generated, incentivizing development and attracting more developers to the ecosystem. The money for this reward comes from the fact that the FTM burn rate will be reduced from 20% to 5%. This is a win-win situation for both developers and the Fantom network. Developers are compensated for the value they create on the network, while the network benefits from increased adoption and usage. The reduction in the FTM burn rate also helps control inflation and gives more stability to the token&#8217;s value. Francesco, a leading figure in the blockchain industry, remarked that this incentivization of development is exactly what Fantom needs to achieve its goals. With Gas Monetization, the platform is taking a significant step forward to become one of the leading L1 giants in the blockchain industry. However, the mechanism could be targeted by spam dApps and malicious actors trying to exploit it. To prevent such exploits, Fantom has implemented certain criteria that dApps must meet to be eligible for Gas Monetization. Fantom&#8217;s Eligibility Criteria A dApp must have completed at least 1 million transactions and been live on the Fantom network for at least 3 months to be eligible. These criteria are valid for each smart contract on the Fantom mainnet and may be subject to change during the program based on their effectiveness. Once approved for the program, dApps will receive 15% of the gas fees they generate. The FTM tokens received are unlocked and can be used as the dApps see fit. However, what happens to the 15% share of gas fees made by dApps that do not participate in the Gas Monetization Program? These transactions are ineligible and do not qualify for the 15% share of gas fees. The Fantom Foundation has clarified that only dApps that meet the eligibility criteria can participate in the Gas Monetization Program and receive rewards for their contributions to the network. The Foundation also reserves the right to suspend rewards to participating dApps for any necessary reason, including fraudulent user activity or the overall well-being of the Fantom ecosystem. The Gas Monetization Program is a great opportunity for dApps to showcase their value and be rewarded for their contributions to the network. However, ensuring that spam dApps or malicious actors do not exploit the program is essential. Related Reading: NFT Market Update: Major Collections Suffer Price Slump in 2023 This new approach is just a series of incentives Fantom builds to attract developers and keep them engaged with the ecosystem.

					<description><![CDATA[THORChain, a decentralized exchange and one of the liquid decentralized finance protocols by total value locked, plans to release “Lending” in 2023.  It is a feature THORChain says will complete their THORFi ecosystem. However, amid this development and community anticipation, RUNE remains under pressure, slipping 32% from April 2023 highs as of writing on May 30. THORChain Lending According to THORChain, Lending will function similarly to other decentralized money markets, including one of the earliest, MakerDAO, which operates on Ethereum.  With THORChain Lending, not only can the borrow deposit collateral, a token or coin already integrated by the platform, but also take loans with zero interest, liquidation, and expiry.  Related Reading: Downside Threat: These Two Crypto At Risk Of Crash Due To Unlocks This arrangement means a borrower would effectively hold a loan without the risk of liquidation, irrespective of the collateral’s volatility. Moreover, THORChain says a user can be short the USD while being long on crypto assets such as Bitcoin and others. Their feature will depart from how other competing decentralized money markets operate. Most require over-collateralization, considering the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. Borrowers will deposit collateral and create debt at a collateralization ratio (CR) set by the market. A distinction in ThorChain Lending, the protocol clarifies, is that debt will be denominated in TOR. TOR is a stablecoin that tracks the value of USD, irrespective of the collateral used, and will be non-transferable.  There will be limits on collateral and risks contained by, among other factors, “slip-based fees when opening and closing loans, dynamic CR, and a circuit breaker on RUNE supply.” Loan repayment, THORChain adds, can be done at any time and in any supported asset. All repayments will be converted to TOR. Impact On RUNE RUNE serves as the utility token of the THORChain ecosystem. Using the token, users can pay for gas and use it to secure the network. RUNE plays a role in ensuring the platform is decentralized and resistant to attacks from malicious agents.  With THORChain Lending, every new loan is expected to create a deflationary effect on RUNE. However, repaying the loan creates an inflationary impact.  Related Reading: NFT Market Update: Major Collections Suffer Price Slump in 2023 If by the time the loan is created and closed, the price of the collateral has not moved relative to the RUNE price; there will be zero effect.  However, there will be an inflationary effect if the collateral price increases versus RUNE during this time, which could negatively impact the token price if many positions are opened that meet these criteria.  Ahead of this launch, RUNE prices remain flat in the last week of trading. However, it is up 7% from May 2023 lows. As of late May 2023, DeFi activity is yet to recover. According to DeFiLlama data, TVL has stagnated below $50 billion in the last five months. During this time, Uniswap, a popular multi-chain DEX, and Curve, a stablecoin DEX, have dominated activity. THORChain has a TVL of $106 million, with most liquidity from tokenized Bitcoin.

					<description><![CDATA[A prominent non-fungible token (NFT) protocol based on the Bitcoin blockchain, &#8220;Ordinals,&#8221; surpassed an impressive benchmark in a significant turn of events. The network&#8217;s transaction surged to 10 million a few days after the Ordinals creator, Rodarmor, announced stepping down from the project.  Related Reading: Pepecoin Eyes Rebound As It Finds Support In Strong Algorithm Data Score Reaching over 10 million inscriptions suggests that many transactions have occurred on the protocol. Casey Rodarmor tweeted that he had stepped down as the lead maintainer of Ordinals.  He claimed that he was not giving Ordinal full attention and handed over the role to a programmer, Raphjaph. He further emphasized that donations from the community will fund the coder&#8217;s work on the project. Ordinals Protocol And Its Rapid Growth Bitcoin Ordinals is a protocol that supports the transcription of a unique identifier to individual satoshis (SATs) to enable easy tracking during transactions. After the launch of Ordinals in January, the protocol quickly gained popularity as a means to create new assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Initially, Ordinals served to &#8220;inscribe&#8221; data on individual satoshis (the smallest divisible unit of BTC).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A prominent non-fungible token (NFT) protocol based on the Bitcoin blockchain, &#8220;Ordinals,&#8221; surpassed an impressive benchmark in a significant turn of events.</p>
<p>The network&#8217;s transaction surged to 10 million a few days after the Ordinals creator, Rodarmor, announced stepping down from the project. </p>

<p>Reaching over 10 million inscriptions suggests that many transactions have occurred on the protocol. <a href="https://twitter.com/rodarmor/status/1662617512700420096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1662617512700420096%7Ctwgr%5Eb7ca699a0ae9fbff1dd72bf9e23f7581ead6ad19%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin-ordinals-surpass-inscription-as-casey-rodarmor-steps-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Casey Rodarmor</a> tweeted that he had stepped down as the lead maintainer of Ordinals. </p>
<p>He claimed that he was not giving Ordinal full attention and handed over the role to a programmer, Raphjaph. He further emphasized that donations from the community will fund the coder&#8217;s work on the project.</p>
<h2>Ordinals Protocol And Its Rapid Growth</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Ordinals is a protocol that supports the transcription of a unique identifier to individual satoshis (SATs) to enable easy tracking during transactions.</p>
<p>After the launch of Ordinals in January, the protocol quickly gained popularity as a means to create new assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Initially, Ordinals served to &#8220;inscribe&#8221; data on individual satoshis (the smallest divisible unit of BTC).</p>
<p>However, the rapid growth in the number of Ordinals inscriptions occurred when the BRC-20 token standard was introduced in early March.</p>

<p>This new token standard, established by the pseudonymous &#8220;Domo,&#8221; enabled users to mint new tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. </p>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://brc-20.io/" rel="nofollow">BRC-20.io</a>, in the first week, the number of Bitcoin-based tokens jumped from a hundred to 25,000 at the time of writing.</p>
