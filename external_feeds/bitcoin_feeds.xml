He further cautioned that the U.S. dollar’s reserve currency status could be eroded if the U.S. defaults on its debt obligations.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Lawmaker’s Debt Default Warning</h2>
<p>Congressman Jim Himes (D-CT), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warned Sunday during an appearance on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;State of the Union&#8221; about the risks of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations.</p>
<p>The lawmaker was asked whether the current U.S. &#8220;debt crisis&#8221; is &#8220;a national security threat&#8221; and whether any world leaders have expressed concern to him about it. Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, informed the Senate last week that Russia and China would try to exploit the chaos resulting from a U.S. default to show that &#8220;We&#8217;re not capable of functioning as a democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Himes replied, &#8220;It has not come up in the meetings that we had in Jordan and Israel and Egypt,&#8221; emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, of course, the Russians and the Chinese would seek to exploit it. The United States has never really come close to defaulting on its debt before. So it&#8217;s hard for us to imagine what that might look like. But, of course, it could be catastrophic.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, the full faith and credit of the United States is the bedrock on which the global financial system is built,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The congressman stressed that if the U.S. debt default comes into question, “all kinds of things could happen.” He warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. dollar could … its position as the global reserve currency could be eroded. People may choose to invest in the United Kingdom or in the European Union, rather than the United States.</p></blockquote>

<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last week that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government’s bills as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">early as June 1</a> “if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, Yellen also warned on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week&#8221; that if Congress fails to act on the debt ceiling, it could lead to a “constitutional crisis” with implications for financial markets and interest rates. Additionally, she cautioned that not raising the debt ceiling would result in a &#8220;steep economic downturn&#8221; in the U.S. The Treasury Secretary said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no way to protect our financial system and our economy other than Congress doing its job and raising the debt ceiling and enabling us to pay our bills. And we should not get to the point where we need to consider whether the president can go on issuing debt. This would be a constitutional crisis.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Dave Ramsey on De-Dollarization and Challenges From Alternative Currencies</h2>
<p>Personal finance guru and Ramsey Solutions CEO Dave Ramsey answered a question about de-dollarization in an episode of &#8220;The Dave Ramsey Show,&#8221; aired last week. Ramsey is an eight-time national best-selling author who sold more than 11 million copies. A self-proclaimed personal money management expert, he calls himself “America’s trusted voice on money.”</p>
<p>Zack from Alabama asked him:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m reading more and more about de-dollarization and countries moving away from the U.S. dollar as their basis of international trade. Will this affect the strength of the dollar, and should I be concerned about how I’m saving and investing as a result of this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ramsey began by telling the Alabama man that he is “spending too much time on the internet” and has gotten into a conspiracy theory about the demise of the U.S. dollar. Regarding countries moving away from the USD for international trade, Ramsey said China, Russia, and Brazil “are the three main players in this.”</p>
<p>He stressed, “They already don’t use the U.S. dollar as their basis of international trade,” emphasizing that all three countries have their own currencies and “there’s a conversion rate” between each of those currencies and the U.S. dollar. The self-proclaimed personal finance guru opined: &#8220;The three largest countries … are talking about bringing in some of the oil countries in the Middle East … they&#8217;re trying to come up with one currency that they all use.&#8221; The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are working to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">create a common currency</a> that will reduce their reliance on the USD.</p>
<p>Ramsey noted that the new, common currency they come up with would be used for international trade and “converted back and forth to dollars much like Europe did with the euro which, by the way, kind of didn&#8217;t work.” He added: “These countries — if they did all agree to use one currency, it would be much like when Europe went to the euro and then that&#8217;s going to exchange for the dollar back and forth.”</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are those countries going to be able to devalue the dollar by doing that? No. Because while they do take up a lot of land mass, they do not take up a lot of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The United States still is the vast majority of the gross domestic product of the world, still. China’s is big, Russia is basically horrible, and Brazil is in a failed economy, like times 10, and it&#8217;s tiny as far as economics go,” he continued. “When you put them all together, they don&#8217;t have the muscle to take down the dollar. They just don&#8217;t, mathematically. It&#8217;s arithmetic. They just don&#8217;t have it.”</p>

<p>Ramsey further said: “Now, what they are going to do if they all do put it together, it&#8217;s not a de-dollarization. It’s not doing away with the dollar. They’ve created their own currency. They&#8217;re still going to have to trade with the 800-pound gorilla which be us, and you&#8217;re going to have to trade with us in dollars, so whatever little currency you create over there in your little fantasy world that you live in, you still going to have to trade it for dollars, so it&#8217;s not going to take down the dollar.”</p>
<p>Mocking the size of Brazil, Ramsey said: “When you look at the math, it&#8217;s humorous.” As for Russia, he said that it&#8217;s “a huge land mass” but “their economic production is pitiful.” In conclusion, Ramsey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Am I worried about this? Absolutely not. Absolutely zero, because Russia is pitiful and China has no labor force.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting that China&#8217;s &#8220;labor force is aging out because they stopped having babies legally,&#8221; Ramsey stressed: &#8220;They have no young labor force coming on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people do not share Ramsey&#8217;s view, warning that a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-official-expects-agreement-on-brics-currency-this-year/">common BRICS currency</a> could erode the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance. Among them is a former <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns/">White House economist</a>, who recently said that if the BRICS uses only its common currency for international trade, &#8220;they would remove an impediment that now thwarts their efforts to escape dollar hegemony.&#8221; A Swedish university professor has cautioned that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-joining-brics-would-accelerate-chinese-yuans-use-as-trading-currency-says-professor/">Saudi Arabia</a> joining the BRICS group would accelerate the use of the Chinese yuan as a trading currency. A former Morgan Stanley economist expects the world to evolve from a unipolar reserve currency world to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-predicts-shift-to-tripolar-reserve-currency-world-yuan-euro-to-disrupt-us-dollars-dominance/">tripolar world</a> — with the U.S. dollar, the Chinese yuan, and the euro as dominant currencies.</p>

The Central Bank of Iran has already started implementing this policy, proposing to pay bilateral trades using Iranian reals in a recent high-level reunion with Oman&#8217;s minister of commerce.</b></p>
<h2>Raisi Calls on Central Bank of Iran to Ditch Dollar</h2>
<p>Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has called for a policy shift when it comes to the use of the U.S. dollar in bilateral trades. On May 7, during a cabinet meeting after his visit to Syria, Raisi discussed the advancement of other countries such as China and Russia in reducing their trade dependence on the U.S. dollar and called for the Central Bank of Iran to lay the groundwork for shifting to the use of local currencies, such as the Iranian real.</p>
<p>Raisi also referred to the strength of the Syrian market, and how the two countries could benefit from a closer integration and trade relationship. He <a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/200424/Raeisi-orders-CBI-economic-bodies-to-use-rial-in-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Syrian market has a high capacity and capability for Iran to increase the level of trade relations between the two countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Raisi recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-seeks-brics-membership-to-counter-western-hegemony-promote-multipolar-world-says-president-raisi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that Iran would seek to join the BRICS bloc as a way of undermining the hegemony that the U.S. and other countries exert over the world, contributing to the establishment of a multipolar world in the future.</p>

<h2>Central Bank of Iran Moves</h2>
<p>The Governor of the Central Bank of Iran, Mohammadreza Farzin, explained that Iran would pursue this proposed policy of ditching the U.S. dollar in trade settlements as a strategic policy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/200474/CBI-seeks-to-ditch-dollar-in-bilateral-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>, made on May 8 during a high-level meeting with Qais bin Mohammad Al Yousef, the minister of commerce and industry of Oman, remarked that the $1.8 billion bilateral trading balance could even increase with the use of national currencies, according to Farzin.</p>
<p>On the reasons for abandoning the U.S. dollar, Farzin detailed that the U.S. was using its currency as a political tool to put pressure on other countries, explaining this was the reason the usage of other currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, had grown recently. Oman&#8217;s representative received the proposal positively, stating that this move would present advantages for both sides.</p>

The application aims to democratize decentralized identities and finance by utilizing World ID to enable users to sign into different websites, crypto applications, and share personal data in a privacy-focused manner. </strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Unveils World App</h2>
<p>The Worldcoin project made an <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-app">announcement</a> on May 8, 2023, revealing the launch of their new World App. The application dubbed the &#x201C;minimalist wallet&#x201D; is designed to bring &#x201C;decentralized identity and finance&#x201D; to the masses. The Worldcoin project, which was introduced to the public in October 2021, is backed by Sam Altman, CEO of Openai.</p>
<p>Before unveiling the World App, Worldcoin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-launches-world-id-an-ai-resistant-iris-dependant-id-protocol/">introduced</a> the World ID, an identification protocol that relies on iris recognition and claims to be resistant to AI manipulation. The project employs zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs that are linked to biometric data scans. The new World App will feature a crypto wallet that will utilize Worldcoin&#x2019;s native token (which has yet to launch), as well as bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>).</p>

<p>The announcement revealed that over 1.5 million people have already joined the World App&#x2019;s beta phase, and the app will now be available in more than 80 countries. This initial rollout is being referred to as Phase I, with plans to expand the application into a comprehensive toolkit in the future. The project&#x2019;s ultimate goal is to provide universal basic income (UBI) to verified users.</p>
<p>&#x201C;World App, the first wallet for the Worldcoin ecosystem, is launching today,&#x201D; the announcement states. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s designed to be friendly, and it supports private digital identity and a new financial system. You can use it to authenticate with World ID to prove you&#x2019;re a real person, get your Worldcoin tokens and send digital money anywhere.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The World App is available on both iOS and Android operating systems, and it was developed by <a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com">Tools For Humanity (TFH)</a>, a technology company &#x201C;built to ensure a more just economic system.&#x201D; According to the TFH web portal, the company is dedicated to using Worldcoin technology to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>The announcement highlights the wallet&#x2019;s minimalistic design, which incorporates the essential features of both Worldcoin and Ethereum. Initially, the Worldcoin project faced <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1452017760788258819?s=20">controversy</a> when it was first announced due to the eyeball scanning component. Moreover, former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iris-scanning-worldcoin-idea-fuels-objections-from-privacy-advocates-snowden-says-dont-catalog-eyeballs/">criticized</a> the project.</p>
<p>The collection of iris scans could be a potential threat to personal autonomy if used for non-consensual surveillance. There&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">concern</a> over the potential for exploitation, mission creep, and misuse of biometric data by both private corporations and governments. Biometric information is highly personal and unique to each individual, unlike passwords or PINs that can be changed if compromised.</p>

Concurrently, the total meme coin sector faced a 7% loss against the dollar, with the top six prominent meme tokens enduring losses within 24 hours.</strong></p>
<h2>PEPE‘s Meteoric Rise Hits a Roadblock with 12% Decline</h2>
<p>Numerous investors <a href="https://twitter.com/lybrandon_/status/1655683046824181760?s=20">reaped significant rewards</a> from the surging <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe">PEPE</a> meme token market; however, its worth has diminished from its all-time high (ATH). Just four days prior, on May 5, PEPE reached a pinnacle price of $0.00000431 per unit, but has since plunged over 50% from that position. Presently, its market valuation rests below $1 billion at $790 million, whereas on May 5, it ascended to an ATH of $1.8 billion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-587018 size-full" title="Meme Token PEPE's Market Cap Plunges Below $1 Billion Mark Amidst Market Decline" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pepeusdt_2023-05-09_12-03-07.png" alt="Meme Token PEPE's Market Cap Plunges Below $1 Billion Mark Amidst Market Decline" width="1996" height="778" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pepeusdt_2023-05-09_12-03-07-300x117.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pepeusdt_2023-05-09_12-03-07-1024x399.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pepeusdt_2023-05-09_12-03-07-768x299.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pepeusdt_2023-05-09_12-03-07-1536x599.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pepeusdt_2023-05-09_12-03-07.png 1996w" sizes="(max-width: 1996px) 100vw, 1996px" /></p>
<p>Despite the devaluation, PEPE has still managed to soar by 3,456% since its all-time low on April 18, set only 22 days earlier at $0.000000055142 per unit. Additionally, the meme coin has gained over 500% in the past two weeks when compared to the U.S. dollar. Yet since May 5, gains have eluded PEPE&#8217;s grasp. Nevertheless, PEPE boasts $804 million in global trade volume within a day—ranking eighth among total crypto trade volumes.</p>
<p>Shifts have also occurred in PEPE&#8217;s rich list as larger whales aggregate the meme coin’s supply. Currently, there are <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/pepe/richlist/">106,430 PEPE holders</a>, with the top ten wallets grasping 34.07% of all existing PEPE tokens. Among these leading holders are five exchanges—including Binance and Okx—owning the most extensive caches of PEPE relative to exchanges. The top 100 wealthiest PEPE addresses claim over 54% of the entire supply.</p>

<p>In general, aside from PEPE, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token">meme coin market</a> has been trailing a downward trajectory in conjunction with the broader crypto economy. Over the past day, the meme coin sector has shed 7% of its value, with DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, FLOKI, and BABYDOGE all experiencing declines. In contrast, meme token turbo (TURBO), Tamadoge (TAMA), and shih tzu (SHIH) have grown 43.1%, 18%, and 13% respectively against the greenback in the previous 24 hours.</p>

As the blockchain&#8217;s transfer fees continue to surge, the backlog of transactions stuck in the mempool has hit an unprecedented high. Crypto enthusiasts have been sharing their diverse perspectives on the matter, leading to a flurry of takes across various social media platforms.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin’s Scaling Challenges Spark Controversy and Diverse Perspectives</h2>
<p>The recent surge in Ordinals and BRC20 token usage has led to a significant increase in onchain activity, causing the mempool to overflow with over <a href="https://mempool.space/">400,000 transactions</a>. Currently, a whopping 194 blocks need to be mined to clear the backlog, which would take more than 24 hours at an average of ten minutes per block. As a result, people have been sharing a wide range of opinions on the matter, with some reveling in the higher fees and increased onchain activity, while others suspect that the blockchain is under attack. Meanwhile, some believe that the so-called attacker&#8217;s scheme is unsustainable and will eventually fizzle out.</p>
<p>“[The] mempool is spammed with dust payments (546sat) to drive fees high and block normal transactions,” one person <a href="https://twitter.com/mauh_2/status/1655128553099350017?s=20">speculated</a>. “What if a state is behind this? Or Satoshi itself?” the individual asked. Some people shared the opinion that high fees are meant to prevent spammers. “High onchain fees is the network protecting itself &#8211; assuring it is expensive to spam / attack,” another individual <a href="https://twitter.com/VersusTheMan/status/1655280827671130113?s=20">tweeted</a>. “From this point of view, the high fees are a VERY good thing. The mempool is a living, breathing, dynamic entity. Fees will eventually go down again when spammer funds are exhausted.”</p>
<p>The recent surge in network fees has left many in the Bitcoin community feeling frustrated. Bitcoin educator Anita Posch took to social media to express her concerns about the impact of these fees on onboarding new users. “Can anyone explain how I&#8217;m going to onboard people with these fees?” Posch <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1655459803957739520?s=20">asked</a>. “Can&#8217;t use onchain, can&#8217;t open channels. Makes custodial Lightning the only option. And all that because some people think it&#8217;s fun to ‘break Bitcoin.’ Why not use Liquid or RSK?” Posch insists that people minting on the Bitcoin blockchain are “privileged.” “The people minting are privileged users,” Posch <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1655545133096398848?s=20">added</a>. “The ones who really need bitcoin as a lifeboat can&#8217;t afford these fees.”</p>
<p>However, not everyone agrees with Posch&#8217;s perspective. Bitcoin Stamps founder Mike in Space <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeinspace/status/1655534644870168577?s=20">said</a> it was a “Terrible take.” “No one is looking to ‘break bitcoin’ we’re just USING it and paying for the privilege to do so,” he wrote. “This is what adoption will, inevitably, looks like: HIGH FEES. This is the system working as designed.” People have also been criticizing the Lightning Network (LN) as the dynamic fees have made it difficult to open channels. “The problems that are occurring with LN were known from the start,” Eric Voskuil <a href="https://twitter.com/evoskuil/status/1655678322792337408?s=20">tweeted</a>. Voskuil added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember this discussion from Scaling Hong Kong. People have been led to believe that chain fees don’t really affect LN and LN doesn’t really push chain fees.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Talks of Censorship Find Their Way Into the Debate</h2>
<p>The recent Ordinal trend has sparked controversy in the Bitcoin community, with some individuals taking issue with Udi Wertheimer, one of the trend&#8217;s originators. In fact, one Twitter user, Btcbello, went so far as to call for Wertheimer to be barred from the upcoming Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami. “Dear [Bitcoin Magazine], [David F Bailey], you should cancel/bar Udi Wertheimer from taking part at [The Bitcoin Conference] immediately,” the Twitter account Btcbello <a href="https://twitter.com/Bitbello/status/1655482261221801985?s=20">wrote</a>. “He thinks he&#8217;s more important to Bitcoin than Satoshi Nakamoto, lol.” Further Btcbello asked people to retweet if they agree and 113 people re-tweeted the post.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin developers have been discussing the network&#8217;s scaling issues, with some proposing the idea of censorship at the node level. “An alternative would be to enforce this ‘censorship’ at the node level and introduce a run-time option to instantly prune all non-standard Taproot transactions. This will be easier to implement, but won&#8217;t hit the road until minimum next release,” one programmer <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-May/021620.html">wrote</a>. Many people simply do not care about the heated arguments as they insist that people have been warning about these issues for years.</p>
<p>“Cracking up. Bitcoin mempool finally gets some usage and the maxis are framing it as a DoS attack on the network,” the Twitter user Foobar <a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1655210834392432642?s=20">said</a>. “They really have not considered even the most basic scenarios, like ‘bitcoin becomes popular and people are willing to pay to use it.’” Samourai Wallet developer Tdevd <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiDev/status/1655874193366347777?s=20">tweeted</a>: “LN was priced out? Someone tell The #Kliq. New Jersey burb Dads not paying their landscapers via LN often enough? (&#8220;It&#8217;s working now.&#8221; LOL!) Waiting for pants wearing wifey to bring home the fiat? The Kliq are out of touch&#8230; Talk the talk without walking the walk. Street stuff.”</p>
<p>So far, there is no clear solution in sight. The developer who wrote about the possibility of censorship at the node level posed the question of whether action should be taken if the volume does not decrease in the coming weeks. Despite the uncertainty, many people believe that the issues will eventually subside. “It is likely the madness over Ordinals will subside,” one person <a href="https://twitter.com/NickLondon_14/status/1655895734347251713?s=20">stated</a>. “Everyone should take a deep breath, Bitcoin will be fine. It will either subside, or we will adapt + grow + build solutions,” another individual <a href="https://twitter.com/DzambhalaHODL/status/1655322581396856833?s=20">said</a>.</p>

His lawyers insist that prosecutors have not obtained consent from Bahamian authorities for the additional counts.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Urges Court to Drop Post-Extradition Charges</h2>
<p>Attorneys representing Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), co-founder and ex-chief executive of the failed cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>, have filed a series of motions in Manhattan federal court on Monday, requesting the dismissal of a number of criminal charges against him.</p>
<p>The lawyers say the charges filed after his extradition to the United States are invalid because prosecutors did not get proper consent from the Bahamian government, Bloomberg reported. They are asking U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan to drop them.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur was accused of running a multibillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors through what was one of the world’s largest crypto trading platforms before it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection amid liquidity issues in November 2022.</p>

<p>U.S. authorities also allege that SBF misused customer funds, including to buy property and increase trading through his crypto hedge fund <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-shows-financial-troubles-plagued-bankman-frieds-alameda-research-as-early-as-2018/">Alameda Research</a>. About a month after the Chapter 11 filing, he was arrested in the Bahamian capital, Nassau, where he had been residing.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried consented to simplified extradition to the United States. His lawyers argue that he still retained his rights under extradition law, insisting he could not be tried on charges beyond those to which he agreed to be extradited for, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried consented to be tried only on the charges in the original indictment for which the government of the Bahamas agreed to extradition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since his arrival in the United States, prosecutors have filed two superseding indictments in the case that brought the total number of charges to over a dozen. Among them are a campaign finance law violation charge and several other counts of fraud.</p>
<p>“After Mr. Bankman-Fried returned to this country, the government superseded the original indictment, not once but twice, improperly adding several new, unrelated charges without first obtaining the express consent of the Bahamian government,” his lawyers elaborated. Although, according to court documents, U.S. prosecutors have notified Bahamian authorities before unsealing these indictments.</p>
<p>SBF has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is expected to face trial in October. His lawyers are also trying to compel the new management of FTX to turn over certain documents to him. They accused the company’s new CEO, John Jay Ray, of acting as “a public mouthpiece for the government by continuing to make disparaging remarks” about Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>

<h2>Central Bank Expected to Eventually Change Its Position on Crypto</h2>
<p>The Nigerian government’s recent approval of a blockchain adoption strategy has been hailed by advocates of the technology as &#8220;a significant milestone for the blockchain industry in Nigeria.&#8221; The advocates have also argued that the unveiling of the strategy document by the government helps to lend &#8220;some form of legitimacy&#8221; to a technology that many still confuse with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigeria-passes-national-blockchain-policy-industry-player-says-central-bank-unlikely-to-lift-crypto-ban/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the approval of the blockchain strategy followed what Isa Pantami, the country’s minister of communications and digital economy, characterized as widespread consultations with some 56 Nigerian institutions and personalities. However, despite the positive step taken by the government of outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari, some in Nigeria’s crypto space have insisted that this will not result in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) reversing its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-nigeria-orders-banks-to-close-accounts-of-crypto-clients-as-remittances-via-traditional-corridors-drop-by-97/">position</a> on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>However, according to Rume Ophi, the executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN), the Nigerian central bank will eventually change its stance and start regulating cryptocurrencies just as countries like Saudi Arabia have done. Ophi also hinted that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-party-says-it-will-review-countrys-blockchain-and-crypto-policy-if-elected/">incoming government</a> of Bola Tinubu might result in changed fortunes for Nigeria’s crypto industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few players in the space think the policy is just an academic exercise but I think with time there will be a balance just like the Markets in Crypto Asset [that has] just [been] approved by the European parliament. The new [Bola Tinubu] administration might just do something different from the outgoing administration,&#8221; Ophi said.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Nigeria&#8217;s &#8216;All-Encompassing Approach&#8217; Hailed</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Binance’s director for West and East Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, said the approval of the adoption strategy means that Nigeria is &#8220;positioning itself as a nation significantly ahead of the curve &#8211; supporting further blockchain innovation, user protection, security and economic competitiveness in the long term.&#8221;</p>
<p>The adoption strategy will also &#8220;add clarity, trust and confidence in the ecosystem&#8221; which is still in its very early stages of development. Anjarwalla also commended what she described as the Nigerian government’s &#8220;all-encompassing approach&#8221; which is laid out in the policy document.</p>
<p>As stated in the <a href="https://nitda.gov.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BlockChainAdoptionStrategy-compressed-1.pdf">National Blockchain Adoption Strategy</a>, the government of outgoing Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari believes the unveiling of the strategy document will likely bolster efforts aimed at &#8220;creating and fostering an efficient, safe, and economically viable digital Nigeria using blockchain technology.&#8221; The Nigerian government said it is also confident that the blockchain will not only facilitate the development of Nigeria’s digital economy but will also &#8220;enable citizens to have more confidence in digital platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>At its conclusion, the strategy document said while the blockchain is said to pose challenges to governments, Nigeria&#8217;s focus will be &#8220;on the application of blockchain to resolve business and governance process inefficiencies.&#8221;</p>

The project seeks to uncover the valuable products, technologies, and know-how of small-to-medium-sized businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an advanced ecosystem, the project opens new opportunities for mutual benefit between Japan and its partners abroad.</span></p>
<p><b>A Project with a Clear Goal</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STAR Project has a clear goal: to help Japanese SMEs effectively communicate their products and technologies. Through this project, SMEs can gain access to funds that they can use to reinvest in their business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign companies can also take advantage of the program. Specifically, foreign companies may purchase products, technology, and know-how from Japanese SMEs and partner up with them. Ultimately, the project aims to revive the economy of Japan and the world, creating a sustainable future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This initiative helps Japanese SMEs market their valued products and technology to overseas enterprises. A win-win situation is possible when both parties benefit from exchanging goods and services successfully.</span></p>
<p><b>Where Does This Initiative Come From?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This initiative originated from a desire to maximize the potential of Japan&#8217;s technological capabilities. Despite the economy’s potential, Japan still falls behind other countries in the overall score of the Global Innovation Index 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This suggests that there are issues beyond technological capability that the economy needs to address. One such issue appears to be public relations activities. Japanese people tend to glorify modesty, with many mistaking this attitude for weak presentation skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STAR improves firms&#8217; abilities to close the gap between Japan&#8217;s technological strength and worldwide innovation index score. With strong technical capabilities and enhanced public relations activities, Japanese SMEs and foreign-affiliated companies can impact the global market more.</span></p>
<p><b>How STAR Intends to Target Its Market</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STAR seeks to target both Japanese SMEs and foreign companies. STAR&#8217;s platform will aggregate SMEs&#8217; goods, technology, and know-how to attract overseas enterprises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will provide various types of support to foreign companies to gain a foothold in Japan and develop their products. In addition, STAR will accept &#8220;StartupersCoin,&#8221; a token to be used by foreign companies for payment of platform services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMEs will receive revenue from revaluing their products, technology, and know-how to reinvest in their firm, particularly abroad. This strategy intends to benefit both Japanese SMEs and foreign companies. Ultimately, STAR seeks to revitalize the economy of not only Japan but the entire world and create a sustainable world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STAR&#8217;s AUCTION is a platform designed to facilitate transactions between foreign companies and Japanese SMEs. All foreign companies registering on AUCTION are subject to screening to ensure their trustworthiness. After passing the screening process, the company can participate in an auction-style bidding process for Privileges, as illustrated below.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the auction, each participant will need to disclose various business details. In case a company wins the Privilege, it will be able to trade products containing confidential information.</span></p>

<h2>Bitcoin Adoption in Liechtenstein</h2>
<p>Daniel Risch, Liechtenstein&#x2019;s prime minister who also serves as the country&#x2019;s finance minister, has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/liechtenstein-allow-payment-certain-state-services-bitcoin-handelsblatt-2023-05-08/">reportedly</a> revealed that Liechtenstein plans to accept bitcoin payments for certain government services. He said in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt Sunday without giving a specific timeframe:</p>
<blockquote><p>A payment option with bitcoin is coming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Risch explained that Liechtenstein plans to accept bitcoin and immediately exchange <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for Swiss francs, the national currency, in order to avoid exchange-rate risks. He also clarified that the cryptocurrency would not be granted equal status as the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>The prime minister additionally told the news outlet that he was open to investing state reserves in bitcoin in the future.</p>

<p>Liechtenstein&#x2019;s reserves, currently amounting to approximately 2.23 billion Swiss francs ($2.51 billion), are invested mostly in securities, Handelsblatt reported, citing the finance ministry.</p>
<p>Risch was further quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are still too risky. But this assessment can of course change.</p></blockquote>
<p>In October 2019, Liechtenstein&#x2019;s legislature <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/liechtenstein-adopts-token-act-to-attract-crypto-business/">approved</a> the &#x201C;Token and Trustworthy Technology Service Providers Act&#x201D; (abbreviated TVTG in German). The government noted in its announcement at the time that with the new law, Liechtenstein becomes the first country to comprehensively regulate the token economy.</p>
