<p><strong>Key Points</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Curve Finance faces multiple exploits on its liquidity pools, resulting in significant losses for projects like Conic Finance, JPEG&#8217;d, Metronome, and Alchemix.</em></li>



<li><em>Speculated reasons include vulnerabilities in programming language versions and manipulation of the &#8220;get_virtual_price&#8221; function, highlighting the need for enhanced security measures in the DeFi space.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Curve Finance, a prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has been facing a wave of attacks on its liquidity pools, resulting in substantial losses for multiple projects.&nbsp;</strong></h5>

<p>The recent incidents, involving Conic Finance, JPEG&#8217;d, Metronome, and Alchemix, have raised concerns within the DeFi community. The string of attacks began with Conic Finance on July 21, where assets were drained due to a connection with LP Tokens on Curve Finance. Subsequently, on July 30, the Lending NFT JPEG&#8217;d project reported an exploit involving the pETH-ETH liquidity pool on Curve Finance, resulting in an $11 million loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same day, Metronome also suffered a $1.6 million loss following a similar exploit. Additionally, Alchemix&#8217;s alETH became a victim, experiencing an estimated $13.6 million loss linked to a liquidity pool on Curve.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curve-launch-1024x538.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curve-launch-1024x538.jpeg" alt="Series of Exploits Hit Curve Finance&#039;s Liquidity Pools" class="wp-image-207197" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curve-launch-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curve-launch-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curve-launch-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curve-launch-750x394.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curve-launch-1140x599.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curve-launch.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Series of Exploits Hit Curve Finance&#039;s Liquidity Pools 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The exact reasons behind these exploits have not been fully disclosed at this time. However, the community has speculated two primary factors. First, vulnerabilities in versions 0.2.15/0.2.16/0.3.0 of the VyperLang programming language are suspected. These versions lack the Re-Entrancy anti-attack filter, enabling hackers to execute rounding attacks and withdraw funds from liquidity pools.</p>



<p>The second conjecture, outlined in a ChainSecurity document, centers on <a href="https://coincu.com/193748-curve-finance-ceo-accused-of-fraud/">Curve Finance</a>&#8216;s &#8220;get_virtual_price&#8221; function. This function, determining the market price of LP Tokens, can potentially be manipulated by Re-Entrancy hackers to create a withdrawal loop and manipulate the oracle price index.</p>



<p>Notably, the ChainSecurity document clarifies that this vulnerability does not impact Curve pools internally. Instead, it may affect platforms utilizing Curve&#8217;s LP Tokens as collateral, enabling false loan withdrawals.</p>



<p>Curve Finance and affected projects are likely to collaborate closely with the community to analyze and address the root causes of these attacks. It is essential for the DeFi ecosystem to implement robust security measures and foster transparency to instill confidence in users and maintain the sustainable growth of the DeFi sector.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Litecoin&#8217;s halving, reducing block rewards from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC, is just four days away.</em></li>



<li><em>LTC price action raises concerns about the bearish influence, despite the potential for the post-halving rise.</em></li>



<li><em>Traders eye $100 milestone, but gradual rally is expected amid market uncertainty and growing interest in newer tokens.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As Litecoin&#8217;s much-anticipated halving draws closer, crypto enthusiasts have high hopes for the blockchain&#8217;s future, while the overall sentiment in the market remains mixed. With just four days remaining until the halving event, excitement, and uncertainty are both evident in the crypto space.</strong></h5>

<p>Litecoin, often referred to as the &#8220;silver to Bitcoin&#8217;s gold,&#8221; has established itself as a prominent decentralized platform, offering rapid and cost-effective payment solutions. With its native cryptocurrency, LTC, Litecoin has gained popularity and traction as an efficient network for conducting transactions.</p>



<p>The upcoming halving is expected to reduce the block rewards from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC, potentially impacting the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price and overall market sentiment. However, amidst the excitement for LTC&#8217;s halving, its price action has been concerning, reflecting bearish influences ahead of the significant event.</p>



<p>Recently, Litecoin&#8217;s price experienced a decline, reaching as low as $87 on July 24. However, it has since recovered to its current level of $89.26, showing a 2% drop in the past week. Over the last 14 days, LTC&#8217;s value declined by 8%. Despite these short-term fluctuations, the altcoin has made substantial gains of nearly 30% since the start of the year and an impressive 60% in the last 12 months.</p>

<p>With the halving approaching, many investors and analysts believe that LTC might witness another surge in price, potentially making it one of the most profitable major cryptocurrencies of the summer. Predictions indicate that the price could return to $100 over the next week and may even rise toward $150 by the end of the year, given a more bullish market.</p>



<p>However, experts caution that LTC&#8217;s rise is likely to be gradual, and traders seeking quick turnarounds might explore newer tokens with significant short-term rally potential. The current price level of around $94.8 broke the bullish trend line from the $70.8 price area, indicating the presence of resistance at $95.4. This resistance could prove crucial as LTC seeks to climb above $100 or faces the possibility of dropping below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $87.6.</p>

<p>Traders will closely monitor the $97.8 price zone, where the bulls and bears are expected to compete fiercely. The outcome at this level may determine the direction of LTC&#8217;s next move. However, the recent bullish momentum, evident in the last three green candles, suggests a potential upcoming rally for Litecoin.</p>



<p>As the market braces for Litecoin&#8217;s halving, the crypto community eagerly awaits to see how the event will unfold and its impact on the broader cryptocurrency landscape. While uncertainty prevails, many investors remain optimistic about LTC&#8217;s future as a prominent player in the crypto space.</p>

<li><em>The move highlights Gucci&#8217;s embrace of NFT technology, providing fans with a unique opportunity to own luxury products with digital collectible value.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Vault Material NFT physical exchange function has been launched by Gucci.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GUCCI--1024x853.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="853" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GUCCI--1024x853.jpeg" alt="Gucci Unveils Exclusive Gucci Vault Material NFT Physical Exchange On 10KTF.shop" class="wp-image-207163" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GUCCI--1024x853.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GUCCI--300x250.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GUCCI--768x640.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GUCCI--750x625.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GUCCI--1140x950.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GUCCI-.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Gucci Unveils Exclusive Gucci Vault Material NFT Physical Exchange On 10KTF.shop 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Gucci, a renowned brand under the Kering Group, has taken a significant leap into the world of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) with the launch of its Vault Material NFT physical exchange function on the partner platform, 10KTF.shop. After months of anticipation surrounding the 2,896 NFTs minted in March, the brand enthusiasts can now redeem their NFTs for premium Gucci products.</p>



<p>The redemption function allows users to exchange 1 NFT for a sleek and stylish wallet, while 3 NFTs can be traded for a coveted Gucci x 10KTF joint luggage bag. The copywriting team adds a playful touch to the description, calling the duffle &#8220;baggage you&#8217;ll want to carry,&#8221; and the wallet a secure option that &#8220;does not require a seed phrase.&#8221;</p>



<p>A cost comparison reveals that the joint luggage bag proves to be the more favorable option for Gucci fans and collectors. While an identical-looking wallet on the brand&#8217;s e-commerce site retails for $460, a similar version of the joint luggage bag without the 10KTF logo is priced at $1790.</p>

<p>Notably, on the popular NFT marketplace, Opensea, the <a href="https://coincu.com/178403-gucci-yuga-labs-kodapendant-nft-necklace/">Gucci</a> Vault Material NFT is currently trading at 0.22ETH, approximately $412. Given its co-branded status with 10KFT, the bag holds additional rarity value, offering a unique and exclusive appeal to its owners.</p>



<p>The NFT was initially rewarded to participants in a 10KTF mission in Battle Town, where access required a Gucci Grail NFT. Participants were then airdropped the exclusive NFT as a special recognition of their involvement.</p>



<p>The brand&#8217;s foray into NFTs signifies the brand&#8217;s eagerness to embrace innovative technologies and explore novel ways of engaging with its audience. By introducing this physical exchange function, the firm creates an exciting avenue for its fans to own tangible luxury products linked to the world of blockchain and digital collectibles.</p>



<p>As the NFT space continues to gain momentum and interest, the Gucci Vault Material NFT exchange on 10KTF.shop provides a glimpse into the evolving intersection of luxury brands and blockchain technology, promising an exciting future for digital and physical collectibles alike.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) achieves native integration with OP Stack, bolstering trust certification in Superchain.</em></li>



<li><em>This milestone sets new standards for information verification and trust establishment, driving wider adoption of certification practices in the blockchain ecosystem.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exciting developments in the world of blockchain certification, as the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) announces the successful native integration with OP Stack.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2022-05-27-at-3.49.18-PM.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="707" height="408" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2022-05-27-at-3.49.18-PM.png" alt="Ethereum Certification Service EAS Achieves Native Integration With OP Stack" class="wp-image-207157" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2022-05-27-at-3.49.18-PM.png 707w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2022-05-27-at-3.49.18-PM-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" title="Ethereum Certification Service EAS Achieves Native Integration With OP Stack 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>With this milestone achievement, all future OP Stack chains will automatically feature the Genesis EAS contract. EAS highlights that this integration will play a crucial role in establishing trust certification as a foundational element in Superchain. Not only will it drive the adoption of certification practices within the Superchain ecosystem, but it will also set new industry standards for information verification and trust establishment.</p>



<p>By seamlessly integrating EAS into OP Stack, Superchain takes a significant step forward in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of data and transactions. Trust certification becomes an integral part of the blockchain, providing users with greater confidence in the information they interact with.</p>



<p>The native integration with <a href="https://coincu.com/205141-op-stack-vs-zk-stack/">OP Stack</a> opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts built on the Superchain network.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Peru issues a decree to regulate the crypto industry and combat money laundering and terrorism financing.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto exchanges are required to adhere to anti-money laundering rules and report to UIF-Peru.</em></li>



<li><em>Other South American countries follow suit in regulating digital assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a bid to tackle the growing concerns of money laundering and terrorist financing related to cryptocurrencies, the government of Peru has taken a significant step forward by issuing a new decree that mandates the regulation of the crypto industry. The decree, which closely follows the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), requires all crypto exchanges operating in Peru to comply with stringent anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, according to <em><a href="https://www.coingraph.news/peru-takes-action-against-crypto-money-laundering-and-terror-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coingraph</a></em>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2239-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2239-1024x576.png" alt="Peru Cracks Down On Crypto Crimes: New Decree Sets Stage For Industry Regulation" class="wp-image-207146" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2239-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2239-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2239-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2239-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2239-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2239.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Peru Cracks Down On Crypto Crimes: New Decree Sets Stage For Industry Regulation 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Under the new regulations, virtual asset service providers, including individuals and companies within <a href="https://coincu.com/178941-peru-promotes-exploration-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peru</a>, are now obligated to report crucial information to the Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF-Peru). This move is aimed at bolstering the country&#8217;s financial system and safeguarding it from illicit activities that might exploit the anonymity often associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>One of the key focal points of the decree is the FATF&#8217;s &#8220;travel rule,&#8221; which underscores the need for implementing robust Know Your Customer (KYC) standards within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By adhering to the <a href="https://coincu.com/190856-bitflyer-restricts-crypto-transfers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">travel rule</a>, exchanges are required to collect and share customer data, thereby enhancing transparency and thwarting potential financial crimes.</p>



<p>The decree, which has already come into effect, is expected to have a considerable impact on the crypto industry in Peru. Stakeholders, including crypto exchanges and other virtual asset service providers, are now faced with the challenge of boosting their compliance efforts to align with the new regulations and foster a secure environment for cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<p>However, the decree has not been without its share of controversy. The Blockchain &amp; DLT Association of Peru (ABPE), a community representing professionals and enthusiasts advocating for the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology, has expressed discontent. The ABPE argues that they were not consulted or involved in the drafting of the proposal, and they are now urging Congress to initiate a dialogue with representatives from the cryptocurrency ecosystem to ensure that all perspectives are taken into account during the regulatory process.</p>



<p>Despite this dissenting voice, the Peruvian government remains steadfast in its commitment to addressing the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies. As other South American countries, such as Brazil and Argentina, also begin to regulate their crypto and digital asset industries, Peru&#8217;s move is in line with a regional trend toward enhancing oversight and compliance within the crypto space.</p>



<p>In a broader context, several other countries worldwide are exploring ways to regulate the cryptocurrency landscape and mitigate potential risks. For example, <a href="https://coincu.com/190038-brazils-central-bank-cbdc-institutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banco do Brasil</a> recently announced plans to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in 2024, signaling the nation&#8217;s intent to embrace digital currencies. Similarly, Argentina&#8217;s securities regulator, the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV), has approved the regulation of Bitcoin futures contracts on the Matba Rofex exchange, enabling investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price without owning the underlying asset.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2240-1024x599.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="599" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2240-1024x599.png" alt="Peru Cracks Down On Crypto Crimes: New Decree Sets Stage For Industry Regulation" class="wp-image-207147" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2240-1024x599.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2240-300x176.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2240-768x449.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2240-750x439.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2240-1140x667.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2240.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Peru Cracks Down On Crypto Crimes: New Decree Sets Stage For Industry Regulation 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>In a collaborative effort to set global crypto standards and explore Central Bank Digital Currencies, the United Kingdom and Singapore have joined forces. This signals a growing recognition among nations worldwide of the importance of adopting regulatory frameworks that promote both innovation and accountability in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.</p>



<p>As the Peruvian government&#8217;s new decree comes into force and the country&#8217;s crypto industry adjusts to the enhanced regulatory landscape, all eyes will be on the outcomes and impact of these measures in the broader fight against financial crimes and the promotion of a safe and thriving digital economy.</p>

<p>The incident was flagged by the crypto tracking company MistTrack, which revealed that funds from the Kannagi Rug had been funneled to <a href="https://coincu.com/190315-tornado-cash-attackers-surrender-governance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tornado Cash</a> in a transaction involving 600 ETH, valued at approximately $1.13 million based on current market prices.</p>

<p>Kannagi Finance, a DeFi protocol operating on the Ethereum Layer 2 network scaling solution, zkSync, emerged just a month ago with the ambitious promise of providing high yields for stablecoin deposits and lending. The project quickly gained immense popularity within the zkSync community for its potential to bring popular DeFi features to the platform. The enticing prospect of maximum returns with low fees/slippage attracted a sizable number of investors, leading to the protocol&#8217;s TVL reaching $2.22 million on July 24.</p>



<p>However, the optimism surrounding Kannagi Finance soon turned to despair as reports of a suspected rug pull surfaced. Data from DeFi TVL aggregator DefiLlama indicated that the project&#8217;s developers allegedly pulled over $2 million worth of user funds, vanishing without a trace. The official website of the protocol has allegedly expired, and attempts to reach out through social media, including the official Twitter account, have proven futile, raising suspicions of an exit scam.</p>



<p>Prior to its launch, Kannagi Finance claimed to offer a distinct experience from other yield farming protocols, vowing to provide users with the best yield and trading fee rewards through its KANA tokens. Although the protocol underwent an audit on June 6, conducted by SolidProof, an audit agency affiliated with Germany-based Make Network, the smart contract code remained closed-source and unverified. This lack of transparency has cast a shadow over the project&#8217;s integrity, as users question the authenticity of the audit.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F2LIdCJbsAAVPqL.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="511" height="584" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F2LIdCJbsAAVPqL.png" alt="Kannagi Finance&#039;s $2 Million User Losses Is Being Redirected To Tornado Cash" class="wp-image-207135" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F2LIdCJbsAAVPqL.png 511w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F2LIdCJbsAAVPqL-263x300.png 263w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" title="Kannagi Finance&#039;s $2 Million User Losses Is Being Shifted To Tornado Cash 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>Rug pulls have become a lamentably common occurrence in the cryptocurrency space, with many investors falling victim to exit scams. In the past year alone, Chainalysis reported that rug pulls accounted for the theft of over $2.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency. The incident with Kannagi Finance adds to the growing concern about the security and trustworthiness of decentralized platforms and projects.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://coincu.com/187304-top-5-new-projects-on-zksync-era-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkSync Era</a> gaining considerable interest as one of the leading layer-2 platforms, it has also become a prime target for scams and security attacks. Recently, <a href="https://coincu.com/205973-eralend-publishes-the-progress-of-the-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Era Lend</a> experienced a significant exploit, resulting in a loss of $3.4 million. The frequency of such incidents underscores the need for robust security measures and thorough due diligence within the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>As the aftermath of the Kannagi Finance rug pull continues to unfold, the DeFi community remains on high alert for potential scams and fraudulent activities. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of conducting comprehensive audits, maintaining transparency, and adhering to best practices to ensure the safety of user funds in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance. MistTrack, the blockchain analytics firm, will closely monitor the situation, providing updates on their investigation into this unfortunate exploit that has left investors in financial distress.</p>

<p>The bipartisan initiative aims to seek clarity on how the guidelines may be influencing emerging technologies like blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), potentially hindering the progress of the United States in this rapidly evolving field.</p>



<p>Representative Bilirakis and Congresswoman Schakowsky, who also hold positions as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee, raised doubts about the tech giant&#8217;s intentions with regard to these emerging technologies. They suspect that the guidelines may inadvertently be used to suppress innovations in the blockchain and NFT space, which could have adverse effects on the country&#8217;s leadership in the tech industry.</p>



<p>The letter to Tim Cook specifically calls for transparency and requests documents relating to Apple&#8217;s policies concerning its <a href="https://coincu.com/205598-apple-store-appears-scam-program-users-beware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS App Store</a>. The lawmakers emphasize the importance of supporting and fostering blockchain, NFTs, and other distributed ledger technologies to ensure the continued growth of the US technology sector.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-1024x576.png" alt="U.S. Lawmakers Question Apple About App Store’s Restrictive Crypto Policies" class="wp-image-207121" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232.png 1960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US Lawmakers Challenge Apple&#039;s Crypto App Store Policies 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>In addition to seeking information about Apple&#8217;s approach to these technologies, the letter poses questions about the company&#8217;s own plans to develop apps utilizing blockchain technology. The lawmakers are also troubled by the possibility that Apple&#8217;s App Store policies might be prioritizing the company&#8217;s revenue over the interests of cryptocurrency-related applications.</p>



<p>Bilirakis and Schakowsky stressed the significance of understanding the App Store Guidelines fully and evaluating how they might impact innovation and America&#8217;s position as a technology leader.</p>



<p>In response to the inquiry, Apple has been given a deadline of August 14 to provide comprehensive answers to the lawmakers&#8217; questions and concerns regarding their crypto policies.</p>



<p>The bipartisan effort has garnered support from notable figures in the cryptocurrency industry. Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, <a href="https://coincu.com/197845-coinbases-clo-criticizes-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Grewal</a>, commended the initiative, expressing approval of the lawmakers&#8217; move to seek clarity on the matter. Similarly, Kristin Smith, the Chief Executive of the crypto advocacy group Blockchain Association, welcomed the inquiry as a step towards ensuring fair treatment of blockchain and cryptocurrency applications on the App Store.</p>



<p>The ongoing scrutiny of Apple&#8217;s App Store policies comes in the wake of recent controversies surrounding the removal of certain cryptocurrency-related applications.</p>



<p>Last month, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://coincu.com/198327-coinbase-ceo-criticizes-apple-damus-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized</a> the removal of the app &#8220;Damus&#8221; from the App Store, considering it disrespectful to users and damaging to the brand&#8217;s reputation. <a href="https://coincu.com/198033-damus-founder-banned-from-apple-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The founder of Damus</a> has vowed to appeal the removal, citing the abuse and misapplication of Apple&#8217;s rules.</p>

<p>As the bipartisan inquiry unfolds, the tech industry, cryptocurrency advocates, and stakeholders eagerly await Apple&#8217;s response, hoping for a clearer understanding of the company&#8217;s stance on blockchain, NFTs, and other emerging technologies. The outcome of this inquiry may play a crucial role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency-related applications on the App Store and their potential impact on technological advancement in the United States.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The new cryptocurrency Worldcoin has sparked immense interest among Kenyans, as the platform rewards users with free WLD tokens in exchange for verifying their humanity through retinal scans, according to <em><a href="https://nation.africa/kenya/news/kenyans-scanning-their-eyeballs-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-tokens-4319600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Nation</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<p>Launched just five days ago on Monday, July 24, the <a href="https://coincu.com/207022-worldcoin-security-audit-reports-92-6-fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin</a> app utilizes special machines, known as Orbs, stationed in 35 countries, including Kenya, to perform the eye-scanning verification process.</p>



<p>The allure of receiving free tokens has drawn a surge of young people to at least 13 Quickmart Outlets in Nairobi, where these Orb devices are located. Eager participants can scan their eyeballs, and upon successful verification, they are rewarded with WLD tokens. These tokens can then be transferred to popular crypto exchanges, such as Binance, and used to purchase various other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The value of the first 25 WLD tokens stands at around Sh7,786 ($55), offering early adopters a tangible incentive to participate in the scheme. James Makau, a bodaboda driver from Ruaka, shared his success story, having earned Sh6,461 ($45.6) from scanning his iris and subsequently converting his tokens into Kenyan shillings by trading them for USDT, a different cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Worldcoin, co-founded by <a href="https://coincu.com/187287-openai-founder-sam-altman-raise-100-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a>, the CEO of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT&#8217;s artificial intelligence platform, has ambitious goals. Their mission is to grant global market access to everyone by providing a verified digital ID, free crypto tokens, and a cryptocurrency wallet. According to their whitepaper, Worldcoin aims to create an inclusive digital currency accessible to people worldwide, regardless of their socio-economic status.</p>



<p>Despite the promising prospects, concerns loom over the true implications of this novel approach to identity verification. Worldcoin&#8217;s founders, Altman and Blania, caution that the journey will be challenging, and uncertainties remain in the outcome. To encourage widespread adoption, participants receive a few WLD tokens as compensation for their involvement, with the exception of the United States, where regulatory scrutiny has made this option unavailable.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Worldcoin Sparks Frenzy In Kenya: Free Tokens for Eye-Scanning Verification" class="wp-image-207118" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Worldcoin Sparks Frenzy In Kenya: Free Tokens for Eye-Scanning Verification 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>The core concept behind Worldcoin&#8217;s iris scanning system is to establish a trustless digital identity to combat the growing capabilities of AI and robots to imitate real humans. The free tokens, in addition to potentially granting voting rights within the platform, are intended to facilitate the cryptocurrency&#8217;s adoption on a global scale.</p>



<p>However, the initial performance of the <a href="https://coincu.com/206599-worldcoin-circulating-supply-111-million-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WLD</a> token has been volatile, with its value doubling shortly after launch but subsequently experiencing a sharp 90% drop. Moreover, the project faces challenges raised by the UK&#8217;s data regulator. The regulator emphasizes the importance of users being able to withdraw consent &#8220;without detriment,&#8221; a challenge given the immutability of blockchain technology, which stores data permanently.</p>

<p>Questions have also been raised by prominent figures in the crypto community, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Ethereum&#8217;s Vitalik Buterin, further adding to the scrutiny. Notably, Worldcoin has garnered significant support from various venture capital investors, such as Reid Hoffman, Andreessen Horowitz, and Coinfund, among others. Presently, 107 million WLD tokens are in circulation, with a notable concentration held by a limited number of entities.</p>



<p>As the excitement around Worldcoin grows in Kenya, the Office of Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) has issued a warning urging caution. The ODPC advises Kenyans against sharing sensitive personal data until they have been provided with sufficient information regarding how their data will be utilized within the platform.</p>



<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s innovative approach to digital identity verification and its incentivization with free WLD tokens have piqued the curiosity of many Kenyans. However, the venture faces challenges and scrutiny over data privacy and the volatility of its cryptocurrency. As the project evolves, careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits will be vital in shaping the future of this ambitious cryptocurrency initiative.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Unchained podcast with host Laura Shin, Torres <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ocDx7zI0uc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> the <a href="https://coincu.com/206974-sec-and-binance-unite-to-thwart-eeon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, of employing a &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; approach towards crypto innovators. He argued that the actions taken by the SEC under Gensler&#8217;s leadership seemed arbitrary and capricious, asserting that the agency had declared war on the entire crypto industry instead of solely focusing on bad actors.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="466" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png" alt="Ritchie Torres Takes On SEC: Advocates for New Crypto Laws and Bipartisan Support" class="wp-image-207094" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png 700w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="Ritchie Torres Takes On SEC: Advocates For New Crypto Laws And Bipartisan Support 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>In alignment with his concerns about the SEC&#8217;s regulatory approach, Torres voiced his support for the recently advanced market structure bill, known as the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act. According to Torres, the FIT Act aims to clarify which crypto assets fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. The bill proposes that the SEC would have authority over a crypto asset until it can be demonstrated that the asset is sufficiently decentralized. Once proven decentralized, the asset would then be categorized as a commodity and would be governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>



<p>On July 26, the House Financial Services Committee voted in favor of the FIT Act, with Torres being among the lawmakers supporting the bill.</p>



<p>Additionally, Torres threw his weight behind another bill intended to regulate stablecoins and ensure that these assets are fully backed by reserves. He referred to stablecoins as &#8220;the clearest usage case of crypto&#8221; and expressed his approval for giving stablecoin issuers the option to comply with either federal regulations or state regulations, such as New York&#8217;s BitLicense.</p>



<p>However, it was reported on July 27 that the stablecoin bill <a href="https://coincu.com/206573-house-lawmakers-locked-in-battle-stablecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed</a> to reach a bipartisan agreement, despite Torres&#8217; endorsement.</p>



<p>Undeterred by the setback, Torres remained optimistic about the future of both bills. He revealed that the market structure bill received six Democratic votes, and he expected even more support for the stablecoin bill. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that the bill&#8217;s progress might be hindered if it fails to gain the support of Rep. Maxine Waters, the ranking member.</p>

<p>Responding to claims that Democratic party members were largely opposed to cryptocurrency development, Torres highlighted that recent cryptocurrency legislation had enjoyed bipartisan backing. He also noted that younger lawmakers appeared to be more open to crypto, while Republicans tended to embrace the crypto industry, possibly due to the party&#8217;s pro-business stance.</p>



<p>Previously, Torres had <a href="https://coincu.com/203714-ritchie-torres-urges-sec-to-rethink-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penned</a> a letter to Gensler, urging the agency to reassess its regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies. This letter was prompted by a legal setback for the SEC in a case involving <a href="https://coincu.com/206896-ripple-prominent-attorney-to-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>, where a federal judge ruled that certain digital-asset transactions did not fall within the agency&#8217;s regulatory scope. Torres used this ruling as evidence to argue that cryptocurrencies themselves were not securities but could be included in investment contracts qualifying as securities.</p>
