<p>Traditional sports betting platforms win when their players lose. Betero turns this centralized concept upside down with a DAO-governed sports betting platform that wins when its players win.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all love to bet, and we all love crypto. Alvaro and I saw the opportunity to create a decentralized sports betting platform that gives back to its players instead of maximizing profits for its owners. A fair platform. And people seem to REALLY love it.&rdquo;&mdash;Frederic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Betero raised over $1,000,000 from more than 1,500 contributors in its presale. The community is strong and ever-growing. Now, Betero wants you to be a part of the decentralized future of sports betting.</p>
<p>The Sports Betting Industry Is Designed to Rip You Off</p>

<p>&ldquo;Centralized sports betting platforms are strong now, pocketing most profits. Their goal is just to serve their shareholders, not the players. Once there is a feasible alternative for the players, they&rsquo;ll switch over without a second thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;Bruno</p>
<p>When you place a bet on a traditional sports betting platform, your bookie doesn&rsquo;t match it. It just acts as an intermediary that connects bettors against each other, charges a fee for doing so, and takes little risk.</p>
<p>What makes this exploitative is that they hide their fee by manipulating the odds.</p>
<p>Instead of representing real-world probabilities, the odds are set to balance the betting pools to make as much profit as possible.</p>
<p>The usual profit margin is between 5&ndash;10% for bets on which team would win a match. Bets on the scoreline of a match have a profit margin greater than 20%, while bets on who would score first climb up to more than 30%.</p>
<p>Multiple bets that combine different types of odds, such as the first scorer and winner, are merged and yield even higher margins for the bookie of up to 50%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Decentralization Meets Sports Betting, Everyone Wins</p>
<p>Betero eliminates capitalism&rsquo;s stranglehold on the betting market and distributes profits back to the players and token holders. It breaks up this margin-based marketplace economy into a decentralized market that rewards the participants.</p>
<p>The Betero system calculates the platform&rsquo;s profit each month and redistributes 25% of it among the players who have a negative betting balance.</p>
<p>The integrated DAO allows Betero token (BTE) holders to submit proposals or vote for existing proposals to change the platform&rsquo;s mechanisms. This includes data providers for the odds, profit redistribution percentages, and supported cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The Decentralized Future of Sports Betting</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betero will become one of the leading betting platforms. It&rsquo;s easy to use, and when the crypto market gets even bigger, we&rsquo;re already here. Each new partnership with a famous athlete helps us gain popularity and with it trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;Frederic</p>
<p>In its presale, Betero raised over $1,000,000 from more than 1,500 contributors. The total staked value of BTE has since risen to around $3,500,000, with the community&rsquo;s spirit going strong.</p>
<p>Be among the first to invest in the future of sports betting and enjoy: ●&nbsp; Early investment ROI. Get the best token prices before the platform&rsquo;s launch.</p>
