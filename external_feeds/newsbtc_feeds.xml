					<description><![CDATA[Blockchain-based payment network Stellar has introduced the open-source “Stellar Disbursement Platform,” aimed at facilitating faster, cost-effective, and transparent digital disbursements worldwide.  Developed by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) over the past year, the platform enables individuals and organizations to execute bulk disbursements using digital assets for various purposes, including gig worker payments and digital aid delivery.  Initially deployed for digital aid disbursements in Ukraine, the turnkey payment solution is now open-source and available for use and further development by anyone. Revolutionizing Global Payments? According to the announcement made on Wednesday, the Stellar Disbursement Platform allows users to send funds to thousands of recipients swiftly within seconds.  It offers numerous applications, including supplier payments, payroll management, and contractor payments, catering to diverse payment needs.  Furthermore, the platform&#8217;s seamless integration with Stellar&#8217;s global network of on and off-ramps, covering over 180 countries, provides recipients with the convenience of converting digital currency to cash &#8220;easily.&#8221; Related Reading: Another Crypto Millionaire Has Been Found Dead Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Foundation, expressed enthusiasm for the open-source release of the Stellar Disbursement Platform. She highlighted its success in facilitating digital aid disbursements in Ukraine and its subsequent evolution into a comprehensive payment solution.  Dixon emphasized the platform&#8217;s potential to empower gig workers, global payroll systems, and creators, fostering a more inclusive and accessible financial future. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, also acknowledged the impact of the Stellar Disbursement Platform on humanitarian aid disbursements. He praised the platform&#8217;s effectiveness in utilizing the USD Coin (USDC) and highlighted its potential to advance global disbursement practices.  The open-source nature of the Stellar Disbursement Platform reflects a commitment to collaboration within the blockchain community. By sharing this tool with the world, Stellar aims to create a more accessible and transparent financial future, benefiting gig workers, global payroll systems, and creators. Overall, Stellar&#8217;s launch of the open-source Stellar Disbursement Platform marks a significant step towards enabling faster, cost-effective, and transparent digital disbursements worldwide. The platform enables individuals and organizations to streamline their payment processes with its wide range of applications and integration with Stellar&#8217;s network.  Stellar Secures Minority Stake In MoneyGram On Tuesday, the Stellar Development Foundation announced its recent participation in the go-private transaction with Madison Dearborn Partners (MDP), solidifying its position as a minority investor in MoneyGram, providing cross-border P2P (person-to-person) payments and money transfer services. As part of this investment, SDF has secured a seat on MoneyGram&#8217;s Board of Directors, granting the foundation an opportunity to contribute to MoneyGram&#8217;s future and digital strategy actively. Per the announcement, joining a group of leaders from the payments, financial services, and technology sectors, SDF&#8217;s presence on the board will leverage its collective expertise to fortify and guide MoneyGram&#8217;s digital transformation. Furthermore, the investment positions SDF to play a vital role in various aspects of MoneyGram&#8217;s journey, including the expansion of its digital business, exploration of blockchain technology, and support for the company&#8217;s overarching mission of facilitating secure and efficient global money movement for individuals and businesses across multiple countries. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Investors Load Up Their Bags As Majority Of Cryptos Nosedive SDF CEO Denelle Dixon expressed confidence in the growth and opportunities arising from this partnership. By fostering solid collaborations with organizations in the payments sector, SDF moves closer to its mission of creating &#8220;equitable&#8221; access to financial services. This announcement signifies a mutually beneficial arrangement where SDF&#8217;s involvement will contribute to MoneyGram&#8217;s digital advancement while aligning with SDF&#8217;s vision of facilitating inclusive financial access. Despite recent protocol announcements and developments, the native token of the Stellar protocol, XLM, has consistently declined over the past two weeks. Currently, the coin is trading at $0.1262, reflecting a 2.4% decrease in value over the past 24 hours and a 13.8% decline within the fourteen-day timeframe.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price action has been stuck in a tight range for weeks leading to the lowest volatility levels in years. A recent report hints at a potential breakout from the current range, but which side will be favorable by the potential spike in volatility? Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculators Retreat As Long-Term Holders Double Down Since $69,000 Peak As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $28,950 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, the BTC’s price saw a slight downtick recording a 2% loss. Other tokens in the top 10 by market cap are underperforming, with many seeing double-digit losses on low timeframes. The Last Time The Bitcoin Price Saw Low Volatility As seen in the chart below, provided by trading desk QCP Capital in a report, annualized volatility for BTC reached critical levels seen for the first time in over five years. The metric last stood at these levels from late 2018 to 2019. The chart above also shows that volatility fluctuated from the low to the yearly high in a cycle that extended for 2019. At that time, Bitcoin and the crypto market were coming out from a prolonged bear market that, as today, left traders and market participants in shambles and with almost no appetite for risk. QCP Capital noted that from 2018 to 2019, the macroeconomic landscape dominated the Bitcoin price action. At that time, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) hiked interest rates, but the COVID-19 pandemic, which operated as a catalyzer, forced it to reverse. The latter occurred from late 2019 to 2020, when the ease in macroeconomic conditions allowed Bitcoin to soar to a new all-time high. Thus, the trading desk believes that a catalyzer is needed to push the price action back to life: The last time trading was this compressed, it was during the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019, and it took a change in the macro environment to revive the market again. However, they noted that the break of the current low volatility environment is not “imminent.” However, the upcoming decision on a Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US could operate as a catalyzer, bringing BTC to its next resistance level at around $34,000, but patience is still required. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Top Assets See High Loss Taking, Is This Bullish? QCP Capital concluded: Will there be a sharp rally that takes us to the 34k resistance – like the prior three times which kissed the support trendline this year? We think it could still be another quiet few weeks before we find out. Cover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Asset management firm Valkyrie has taken a significant step by filing for an Ether or Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) called “Valkyrie Ethereum Strategy ETF” with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Valkyrie Ether Futures ETF Include Secure Collateral Investments According to the filed documents on August 16, the proposed ETF will not directly invest in Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Instead, it aims to acquire a portfolio of Ether futures contracts.  These contracts are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), primarily focusing on contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  The value of these futures contracts will be determined by the CME CF Ether Reference Rate, which tracks the price of Ether across selected cash exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Top Assets See High Loss Taking, Is This Bullish? Per the filing, the Fund intends to employ a &#8220;rolling&#8221; strategy to manage the expiration of futures contracts. As contracts approach their expiration date, they will be replaced by similar contracts with later expiration dates.  These contracts allow investors to speculate on Ether&#8217;s future price movements without owning the digital asset directly.  Apart from Ether futures contracts, the Fund will invest its remaining assets in cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities, collectively called &#8220;Collateral Investments.&#8221;  These may include U.S. Government securities, money market funds, and corporate debt securities rated investment grade or comparable quality. Collateral Investments serve the purpose of providing liquidity and satisfying margin requirements for the Fund&#8217;s futures portfolio.  In addition, the Fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements to help maintain the desired level of exposure to Ether futures contracts. These factors are expected to position the proposed Ether ETF favorably with the SEC, as it aligns with their requirements. Therefore, there is optimism for a promising decision in support of the Ether ETF application. Options Market Supports BTC And ETH Amid Strong US Economy The strength of the US economy has propelled the US Dollar Index (DXY) to deliver a sharp performance, exerting continued pressure on the cryptocurrency market. However, despite liquidity challenges, the gradual decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH prices has not exceeded expectations.  Fortunately, the options market continues providing substantial price support for BTC and ETH, ensuring stability without external liquidity. Digital asset management platform Blofin has closely analyzed the options market and identified significant factors contributing to the ongoing support for BTC and ETH.  Positive gamma has impacted BTC, &#8220;sticking&#8221; its price around the $29,000 mark. Similarly, for ETH, market makers&#8217; hedging behavior around the $1,800 strike price has also provided support, preventing a steeper decline in its price. Despite the overall support from the options market, Blofin&#8217;s analysis reveals a discrepancy in the sentiment of block traders towards BTC and ETH.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu DAO Gets Serious With New Advisory And Investment Firm Block traders, who typically execute large-volume trades, believe more strongly in BTC&#8217;s resilience than ETH. This preference may stem from BTC&#8217;s established position as the leading cryptocurrency and its reputation as a reliable store of value. Overall, Blofin&#8217;s analysis underscores the crucial role the options market plays in supporting BTC and ETH amid liquidity pressures. The positive gamma effect and market makers&#8217; hedging actions have contributed to maintaining the stability of both cryptocurrencies. As of the time of writing, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of trading volume is trading at $1,825. Following in the footsteps of Bitcoin, Ethereum has experienced a 0.8% decline over the past 24 hours, further extending its downward trend over the past 30 days, resulting in a 4% decline during that period.

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum price has been on a rather disappointing run for investors over the last month and this decline has seen it fall to the low $1,800s. As the onslaught continues, the question now is will Ethereum be able to cross the $2,000 resistance before the month runs out? ETH Open Interest On The Rise One interesting factor about the current trend for the digital asset is the rate at which open interest is growing. Now, during times of falling prices where long traders are suffering the most in the market, open interest tends to decline as traders start to pull back from bullish positions. However, that has not been the case lately. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? As data from Coinglass shows, the Ethereum open interest has been on the rise lately. This growth trend is evident across exchanges, a number of which saw a significant jump in their Ethereum open interest. For example, in the last day, the ETH open interest rose 16.77% on CoinEx, 14.48% on OKX, and 13.08% on Bitget. It doesn’t end there as the likes of Huobi and Binance also saw an 8.15% and 5.94% increase in their ETH open interest, respectively. ETH open interest on exchanges jumps 5.98% in 24 hours &#124; Source: Coinglass As a result of this, the total exchange ETH futures open interest in USD moved from $6 billion last week to $6.54 billion on Wednesday. Given that the ETH futures open interest across exchanges was sitting at $6.4 billion on Tuesday, it translates to a 5.98% jump in total open interest in the last 24 hours alone. What Does This Mean For Ethereum Price? The steady rise in the Ethereum futures open interest on exchanges could point to a coming halt in the price decline. This is because, despite the falling prices, investors expect the price of the cryptocurrency to keep rising, which means bullish sentiment has not waned. What the current trend points to is likely a case of investors selling off holdings to secure some profit. But with so much open interest, it means there is not a lot of runway for the sellers. As a result, they will run out of steam soon and buyers will take over the market once more. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? When this happens, it would not take long until the Ethereum price is back up once more. Pulling above $2,000 will be more of a hurdle though. This is because the price of ETH continues to trade below its 50-day moving average, giving bears steam for the resistance at $2,000. ETH bulls hold $1,800 support amid decline &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com However, with the expectations of an Ethereum ETF being approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there could be more volume flowing into the asset soon. This could be just the push ETH’s price would need to break $2,000. But the first ETH ETF deliberation by the SEC will happen in October, crossing August out of the picture.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent interview, Tom Lee, CNBC’s head of research, shared his insights on the potential impact of a Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the price of the largest cryptocurrency in the market.  Lee expressed optimism that introducing a Bitcoin ETF could propel the digital asset to price levels of $150,000 or even $180,000, representing a significant surge from current levels.  Optimistic View On BTC Lee&#8217;s bullish stance on the potential for a Bitcoin ETF to drive price appreciation reflects the growing anticipation within the cryptocurrency community, as an ETF would provide traditional investors with a regulated and easily accessible vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin, potentially attracting substantial capital inflows into the market.  According to Lee, if the SEC were to approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF, it could unlock a new wave of investor interest and significantly boost the price of Bitcoin.  He estimated that this approval could drive the cryptocurrency to $150,000 or even $180,000, representing a substantial appreciation from its current levels.  The endorsement of a regulated ETF would likely instill confidence among institutional investors who have hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market due to concerns about custody and regulatory oversight.

Bitcoin&#8217;s protocol is designed to undergo halvings approximately every four years, reducing the block reward miners receive by half.  Considering the impact of the halving, Lee tempered expectations of Bitcoin reaching six-figure prices in the immediate aftermath. While he expressed confidence in the long-term potential of the digital asset, he suggested that the effects of the halving might delay the realization of such high valuations.  Bitcoin Holds Critical Zone Amidst Intensifying Bull-Bear Battle While continuing to experience a consolidation phase and decide which side will crack first,  Bitcoin has found itself in a critical zone, prompting both bullish and bearish sentiments among market participants.  Keith Alan, co-founder of the analysis firm Material Indicators, has highlighted vital indicators and technical levels that are currently shaping the market&#8217;s direction.  While the bears actively seek to test support and potentially trigger a macro bear market, the bulls have maintained the trading range thus far, keeping the macro bull market prospects alive. The significance of maintaining the range cannot be understated. According to Alan’s analysis, key Moving Averages and the green resistance/support (R/S) Flip Zone have demarcated critical levels that Bitcoin must hold.  As BTC’s price approaches the lower end of the range, below $29,000, Alan closely observes the technical support at the 21-Week Moving Average, as a breach of this level could have far-reaching implications for the overall market sentiment. According to Keith, a break below the range and the subsequent formation of a Lower Low (LL) in price action would signal the onset of a macro bear market. This would imply a prolonged period of downward price pressure and a potential shift in the broader market trend.  Related Reading: Is An XRP Spot ETF Coming To The US Soon?

Despite the bearish signs of “price erosion” and diminishing liquidity, the bulls can still find solace in the fact that they are currently holding the range. This suggests that the market is yet to tip in favor of the bears decisively.  However, the bears remain determined to test this support, making it a crucial juncture for determining the near to mid-term trend of Bitcoin.

					<description><![CDATA[Toncoin (TON) has showcased healthy market status since the end of last week. According to historical data from TradingView, it witnessed a consecutive bullish trajectory from August 11, 2023, until today, August 16. The upward movement drew the attention of investors, resulting in a price increment of over 12% gain in the past seven days. Notably, the latest developments within Toncoin’s ecosystem could be the reason for the market uptick in the past few days.  However, TON’s market value today, August 16, is $1.44, representing a price drop of over 2% in the last 24 hours. With this current price, the asset is almost 19.7% up in the past 14 days, 7% in 30 days, and 17% in the past year.  Related Reading: Best-Selling Author Touts Buy XRP Now, But This Price Is Crucial Recent Development Within Toncoin Ecosystem Pushes TON’s Value There have been a lot of events on Toincoin’s ecosystem attracting massive investor attention and investment. Today August 16, Toincoin shared a post on X about its Indonesia event in Bali slated for August 23, inviting the crypto community to join.  Also, on August 14, Toincoin shared another update on expanding its ecosystem globally through the X platform.

Earlier on August 11, the TON community, via its X handle, shared a tweet from a known payment gateway for cryptocurrencies, NOWPayments.  The report noted that the payment service had incorporated TON into its technology to enable a seamless non-fungible token checkout from different marketplaces. This announcement triggered a rise in the market value of TON, verifiably from historical data on TradingView. From the data, the digital asset kick-started its bullish trend on the same day the news was announced.  It recorded a price gain from $1.259 to $1.302, reflecting a positive price change of about 3.4% in 24 hours. As the news spread, investors filled their portfolios with TON, despite the price decline of some other crypto assets.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has spiked, a sign that the whales may be selling now. Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Gone Up In Recent Days An analyst in a CryptoQuant post explained that the whale inflows have been higher than usual recently. The &#8220;exchange whale ratio&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 inflows to exchanges and the total exchange inflows. Generally, the ten most significant transactions going to exchanges are coming from the whales, so this ratio&#8217;s value can provide hints about how the inflow activity of these humongous investors currently compares with the entire market. When the value of this metric is high, it means that this cohort is making up a significant part of the total market inflows. As one of the main reasons investors deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this trend can be a sign that the whales are currently applying a large amount of selling pressure. On the other hand, low values imply the whales are making up for a relatively healthy portion of the total inflows. Depending on other market factors, such a trend may be neutral or bullish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Related Reading: This Dreaded Candlestick Formation Just Printed: Bitcoin To $18k? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the last couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have hit a high peak in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has recently registered a spike. In this latest surge, the metric had neared the 0.70 mark, implying that almost 70% of the total exchange inflows had come from these humongous investors alone. If these whales have made these deposits to sell their coins, then BTC could naturally feel a bearish effect from this inflow activity. So far, however, the price hasn&#8217;t seen any significant decline, as it continues to be within the range it has been endlessly consolidating for the past few weeks.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has spiked, a sign that the whales may be selling now.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Gone Up In Recent Days</h2>
<p>An analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/64dc966adcf5141b5e5cfcb5-More-Whale-Inflow-than-Average" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> explained that the whale inflows have been higher than usual recently. The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bullish-signal-exchange-whale-ratio-plunges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">exchange whale ratio</a>&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 inflows to exchanges and the total <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-exchange-inflow-spikes-is-this-bearish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">exchange inflows</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, the ten most significant transactions going to exchanges are coming from the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/pepe-whales-load-up-bags-memecoin-jumps-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">whales</a>, so this ratio&#8217;s value can provide hints about how the inflow activity of these humongous investors currently compares with the entire market.</p>
<p>When the value of this metric is high, it means that this cohort is making up a significant part of the total market inflows. As one of the main reasons investors deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this trend can be a sign that the whales are currently applying a large amount of selling pressure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, low values imply the whales are making up for a relatively healthy portion of the total inflows. Depending on other market factors, such a trend may be neutral or bullish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the last couple of years:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/148277/quicktake/0WYGx_c1143591b3d7c0d9acb264b54f45e29e50085bff020c43315d3370297672677d.png?resize=1280%2C702&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio" width="1280" height="702"  data-recalc-dims="1"/></p>

<p>The above graph shows that the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has recently registered a spike. In this latest surge, the metric had neared the 0.70 mark, implying that almost 70% of the total exchange inflows had come from these humongous investors alone.</p>
<p>If these whales have made these deposits to sell their coins, then BTC could naturally feel a bearish effect from this inflow activity. So far, however, the price hasn&#8217;t seen any significant decline, as it continues to be within the range it has been endlessly consolidating for the past few weeks.</p>

<p>In the chart, the quant has also highlighted the instances during the last couple of years where the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio spiked to similarly high values.</p>
<p>It would appear that the BTC price declined shortly after most of these occurrences. In some instances, the bearish effect only occurred with a delay, meaning that even though the recent spike hasn&#8217;t led to a significant price drawdown, it could still do so soon.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the Bitcoin market copes with this potential high selling pressure from the whales this time.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,000, down 2% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent turn of events, multiple executives of the embattled California-based cryptocurrency bank Silvergate Capital have announced that they will be stepping away from their roles at the bank. The announcement comes as the bank remains deep in the throes of liquidation while battling multiple lawsuits linked to its demise. Top Executives Set to Step Down Silvergate Capital Corp announced on Tuesday, August 16, the departure of some of its primary employees working in executive leadership positions in its company. The executives leaving include Chief Financial Officer, Antonia Martino, Chief Legal Officer, John Bonino, and CEO, Alan Lane.  Related Reading: Another Crypto Millionaire Has Been Found Dead Lane and the company’s Chief Legal Officer will be departing on Tuesday, August 16, and according to a financial filing delivered to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Silvergate’s Chief Legal Officer is set to step down on September 30.   The executives&#8217; decision to depart from Silvergate follows the bank&#8217;s announcement in March to shut down operations and liquidate its assets. Lane has served as the CEO of Silver Capital Corp and Silvergate Bank since 2008 and played a pivotal role in Silvergate’s development and growth.  In the absence of a CEO, Silvergate has replaced Lane with Silvergate’s Chief Transition Officer, Kathleen M. Fraher. It has also made Andrew Surry, Silvergate’s Accounting Officer, the principal financial offer in the absence of Martino. Silvergate stated in the filing to the SEC that it will provide each executive severance benefits previously offered to employees laid off through the bank&#8217;s liquidation process.  Earlier this year in January, Silvergate laid off over 180 employees, cutting its workforce by 40%. Again, in May, the bank laid off over 250 workers, leaving a group of about 80 to oversee its liquidation and termination process.  The San-Diego-based bank said in a report that it plans to significantly reduce the number of employees in its company and manage its operations using a skeleton crew.  Stock price falls from $20 to $0.2 &#124; Source: Silvergate Capital Corporation on Tradingview.com Silvergate Enveloped in Lawsuits and Liquidations In November 2022, Silvergate collapsed following the FTX failure and embroilment in fraud. Silvergate, which served as one of the two major banks for cryptocurrency companies in the industry, decided to officially shut down all operations and start a liquidation process.  As a result, stocks plunged by 36% and the bank suffered massive customer withdrawals.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin and the other top assets are observing a high amount of loss-taking currently. Here&#8217;s what this could mean. Investors Of Bitcoin &#38; Other Top Coins Are Capitulating Currently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the current trader capitulation that the largest assets in the market are seeing may be a bottom signal. The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,&#8221; which, as its name already implies, tells us how the profit-taking volume for any given coin compares with its loss-taking volume right now. When this metric has a positive value, it means that the profit-taking volume is higher than the loss-taking volume currently. Thus, such a trend implies that the market as a whole is harvesting profits at the moment. On the other hand, the indicator having negative values suggests loss taking is the dominant behavior among the traders of the cryptocurrency in question right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Analyst Forecasts New ATH by 2024 – Can It Happen? In the context of the current discussion, the assets of relevance are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA). Here is a chart that shows the trend in the ratio of transaction volume in profit to loss for these assets over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been negative for all these assets in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the indicator&#8217;s value for all these top assets has dipped inside the negative territory recently. This high loss realization from the investors has come as the market as a whole has been unable to amass together any significant rally. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that these assets have seen the investors capitulate at different points throughout the year, but the current capitulation event has an interesting feature that was missing from these previous instances: the loss-taking is currently happening for all these large cryptocurrencies. It would appear that traders as a whole have finally started to give up on the market after experiencing endless consolidation, as they are ready to take losses in order to make their exit. The scale of the loss-taking itself is also extraordinary, as the only other time this year that the loss volume overtook the profit volume to this degree was way back in March. Historically, capitulation from investors has made bottoms more probable to form. And from the above chart, it&#8217;s visible that the March capitulation also leads to Bitcoin hitting a bottom. Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit The likely reason behind this pattern is that the investors who exit in losses are generally the weak hands, who had a low conviction in the asset, to begin with. In capitulation events, the coins that they sell at losses are picked up by the more resolute investors, and hence, the market gains a stronger foundation for building up rallies. It&#8217;s possible that the high loss taking that Bitcoin and the others are experiencing currently may also lead to a bottom, if the historical precedence is anything to consider.
