										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Sound.xyz recently announced the addition of support for Ethereum Layer-2 Optimism.</em></li>



<li><em>The music NFT distribution platform minted more than 150,000 music NFTs on Optimism this month.</em></li>



<li><em>The NFT minted on Optimism is almost the same as the number of music NFTs minted on Ethereum over the past year.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sound.xyz is tuning in with the major Layer 2 scaling solution, Optimism, to address important Web3 industry challenges, such as high gas prices and sluggish transactions connected with Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet.</strong></h5>

<p>The music NFT platform Sound.xyz has acknowledged Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, with a Eurodisco dance tune nicknamed &#8220;V-Buterin.&#8221; Importantly, the music is free to listen to till June 19 at 7:00 p.m. Sound.xyz, a Web3 music portal, provides it as a free-to-mint NFT for interested investors and NFT aficionados.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1311-1024x542.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="542" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1311-1024x542.png" alt="Sound.xyz Minted 150,000 Music NFTs, Impressive Start On Optimism" class="wp-image-195966" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1311-1024x542.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1311-300x159.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1311-768x406.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1311-750x397.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1311-1140x603.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1311.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Sound.xyz Minted 150,000 Music NFTs, Impressive Start On Optimism 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to <a href="https://dune.com/web3academypro/t4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune analysis</a>, since the announcement of Optimism&#8217;s debut on June 13, the music NFT distribution network Sound.xyz has minted more than 150,000 music NFTs on Optimism this month, which is about the same as the number of music NFTs minted on Ethereum over the last year. The majority of the mining comes from the V Buterin track NFT published by Optimism Collective.</p>



<p>Sound.xyz achieves a phenomenal 90% decrease in gas expenses by using the Optimism Layer 2 technology, which is a major success given that the rates have often surpassed the cost of the music. Moreover, as a result of this collaboration, transaction speeds on the music-centric NFT marketplace have increased sixfold, and collectors now have additional alternatives for paying for records, including credit cards, Mainnet ETH, and Optimism ETH.</p>



<p>Despite of this partnership, die-hard Ethereum supporters may still deploy their contracts on Ethereum&#8217;s Layer 1 mainnet, enabling music enthusiasts to gather and discover music across both chains. They must, however, spend Optimism ETH while purchasing music on Optimism, which is readily obtained by bridging monies with the official Optimism Bridge. Collectors may now pay using Mainnet ETH and get their music NFTs on the Optimism chain.</p>

<p>Moreover, Cherished artists Rae Isla and Sammy Arriaga will begin off their debut with their song &#8220;Heartbreak Closer.&#8221; Other artists expected to release songs this week include ROHKI, TK the Legend, Bloody White, Reo Cragun, Sara J Phillips, and Daniel Alla.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, Music and Optimism share a goal of supporting ecosystem contributors and innovators. This collaboration is just the beginning of Web3 development. Even better, Sound teases more intriguing upgrades and changes in the works.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance.US, Binance and the SEC have come to a mutual agreement.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance.US will ensure that no authorities from the global exchange, Binance Holdings, have access to private keys for wallets or hardware wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>The deal was approved by Judge Amy Berman Jackson.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to court records, Binance, Binance.US, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission entered into an arrangement to guarantee that only the exchange&#8217;s subsidiary US workers may access client cash in the near term.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1308.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="680" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1308-1024x680.png" alt="Official: Binance.US Is Separated From Binance Holdings After Court Approved SEC Deal" class="wp-image-195957" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1308-1024x680.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1308-300x199.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1308-768x510.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1308-750x498.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1308-1140x757.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1308.png 1256w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Official: Binance.US Is Separated From Binance Holdings After Court Approved SEC Deal 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission struck an <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195885-binanceus-and-sec-agreement-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreement</a> with Binance late Friday that would enable the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange to continue operating in the United States and protect client assets while the business fights a federal lawsuit.</p>



<p>According to the latest announcement, the deal has been approved by the federal judge overseeing the case. According to the filings, Binance.US will take steps to ensure that no Binance Holdings officials have access to private keys for its various wallets, hardware wallets, or root access to Binance.US&#8217;s Amazon Web Services tools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update: Judge Amy Berman Jackson apparently just approved the Proposed Stipulation and Consent Order,&quot; filing a &quot;Consent Order&quot; which, upon first glance (I have not reviewed it line-by-line) looks the same as the order agreed to by the parties.

<p>Funds belonging to Binance.US users would be placed in separate digital vaults accessible exclusively to the US exchange — not to the exchange&#8217;s bigger worldwide company or its creator, Changpeng Zhao. Binance.US is allowed to transfer firm assets solely to make payments for costs or to discharge obligations accrued in the usual course of business, according to the agreement.</p>

<p>Additional elements in the proposed deal include Binance.US creating new crypto wallets that no workers of the global exchange will have access to, providing extra information to the SEC, and agreeing to an accelerated discovery timeline, according to the documents.</p>



<p>After the filing of fraud allegations against the exchange on June 5, the SEC proceeded to freeze the firm&#8217;s US assets, which the exchange&#8217;s attorneys said would put it out of business in the US.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitwise Asset Management has filed a proposed regulation modification to accommodate its intended Bitcoin spot ETF.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitwise Asset Management has resubmitted its proposal for a Bitcoin spot ETF.</em></li>



<li><em>This move follows BlackRock, the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager, expressing interest in a Bitcoin ETF.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitwise Asset Management has <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2023/SR-NYSEArca-2023-44.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a proposed regulation modification to accommodate its intended Bitcoin spot ETF.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1305.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1305-1024x538.png" alt="Bitwise Continues Hoping For New BTC Spot ETF Application Filing Following BlackRock" class="wp-image-195948" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1305-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1305-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1305-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1305-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1305-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1305.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitwise Continues Hoping For New BTC Spot ETF Application Filing Following BlackRock 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The prior proposal was denied by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, during the June application period last year. The SEC said at the time that Bitwise&#8217;s ETF could not implement an acceptable surveillance-sharing mechanism, could not offer protection against market manipulation, and could not demonstrate that the relevant market was of considerable size.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the SEC accepted the possibility of future filings to resolve these issues, and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188401-grayscale-and-bitwise-abandon-ether-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitwise</a> is currently attempting to establish compliance in its most recent filing.</p>



<p>In our most recent submission, BitWise requested a formal schedule for the SEC&#8217;s decision-making process. The corporation specifically requested a decision on approval, denial, or the beginning of additional processes within 45 to 90 days. Its goal is to improve the assessment process by increasing clarity and openness.</p>

<p>While the application has been made public through the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), it is vital to highlight that the SEC has yet to process it. As a result, the specific decision-making timeline remains unknown at this moment.</p>



<p>Following the recent revelation of BlackRock&#8217;s June 15 submission of a Bitcoin spot ETF application, Bitwise has responded with its own file. Given the company&#8217;s track record of successful ETF submissions with the SEC, market players are optimistic about BlackRock&#8217;s application.</p>



<p>But, analysts are skeptical that BlackRock&#8217;s present plan would be approved. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF and has rejected multiple other applications from the cryptocurrency and banking industries.</p>

<p>Bitwise CEO Matthew Hougan addressed this regulatory landscape in March, indicating that although he expects the United States would ultimately approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, the current regulatory climate offers hurdles for organizations attempting to launch such a fund. Hougan pointed out that there is now no clear road to approval.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sappy Seals is one of the most notable collections in early 2023 since it is one of many relatively minor NFT collections that gain momentum on the secondary market. The NFT volume of Sappy Seals has increased significantly, but the floor price trading remains the same. It is one group of top-tier NFT PFPs that we can&#8217;t get enough of, coming in not far behind the dominating NFT PFPs like BAYC and Crypto Punks.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1299.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1299-1024x341.png" alt="Sappy Seals Review: NFT Collection Has An Impressive Community" class="wp-image-195939" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1299-1024x341.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1299-300x100.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1299-768x256.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1299-750x250.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1299-1140x380.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1299.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Sappy Seals Review: NFT Collection Has An Impressive Community 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>So what is Sappy Seals? Let&#8217;s find out more about this project with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Sappy Seals?</h2>



<p>Sappy Seals, as the name indicates, is a seal-themed NFT PFP, each having its own set of attributes. Sappy Seals mnh là mt NFT meme và là ngi tiên phong v NFT meme trong Web3.</p>



<p>Wab. eth|Seal Father released 10K Sappy Seals NFT to the Ethereum Blockchain. These NFT Seals are adorable and have unique traits.</p>



<p>Each seal wears a distinctive outfit, such as full sleeves, half sleeves, or sleeveless. These outfits are in various color combinations. While some seals are dressed in a cool Havana half-shirt, others are dressed in a hoodie, while yet others are dressed in party t-shirts.</p>



<p>The designer has maintained the individuality of the Sapp Seals heads as well. Although some wear casual caps, others don Mexican hats, and some of the Sappy Seals even have wings.</p>



<p>The project launched in August 2021 and quickly received the attention of the community when it sold out all the NFTs in the collection in just 10 minutes.</p>



<p>Thus far, the highest price paid for a Sappy Seal has been over 150 ETH, or $262,000 at the time of writing, while the average price for a Seal NFT is around 0.473 ETH. The Seals&#8217; currency floor price is at 0.438 ETH, with a total transaction volume of 31.4K ETH, which is extremely good. Seals are appealing to many individuals because of their lower cost when compared to other high-quality PFP NFTs and their potential to one day rank among the top-tier NFT collections.</p>



<p>In order to increase the sustainability of our environment, the Sappy Seals are also donating a portion of their overall sales earnings to ocean cleaning efforts. Proactive assistance for marine habitats is therefore, a critical component of the Seal&#8217;s future strategy.</p>



<p>Sappy Seals now have roughly 2,200 owners and a large community of fans. The Sappy Seals community, like many other NFT communities, is as lively as it is varied.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Characteristics</h2>



<p>Each NFT is made up of 7 different properties including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hidden has only 1 NFT in its collection.</li>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">NFT metrics</h2>



<ul>
<li>NFT Collection Name: Sappy Seals</li>



<li>Classification: PFPs</li>



<li>Total amount of NFTs: 10,000 NFT</li>



<li>Blockchain: Ethereum</li>



<li>Number of features: 7</li>



<li>NFT contract: 0x364C828eE171616a39897688A831c2499aD972ec</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Arfing community</h2>



<p>The Sappy Seals, unsurprisingly, have their most active place on Discord. With around 10,000 members, the Discord server is now one of the most active Discord NFT groups available. You may check out the Seals marketplace, interact with the community, play mini-games, and much more on the site, which makes the community more appealing.</p>



<p>The community-led Sappy Seals, describe itself as the most inclusive, ethnically diverse, and forward-thinking group in this sector. Additionally, these Seals take pleasure in their community-based content production and are always looking for what&#8217;s next.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, we&#8217;re all aware that people who just debate floor price variations are only interested in profit and are uninterested in the project itself. In the Sappy Seals Discord, participants actually like talking about the project&#8217;s plans, guesses, and any other unimportant subject.</p>



<p>The founders of Sappy Seals broke down the traditional barrier between creators and holders, stressing contact with all members.</p>



<p>Twitter is also used by the Seals community. If you&#8217;ve seen Sappy Seals tweets, you&#8217;ve probably seen the strange behavior of &#8216;Arfing,&#8217; which is really emulating the sound produced by genuine seals. Arfing is used by the community to greet each other, convey enthusiasm, and join in on a collective arf.</p>



<p>The Sappy Seals NFT creators want to make the whole leap to become a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. They want the Sappy Seals community to be a part of this process, which is why they upped the loyalty to 2.5% on September 7, 2021. This implies that everyone will get 2.5% of every Sappy Seals NFT sale.</p>



<p>This community&#8217;s extraordinary growth is poised to accelerate when the Sappy Seals join the metaverse, which will be enabled by the DeFi platform PIXL.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">PIXL token</h2>



<p>Simply defined, PIXL is a governance token obtained by stacking Sappy Seals NFTs. With a PIXL token, you may vote on various community suggestions, such as how to handle the treasury.</p>



<p>Apart from that, if you possess Sappy Seals NFT, you will be able to participate in PIXL Farming on the PIXL/ETH pools. You may mint Sappy Seals NFTs and utilize them later in the Metaverse through farming.</p>



<p>The farmable NFTs from the PIXL/ETH pool will be of varying rarity, and the window will only be available for a short time.</p>



<p>Sappy Seals NFT has four distinct kinds of pools, with the lowest tier pool requiring one week of commitment and the highest tier pool requiring four weeks. Users may quit the pool before the commitment term is completed, however, there will be a fee.</p>



<p>The following farm economics have been created by the Sappy Seals team:</p>



<ul>
<li>To join, you must have a certain number of LP tokens.</li>



<li>If you want to leave the pool before the commitment term is over, you will be charged a small fee.</li>



<li>Holders with a longer time commitment, such as four weeks, will get the rarest things.</li>



<li>The pool will shut after a set amount of Sappy Seals NFTs have been minted, making room for a fresh rotation.</li>



<li>Seal Gear NFTs may be stacked.</li>
</ul>



<p>The PIXL token is the base-layer token for The Pixelverse – a cross-community metaverse for gaming, earning, and meeting people. PIXL is a project housed on the BNB Smart Chain that is bringing the world of advertising to the metaverse.</p>



<p>That is its own deep rabbit hole that we want to investigate in a future essay. All you need to know for now is that Sappy Seals is using the platform to expand into the metaverse. Sappy Seals will coexist alongside Winter Bears, 2px, and other intriguing metaverse projects since PIXL is cross-platform. The potential of such a crossover metaverse remains unexplored, but the chances are promising.</p>



<p>One feature that deserves your notice is the ability to stake Sappy Seals in order to earn PIXL tokens. What makes Sappy Seal Staking unique is that PIXL offers rarity-based rewards, which means you will get a return dependent on how rare your NFT is. Since there are 6000 blocks mined every day, it is now feasible to produce approximately 0.033 PIXL per minute.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">P2E game</h2>



<p>The next game is a natural next step in the Sappy Seal metaverse expansion. The game is currently under development and will employ a play-to-earn paradigm that will allow players to use NFT-enabled virtual items in-game. The game&#8217;s alpha version is presently playable on the Sappy Seals website.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How to buy Sappy Seals NFTs?</h2>



<p>Sappy Seals NFTs may be found on OpenSea.io and Rarible. Nevertheless, not all of the Sappy Seals NFTs are for sale. Certain Sappy Seals NFTs are exclusively accessible via auction. To purchase the NFTs or place a bid, sign in to your OpenSea or Rarible account using your digital wallet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Team</h2>



<p>Sappy Seals is developed by Seal Team Six, consisting of 6 anonymous members. In it, Wab. eth|Seal Father is the head and founder of Pixlverse – a metaverse platform that has strategically partnered with many other NFT projects to build a powerful group.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Should you own Sappy Seal NFT?</h2>



<p>Sappy Seals are a fantastic investment since they are reasonably priced and are on the A-list of NFT PFPs. The seals are a highly sought-after collection, thanks to the strong community support and all the recent incursions into the metaverse. You may even take advantage of the recent price drop to invest in the Seals. At the same time, this should not be construed as financial advice. NFTs are subject to high volatility and other pricing hazards. Be sure to do extensive research before investing in NFT. The NFT excitement is expected to continue until 2024, and Sappy Seals may expand significantly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Sappy Seals is a unique NFT collection that develops in response to the Meme trend and aspires to introduce NFT memes into the Web3 global environment.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not simply the vow to clean up the ocean; the team is also preparing games and impending Metaverse infrastructure initiatives to help the community grow even more.</p>



<p>They are providing very rare Sappy Seals NFTs in exchange for just 4 weeks of dedication, which is really unusual.</p>



<p>Other than that, their market pricing is rather consistent and is likely to remain so &#8211; but you must exercise caution when dealing with NFTs.</p>



<p>Lastly, every Sappy Seals member wants to be a part of something larger. If you come across a project with a decent track record and a staff that seems to understand how to establish a brand, you&#8217;re probably on the right route to discovering the greatest long-term community to contribute to.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Celestia is a Modular Blockchain that increases speed and improves performance for the blockchains it is attached to.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In recent times, the phrase &#8220;Modular Blockchain&#8221; has emerged in the crypto community as a technological innovation for the development of the DeFi market. Modular Blockchain is expected to be one of the next developments, helping to overcome the limitations of the &#8220;old&#8221; Blockchain. So what is a modular blockchain and what is the potential for the first project &#8211;<a href="https://news.coincu.com/135258-celestia-labs-55m-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Celestia</a>? Let&#8217;s find out through the article below.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why Modular Blockchain?</h2>



<p>Modular Blockchain is a blockchain that shares the above tasks for many interconnected networks, helping to optimize performance and increase scalability many times.</p>



<p>Before that, almost all the blockchains we know are monolithic blockchains, such as Solana, Near, Binance Smart Chain, etc. Even Ethereum, at the present time, is also a monolithic blockchain, but Ethereum has a plan to become a modular blockchain in the future. Monolithic Blockchain is a Blockchain that handles all of the above tasks, work on a single layer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1295.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="550" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1295-1024x550.png" alt="Celestia Review: Pioneering Modular Blockchain Project To Extend Web3" class="wp-image-195931" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1295-1024x550.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1295-300x161.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1295-768x413.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1295-750x403.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1295-1140x612.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1295.png 1167w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Celestia Review: Pioneering Modular Blockchain Project To Extend Web3 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>There is no denying what the Monolithic blockchains have brought to Crypto, but they are slowly reaching their limits. The most typical is the problem of Ethereum&#8217;s scalability, high cost, and slow speed that create barriers between a large number of users.</p>



<p>We will need a newer, more efficient version of the Blockchain that addresses the limitations of the Monolithic Blockchain, and the Modular Blockchain is the answer.</p>



<p>Sharing tasks for multiple interconnected networks is similar to the production line example above, helping to optimize the resources of each department and help create a more efficient product, not to mention the fantastic scalability they can offer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Celestia?</h2>



<p>Celestia is the first Modular Blockchain that allows other Blockchains to link to use the consensus mechanism as well as the data available, thereby increasing the speed and improving the performance of the attached blockchains.</p>



<p>At the present time, Monolithic Blockchains such as Near, Solana, etc. have to perform many functions at the same time, such as calculating and processing transactions, implementing consensus mechanisms, and storing data. This leads to a problem in the future as Blockchain grows with increasing transaction volume causing network congestion. This problem is familiar and Ethereum itself has been developing Layer 2 to help free Layer 1 from the task of computation and transaction processing.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1291.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="530" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1291-1024x530.png" alt="Celestia Review: Pioneering Modular Blockchain Project To Extend Web3" class="wp-image-195927" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1291-1024x530.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1291-300x155.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1291-768x397.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1291-750x388.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1291-1140x590.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1291.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Celestia Review: Pioneering Modular Blockchain Project To Extend Web3 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>With a similar vision to Ethereum, Celestia will also have a two-layer model: Consensus &amp; Data Layer and Execution Layer. However, the Execution Layer at Celestia is not just rollups of offchain transaction processing, but can also be different independent blockchains and connect to Celestia via cross-chain bridge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does Celestia work?</h2>



<p>Celestia adopts a modular architecture, which separates the blockchain stack into specialized components. The core functions, consensus, and execution, are separated into different layers.</p>



<p>A monolithic architecture can be limited. The execution and consensus functions are encapsulated in a class, and then the smart contract will be built on this encapsulated layer. Users are constrained to an execution environment, limiting the ability to optimize and specialize for specific use cases.</p>

<p>A modular architecture separates consensus and implementation into separate layers. The execution layer lives on its own Blockchain, allowing optimization and specialization for specific use cases. Any developer building decentralized applications built on this architecture will get better flexibility, security, and scalability.</p>



<p>In a modular blockchain, data availability sampling can be achieved, allowing a node to verify a block with a small sample, such as verifying a 100 MB block with only 10 KB of data. A machine with minimal processing power, like a smartphone, can act as a button.</p>



<p>When developers build dApps on Celestia directly, they can choose which execution environment to use and run as many execution environments in parallel as they like. In a monolithic environment, consensus tightly ties the rules of execution, meaning that users are bound to whatever execution environment the base chain supports.</p>



<p>In the future, we may see the Tendermint chain and the Cosmos region using Celestia as the available data layer. These zones will minimize trust by using proofs of fraud to provide the Cosmos ecosystem with a uniform level of security and help reduce reliance on social governance when dealing with harmful zones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What Are the Highlights of Celestia?</h2>



<p><strong>Separation of consensus layer and implementation layer</strong>:</p>



<p>Celestia provides a consensus layer with an open pending mechanism so that developers of the implementation can plug in and run quickly. Along with that, the separation of the two layers helps the developer of the implementation layer to customize the Blockchain to specialize the output function, for example, for NFT, Game is for speed, and Defi is for security.</p>



<p><strong>Data proof available:</strong></p>



<p>Celestia encrypts block data with a 2-way reed-solomon so that all data can be tested against a small sample of randomly selected data instead of having to check the entire data. If the data is encrypted incorrectly, the network will be notified via fraudulent evidence of its availability. This makes it possible for Celestia to store more data and reduce validation times.</p>



<p><strong>Off-chain transaction processing (Rollups):</strong></p>



<p>With the above data storage structure, Celestia shows the potential to be the perfect environment to develop Rollups (off-chain transaction execution) when: Optimistic rollup needs data to prove the invalidity of the rollup transaction error and zk-rollup needs complete data to re-aggregate the state of the chain.</p>



<p><strong>Protecting light clients in cross-chain interactions:</strong></p>



<p>Celestia&#8217;s cross-chain interoperability implementation will not assume that the light clients give real public information but that the interaction will only be opened once the secure transaction is correctly verified.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Available products</h2>



<ul>
<li>Ring Signatures: are electronic signatures that allow the sender to conceal their identity from others in a group. To create a ring signature, Celestia combines a sender&#8217;s key and the public keys on the Blockchain. It hides the identity of the sender, since it is computationally impossible to determine which key was generated and by whom.</li>



<li>Stealth Addresses: creates a layer of anonymity between your public address and the Celestia you own. Addresses on the publicly available Celestia blockchain are hidden addresses, so personally identifiable information is completely off the Blockchain.</li>



<li>Ring Confidential Transactions: Ring CT technology allows the amount sent for a transaction to be hidden while maintaining the network&#8217;s ability to verify transaction value. As a result, transactions no longer need to be split into different denominations and wallets are free to choose ring members from any output and regardless of amount, which provides a significant improvement in terms of privacy for Celestia.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tokenomic</h2>



<p>Celestia is intended to have a token that can be used to secure the network through a Proof of Stake mechanism and to pay transaction fees on the network and eventually a fee burning mechanism similar to EIP-1559 in Ethereum. However, not much information has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Celestia is in the process of implementing Incentivized Testnet &#8211; this is usually a campaign to encourage people to experience the testnet and receive airdrops (such as Aptos once held 3 Incentivized testnets and &#8220;huge&#8221; airdrops for participants).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Scalability is one of the biggest barriers to the full adoption of blockchain technology. While a few Layer 1 scaling solutions exist, most are focused on block production, not block verification. With scalability, security and decentralized features, the first Modular Blockchain Network, Celestia, is preparing us for Web 3. Celestia is not the only solution as Polygon has Avail and Ethereum there&#8217;s Danksharding. However, Celestia is unique because it focuses on ease of integration, fast delivery, and user experience.</p>



<p>Celestia is currently mostly still in the product development stage. With the testnet implementation, the project is gradually approaching the time of official operation. Currently, this Blockchain has not conducted any more funding rounds. Still, I predict that when the testnet is completed and the mainnet is launched, the project will continue to raise more capital in the next rounds.</p>



<p>During this time, you can participate in testnet node programs to receive retroactive. Although not officially put into operation, Celestia is also one of the leading projects in a completely new niche. Therefore, we have the right to wait and expect its explosion like the Solanas, Avalanche…</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Troubled cryptocurrency firm Delio shared about the opening of withdrawals during a press conference with investors today.</em></li>



<li><em>The CEO said they would continue to withdraw the money in stages but did not disclose the specific time.</em></li>



<li><em>During the press conference it was also revealed that Haru Invests, the main cause of the company&#8217;s troubles, is in the process of bankruptcy.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Decenter, South Korean crypto-finance firm <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195747-haru-invest-delio-action-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delio</a> announced at an investor briefing in Seoul that it will resume withdrawals in phases.</strong></h5>

<p>Yesterday, Delio also shared the plan of a press conference to explain the company&#8217;s current situation to investors after getting into trouble with partner company Haru Invest which caused it to stop withdrawing money. However, when the press conference took place, participants felt that this was just a statement to appease investors, but the specific repayment period, method and extent of damage were not disclosed.</p>



<p>Delio CEO Jeong Sang-ho said that Delio is currently in an unstable state as it depends on the situation of Haru Investment, the decommissioned crypto exchange, and B&amp;S.</p>



<p>In the press conference, it was revealed that Haru Invest is conducting bankruptcy proceedings. Delio claims to guarantee as much capital compensation as possible, such as capital raise paid by third parties. Starting next week, we will switch to a normal working system.</p>

<p>Investors who attended the briefing that day asked again about Delio&#8217;s ratio of trust assets to Haru Investment. Still, CEO Jung said, &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to answer at this point because This is a flexible situation.&#8221; He indirectly replied, &#8220;I will be in touch through the organization when the investor representative meeting is established.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ahead of the June 14 news, Delio, a South Korean crypto finance company, announced that it will suspend withdrawals from 18:30 local time, and it said the move is made amid increased market volatility after Haru Invest halted withdrawals.</p>

<p>Pawnfi Protocol, a DeFi product that introduces the pawn concept, recently faced a security breach. The attacker was able to exploit the contract by borrowing APE tokens using an NFT that was already staked in the APE Staking Pool. The borrowed APE tokens were then transferred and held within the project contract. </p>



<p>Subsequently, the attacker reinvoked the depositAndBorrowApeAndStake() function, causing the contract to stake the APE tokens in the APE Staking Pool. At this point, the contract mistakenly recognized the newly staked funds as being deposited by the attacker, giving them access to withdraw the APE tokens.</p>

<p>This attack was due to the protocol&#8217;s failure to verify whether the NFT had actually been transferred when users used a specified NFT as collateral for borrowing. The security breach was detected and reported by BlockSec, a blockchain security firm.</p>

In addition to supporting mainstream assets, Pawnfi covers a wide range of Non-Standard Assets, including NFTs, LP tokens, tokenized rights, and minor cryptocurrencies with relatively less liquidity.</p>



<p>Pawnfi&#8217;s concept of using pawns as collateral provides a unique approach to lending and leasing markets. The platform&#8217;s appraisal process is designed to ensure that borrowers receive a fair value for their assets, while lenders are protected from potential losses. Pawnfi&#8217;s liquidity provision ensures that both borrowers and lenders have access to the assets and funds they need, while the use cases for NSAs offer a range of opportunities for asset owners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Binance, Binance.US and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have announced an agreement to ensure that only US-based employees can access customer funds.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>After many negotiations, Binance.US and the SEC have agreed to remove the option of freezing Binance.US</em> <em>assets.</em></li>



<li><em>An agreement was reached to ensure that only Binance.US employees can access client funds.</em></li>



<li><em>The US branch of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange platform will share details on business expenses, including cost estimates, in the coming weeks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Coindesk, Binance, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195587-binanceus-fires-50-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a> and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have announced<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.70.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an agreement </a>to ensure that only US-based employees can access customer funds.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1282.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="828" height="466" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1282.png" alt="Binance.US And SEC Reach Agreement On Access To US Customers&#039; Money" class="wp-image-195890" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1282.png 828w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1282-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1282-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1282-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" title="Binance.US And SEC Reach Agreement On Access To US Customers&#039; Money 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Under the proposed agreement, Binance.US will ensure that no employee of Binance Holdings (referring to Binance exchange) has access to the private keys for critical wallets, hardware wallets, or other access rights &#8211; administrative access to Binance.US Amazon Web Services tools. Furthermore, the US crypto exchange platform will share details on business expenses, including cost estimates, in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>This proposed settlement comes in response to the SEC&#8217;s proposal to freeze the assets of Binance.US while pursuing the exchange over securities-related allegations. The regulator said it was concerned that funds could be moved overseas or that records would be destroyed if a temporary containment order (TRO) was not issued. Lawyers for Binance.US protested, arguing that freezing all of their assets would be tantamount to a &#8220;death sentence.&#8221;</p>



<p>On Thursday, the two sides released a report saying the parties worked hard to reach an agreement. Some progress has been made, and the parties are continuing to negotiate a proposed deal to submit to the court.</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Judge Amy B. Jackson set a deadline for the SEC and Binance to compromise on the SEC&#8217;s request to freeze all assets of Binance.US, BAM Management, and BAM Trading.</p>



<p>Other terms in the proposed agreement would allow Binance.US to create a new crypto wallet that employees of the global exchange do not have access to, provide additional information to the SEC, and agree to a schedule express discovery. Customers in the US will still be allowed to withdraw during this time.</p>



<p>The proposed settlement, if accepted, would address some of the SEC&#8217;s stated concerns as the broader lawsuit it filed will make its way through the justice system. The SEC sued Binance and its US affiliate last week for allegedly providing and trading in unregistered securities and alleging mass mixing of funds and poor practices. The proposed settlement does not delve into the broader litigation.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With the rapid development of blockchain technology and DeFi, many new projects have been born with the desire to improve the overall blockchain ecosystem.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Monad?</h2>



<p>Monad is a Layer 1 blockchain based on the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which the project claims can scale to handle 10,000 TPS through compatibility with Ethereum&#8217;s EVM.</p>



<p>It is developed by the team of Jump Trading LLC, the project positions itself among other competitors with high EVM compatibility combined with parallel execution (Parallel Execution). It can reduce gas fees but not affect security.</p>



<p>The former developers of Jump Trading co-founded Monad Labs. When asked why they are creating a new blockchain in an already crowded field, James Hunsaker said there is still an opportunity to increase the performance of Ethereum and expand the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Monad&#8217;s vision?</h2>



<p>Monad&#8217;s long-term vision is to accelerate the development of decentralized applications by providing a decentralized computing platform. Decentralized computing is an essential innovation – both to facilitate stores of value and as a means to support robust, composable applications with open APIs.</p>



<p>While these applications are fairly simple at the moment, they are rapidly becoming more advanced and useful with development supported by open APIs. New apps can call functions on top of existing apps to take advantage of existing functionality and build more complex and intuitive behaviors.</p>



<p>However, growth in the dApp space fundamentally depends on improvements in the underlying blockchains, which are extremely slow by today&#8217;s computing standards. Significantly higher throughput is required for mass adoption.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What makes Monad so fast?</h2>



<p>With blockchains, EVM compatibility is vital because of its ubiquity, similar to Javascript in web2. Currently, in the crypto market, there are more than 20 EVM-compatible networks, accounting for more than 97% of DeFi&#8217;s TVL. Despite the high popularity, the processing throughput of EVM in the blockchain still needs to be impressive. Today&#8217;s fastest EVM chain is just over 200 TPS.</p>



<p>Besides, the biggest disadvantage of EVM is that it currently can only do one transaction at a time, so transactions in most blockchains are processed one after another. Obviously, this mechanism is inefficient because of the loss of user time.</p>



<p>The developers tried to solve it by parallel execution mechanism. However, the problem of parallel execution is the need for compatibility with EVM, since it is not possible to identify independent transactions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="658" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281-1024x658.png" alt="Monad How To be The Fastest, Cheapest And Most Secure Layer 1 EVM?" class="wp-image-195879" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281-1024x658.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281-300x193.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281-768x494.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281-1536x987.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281-2048x1316.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281-750x482.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1281-1140x733.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Monad How To be The Fastest, Cheapest And Most Secure Layer 1 EVM? 26"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Realizing the above limitation, Monad has developed a parallel execution mechanism but has a high degree of compatibility with EVM. Similar to Aptos, Monads use parallel execution of transactions.</p>



<p>That is, Monad still processes transactions in order, but will classify them into two main groups: related and unrelated. Instead of executing the transaction in turn, the transaction will be executed in parallel without any dependencies. This allows Monad to process transactions more efficiently. Capable of reaching 10,000 TPS but still saving users time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Reduce gas fees but still ensure security</h2>



<p>An important factor contributing to this problem is the high cost of implementing security measures in Ethereum smart contracts. To reduce gas costs for users, developers often feel compelled to skip extra safety checks, making the problem worse.</p>



<p>Developers sometimes choose unsafe methods to achieve gas efficiency, which is obvious in certain cases.</p>



<p>Ethereum, for example, charges a certain number of units of computation or gas per opcode, with more computations resulting in more gas consumption. Users pay for gas consumed by opcodes in a function when calling a smart contract. The immense value of around $250 billion locked in Ethereum&#8217;s ERC-20 and NFT underscores the importance of ensuring contract security.</p>



<p>Therefore, Monad is working hard to build a blockchain that ensures high transaction efficiency with low cost but still can achieve security standards.</p>



<p>Obviously web3 developers want the best user experience at the lowest cost. However, this is not an easy problem. In the past 3 years, more than 4 billion USD of assets have been lost due to network problems such as hacking, mining… The expensive security assurance is also the main reason for the increase in gas fees. High. There are already some blockchains that have reduced gas fees and of course, security is also affected, Polygon is an example.</p>



<p>So low gas charge but high safety is double duty. Monad affirmed that it will try to solve the two limitations at the same time by testing many methods, such as: minimizing the use of external libraries to reduce gas costs.</p>



<p>In short, the above is still just a goal. Monad is still continuing to develop to completely.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to save gas with micro-optimization</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Tightly pack storage variables</strong></p>



<p>When defining storage variables, make sure to declare them in ascending order, according to size. When multiple variables are able to fit into one 256 bit slot, this will save storage size and gas during runtime.</p>



<p><strong>Short circuiting</strong></p>



<p>When an if statement has more than one possible case, list the more freqently occuring case first. This will allow less computation to evaluate the case and enter the body of the if statement. The gas report shown below is a result of passing in 0 as a.</p>



<p><strong>Pack calldata where possible</strong></p>



<p>Every byte of calldata costs gas with non-zero calldata costing 4 gas per byte and zero value calldata costing 16 gas per byte since EIP-2028. By packing calldata, you can reduce the zero value calldata, thus making it more efficient when calling a function. You will need to decode the calldata correctly inside of the function if you pack calldata.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Move forward</h2>



<p>At the moment, the development space of dApps is too dependent on the blockchain they deploy on. By computing standards, blockchains are somewhat slower to grow. While Visa achieves 24,000 TPS, blockchains need to catch up. For example, Ethereum capped at 20 TPS, Bitcoin at 7 or Bitcoincash at 60.</p>

<p>Blockchain Monad is currently one of the highly appreciated blockchain projects and is attracting the attention of the blockchain community. With a design that works on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the ability to process up to 10,000 transactions per second, Monad is expected to improve the performance and security of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>However, Monad is still in the development stage and faces many challenges in deploying the test network. We will wait and see what breakthrough improvements Monad will bring to the blockchain ecosystem in the future.</p>
