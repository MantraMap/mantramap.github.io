<p>The crypto market was generally bad for most coins in 2022, but some recovered impressively in 2023. Unfortunately, Thorchain (RUNE) is not one of those projects. It has continued to perform badly despite the lessening bearish crypto sentiment. Convex (CVX), on the other hand, is on the back of an impressive recovery in 2023. Convex (CVX)'s price had dropped sharply in the second half of 2022, but it managed to bounce back in 2023, albeit slowly. Perhaps the best news is the upcoming launch of Sparklo (SPRK) an alternative investments platform that caters to precious metals.</p>
<p class="s6">Thorchain (RUNE) Records 50% Losses in Year-on-Year Performance</p>
<p>Thorchain (RUNE) was one of the crypto tokens that felt significant damage from the market crashes of 2022. it was trading at $7.6 in the final days of March 2022. More than a week later, Thorchain (RUNE) had lost 50% value thanks to a sudden market collapse caused by Terra's crash. Since then, Thorchain (RUNE) has been unable to maintain any strong rally to help it recover some of its lost value. Towards the end of the year, it had dropped to around $1.2. The only positive side for Thorchain (RUNE) is that its price has been far more stable in 2023. While Thorchain (RUNE) has not broken over the $1 mark in the past few months, it has also not broken below, which is a good sign.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s6">Convex (CVX) Finance Continues Impressive 2023 Rally in the Past Three Months</p>
<p>Convex (CVX) Finance has remained largely stable over the past three months, which is good for Convex (CVX) because the price has been rallying in 2023, and maintaining stability is a sign of good things to come. </p>
<p>Convex (CVX) was trading for as low as $3 by the start of 2023. It rallied to $6.4 by mid-February. Since then, the price has hovered between $5 - $6, especially in the last two months. Despite the slow performance of the market, Convex (CVX) is showing a strong rally coupled with some stability. It will be easier for Convex (CVX) to lock in price gains as the market becomes more bullish. Another reason for Convex (CVX)'s performance, especially in the past two months, could be its recently launched staking mechanism updates.</p>
