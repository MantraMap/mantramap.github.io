In today’s micro update from Capriole, founder Charles Edwards presented a compelling analysis that draws parallels between the current low volatility of Bitcoin and its historical behavior in 2016. With Bitcoin&#8217;s price stagnating around the $29,000 mark, experts are closely watching for signs of a potential bullish breakout. &#8220;Bitcoin’s price remains at $29K, in a sideways consolidation that has created one of the absolute lowest volatility periods in Bitcoin’s 14 year history,&#8221; Edwards states. This prolonged period of low volatility is reminiscent of 2016, suggesting that a significant price movement could be imminent. Bitcoin Breakout Imminent? While the technicals indicate a bearish breakdown from the $30,000 mark, the absence of a downward momentum offers a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. &#8220;If price was going to collapse, we would usually have seen that follow through by now,&#8221; the report notes. However, for a more concrete bullish sentiment, &#8220;a close back above $30K on the daily timeframe is required at the minimum as a technical confirmation of a failed breakdown.&#8221; Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit On the fundamental front, Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain data continues to contract, albeit at a decelerating rate. The imminent decisions on several Bitcoin ETF approvals could potentially disrupt the current low volatility phase. &#8220;An approval could cause a break from the current low volatility range. Best not to pre-empt this though, as these decisions often get pushed. Confirmations are key to mitigate risk,&#8221; Edwards cautions. Diving deeper into the technicals, the report highlighted two key observations: Since 2010, Bitcoin’s historic volatility has only been lower than today in 2016. Suggesting a big price move is on the horizon when volatility expansion (reversion to the mean) occurs. Bitcoin’s $30K breakdown has (so far) failed to follow through&#8230; A close back into the Wyckoff structure at $30K would signify a failed breakdown and therefore be a very positive technical signal. BTC On-Chain Indicators Are Neutral Capriole&#8217;s Bitcoin Macro Index, a comprehensive tool that amalgamates over 40 Bitcoin on-chain, macro market, and equities metrics into a machine learning model, currently scores at -0.36, indicating &#8220;Contraction&#8221;. This suggests that while the short-term outlook remains neutral, the long-term perspective appears bullish. Remarkably, this strategy takes long-only positions in Bitcoin. In slowdowns and contractions, cash is held. &#8220;The Macro Index today remains in a period of relative value (below zero), suggesting decent long-term value for multi-year horizon investors,&#8221; the report elucidated.

A noteworthy addition to Capriole&#8217;s analysis toolkit is the &#8220;Bitcoin Production Cost&#8221; model, which evaluates the cost of mining a Bitcoin based on global average electrical consumption. Currently, this model indicates that Bitcoin is trading within a long-term value region, with the report speculating, &#8220;I would be surprised if this holds into 2024.&#8221; In conclusion, the analysis from Capriole paints a picture of potential long-term value amidst the current bearish technicals. Drawing parallels with 2016, the report suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s current low volatility phase could be a precursor to a bullish breakout. &#8220;All else equal, Bitcoin is like a beach ball submerged underwater. Nonetheless, we remain in a technical breakdown. We don’t know how long that hand will hold the ball underwater for. Prudent risk-management will await a technical confirmation before acting.&#8221; With the cyclical nature of Bitcoin&#8217;s expansion and contraction cycles, only time will tell if history will indeed repeat itself; especially with the backdrop of a totally different macro environment. At press time, the BTC price remained stagnant, trading at $29,445. Featured image from André François McKenzie / Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com
