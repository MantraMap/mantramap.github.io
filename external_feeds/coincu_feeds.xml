					<description><![CDATA[The publisher of the CryptoZoo NFT scam project, Logan Paul, has yet to fulfill his promise to return $1.8 million to investors over the past six months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Logan Paul still hasn&#8217;t refunded the buyer of his scam NFT project after six months of promises.</em></li>



<li><em>In January, Logan Paul pledged to burn ZOO tokens and refund $1.8 million to CryptoZoo NFT buyers.</em></li>



<li><em>In 2021, CryptoZoo NFT was released with ZOO token, but this game has yet to come to fruition.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The publisher of the CryptoZoo NFT scam project, <a href="https://coincu.com/158092-logan-paul-sue-coffeezilla-cryptozoo-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logan Paul</a>, has yet to fulfill his promise to return $1.8 million to investors over the past six months.</strong></h5>



<p>YouTuber Logan Paul faced intense backlash six months ago for allegedly scamming his audience with an NFT gaming project called CryptoZoo, which was proposed in 2021. Paul and his crew were given ZOO tokens and sold NFT, but the game was never completed.</p>

<p>Paul posted a video on 13 outlining his &#8220;three-step plan&#8221; right after receiving criticism to set things from YouTube investigators in January like Stephen &#8220;Coffeezilla&#8221; Findeisen became true. A month later, a class-action complaint was filed against the influencer, alleging that Paul and his crew had duped and taken advantage of CryptoZoo purchasers.</p>



<p>In Coffeezilla&#8217;s latest video, he shared a screenshot of an email communication with Paul&#8217;s attorney, Jeffrey Neiman of the law firm MNR, which seems to suggest that a specific plan has yet to be established. No refunds have yet been made to the affected investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Logan Paul&#039;s Scam Isn&#039;t Over" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYYiypp6WaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;According to the victims, there [have] been zero payments. There&#8217;s no excuse for this. Logan made a public statement about this, took credit for it, and has ghosted the victims,&#8221; Coffeezilla said.</p>



<p>As alleged by Coffeezilla, Paul once promised to deposit all of their ZOO tokens into a burning wallet so that the tokens would be effectively destroyed. After that, they can only profit from their ZOO tokens. However, upon examining the official ZOO contract detailed in the token&#8217;s white paper, there is no clear evidence that Paul or Levin burned any of their ZOOs. According to BSC Scan data, no significant ZOO token burns from one or two wallet addresses have occurred since January 2023.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Paul has yet to post a response on YouTube or Twitter.</p>

<p>In a June 30 announcement, fintech firm GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corporation said its shareholders approved the merger so that the company would act as a special-purpose acquisition company for Bitcoin Depot. The deal, first reported in August 2022, is worth $885 million.</p>



<p>The combined company will be renamed Bitcoin Depot Inc. and will be led by the current management team. Bitcoin Depot common stock and public warrants are scheduled to begin trading on July 3, 2023 on Nasdaq under the tickers &#8220;BTM&#8221; and &#8220;BTMWW,&#8221; respectively.</p>



<p>Bitcoin Depot was founded in 2016 with a mission to connect those who prefer to use cash with the broader digital financial system. The company provides users with simple, efficient, and intuitive means to convert some money into Bitcoin, which users can deploy in the payments, spending, and investing space. The company has the largest market share in North America, with approximately 6,440 kiosks as of March 31, 2023.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Depot will install thousands of crypto ATMs at Circle K-branded convenience stores in the US and Canada amid the cryptocurrency market boom.</p>



<p>But this year, the number of users of these machines has decreased significantly as the virtual currency market enters a &#8220;hibernation&#8221; period, with the average transaction value at each ATM globally reducing by about 75% compared to the previous year, early 2021.</p>



<p>In May, the American provider of Bitcoin ATMs announced that it would cease operations in Connecticut after the state&#8217;s Department of Banking said the company did not have the appropriate license.</p>

<p>The U.S. Commodity and Derivatives Regulatory Authority has added new crypto industry market participants to a committee focused on digital assets, according to an agency<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8740-23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announcement </a>Friday.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Franklin Templeton has been a passionate proponent of exploring and delivering opportunities in the digital asset markets, and we so appreciate the CFTC&#8217;s leadership in this arena and are excited to take on a leadership role and work with other industry participants towards the goal of shaping a 21st century financial ecosystem,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Sandy Kaul said in the statement.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Franklin Templeton is one of the most essential wealth managers in the world, with over $1.3 trillion under management. Franklin Templeton Senior Vice President Sandy Kaul emphasized that most regulators worldwide, including the CFTC, view cryptocurrencies differently than the SEC. However, she expects the SEC to develop laws and regulations that support cryptocurrencies soon.</p>



<p>Franklin Templeton views the crypto ecosystem as a collection of digital nations. Each of these blockchain ecosystems is its own country.</p>



<p>Other members include executives from crypto companies like Coinfund, Crypto.com, and Uniswap and representatives from traditional Wall Street financial institutions like BlackRock, DRW, and Goldman Sachs.</p>



<p>GMAC was established to help the regulator analyze issues related to the US capital markets, and make policy recommendations associated with financial instruments such as derivatives and companies that support their trading support such as exchanges and brokers.</p>



<p>New members have been added to the CFTC&#8217;s Global Market Structure group&#8217;s subcommittee on digital assets, according to Commissioner Caroline Pham. There are now 128 people involved in its GMAC group and relevant subcommittees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cboe updated the filings for the spot bitcoin ETF on its website shortly after the SEC said that the spot bitcoin ETF filings were not clear and comprehensive.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cboe re-filtered five spot bitcoin ETF proposals on Friday following reports that the SEC had requested more information.</em></li>



<li><em>Cboe said it expected to sign a custody-sharing agreement with Coinbase.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the Exchange Operator, on behalf of five issuers of a spot bitcoin ETF filed it back with the SEC on Friday.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets Inc. <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-028-Amendment-No-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated</a> the filings for the spot bitcoin ETF on its website shortly after the SEC said that the spot bitcoin ETF filings were not clear and comprehensive.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Cboe, on behalf of five issuers of a spot bitcoin ETF filed with the SEC on Friday. Updated filings have been submitted to the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.</p>



<p>The refreshed filing is intended to address concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to these people, the agency <a href="https://coincu.com/199277-sec-says-bitcoin-etf-inadequate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notified </a>exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, which had submitted applications for asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, that the files needed to be more precise and thorough.</p>



<p>One key issue is that the exchanges did not name the cryptocurrency trading platforms they plan to enter into custody-sharing arrangements to help detect fraud in the underlying Bitcoin market.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="375" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png" alt="Cboe Immediately Updates Bitcoin ETF Spot Profile After SEC Complaint" class="wp-image-199321" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="Cboe Immediately Updates Bitcoin ETF Spot Profile After SEC Complaint 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The filings, in the second iteration, named Coinbase as part of a custody-sharing agreement for ETF applications by Wise Origin, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy.</p>



<p>The updated document states that the product, The Spot BTC SSA, will show signs of a custody-sharing agreement split between the two. The filing says that setup will allow additional access to data related to spot Bitcoin transactions on Coinbase if the exchange determines it is necessary as part of a monitoring program.</p>



<p>Following the wave of BlackRock is a wide range of traditional and crypto asset managers. In recent days, Fidelity Investments, Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management, and Valkyrie have all revived or revised their applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

<p>The IRS wants the exchange to identify accounts with more than $20,000 in crypto transactions annually between 2016 and 2020. Kraken has previously objected to the IRS subpoena partly because its concerns will create a great burden. The exchange called the agency&#8217;s summons an &#8220;irrational treasure hunt,&#8221; arguing that it crossed the line.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Government has a legitimate purpose for seeking the materials described in the summon. As discussed above, the summons was issued in connection with an investigation by the IRS to determine the identity and correct federal income tax liability of US persons who conduct transactions in cryptocurrency during the period 2016-2020,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Judge Joseph C. Spero said in the court document.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Kraken will have to disclose information such as name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, and tax identification number.</p>



<p>Friday&#8217;s ruling in favor of the government comes amid a deepening US crackdown on cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission this month filed a lawsuit accusing Coinbase of operating an illegal exchange and alleging that Binance.US mishandled customer funds, misled investors and agencies&#8217; regulatory authorities as well as violations of securities rules.</p>

<p>Kraken is a leading cryptocurrency exchange with a daily trading volume of around $650 million globally, according to CoinMarketCap. The company did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on the ruling.</p>



<p>Kraken currently only offers US Forms 1099-MISC, 1099-INT, and 1099-NEC, which are filed with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a copy will be provided to you (if you qualify). This could change in the coming years as tax reporting laws constantly change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>QuickNode adds support for XRP Ledger, boosting Web3 adoption.</em></li>



<li><em>XRPL offers reliability, fast transactions, and diverse use cases.</em></li>



<li><em>QuickNode simplifies infrastructure for developers, enabling high-quality dApp development.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>QuickNode, a leading provider of blockchain infrastructure solutions, has <a href="https://blog.quicknode.com/xrp-ledger-xrpl-blockchain-quicknode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an interesting platform announcement. It supports the XRP Ledger (XRPL), making it the company&#8217;s 23rd blockchain technology.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="529" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1024x529.png" alt="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger" class="wp-image-199306" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1024x529.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-300x155.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-768x396.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1536x793.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-750x387.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1140x588.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318.png 1860w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>QuickNode claims that XRPL may be used for a variety of purposes, including tokenization, CBDC, DeFi, and stablecoins. This integration intends to enable developers within the XRPL ecosystem and boost Web3 technology adoption via dependable and efficient blockchain solutions.</p>



<p>The XRPL offers developers significant utility and flexibility, allowing them to write in Python, Java, and JavaScript. The XRPL is appropriate for any independent developer or organization looking to create a wide range of use cases.</p>



<p>The XRPL is a very beneficial blockchain platform for developers looking to construct enterprises. Throughout the last decade, the protocol&#8217;s capabilities have been enhanced to allow for scalable blockchain development. This allows developers to begin on creative projects and applications in a variety of use cases, including as payments, tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and others.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1024x576.png" alt="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger" class="wp-image-199308" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>A Proof-of-Association (PoA) consensus method underpins the XRPL&#8217;s functionality. Validators, or network servers, achieve consensus every 3-5 seconds, assuring the sequence and result of XRP transactions. The XRPL&#8217;s robust encryption assures the system&#8217;s integrity, while transaction openness provides public accountability.</p>



<p>The addition of XRPL infrastructure to QuickNode&#8217;s platform expands the potential for developers globally. With rapid access to full blockchain capability, developers may tokenize assets, explore sophisticated payment systems, and exploit a variety of XRPL features without having to study, construct, and manage smart contracts.</p>



<p>QuickNode&#8217;s support for XRPL strengthens its position as a premier blockchain infrastructure provider. QuickNode enables developers to concentrate on creating high-quality decentralized apps (dApps) while easing their Web3 strategy by simplifying node management, synchronization, and providing a full platform. It has demonstrated its dependability and scalability in serving industry-leading projects by processing over 200 billion requests per month across 14+ locations globally.</p>

<p>QuickNode <a href="https://coincu.com/162220-quicknodes-series-b-round-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> $60 million in Series B fundraising in January of this year, valuing the company at $800 million. Dan Tapiero&#8217;s 10T Holdings led the round, and Tapiero will also join QuickNode&#8217;s board of directors. According to The Block, other Series B backers included Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six, Protocol Labs, Tiger Global, and QED Investments.</p>



<p>The addition of XRPL to the QuickNode platform marks yet another step forward in the evolution of Web3 technologies. QuickNode helps the development and acceptance of blockchain solutions by offering developers with easy access to the established XRPL infrastructure, stimulating creativity, and increasing the possibilities within the XRPL ecosystem.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Celsius can now sell altcoins and plans to pay creditors in Bitcoin and Ethereum.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Celsius can now sell altcoins and plans to pay creditors in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>The decision was made after discussions with the SEC regarding regulatory requirements for less popular cryptocurrencies.</em></li>



<li><em>Celsius holds altcoins worth $218 million but filed for bankruptcy and is focusing on paying off debts while customer withdrawals remain on hold.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celsius just <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174906302380000000027.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it had been given permission to begin liquidating its altcoins, as this insolvent cryptocurrency lender intends to payout to creditors using only the two most prominent cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2315-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2315-1024x576.png" alt="Celsius Can Convert All Altcoins To BTC, ETH After July 1" class="wp-image-199300" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2315-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2315-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2315-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2315-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2315-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2315.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Celsius Can Convert All Altcoins To BTC, ETH After July 1 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York accepted the action, which Celsius suggested following conversations with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has said that a spectrum of less-used crypto coins needs regulatory permission.</p>



<p>On July 1, 2023, Celsius will be able to sell or convert any non-BTC and non-ETH cryptocurrency into BTC or ETH. Celsius has $70.5 million in CEL, $51.8 million in MATIC, $26.2 million in ADA, $17.3 million in LINK, and $14.4 million in LTC, among other investments.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrencies owned by Celsius amount to $218 million, according to an alleged balance sheet that went viral in April and include CEL, MATIC, ADA, LINK, LTC, DOT, BCH, AAVE, UNI, XLM, SOL, EOS, FIT, SRM, and BNB. Celsius&#8217; native token is CEL, while the remainder is largely MATIC and ADA.</p>

<p>The company has been in regular contact with the SEC and certain state regulatory agencies regarding the proposed distribution of cryptocurrency under the plan to ensure that all such distributions are in full compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, according to the filing.</p>

<p>Celsius revealed on July 13, 2022, that it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The organization said that it intends to continue functioning during the restructuring, albeit withdrawals will remain halted for the time being.</p>



<p>They have aggressively paid off project debt since then. In particular, the company spent about $800 million on Aave, Maker, and Compound.</p>



<p>Paying clients, on the other hand, is more challenging; a year has passed and many customers are still unable to take their funds. Nevertheless, insolvent cryptocurrency firms like BlockFi and Voyager Digital have declared that consumers would be able to withdraw their cash this summer.</p>

<p>OKX, the premier Web3 technology company, and Manchester City Club today named OKX as the club&#8217;s official sleeve partner in a new multi-year relationship.</p>



<p>OKX and Manchester City have signed their third sponsorship agreement in little over a year. OKX became the club&#8217;s official cryptocurrency partner in March 2022, and months later, it added sponsorship of Manchester City&#8217;s training clothes. Man City has accomplished a &#8220;treble&#8221; by winning all three of its major competitions: the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the UEFA Champions League.</p>

<p>City Football Group Chief Executive Officer Ferran Soriano and OKX Global Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique were present for an exclusive unveiling at the Etihad Stadium. The sleeve was revealed as part of the event in a &#8216;virtual reveal&#8217; with a movie involving player avatars. Gael Clichy, a Manchester City great, was also there for a media Q&amp;A. In the statement, Soriano stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We are very proud to have OKX represented on the sleeve of the Manchester City shirt. We have already seen great web3 experiences designed by OKX for Manchester City’s global fan base and there will be many more to come.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>City Football Group (CFG) is a British conglomerate that owns Manchester City as well as other soccer clubs such as New York City FC and Melbourne City FC. Newton Investment and Development LLC, an Abu Dhabi-based firm completely controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, owns the majority of CFG.</p>



<p>Haider Rafique added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The journey with the Man City team has been incredible. Manchester City was our first official global brand partnership and in just a year and a half we have come a long way. We always intended to integrate with the sport and help the Club lead on leaning into Web3. Fast forward fifteen months, we now have a metaverse, an NFT initiative and a number of other new projects that we are excited about.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC finds recent applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs insufficient due to clarity and thoroughness.</em></li>



<li><em>Asset managers, including Fidelity and Ark Investment, are modifying their applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</em></li>



<li><em>Approval of a Bitcoin ETF could revolutionize the industry by increasing accessibility and transforming the cryptocurrency market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to persons familiar with the subject, the Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that a recent wave of applications submitted by asset managers to create spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) is insufficient, <em>WSJ</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-390336e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png" alt="BREAKING: SEC Says Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate, Market Panic" class="wp-image-199280" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: SEC Says Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate, Market Panic 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the persons, the agency notified exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, which submitted the applications on behalf of asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, that the files weren&#8217;t sufficiently clear and thorough.</p>



<p>Following in BlackRock&#8217;s footsteps were a slew of conventional and crypto asset managers. In recent days, Fidelity Investments, Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management, and Valkyrie have all revived or modified their applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p>Since 2017, the SEC has frequently rejected such funds on the grounds that they are prone to fraud and market manipulation. At least a half-dozen ETFs that hold Bitcoin futures are already available.</p>



<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading volume increased as a result of the current interest from mainstream players in Bitcoin ETFs. Nonetheless, analysts believe that the SEC in the United States may be obliged to accept the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF proposal soon.</p>



<p>Since Grayscale filed an appeal against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s decision to deny its application in June 2022, the two sides have exchanged legal files in addition to oral evidence heard by three U.S. federal appellate court judges on March 7.</p>

<p>Prices for Bitcoin and other crypto-related equities have risen since <a href="https://coincu.com/195477-blackrock-to-expand-more-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a> submitted paperwork with the SEC for an ETF that contains genuine Bitcoin in mid-June. The cryptocurrency has risen by approximately 20%, surpassing $30,000 for the first time since April. At the same time period, shares of Coinbase Global, which is listed as the custodian for the BlackRock fund&#8217;s assets, have risen by more than 30%.</p>



<p>Several industry observers believed that BlackRock&#8217;s submission would allay the SEC&#8217;s worries by committing to share &#8220;monitoring&#8221; of a spot Bitcoin trading platform with Nasdaq, which would list the ETF.</p>



<p>An ETF that reflects the real price of Bitcoin would be a game changer for the industry since it would allow more people to invest in the cryptocurrency. It would enable investors to purchase and sell Bitcoin via a brokerage account in the same way that they do stocks.</p>



<p>The day after the news, Bitcoin and the entire crypto market had a massive crash that erased today&#8217;s bull efforts.</p>

<p>Blofin&#8217;s main rivals in Vietnam are Binance, Exness, Bybit, and MEXC. According to reports, Binance is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. CEO of Blofin, Matt Hu, stated:</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that Pham Minh Chinh, Vietnam&#8217;s prime minister, has already highlighted the necessity for the government to properly explore cryptocurrency legislation.</p>



<p>The State Bank of Vietnam has previously cautioned against the dangers of owning, trading, and utilizing cryptocurrencies, underlining that they are not legally protected.</p>



<p>Blofin manages assets, executes transactions, and offers additional services to foreign compliance institutions and clients. It currently has a US federal MSB license, has filed compliance funds with the Cayman Monetary Authority, and is seeking equivalent services in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, and other licensing areas.</p>



<p>Blofin closed a $50 million Series B round of funding in 2022, led by KuCoin and followed by SIG and Matrix Partners China.</p>
