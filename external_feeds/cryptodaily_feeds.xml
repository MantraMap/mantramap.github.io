			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Russia's bill regarding the digital ruble is now signed into law and will take effect on August 1, 2023.</p>
Russia&rsquo;s CBDC Legislation Finally Signed into Law
<p>Russia moves forward with the launch of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), digital ruble, thus taking a step towards crypto regulation in the country.</p>
<p>The digital ruble legislation bill was first introduced to the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the State Duma, in December 2022. The bill passed its first reading in March 2023 and its third final reading on July 11, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 24, Russia&rsquo;s president Vladimir Putin finally signed the CBDC bill into law which is scheduled to come into force on August 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The new law introduces amendments to several articles of the Russian Federation Civil Code. According to the law, the digital ruble will be treated as a means of cashless payment. Russia&rsquo;s central bank will be the main entity responsible for the digital ruble&rsquo;s infrastructure and the safety of the stored assets.</p>
How the Digital Ruble Is Expected to Work
<p>The digital ruble is primarily designed to be a means of payment or a money transfer method and not aimed at investment purposes. Russia&rsquo;s central bank reported that transfers and payments in digital rubles will be free for regular citizens, although corporate clients will have to pay 0.3% of the payment amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authorities have referred to the digital ruble as a &ldquo;new opportunity for citizens and businesses&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s also important to note that the use of the new currency in the country will be completely voluntary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is going to force anyone into the digital ruble. Its use is absolutely voluntary, it is an additional opportunity for people: they can use it if they want to.&rdquo; &ndash; said the governor of Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina.</p>

<p>The government authorities previously reported that trials of the CBDC were to be run in collaboration with 13 local banks that have passed the necessary technical stages of preparation. The digital ruble wallet and transfers should be available in any of the Russian banks&rsquo; mobile apps, although all the operations will be carried out by the Central Bank itself.</p>
<p>The Bank of Russia highlights the reliability, security, and efficiency of the CBDC operations thanks to their centralized regulation.</p>
<p>Olga Skorobogatova, the Bank of Russia&rsquo;s deputy governor, compared the digital ruble to other digital assets:</p>

<p> "the digital ruble is not a cryptocurrency or a stablecoin, where either there is no issuer, or it is not clear who it is."</p>

<p>The mass adoption of the digital ruble in Russia is expected in 2025-2027. The CBDC could be a way to avoid sanctions against Russia imposed by the West when making cross-border payments. It could also be part of the effort to regulate the use of digital assets in the country.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Changpeng Zhao and other defendants associated with the Binance crypto exchange plan to appeal to the court to dismiss a lawsuit from the United States commodities regulator.</p>
Binance&rsquo;s Appeal To Dismiss
<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and its former Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim have revealed that they will be filing motions with the court seeking permission to dismiss a prior complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the July 24 filing to the Illinois District Court, the defendants, which consist of multiple entities from the Binance ecosystem, have claimed that they will be filing two separate motions to counter the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint and appeal for its dismissal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC's lawsuit against Binance was filed on March 27, 2023, and the defendants are required to respond latest by July 27, 2023. In its latest filing, the Foreign Binance Entities, which includes CZ, has revealed intentions to file a joint Motion to Dismiss, while Samuel Lim plans to file a separate motion and incorporate parts of the motion filed by the other defendants.</p>
Binance Seeks To Exceed Page Limit Rule
<p>The defendants are also seeking to exceed the 15-page limit rule on the brief as they claim that they made every effort to adhere to this limit but contend that due to the intricacy of the CFTC's complaint and the multiple arguments they wish to present, their Memoranda of Law is likely to surpass the given page restriction.</p>
<p>The filing reads,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the complexity of the CFTC&rsquo;s Complaint and the number of arguments Defendants anticipate making in support of their Motions to Dismiss, Defendants anticipate that their Memoranda of Law in support of the two motions will exceed the fifteen-page limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In their motion, the defendants requested the court's permission to collectively use up to 50 pages for both Memoranda of Law. This proposed limit is 25 pages less than what the defendants would be entitled to under Local Rule 7.1 if each of them separately moved to dismiss the CFTC's complaint.&nbsp;</p>
CFTC&rsquo;s Complaint
<p>Notably, the CFTC has agreed not to oppose this request, as confirmed by discussions between both parties' counsels. While the court has yet to issue a ruling on their motion, the cooperation from the CFTC's counsel indicates a willingness to accommodate the defendants' request.</p>
<p>The regulatory body had accused Binance and Zhao of violating derivatives regulations and engaging in unregistered trading activities in the United States. The complaint alleged that Binance had strategically expanded its US presence despite publicly claiming to block or restrict access for US customers. CZ responded to the lawsuit, expressing surprise and disappointment, stating that it had been actively cooperating with the agency for over two years.</p>
<p>As the July 27 deadline for the response approaches, market participants are keenly observing the developments in this case, as its outcome may have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Middle Eastern crypto exchange Rain, backed by Coinbase, announced that its Abu Dhabi unit secured a license to offer crypto brokerage and custody services in the UAE.</p>
<p>According to reports by Reuters, Rain, a Middle Eastern crypto exchange based in Bahrain, and backed by Coinbase, announced today its Abu Dhabi unit secured a &ldquo;license to operate a virtual assets brokerage and custody service for clients in the United Arab Emirates.&rdquo;</p>
Rain Expands Offerings into UAE
<p>Obtaining the license means that Rain&rsquo;s unit based in the Abu Dhabi Global Market financial free zone may now offer institutional and a limited number of retail clients in the UAE services to buy, sell, and store their virtual assets.</p>
<p>Yehia Badawy, Rain&rsquo;s co-founder, said in an interview with Reuters that the license further allows the exchange to open a bank account in the UAE and permits its clients in the region to fund their own accounts provided they use a local payment network.</p>
<p>Badawy noted that local asset managers have been reluctant to work with crypto firms who do not have domestic operating licenses but said they would now confidently deal with such firms. He further stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can capture more demand from institutional investors using this licence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Badawy founded Rain with three partners in 2017 with the backing and support of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>Rain has seen significant growth after it raised $110 million in a Series B funding round in 2022, placing the firm&rsquo;s value at $500 million. The firm indicated that the funds were earmarked for regional expansion.</p>
Growing Number of Crypto Firms Attracted to UAE
<p>The current crisis and regulatory uncertainty in the US prompted many crypto-related firms to explore other regions to expand to, and the UAE appears to be a popular option.</p>
<p>Binance recently said it was considering a move to Dubai due to the UAE&rsquo;s pro-crypto stance and policies. Alex Chehade, Binance Dubai&rsquo;s General Manager, said the region is a prime destination for crypto businesses.</p>
<p>The US-based crypto exchange Gemini also said it would &ldquo;soon&rdquo; start the process of obtaining a crypto service license for customers in the UAE. Gemini cited &ldquo;hostility and [a] lack of clarity&rdquo; on US regulations as motivation for its decision.</p>
<p>Coinbase also believes that the UAE is an attractive region for establishing its business amid ongoing difficulties with US regulators. The exchange expressed its interest in establishing an international hub in the UAE with its CEO Brian Armstrong, who believes that the country is well positioned to expand and serve the market in Africa, Asia, and, naturally, the Middle East. Armstrong also praised the country for its &ldquo;forward-thinking&rdquo; approach to crypto regulation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The highly controversial Arkham Intel Exchange has approved its first-ever bounty hunt, with crypto sleuths set to go after crypto wallets belonging to Terra co-founder Do Kwon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Do Kwon currently languishing in a Montenegrin jail, crypto users have long been trying to seek out any information regarding his crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Deanonymizing The Blockchain&rdquo;
<p>The Arkham Intel Exchange is a highly controversial platform, acting as a marketplace that facilitates the trading of on-chain data. The platform recently approved its first-ever bounty submission after two crypto sleuths found evidence of crypto wallets belonging to Do Kwon. An anonymous user, along with a pseudo-anonymous Twitter user going by the name of @ErgoBTC, were paid around 9500 ARKM tokens, worth around $5000 for their submission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Arkham Intel Exchange now has its first approved submission: new evidence of wallets owned by Do Kwon / Terraform Labs. An anonymous on-chain sleuth and @ErgoBTC were the successful bounty hunters.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It further added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expanded labels for the LFG BTC address activity after running off with funds intended for the defense of the UST depeg have been added to Arkham as a part of their bounty program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Arkham Intel, the anonymous user and Ergo sent the platform considerable evidence they had found wallets owned by Do Kwon and Terra. Ergo stated this evidence contradicts public statements made by Terra that it holds only one Luna Foundation Guard wallet. Luna Foundation Guard stated that 80,081 BTC, which comprised over 99% of its reserves, had exited the fund. LFG had claimed that the reason behind the sale of the crypto asset was to shore up and support the overall health of the Terra ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
ErgoBTC&rsquo;s Findings&nbsp;
<p>Ergo shared further details about his research, which was first made public in October when the Luna Foundation Guard claimed it had only one Bitcoin wallet containing 313 BTC. Ergo had written at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While it may be true that this is the only formally &lsquo;declared&rsquo; wallet controlled by the LFG, they seem to have failed to account for the trail of bread crumbs left by the change outputs used to fund their new declared wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crypto sleuth continued to track the funds over the next few months and noted that they were moving even after Do Kwon&rsquo;s arrest in March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kwon may have been rolled up for faking a passport. But LFG and the BTC are still moving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wallet being tracked has been officially christened &ldquo;Terraform Labs&rdquo; on the Arkham Intel Exchange and currently holds around $160 million worth of crypto, out of which around $153 million is in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
The Arkham Intel Exchange&nbsp;
<p>The Arkham Intel Exchange was launched on the 10th of July to generally negative reactions by members of the crypto space, with most describing it as a glorified snitching service. Many in the crypto space have also stated that the platform could be used to dox innocent individuals. Users on the platform can place bounties for information related to blockchain transactions, which would then be released to the public within 90 days following approval from the platform. Going by this timeline, information about the Do Kwon and Terra wallets could be available in the public domain sometime in October.&nbsp;</p>
The Terra Collapse&nbsp;
<p>The Terra collapse was one of the most crippling events in the history of crypto when the collapse of its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its cryptocurrency LUNA triggered chaos in the market. Following TerraUSD&rsquo;s de-pegging and the ecosystem&rsquo;s collapse, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Do Kwon with securities violations for selling unregistered transactions of crypto asset securities. He was also charged for failing to provide truthful disclosures and providing investors with misleading information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kwon&rsquo;s whereabouts were unknown until March 2023, when he was apprehended by authorities in Montenegro and was sentenced to four months in prison for traveling using forged travel papers. Several other individuals connected to Terra are also under investigation by authorities in South Korea. Recently, co-founder Hin Hyun-seong had his first hearing for charges related to illegal profits from the sale of LUNA tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wallet being tracked has been officially christened &ldquo;Terraform Labs&rdquo; on the Arkham Intel Exchange and currently holds around $160 million worth of crypto, out of which around $153 million is in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
The Arkham Intel Exchange&nbsp;
<p>The Arkham Intel Exchange was launched on the 10th of July to generally negative reactions by members of the crypto space, with most describing it as a glorified snitching service. Many in the crypto space have also stated that the platform could be used to dox innocent individuals. Users on the platform can place bounties for information related to blockchain transactions, which would then be released to the public within 90 days following approval from the platform. Going by this timeline, information about the Do Kwon and Terra wallets could be available in the public domain sometime in October.&nbsp;</p>
The Terra Collapse&nbsp;
<p>The Terra collapse was one of the most crippling events in the history of crypto when the collapse of its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its cryptocurrency LUNA triggered chaos in the market. Following TerraUSD&rsquo;s de-pegging and the ecosystem&rsquo;s collapse, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Do Kwon with securities violations for selling unregistered transactions of crypto asset securities. He was also charged for failing to provide truthful disclosures and providing investors with misleading information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kwon&rsquo;s whereabouts were unknown until March 2023, when he was apprehended by authorities in Montenegro and was sentenced to four months in prison for traveling using forged travel papers. Several other individuals connected to Terra are also under investigation by authorities in South Korea. Recently, co-founder Hin Hyun-seong had his first hearing for charges related to illegal profits from the sale of LUNA tokens.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to a gag order that prevents him from publicly discussing his case after prosecutors alleged he was discrediting their witness, Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried had come under fire for conducting an interview with the New York Times, which prosecutors have claimed amounts to witness tampering.&nbsp;</p>
Bail Status In Jeopardy&nbsp;
<p>The gag order prevents the FTX founder from making any public statements related to the lawsuit, FTX, and the people involved with the lawsuit. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the case, will make a ruling on whether the gag order is required at the upcoming hearing for the lawsuit, scheduled on the 26th of July. The judge will also look at the &ldquo;adequacy and continuation&rdquo; of Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s bail, suggesting that his current bail status could be in jeopardy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed order bans Bankman-Fried and others associated with the lawsuit from discussing anything with the press that could interfere with a fair trial. This includes statements regarding the credibility of witnesses, information that is not admissible during the trial, and any statement or opinion about the case that could influence the public. The order also extends to attorneys. However, it does not prevent Bankman-Fried from asserting his innocence.&nbsp;</p>
The New York Times Story&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried came under criticism following a story published in the New York Times. The story&rsquo;s focus was Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, and talked about writings found in her personal journals and Google Docs, appearing to show her ambivalence about her relationship with SBF and role at FTX. These were written by Ellison when she was the head of Alameda Research and before the collapse of FTX. She also talked about her struggles when it came to leading Alameda, which she described as &ldquo;overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the story, federal prosecutors launched a scathing attack on SBF, accusing him of leaking stories to newspapers and showing their witness in poor light. They also described it as a malicious effort to influence the jury pool toward the witness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to tainting the jury pool, the effect, if not the intent, of the defendant&rsquo;s conduct is not only to harass Ellison but also to deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying.&rdquo;</p>

Nothing Malicious&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers confirmed in a letter sent to Judge Kaplan that the former FTX CEO had met with reporters, adding that he gave them Ellison&rsquo;s documents. However, they denied all allegations of witness tampering as alleged by the prosecution. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers argued that the prosecution&rsquo;s allegations were unfounded and that he had no malicious intention when he shared the documents with reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;[SBF] did not violate the protective order in this case, nor did he violate his bail conditions, nor did he violate any law or rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Additionally, the defense stated that Bankman-Fried would agree to the gag order and refrain from discussing or making public statements regarding the case. However, they argued that the gag order should also apply to the prosecution, along with all witnesses, including current FTX CEO John Ray. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers argued that Ray had publicly vilified and attacked their client and continues to portray him as a villain, despite the case&rsquo;s ongoing status.&nbsp;</p>
Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s House Arrest&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried has already been summoned by Judge Kaplan following the accusations, with the judge skeptical regarding his bail conditions. He has already warned Kaplan has already warned SBF that he could end up going back to jail if he did not curtail his use of VPN programs and encrypted messaging apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former CEO is under house arrest at his parent&rsquo;s home in California as part of a $250 million bail package. However, the bail conditions have already been tightened twice. Visitors are now required to hand over their devices to a guard at the front door. Additionally, Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s internet usage is heavily monitored, and he is banned from using certain encrypted applications and contacting witnesses. The second condition was imposed after he messaged a potential witness and emailed John Ray.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In its newest scare tactic, the SEC alleged Binance.US inflated its trading volumes through a practice known as &ldquo;wash trading.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly increased the regulatory pressure against Binance.US. Binance has become the subject of the US&rsquo;s efforts to eliminate crypto exchanges it deems to have acted improperly.</p>
SEC: Binance.US Engaged in &ldquo;Wash Trading&rdquo;
<p>US regulatory action this time comes as the SEC accused Binance&rsquo;s US arm, Binance.US, of inflating its trading volumes &ndash; a practice known as &ldquo;wash trading.&rdquo; The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) first reported the news and said some of the exchange&rsquo;s crypto trading was a &ldquo;mirage&rdquo;, according to SEC.</p>
<p>Most accusations levelled against the exchange and its CEO, Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao, came after the SEC sued Binance, Binance.US, and CZ. In its claims against the exchange, the SEC alleged that trading volumes on Binance.US were inflated by a firm owned by Zhao.</p>
<p>The WSJ report says the securities agency alleges that Binance.US inflated trading volumes &ldquo;by using dozens of user accounts held by Sigma Chain, a Swiss trading company controlled by Zhao.&rdquo; The WSJ also cites an academic report and boldly claims that over 70% of trading volume on crypto exchanges is derived from wash trading.</p>
<p>Binance.US filed a lawsuit against the SEC for its claims of improper handling of customer funds and said the SEC were &ldquo;misleading: the public in its ongoing cases. The SEC accused Binance and CZ of commingling customer assets in a press release.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms&rsquo; customers&rsquo; assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;A spokesperson addressed the SEC&rsquo;s allegations of wash trading, saying they are &ldquo;entirely unfounded.&rdquo; The WSJ further reports the spokesperson said the claims are &ldquo;based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the facts and a misapplication of the relevant law.&rdquo;</p>
Binance.US Feels the Pressure
<p>The exchange naturally has felt the effects of the SEC&rsquo;s endless lawsuits and allegations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent reports indicated Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate laid off some of its staff following the agency&rsquo;s actions.</p>
Binance Seeks Dismissal of CFTC Complaint
<p>In a July 24 report, news agency Reuters said that Binance and its CEO are &ldquo;planning to seek dismissal of a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) complaint accusing the crypto exchange of violating the Commodity Exchange Act and certain related federal regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Binance has until July 27 to submit its response to the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint and will reportedly seek a dismissal. In March, the CFTC revealed it was suing Binance and its CEO, accusing the exchange of trading on its own platform and CZ of indulging in insider trading.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The United States Federal Reserve has officially launched its new instant payment system dubbed FedNow.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch comes as the Federal Reserve looks to modernize and streamline the United States&rsquo; payment system. Research on financial systems has been ongoing since 2021 FedNow enables instant payment between users and banks and boasts of its 24/7/365 operations. Users will have full access to their funds and also do not have to pay anything to join the service. The Federal Reserve expects the service to speed up the flow of money throughout the country.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the FedNow&rsquo;s own website, the initial launch will simply focus on &ldquo;core clearing and settlement capabilities&rdquo; and additional features will be launched in phases, depending on industry demands and changes in technology. As more banks and credit unions adopt the service, users and businesses can expect more benefits. As of writing, early adopters of the service include big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BNY Mellon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While this development is of course a net positive for everyday users, the launch of FedNow raises a glaring question, especially regarding the United States&rsquo; own financial system. There are already existing systems like Venmo, Paypal or even The Clearing House&rsquo;s Real-Time Payments (RTP) Network that enable instant payments. So the question becomes what is FedNow really for? And what comes next after FedNow? </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Although the Federal Reserve has said that FedNow will not be used as a springboard to the launch of the United States&rsquo; own central bank digital currency (CBDC), this has not stopped the cryptocurrency community from speculating and worrying. If the Federal Reserve, and by extension the United States government, is serious about digital currencies, then it should also relax the current hostile environment to cryptocurrency enablked by none other than the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC, at the helm of Gary Gensler, has been on a warpath against cryptocurrency platforms with its unflinching stance that all crypto assets (save for Bitcoin) are securities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, there is the recent issue of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) bloc developing its own CBDC patently as a rival to the U.S. dollar. The United States is currently at a crossroads and the next big move after FedNow will be crucial not just to the everyday user but the entire world&rsquo;s monetary system.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a recent statement, the SEC claimed that the recent Ripple ruling was incorrect, while disclosing that it has already decided and is currently moving in to post an appeal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">There has been some intertwining contexts with latest legal fracas with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which involves Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the SEC's recent motion against Terraform Labs has revived discussions around the landmark Ripple Labs case, signaling a possible appeal on the horizon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Institutional vs. Retail: Divergent Perspectives</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In the Ripple Labs case, the court determined that Ripple's XRP token sales to institutional investors breached SEC rules. However, the judge ruled that Ripple's offerings to retail investors on exchanges didn't infringe on these same regulations. This bifurcation of institutional and retail sales was broadly seen as a victory for the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a stark departure from this view, the SEC, in its most recent filing against Terraform Labs and Kwon, voiced its disapproval. The agency stated:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The decision creates an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the SEC's view, the ruling reformulates the decades-old Howey Test, a metric used to identify when assets are securities, transforming it into a more subjective standard. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Accordingly, the SEC requested that the court reject this part of the Ripple decision and hinted at a possible appeal in the Ripple case.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ripple Ruling's Impact on Terraform Labs Lawsuit</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ripple ruling has become a crucial reference in the ongoing lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Kwon. Their legal representatives cited the Ripple decision in their dismissal motion, arguing that it "confirms the legal insufficiency of the SEC&rsquo;s argument."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">They were referring to the SEC's assertion that certain tokens, including the ill-fated TerraUSD stablecoin, were securities due to their method of sale.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the SEC has doubled down on its accusations that Terraform Labs and Kwon offered and sold unregistered securities as part of a fraudulent scheme, causing a loss of at least $40 billion in market value. The SEC also underscored that the institutional investor aspect of the Ripple ruling supports its case against Terraform Labs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC notes that institutional buyers in such a case (such as trading firms that purchased crypto assets from Terraform Labs with no restrictions on resale) purchased ostensibly on the reason that the assets were an investment on top of Terraform Lab's initiatives.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The legal entanglements involving the SEC, Ripple Labs, and now Terraform Labs, highlightts the evolving dynamics between the emerging crypto industry and established securities regulations. The nuanced interpretation of these regulations in relation to cryptocurrencies like XRP and TerraUSD has far-reaching implications for the industry. How these cases play out in the courts will set precedents that could shape the crypto landscape for years to come.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">SEC's Prospective Appeal</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC's recent motion reveals its plan to challenge the federal court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres upheld that nearly half of Ripple's XRP sales did not contravene investor-protection laws. This verdict sparked hope among other defendants embroiled in disputes with the SEC regarding their cryptocurrency sales, which, according to the SEC, often constitute illegally sold securities. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This court ruling has become a beacon of hope for defendants like Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs. Kwon, currently serving time in prison, faces an SEC lawsuit alleging fraudulent activities and various legal infringements. The lawsuit was filed in February in Manhattan federal court. In light of the recent Ripple Labs ruling, Kwon's defense is employing it as a basis to refute the SEC's accusations. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Precedent in Flux</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the SEC signalling its intent to appeal the Ripple Labs ruling, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the crypto industry.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a recent statement, the SEC claimed that the recent Ripple ruling was incorrect, while disclosing that it has already decided and is currently moving in to post an appeal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">There has been some intertwining contexts with latest legal fracas with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which involves Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the SEC's recent motion against Terraform Labs has revived discussions around the landmark Ripple Labs case, signaling a possible appeal on the horizon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Institutional vs. Retail: Divergent Perspectives</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In the Ripple Labs case, the court determined that Ripple's XRP token sales to institutional investors breached SEC rules. However, the judge ruled that Ripple's offerings to retail investors on exchanges didn't infringe on these same regulations. This bifurcation of institutional and retail sales was broadly seen as a victory for the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a stark departure from this view, the SEC, in its most recent filing against Terraform Labs and Kwon, voiced its disapproval. The agency stated:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The decision creates an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the SEC's view, the ruling reformulates the decades-old Howey Test, a metric used to identify when assets are securities, transforming it into a more subjective standard. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Accordingly, the SEC requested that the court reject this part of the Ripple decision and hinted at a possible appeal in the Ripple case.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ripple Ruling's Impact on Terraform Labs Lawsuit</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ripple ruling has become a crucial reference in the ongoing lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Kwon. Their legal representatives cited the Ripple decision in their dismissal motion, arguing that it "confirms the legal insufficiency of the SEC&rsquo;s argument."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">They were referring to the SEC's assertion that certain tokens, including the ill-fated TerraUSD stablecoin, were securities due to their method of sale.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the SEC has doubled down on its accusations that Terraform Labs and Kwon offered and sold unregistered securities as part of a fraudulent scheme, causing a loss of at least $40 billion in market value. The SEC also underscored that the institutional investor aspect of the Ripple ruling supports its case against Terraform Labs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC notes that institutional buyers in such a case (such as trading firms that purchased crypto assets from Terraform Labs with no restrictions on resale) purchased ostensibly on the reason that the assets were an investment on top of Terraform Lab's initiatives.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The legal entanglements involving the SEC, Ripple Labs, and now Terraform Labs, highlightts the evolving dynamics between the emerging crypto industry and established securities regulations. The nuanced interpretation of these regulations in relation to cryptocurrencies like XRP and TerraUSD has far-reaching implications for the industry. How these cases play out in the courts will set precedents that could shape the crypto landscape for years to come.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">SEC's Prospective Appeal</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC's recent motion reveals its plan to challenge the federal court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres upheld that nearly half of Ripple's XRP sales did not contravene investor-protection laws. This verdict sparked hope among other defendants embroiled in disputes with the SEC regarding their cryptocurrency sales, which, according to the SEC, often constitute illegally sold securities. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This court ruling has become a beacon of hope for defendants like Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs. Kwon, currently serving time in prison, faces an SEC lawsuit alleging fraudulent activities and various legal infringements. The lawsuit was filed in February in Manhattan federal court. In light of the recent Ripple Labs ruling, Kwon's defense is employing it as a basis to refute the SEC's accusations. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Precedent in Flux</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the SEC signalling its intent to appeal the Ripple Labs ruling, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the crypto industry. The final decision on the Ripple case could profoundly influence ongoing and future lawsuits, including Terraform Labs.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&rsquo;s CEO Brad Garlinghouse blasted the SEC, accusing it of creating a &ldquo;mess&rdquo; by declaring itself the &ldquo;cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter today to defend Judge Torres&rsquo; recent decision, which declared that Ripple&rsquo;s sale of its XRP token did not constitute a sale of securities.</p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s chief further blamed the SEC for creating the &ldquo;mess&rdquo; surrounding crypto regulation when it had no right to do so.</p>
Garlinghouse Speaks Out Against SEC
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory against the SEC has been celebrated by most of the industry but has seen some backlash from the naysayers. Judge Analisa Torres ruled on July 13 the XRP token, concerning retail sales on digital asset exchanges, is not necessarily a security. Torres, however, did rule that XRP qualifies as a security under the Howey Test when sold to institutional investors.</p>
<p>At the time of the ruling, Garlinghouse commented that institutional sale represents &ldquo;the smallest piece&rdquo; of the suit and believes if the SEC decides to appeal the decision regarding retail sales, it would only &ldquo;solidify&rdquo; Torres&rsquo; decision. Garlinghouse further labelled the SEC a &ldquo;bully&rdquo; for targeting &ldquo;weak players&rdquo; in the industry without the necessary resources to build a strong defence.</p>
<p>The Ripple CEO continued his criticism of the agency in defence to retail consumers. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;An important topic has come up about protecting retail. The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction Where&rsquo;s that gotten us? Consumers left holding the bag in bankruptcy court while the SEC holds press conferences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the same thread, Garlinghouse defended Judge Torres&rsquo; application of the law, emphasizing &ldquo;legislation &ndash; not more regulation by enforcement &ndash; is the only way to provide clear rules and protect retail.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It&rsquo;s absurd to blame a Judge for faithfully applying the law. We all know legislation &ndash; not more regulation by enforcement &ndash; is the only way forward to provide clear rules and protect retail. Glad to see more members of Congress like @RepRitchie, @PatrickMcHenry champion this.</p>
&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 22, 2023
<p>

</p>
SEC May Appeal Decision But Will Take Years
<p>While it has not clearly stated it would appeal Torres&rsquo; ruling, the SEC did hint at the possibility.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that disgraced Terraform Labs co-founder, Do Kwon is trying to use the landmark ruling as precedence in his own battle against the securities agency. In a motion involving Kwon, the SEC urged the presiding judge not to seek guidance from the Ripple ruling. The SEC said Judge Torres&rsquo; decision &ldquo;adds baseless requirements&rdquo; to the Howey Test and stated there would be a &ldquo;further review&rdquo; of the ruling.</p>
<p>Prominent crypto and pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton clarified the implications of a possible appeal by the SEC.</p>
<p>Deaton said on Twitter that he does not view a potential appeal as a setback to the industry.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An appeal is not even close to be a setback. First, it will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit, if it&rsquo;s appealed. The Torres Decision is the law until then - at least in the 2nd Circuit. Second, even if the 2nd Circuit said Torres was wrong&hellip; https://t.co/GzW31D9edQ</p>
&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) July 22, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Mr Deaton explained that a possible SEC appeal would take at least two years to come to fruition and said that until such a decision is revealed, Judge Torres&rsquo; ruling remains the law.</p>
<p>He assured nervous XRP holders,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anyone underestimate how significant this win is.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In response to the rollout of the Worldcoin crypto services, Vitalik Buterin published a detailed essay about biometric proof of personhood.</p>
Worldcoin&rsquo;s Mission to Help Distinguish Humans from AI Bots Online
<p>The CEO of OpenAI Sam Altman together with Alex Blania founded Worldcoin over three years ago. The main idea behind the project is to present a solution which can effectively verify human identity online without violating users&rsquo; privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With AI technology developing extremely rapidly in the latest months, many believe that soon it&rsquo;s going to take over lots of human jobs leaving thousands unemployed. It might also get to the point where it will become very difficult to tell the difference between humans and AI bots online.</p>
<p>Worldcoin offers a digital proof of personhood called World ID. In order to get a World ID, one needs to use an Orb, a sophisticated biometric verification device which scans users&rsquo; irises to verify that they&rsquo;re human.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldcoin also confirmed that it plans to create an AI-funded Universal Basic Income (UBI) service, thus helping to combat income inequality. Users in the countries &ldquo;where laws allow&rdquo; should be able to receive the Worldcoin digital currency (WLD) for simply being human.&nbsp;</p>
Worldcoin Starts the Rollout of Its Services&nbsp;
<p>On July 24, Worldcoin published a letter from cofounders on its website announcing the official launch of the product. One can access the Worldcoin services via World App, the company&rsquo;s owned crypto wallet which is already available on iOS and Android. However, to get verified for World ID, it&rsquo;s also required to visit an Orb, the eyeball-scanning device which is not globally distributed yet.</p>
<p>Over 2 million people already signed up for World ID during the project&rsquo;s Beta phase. Numerous crypto exchange platforms such as Binance, OKX, and Huobi have already confirmed the listing of the Worldcoin&rsquo;s token.</p>
Vitalik Buterin Describes Potential Risks of the Worldcoin&rsquo;s Identity Verification System
<p>On the same day of Worldcoin&rsquo;s launch, the Ethereum network cofounder Vitalik Buterin published an extensive blog post about biometric proof of personhood in general and World ID in particular.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Buterin, proof of personhood solutions are crucial as they help solve &ldquo;a lot of anti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems&rdquo; as well as increase privacy and reduce dependence on centralized authorities. Many apps today use government-backed identity systems such as state IDs or credit cards, which inevitably intrude on users&rsquo; privacy.</p>
<p>However, digital identity verification solutions have their issues as well. Buterin identifies at least four major risks with Worldcoin&rsquo;s construction: privacy, accessibility, centralization, and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vitalik Buterin then compares World ID to other types of identity verification and concludes that there is no ideal form of proof of personhood:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I definitely do not envy the people attempting the task, and it will likely take years to find a formula that works. The concept of proof-of-personhood in principle seems very valuable, and while the various implementations have their risks, not having any proof-of-personhood at all has its risks too&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

Thus, they are looking for real-world utility tokens that can offer a stable profit. Subsequently, the presale of Tradecurve (TCRV) is selling out quickly.Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) seem to be losing their Midas touch.</p>
<p class="s5">Whales are accumulating TCRV tokens in large numbers, as their value can grow by 100x in the next six months.</p>

Solana (SOL) Joins Hands With Coca-Cola
<p class="s5">Expanding its ecosystem, Solana (SOL) has partnered with Coca-Cola in Serbia. Under this partnership, Solana&rsquo;s platform SolSea and Coca-Cola will jointly work on an NFT offering at a music event.</p>
<p class="s5">As per the official statement, Solana and the soda company will provide 100 limited-edition hoodies and NFTs to participants. Earlier, a report had suggested that Solana has witnessed a significant rise in the NFT space this year.</p>
<p class="s5">The price trajectory of Solana has also responded positively to the partnership. The exchange rate of Solana has increased by 21% in the past week. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $22.29.</p>

Revolut Announces Delisting Polygon (MATIC)
<p class="s5">Polygon has faced several challenges and weathering of its user base since the SEC labeled MATIC as a security. Many exchanges have announced delisting Polygon (MATIC), with the Revolut being the latest one.</p>
<p class="s5">While making the announcement, Revolut stated that it will delist Polygon by September 18. Earlier, two leading exchanges, Robinhood and Bakkt, had already announced the delisting of Polygon. According to analysts, this move can cause a severe fall in Polygon&rsquo;s user base and price.</p>
<p class="s5">The market value of Polygon has seen a drop of 7% in the last 30 days. Consequently, Polygon is now trading at $6.34.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve Becomes The Face Of Next-gen Cryptos
<p class="s5">After the collapse of the FTX exchange, which caused a loss of around $2 billion in the crypto market, investors have become apprehensive about centralized exchanges. The market trust in centralized exchanges has suffered a blow. Therefore, the demand for decentralized exchanges has increased, and Tradecurve (TCRV) is considered the best option by experts.</p>
<p class="s5">It is a unique blockchain platform, which enables users to trade a wide range of assets without relying on fiat payments. It keeps users&rsquo; identities anonymous, and allows them to trade privately.</p>
<p class="s5">On this platform, users are not required to undergo any KYC checks. This is contrary to existing trading platforms like ByBit and Robinhood, where users must share their personal details.</p>
<p class="s5">Its native crypto is TCRV, which will fuel the platform&rsquo;s ecosystem. The token&rsquo;s smart contract has been verified by Cyber Scope, and the team verification was performed by Assure DeFi. The token&rsquo;s presale is live, and currently progressing through the fourth stage, where a token is available for purchase at $0.018.</p>
<p class="s5">So far, the price of a token has increased by 80%, and is likely to rise to $0.025 in stage 5. Moreover, the platform&rsquo;s value may rise 50 times before the end of the presale round. Interestingly, only 40% of the total 1.8 billion tokens will be available during the presale.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Crypto enthusiasts usually go for cryptocurrencies that have been around for a while because of these coins' proven success in the market. But the story is different with the new project Uwerx, which has traders buying in bulk even though it has yet to launch. </p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx is having a successful presale, to the amazement of its developers and the benefit of early investors. Having smashed through its first four stages in less than two months, analysts believe Uwerx will make a better investment than Open Campus (EDU) and Conflux (CFX). </p>
Open Campus (EDU) Sees An Downward Trend
<p class="s5">Open Campus (EDU) has reached a wider audience since it partnered with Animoca Brands to launch the Web3 Global Educators Fund. This has translated to an increase in the number of members joining the Open Campus (EDU) community. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, the project's Publisher NFTs have become a favorite among educators and content creators as it gives them the means to earn revenue for their work. </p>
<p class="s5">Despite the increase in Open Campus (EDU) adoption, the project has not risen in price in the last seven days. Open Campus trades at $1.00, representing a -13.84% decrease in the last seven days. Analysts predict it to trade at $2.07 by the first quarter of 2024</p>
Conflux (CFX) Rises In The Last 24hrs
<p class="s5">The past 24hrs have been good to Conflux (CFX). The project trades at $0.24, representing a 9.37% increase within 24 hours. Although this current price represents a -23.55% decrease in the last seven days, Conflux (CFX) holders believe this could be the start of the project's bull run. </p>
<p class="s5">Conflux (CFX) announced on June 2 via Twitter that it has partnered with Code4arena. This collaboration will provide enhanced security for both ecosystems.</p>
<p class="s5">Following the partnership, the Conflux (CFX) team announced on June 6 that they were aware of the recent cross-chain irregularity in their ecosystem. They assured users they had taken preventive action by removing Multichain's co-mint rights. This will ensure the security of user assets. The project also stated that they had not detected any loss, and the ecosystem was functioning as usual.</p>
<p class="s5">With more partnerships and improvements, analysts believe the CFX token could increase to $0.31 by the end of this year.</p>
Join The Future Of Decentralized Freelancing With Uwerx (WERX)
<p class="s5">According to a 2022 statistic from Velocity Global, at least 36% of the American workforce freelances. This suggests a need to bring new ideas and innovations to the freelance industry. Uwerx is entering the cryptocurrency market as a much-needed innovation that will revolutionalize the gig economy. It will offer unique benefits to freelancers, such as a minimal 1% transaction fee, fast payments, intellectual property rights protection, and more. </p>
<p class="s5">Still on presale, Uwerx is already making significant strides and attracting investors' attention. Uwerx is currently valued at $0.05245 in its ongoing fifth presale stage. However, analysts see the project growing exponentially in the coming months. They predict the WERX token to rise above $2.6 by Q4 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx takes the security of investors' funds seriously. The project has received audits from InterFi Network and SolidProof, ensuring top-tier protection. It also implemented a 25-year lock on developers' liquidity tokens on June 7, 2023.</p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Uwerx released the Alpha version of its platform on May 19, 2023. This version features a Landing page, Sign-up page, Login page, Forgot Password, Hiring Dashboard, Freelancer/Client Initiation, The Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step of Finding Talent, My Activity, and Job Creation process pages. </p>
<p class="s5">All these features will lead to the rollout of the platform's Beta version, enabling users to test and experience the platform. User feedback is expected and can be sent to the email: feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx Vault is another fantastic feature of Uwerx. Launched in April 2023, this feature allows users to store their WERX tokens for various lengths of time. Users will also earn rewards for using the Vault.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale will end on July 31, 2023, so investors are advised to take advantage of the current low price to join the community before Uwerx launches into the coin market. </p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx team pays attention to the community's needs and makes adjustments to solve those needs. The developers recently asked the community to vote on a test airdrop. 98.2% of respondents voted in favor of the test airdrop, which the team believes will enable users to verify their receiving wallet addresses. They will also relinquish smart contract ownership of the project, which will take effect once it lists on centralized exchanges. </p>
<p class="s5">These moves have increased investors' confidence in the project and have made them believe that Uwerx could be a prominent project in the coin market by the end of this year. </p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained quite weak early in the Asian session as the pair plummeted to the 28973.24 area after trading as high as the 30350.70 area, a brief move that represented a test of a recent price objective associated with buying pressure around the 29525 and 29757.44 areas.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 29403 and 29089 levels during the acute depreciation, downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure around the 30421.29 and 29851.28 levels.&nbsp; Related downside price objectives include the 28775, 29386, and 27757 levels.&nbsp; The rapid depreciation also represented a test of the 28937 and 28845 levels, upside price objectives related to buying pressure from June around the 24750 and 26165 levels.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives include the 29386, 28213, 28137, 27757, 27430, 27338, 27312, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized identity startup cheqd has announced the launch of a new platform called Creds for Web3 users to issue, hold and share digital credentials and build portable reputations.</p>
<p>The new tool was announced at the Nebular Summit in Paris, where attendees at the event were issued with the first Creds as part of a technology showcase. Creds give users a secure and private way to prove their identity in Web3 environments. What&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;re fully portable and reusable, allowing users to slowly build up a strong reputation without ever revealing their true identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheqd explains that there are many challenges around the issue of Web3 security, with crypto scams wiping out millions of dollars in user&rsquo;s funds, creating massive distrust in online communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to cheqd, the best way to combat Web3 scams is to increase the trust and reputation of users, which is exactly what it&rsquo;s aiming to do with Creds. It provides a way for individuals to confirm their personhood and ownership of assets such as wallets and user handles across multiple platforms. So a moderator on a Discord server could prove their status and role, without revealing their identity. A scammer would not be able to prove this. In this way, not only will Creds help to prevent scams, but they can also prevent impersonation-based attacks and the spread of fake news by malicious individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheqd&rsquo;s idea with Creds is that users can build a verifiable reputation across multiple platforms and communities, with full control over which credentials they decide to share with which groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, a decentralized identity does more than simply improve security and prevent fraud. One of the most promising aspects of Creds is its ability to enable new kinds of gamified engagement for communities. By creating a reputation layer, projects can explore new gamification mechanics such as incentivized quests or &ldquo;learn-to-earn&rdquo; courses, where users are rewarded for learning and participating in forums and community activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheqd&rsquo;s Head of Marketing &amp; Community Eduardo Hotta said Web3 organizations are very interested in becoming more community-focused. &ldquo;As an example, it's preferable to have a smaller number of real active community members, or superfans, than to have a group with thousands of bots,&rdquo; he said. With Creds, projects can prove they have viable, active and engaged communities and encourage people to build reputations within them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheqd notes that similar decentralized identity projects in the past have made use of NFTs and SoulBound Tokens with varying levels of success. Creds differ from previous initiatives because these tokens are completely private, revocable and portable, able to be used with multiple platforms and ecosystems. With Creds, all personally identifiable information is stored off-chain, privately and securely. This data is verified by decentralized identifiers on-chain and cryptographically signed to ensure trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creds are set to become a key aspect of cheqd&rsquo;s mission to build a trusted data economy based on lending markets, preference data markets and others that put users at the center. Cheqd supports these markets with a cutting-edge payment network that prioritizes individual&rsquo;s privacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Creds offers a privacy-preserving alternative to the surveillance enabling tech of SBTs and NFTs where you have little control over your privacy, as activities and other information are written on the ledger making it public and immutable,&rdquo; said cheqd co-founder and Chief Executive Fraser Edwards. &ldquo;Creds are collectable, portable, secure and verifiable; it has all the best things that the NFT and SBT have with the addition of everything else they are missing."</p>

<p>At Nebular Summit, all attendees were issued with Creds, enabling them to verifiably prove their attendance at the event without revealing their identities or any other information about themselves.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Grizzly.Fi, the trailblazing DeFi platform committed to democratizing innovative financial solutions, has shared a momentous announcement that transcends its vibrant community.</p>
<p>On July 21, 2023, Grizzly Trade, their decentralized perpetual platform built on opBNB in collaboration with Metavault Trade, officially launched on BNB Mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This highly anticipated release marks the platform's advancement into a new realm alongside its existing range of earning products, further benefiting the Grizzly ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
The First Decentralized Perpetuals on opBNB
<p>Grizzly, one of the most promising projects in the DeFi span, has launched its decentralized perpetual exchange, Grizzly Trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategic expansion marks a significant milestone for the Grizzly Ecosystem, as it taps into a new market and propels the platform towards its vision of becoming a decentralized hub for DeFi's finest utilities.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Metavault Trade, Grizzly.Fi has extended its product line to include a futures trading platform, providing additional benefits to the Grizzly ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The opBNB (BNB Layer 2) deployment process commenced on June 30, 2023, and made Grizzly Trade available for testing. Following the initial deployment on the opBNB Testnet, the platform was also launched on the BNB mainnet on July 21.</p>
<p>Grizzly Trade allows users to trade blue-chip cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and BNB with leverage of up to 50x while ensuring a fully non-custodial experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, providing a glimpse of the upcoming V2 update, which aims to transform the growing ecosystem into a beginner-friendly crypto hub.</p>
<p>Beyond its appeal as a new product catering to a broader audience, Grizzly Trade plays a vital role within the Grizzly ecosystem, serving as a lucrative real yield source for yield farmers. By providing liquidity, users can earn 50% of all platform fees while simultaneously being exposed to BTC, ETH, BNB, and stablecoins.</p>
<p>One of the most notable features of Grizzly Trade is the built-in Buyback &amp; Burn functionality for Grizzly's native token, "GHNY." This unique feature utilizes 25% of all generated platform fees to purchase GHNY from the open market and burn it. This mechanism effectively curbs inflation, transforming GHNY into an ultrasound (deflationary) token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grizzly Trade not only expands the potential market size by introducing a utility already utilized by thousands of individuals regularly but also stabilizes inflation and drives the protocol's traction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It signifies an important step towards achieving the overarching goal of the Grizzly ecosystem: to lead and onboard the next million users into DeFi.</p>
Win Big with GrizzlyFi's "Trade to Earn" and "Trade to Win" Challenges!
<p>In parallel with this launch and to celebrate it, GrizzlyFi establishes new trading challenges to reward and encourage new users to explore the platform: 'Trade to Earn' and 'Trade to Win.' With these two challenges, users can win impressive prizes from a reward pool of $20,000 in the 'Trade to Earn' challenge with a $1,000 transaction volume. Also, they can compete for some of the $50,000 and $30,000 prize pools in the 'Trade to Win Beginner' and 'Trade to Win Pro' challenges, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
Discover Grizzly.Fi
<p>Grizzly.Fi is a tech company founded in 2021, and it incorporates a DeFi platform dedicated to democratizing decentralized finance for all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Grizzly.Fi is also one of the most intuitive Liquidity Mining platforms. Renowned for its solutions and unwavering dedication to inclusivity, the company sets the benchmark in the industry.</p>
<p>Apart from its exceptional accessibility, Grizzly.Fi upholds an unwavering focus on security and transparency.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The South Korean Financial Services Commission's (FSC) decision to seize Delio&rsquo;s assets cast doubts over its future operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>South Korea's crypto lending powerhouse, Delio, established in 2018, is currently navigating stormy waters. Its woes began when the FSC, a local financial watchdog, took control of both the company's and its customers' assets. This included not just the tangible assets but also their cold wallets and ledgers. The seizure, a result of an ongoing legal tussle with its depositors, has put Delio in a tight spot, making it challenging for them to offer their regular suite of services.&nbsp;</p>
A suspension of interest payments
<p>The firm has emphasised the need to safeguard its assets, especially considering the interests of its depositors. In light of these events, Delio made the tough call to suspend interest payments to its deposit and vault users starting July 24. This move was not isolated; other services that demanded additional expenditures, like operational costs, were also put on hold.&nbsp;</p>
Deposits and withdrawals stopped
<p>This decision has understandably heightened concerns among their clientele. Delio's recent actions can be traced back to June 14 when they abruptly stopped deposits and withdrawals on their platform. This move was a protective measure against market volatility, which was exacerbated by similar actions from their sister lending company, Haru Invest. Haru Invest's decision to halt withdrawals was influenced by the discovery of misleading information from its consignment operator, B&amp;S Holdings.</p>
FSC gets involved&nbsp;
<p>The FSC's involvement deepened when they initiated an investigation into Delio's sudden transaction suspension. This probe culminated in a lawsuit against Delio, accusing them of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. The fallout from this legal action saw travel restrictions placed on Delio's CEO, Jeong Sang-ho, among others.&nbsp;</p>
One of the largest crypto lending platforms
<p>Despite the shadows currently cast on Delio, it's vital to recognize their significant standing in the crypto realm. They are one of South Korea's premier crypto lending platforms, boasting a vast array of services from custody to staking. Their impressive portfolio includes about $1 billion in Bitcoin, $200 million in Ether, and a staggering $8.1 billion in various other altcoins.</p>

There is no obligatory minimum staking time to withdraw the reward as well as there are no limits on the number of withdrawing requests.&nbsp;</p>How the reward is calculated<p>The amount of reward depends on the GGR of Fairspin casino and the number of tokens in the staking pool and the user's multiplier.</p><p>The user's multiplier depends on the length of your stake in days.</p><p>Calculation formula:</p><ul><li>from 0 to 1 day multiplier *0.3</li><li>from 7 to 30 days multiplier *0.6</li><li>30 to &infin; days multiplier *1</li></ul><p>The reward, in the end, will be equal to % of the GGR of the Fairspin casino multiplied by the user's share in the pool and multiplied by the time multiplier. If a user stakes tokens for 1 month and more, he will have the maximum benefit - a share of 0.5% of GGR.</p><p>The request to stop liquidity staking can be made at any time. A user can request to withdraw the full sum or a part of it.&nbsp;The tokens will be sent to a user&rsquo;s account immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>In case a user makes a request to withdraw a part of tokens from the Liquidity Staking, the reward multiplier for the rest of the tokens in Liquidity Staking will go back to the initial level.</p>About TFS Token&nbsp;<p>The TFS token is the driving force behind Fairspin, one of the leading global blockchain casinos, that ushers in a new era of trust and transparency in online gambling.</p><p>Built upon ERC-20/BEP-20 technology, the TFS token ensures immutable betting data, empowering players with complete access to their gaming history and rewards. With a limited supply and a focus on user rewards, the token introduces groundbreaking Play to Earn and Hold to Earn features, rewarding players for their engagement.</p><p>As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the TFS token stands at the forefront, revolutionizing the way players interact with online casinos and shaping the future of fair gaming.&nbsp;</p>ContactTFS Token PR teampr@fairspin.io]]></content:encoded>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>An obscure altcoin called the X token has surged by over 1000% following Elon Musk&rsquo;s announcement that Twitter is rebranding itself to X.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the token in question has absolutely no association with the rebranded Twitter or X.com, as it is now known.&nbsp;</p>
An Unprecedented Surge&nbsp;
<p>The X token is linked to an NFT marketplace that announced its closure back in May and registered a staggering increase following Elon Musk&rsquo;s announcement to rebrand Twitter to X.com. The token, which was trading at $0.00002, jumped to $0.00025. According to data from CoinGecko, the token&rsquo;s value has jumped by over 1000% over the past 12 hours. Most of the token&rsquo;s trading volume is on the SushiSwap decentralized exchange (DEX). However, despite the massive surge, the token&rsquo;s trading volume remains low, amounting to just $51,000.&nbsp;</p>
Is There An Association With Twitter?
<p>The surge occurred after Elon Musk announced an upcoming logo change for the social media platform. Following the announcement, users likely thought the token was related to the rebranded platform. However, the token was part of a project started by X, a decentralized NFT marketplace operating across several chains, and has no association with the rebranded Twitter. The X DAO is in charge of the platform&rsquo;s governance, and users who have staked their X tokens can exercise their voting rights after obtaining the veX governance tokens.&nbsp;</p>
Twitter&rsquo;s Rebranding&nbsp;
<p>Elon Musk had announced his plans to rebrand Twitter on Sunday, stating that he intended to retire the iconic blue bird logo that had been part of Twitter&rsquo;s global identity since its inception. In a tweet, he stated that if a good enough X logo is posted, it could go live within 24 hours. Following the tweet, X.com began redirecting to Twitter.com, with Musk tweeting about the company&rsquo;s rebrand to X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds. If a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we&rsquo;ll make it go live worldwide tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Musk had also sent an email to Twitter employees telling them about the change to X. He added that this would be the last time he would be using an email address associated with Twitter. While some users, specifically Musk fans, applauded the changes, long-time users of Twitter are miffed with the changes. Marques Brownlee, one of the most well-known names in tech, tweeted that he was still going to call the platform Twitter. Musk responded to the tweet, stating, &ldquo;Not for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The platform&rsquo;s rebrand is the clearest indication yet that Twitter is no longer the same social media platform purchased by Musk. Recently appointed chief executive officer of X Corp, which owns Twitter, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square. X is the future state of unlimited interactivity &ndash; centered in audio, video, messaging, and payments/banking &ndash; creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we&rsquo;re just beginning to imagine.&rdquo;</p>

Markets In Recovery?&nbsp;
<p>Apart from the X token surge, crypto markets remained dormant, with no major movements. The total market capitalization still stands at $1.23 trillion and has remained at that level for the past few days. Bitcoin prices had jumped over the $30,000 mark but have since fallen back, with BTC currently trading at $29,787. Most cryptocurrencies are firmly rooted in the red, with only a few exceptions.</p>
