<p>MoonPay, a cryptocurrency payments company, announced a major $555 million financing round in November 2021, with investors like Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management taking part during the Bitcoin craze, which reached a record high of over $69,000.</p>



<p>Insiders paid out $150 million in shares, according to <em>The Information</em>, with CEO Ivan Soto-Wright among the main sellers.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/166573-moonpay-25-mil-bayc-celebrities-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MoonPay</a> is a crypto infrastructure company that provides a payment gateway for crypto companies. The platform supports digital asset transfers, allowing users to easily acquire cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In 2021, the company received widespread notice for its non-fungible token (NFT) &#8220;concierge&#8221; service, which was lauded by celebrities like Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton.</p>

<p>The company was valued at $3.4 billion in the financing round, which was spearheaded by high-profile investors. Ivan Soto-Wright revealed in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/22/payments-infrastructure-firm-moonpay-raises-555m-at-a-34b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em> that the company intended to use the cash to expand its personnel and geographical reach, among other things. Nevertheless, rather than going to the firm, part of the funds was utilized to purchase shares from existing stockholders such as Soto-Wright.</p>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/moonpay-ceo-other-executives-cashed-out-before-crypto-business-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Information</a></em>, $405 million of the total funds came from selling shares to investors, while the remaining $150 million came from insiders cashing out their shares in a secondary transaction. This suggests that a significant portion of the cash generated was not reinvested in the firm. Soto-Wright acquired a $38 million estate in Miami a few weeks after the Series A fundraising round, a property he&#8217;s accustomed to throwing expensive parties like the one hosted during last year&#8217;s Art Basel art festival.</p>

<p>Today, Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) chief executive officer, Liang Fengyi, said it had developed a guide for virtual asset trading platform operators. The stated principle is that investor protection is a top priority.</p>



<p>On the same day, Liang Fengyi attended the outstanding leader&#8217;s webinar organized by the Hong Kong Institute of Finance and discussed the development of virtual assets in Hong Kong. Here she said that the Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission was criticized when it proposed to oversee the virtual asset trading platform in 2018.</p>



<p>The agency argues that the licensing system requires applicants to meet internal control and investor protection requirements, which will spur fintech firms to operate in Singapore and other places.</p>



<p>The market only understood the significance of these requirements once several offshore virtual asset platforms went bankrupt.</p>



<p>The guidelines for virtual asset trading platform operators in Hong Kong are expected to be effective in June. The CEO of SFC believes that the policies meet market expectations and put investor protection first, such as regulating the safe custody of assets, segregation of client assets, and avoiding conflicts of interest is right. She applauded the Hong Kong SFC as a leading role model for regulators.</p>

<p>Before the official launch, team members and early partners had already locked in $793,000 inside Origin Ether&#8217;s smart contracts. However, the public launch on May 16 led to a rapid accumulation of deposits, which resulted in a staggering TVL of over $13 million by May 30. This represents a gain of approximately $12.6 million in just two weeks.</p>



<p>Origin Ether&#8217;s official documentation reveals that the app generates yield from Ether by depositing it into multiple liquid staking and DeFi protocols. The app utilizes an algorithmic market operations strategy on Curve and Convex to maximize returns. Before being deposited into these protocols, some of the ETH is converted into liquid staking derivatives, such as Lido Staked Ether (stETH), Rocket Pool Ether (rETH), and Frax Staked Ether (sfrxETH). This allows users to gain additional farming rewards from these providers.</p>

<p>Liquid staking protocols have become increasingly popular as Ethereum moves towards proof-of-stake consensus and enables withdrawals. On May 1, DefiLlama reported that liquid staking protocols had surpassed decentralized exchanges to become the top DeFi category in terms of TVL. Cross-chain bridging protocol LayerZero also recently partnered with the Tenet network to increase the use of liquid staking in the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>



<p>Origin Ether&#8217;s impressive TVL in just 14 days clearly demonstrates the growing popularity and potential of yield farming applications and DeFi protocols in general. With more and more users looking to generate yields from their crypto holdings, it&#8217;s likely that we&#8217;ll see more innovative applications emerge in the near future.</p>

<p>Among them, the HKVAC Large Scale Cryptocurrency Index reflects the overall performance of high-cap cryptocurrencies in the global crypto market, including 30 cryptocurrencies with the highest international market capitalization that meet their candidate criteria.</p>



<p>The adjusted review date is the last day of each quarter (March, June, September, and December). Virtual asset exchange ratings reflect the reliability of the trading platform and promote transparency and accountability in the virtual asset trading market.</p>



<p>Professional and industry rating agencies established HKVAC. It includes virtual asset industry stakeholders, including big data companies, exchanges, institutional investors, and more, along with Hong Kong&#8217;s licensed rating agencies.</p>



<p>In an attempt to be the next crypto hub, the agency was created with the aim of creating a secure virtual asset investment environment to improve investors&#8217; recognition of assets and virtual products.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Paxful&#8217;s new interim CEO, Roshan Dharia, aims to strengthen operations and explore strategic alternatives.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform previously experienced a short conflict between former CEO Ray Youssef and co-founder Artur Schaback over the use of exchange funds in early 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>The conflict led to blocked salaries and resignations from certain teams and contractors, and Yousseff allegedly shut down Paxful on his own accord before stepping down.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On May 30th, Paxful announced that Roshan Dharia will be the company&#8217;s interim CEO. </strong></h5>

<p>The new CEO will be responsible for enhancing operations and identifying strategic alternatives. Roshan Dharia expressed his excitement about his new role, stating, &#8220;I am thrilled to become the CEO of Paxful. I plan to hit the ground running and build on the innovative technology created by the Paxful team.&#8221; Roshan previously served as a senior executive at TrustToken, which is well-known for being the creator of TrueUSD (TUSD), the fifth-largest stablecoin in terms of market capitalization.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the onboarding of the new CEO was not without controversy. The former CEO &#8211; Ray Youssef, took to Twitter to criticize the company&#8217;s decision to appoint Roshan. Youssef tweeted, &#8220;PF has a new defi CEO…expect a token soon.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting that Ray Youssef has no involvement in Paxful&#8217;s business decisions, and he advised users to approach Roshan directly with any concerns.</p>

<p>Paxful has had some issues in the recent past. Youssef had a disagreement with co-founder Artur Schaback over the use of exchange funds in early 2023. This led to blocked salaries and resignations from certain teams and contractors. Yousseff allegedly shut down Paxful on his own accord when it halted services on April 4th. He subsequently resigned from his role and committed his funds to a public trust that would be used to repay users.</p>

<p>It was on May 31 that the co-founder of the RPG series Illuvium, Kieran Warwick, released a statement in the Discord community that he had raised an additional $10 million in funding from Framework Ventures.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="645" height="331" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png" alt="Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures" class="wp-image-191102" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png 645w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" title="Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures 21"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The money raised will accelerate the development of this game. This transaction is completed through a token, which will be locked for two years and will not be included in the commit, so it will not participate in the distribution of benefits.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Illuvium is an entirely decentralized collectible and role-playing game built on the Immutable X L2 network. Illuvium is about to launch a public beta with three interactive AAA games: Zero (city builder), Overworld (monster world), and Arena (arena).</p>



<p>Founded last year by Kieran and Aaron Warwick, this RPG has created a game that rewards players with the chance to discover and capture NFT creatures, known as Illuvials, in combat. The game incentivizes players to have a stake in the project, as the Illuvium network allows in-game fees to be paid out to staked token holders as ongoing rewards.</p>

<p>In March 2021, Illuvium successfully raised $5 million in a seed round led by one of the oldest venture capital funds in the decentralized finance, Framework Ventures. The project has also received financial support from IOSG Ventures, LD Capital, Delphi Digital, YBB Foundation Ltd, Stake Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, Lotus Capital, Blocksync Ventures, Bitscale Capital, Quantstamp, Yield Guild Games, Bitcoin.com, …</p>



<p>In mid-April 2022, Framework Ventures, a backer of Illuvium and Stardust, said it would invest $200 million in blockchain game projects following the launch of a $400 million fund.</p>

<p>The exchange initially sent a series of test transactions involving all these assets to Alameda on May 23, with the transactions being worth $10 each. These transactions were intended to return FTX and Alameda&#8217;s frozen funds on the OKX platform. In March, OKX seized $157 million in cryptocurrency assets after FTX collapsed in November 2022. The latest transfers continue OKX&#8217;s efforts to return these funds to their rightful owners.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Alameda Research is transferring its leftover funds to Coinbase. In the past week, the bankrupt firm has transferred $10 million worth of USDT from its cold wallets to Coinbase Prime and deposited $31.2 million to the U.S.-based exchange. According to Arkham Intelligence, Alameda has transferred more than $250 million to Coinbase over the past month.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>A Coinbase user&#8217;s statement about a privacy violation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not receive much support from the judge.</em></li>



<li><em>The ruling strengthens the IRS&#8217;s authority over financial data collection, potentially setting a precedent for future privacy challenges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US District Court Judge Joseph N. Laplante dismissed Coinbase user James Harper&#8217;s request to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to obtain personal data from <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191053-former-coinbase-settles-charges-with-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> in a ruling.</strong></h5>

<p>The IRS obtaining his data through subpoenas does not violate Harper&#8217;s right to a fair hearing or protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>



<p>However, in his most recent judgment, Laplante sided with the IRS, and he stated that Harper had no standing to claim an interest in the records under the Fourth or Fifth Amendments. Harper&#8217;s claim of a privacy violation was further weakened by the judge&#8217;s assertion that Coinbase was the rightful custodian of Harper&#8217;s account documents.</p>



<p>Judge Laplante noted that Harper voluntarily disclosed his information to Coinbase. Additionally, the company&#8217;s privacy policy warns against possible government expropriation, and this significantly undermines Harper&#8217;s view that disclosure to Coinbase is voluntary.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="885" height="497" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png" alt="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data" class="wp-image-191079" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png 885w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-300x168.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-768x431.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" title="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data 31"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This reaffirms the broad authority that the IRS has, allowing it to issue subpoenas in a variety of circumstances. The ruling strengthens the IRS&#8217;s right to collect financial data, potentially setting a precedent for future privacy challenges.</p>



<p>In addition, the judge dismissed Harper&#8217;s claim of a breach of due process and stated that Harper did not have any property rights to the record. Even if he had such rights, the summons would be significantly restricted, requiring court approval.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the plaintiff, James Harper, opened accounts on exchanges like Coinbase in 2013 and received Bitcoin as income for his consulting work. In 2016, the IRS issued a subpoena to this exchange seeking anonymous taxpayer information, which Coinbase initially denied, leading to a second legal pursuit by the IRS to ensure compliance.</p>

<p>Former FTX SBF CEO has challenged his criminal charges after being extradited from the Bahamas. The US Department of Justice is <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/148/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking a specialty waiver</a> from the Bahamas to allow certain cases to proceed.</p>



<p>Since the SBF was extradited last December, prosecutors have filed a number of alternative indictments against him on new charges.</p>



<p>SBF, which<a href="https://news.coincu.com/186038-sbf-asks-us-judge-drop-criminal-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has pleaded not guilty</a> to criminal charges, including bank fraud, is awaiting trial in October. The crypto prodigy was formally arrested in the Bahamas and later extradited to the United States, where he is currently located under house arrest at his parents&#8217; home in California.</p>



<p>The FTX founder recently countered a number of criminal charges against him, arguing that the government had &#8220;inappropriately added&#8221; &#8220;several new, unrelated allegations without concurrence.&#8221; that was the clear intention of the Bahamian government.&#8221; He has offered to dismiss 10 of the 13 criminal charges against him.</p>

<p>US prosecutors say they will not pursue certain charges against the founder of FTX if the island nation says they violated the terms of his extradition. They acknowledged in court documents filed Monday that some charges could be dropped if the Bahamas objected.</p>



<p>Although prosecutors argued that Bankman-Fried could not challenge the charges based on his extradition, they noted that the Bahamian government could prevent parts of the case from continuing. The judge is expected to hear arguments on the matter on June 15.</p>



<p>Prosecutors said the Bahamas was the only party involved in the Bankman-Fried trial that could raise valid objections to the newer charges on grounds related to the extradition agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC announced that former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi and his brother had agreed to settle allegations of insider trading.</em></li>



<li><em>Wahi received a two-year jail term earlier this month after pleading guilty to similar criminal counts.</em></li>



<li><em>In Wahi&#8217;s insider trading case, Coinbase has not been accused of any misconduct.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> on May 30 that former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil Wahi had agreed to resolve accusations of insider trading filed against them. The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a motion for final judgment in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.</strong></h5>

<p>The brothers were detained last year on suspicion of wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with an insider trading scam. The SEC filed insider trading accusations on the same day. According to the SEC&#8217;s release on Tuesday, the two agreed to disgorge their earnings and pay interest.</p>



<p>They pled guilty to the allegations brought by the Department of Justice, and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186281-former-coinbase-manager-2-years-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ishan Wahi</a> now faces a 2-year term, while Nikhil Wahi is serving a 10-month sentence. The SEC said that the brothers&#8217; criminal fines satisfied the civil case settlements and that it would not pursue any further penalties.</p>



<p>Wahi&#8217;s SEC cooperation agreement covers his own case as well as any relevant judicial or administrative process or inquiry started by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party, implying that he may participate in the separate probe.</p>

<p>SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal said in a statement that the suspected conduct is not new.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We allege that Ishan and Nikhil Wahi, respectively, tipped and traded securities based on material nonpublic information, and that’s insider trading, pure and simple. The federal securities laws do not exempt crypto asset securities from the prohibition against insider trading, nor does the SEC. I am grateful to the SEC staff for successfully working to resolve this matter,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The SEC alleged in its initial complaint against Wahi last year that the tokens at the center of the insider trading allegations were unregistered securities, which means the SEC could try to hold Coinbase liable for facilitating the sale of unregistered security investments for the tokens that the company eventually listed.</p>



<p>The settlement ended the court action that was supposed to determine whether nine of the cryptocurrencies at the core of the dispute were, in fact, securities, as the SEC alleged. Ishan Wahi contended in his first answer to the SEC complaint that the tokens were not securities.</p>



<p>Coinbase postponed any SEC action last month by suing the agency for a response to a petition for crypto-specific regulations. The case is being fought by the SEC.</p>
