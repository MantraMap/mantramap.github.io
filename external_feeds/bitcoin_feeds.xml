Notably, Cboe&#8217;s amended filings now include Coinbase as a partner in the surveillance-sharing agreement for the spot bitcoin ETFs.</strong></p>
<h2>Cboe Responds to SEC&#8217;s Concerns, Revises Spot Bitcoin ETF Filings With Coinbase Collaboration</h2>
<p>Following a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/insiders-say-sec-deems-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-other-applications-as-inadequate/">disclosing</a> the dissatisfaction of SEC insiders with the recent batch of spot bitcoin ETF applications by several prominent financial institutions, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">Blackrock</a>, Wisdomtree, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-funds-joins-race-for-sec-approval-as-it-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Valkyrie</a>, Fidelity, Ark Investment, and Invesco, four firms re-submitted their filings on Friday.</p>
<p>In an article by WSJ contributor Vicky Ge Huang, insiders, described as &#8220;people familiar with the matter,&#8221; revealed on Friday that the regulatory body deemed the ETF registrations inadequate. Cboe and Nasdaq were among those informed of this development, the WSJ report noted.</p>
<p>According to Ge Huang&#8217;s report, a spokeswoman from Cboe confirmed the exchange&#8217;s intention to resubmit its spot bitcoin ETF filings. True to their word, Cboe proceeded to <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1674882432506511360?s=20">update</a> and make necessary <a href="https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/">amendments</a> to the filings, which were initially submitted by Fidelity, Vaneck, Invesco, and Wisdomtree.</p>
<p>A significant development in the amendments came on Friday, as Coinbase was designated as a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) partner. It&#8217;s worth noting that while Blackrock and Ark did not resubmit their applications, Blackrock had already identified Coinbase as its SSA partner.</p>

<p>To date, the U.S. regulatory watchdog remains skeptical of the spot bitcoin ETF sponsors&#8217; ability to safeguard the funds against manipulation and ensure investor protection. Despite granting approval for multiple futures exchange-traded funds, the SEC recently greenlit a bitcoin futures ETF with leverage.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the latest ETF applications and Blackrock&#8217;s filing have designated Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) partner. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the San Francisco-based firm is currently entangled in a legal dispute with the securities regulator, as the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">SEC filed a lawsuit</a> against the exchange.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will the inclusion of Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner in the resubmitted spot Bitcoin ETF filings be enough to satisfy the SEC&#8217;s concerns? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Inscription activity has continued to rise since then. In addition to text, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and fungible BRC20 tokens, Ordinal inscription technology has ushered in a new naming standard called Sats Names, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Sats Names Emerge</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://ordinals.com/">statistics</a>, in June 2023, Ordinal inscriptions surpassed the 14 million mark. As of July 1, 2023, there are now over <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/29230dc6f06c9cbfbfcf8c90105ee7166a6c77f71fbb0ee3c322096e48cc74dci0">14.41 million inscriptions</a>. So far, this trend has provided bitcoin miners with an additional <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">1,799.65 BTC</a>, equivalent to roughly $54 million in inscription-related fees.</p>
<p>The vast majority (86%) of these inscriptions are simple plain text, while the remaining inscriptions are various file types such as JPGs and PNGs. Furthermore, Ordinal inscriptions have catalyzed the emergence of a new form of Bitcoin-based tokens under the BRC20 standard.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/exploring-the-world-of-rare-satoshis-collectors-embrace-the-value-of-unique-bitcoin-artifacts/">new concepts</a> such as &#x201C;rare satoshis&#x201D; or &#x201C;satributes&#x201D; have emerged, along with a new trend known as Sats Names. <a href="https://docs.sats.id/sats-names/sns-spec/mint-names">Sats Names</a>, also referred to as SNS, is a standard for creating human-readable names on the Bitcoin blockchain using Ordinal inscription technology.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-595852 size-full" title="Bitcoin's Sats Names Ecosystem Flourishes: 370,000 SNS Names Inscribed" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc.jpg" alt="Bitcoin's Sats Names Ecosystem Flourishes: 370,000 SNS Names Inscribed" width="1280" height="300" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc-300x70.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc-1024x240.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc-768x180.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>This allows users to mint names with appended extensions like .sats and .xbt. For example, a user could choose a name like satoshi.sats or jimmy.sats. The guidelines specify that each ordinal can have only one name, and any UTF-8 character is permissible.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Capitalization does not matter,&#x201D; the Sats Names documentation details. &#x201C;All names will be registered as lowercase. No spaces are permitted within a name.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To check the availability of a Sats Name, individuals can use the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/satsnames/repositories">Sats Names API</a>, a web service that allows users to query the availability of Sats Names. Names are obtained on a first-come, first-served basis and can be purchased through various marketplaces focused on Ordinals.</p>
<p>The concept of decentralized name services has been present since Namecoin in 2011, and similar ideas have been implemented on other blockchains, such as the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) standard.</p>

<p>According to the Sats Names documentation, as of June 2023, there have been 250,000 .sats names inscribed, along with an additional 120,000 SNS names inscribed for other namespaces such as .ord, .btc, and .xbt.</p>
<p>The documentation indicates that so far, around 50,000 users currently possess SNS names, and it states that SNS name resolution is supported on the Unisat wallet and Ordinals wallet.</p>

<p>Among 22 different networks, Bitcoin emerges as the second-highest blockchain in terms of sales. In June, BTC-based NFT sales amounted to $110.30 million, representing 15.60% of the total sales. However, there was a significant decline of 42.36% in Bitcoin-centric NFT sales compared to the previous month&#x2019;s figures. On the other hand, Solana-based NFT sales witnessed a remarkable surge, soaring 65% higher than the previous month&#x2019;s sales, reaching an impressive $70.42 million.</p>

<p>Completing the top five blockchains in terms of sales are Mythos and Polygon, trailing behind <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, and SOL. However, both Mythos and Polygon experienced a decline in NFT sales during June compared to May. Mythos registered $28,322,124 in sales, representing a decrease of 19.75%, while Polygon saw sales amounting to $27,846,781, marking a significant drop of 45.91% from the previous month. Taking the lead as the highest-grossing NFT collection in June, based on 30-day sales, was Uncategorized Ordinals, raking in an impressive total of $52.91 million.</p>

<p>In June, Uncategorized Ordinal NFT sales witnessed a notable increase of 1.44% compared to May. Following closely behind was the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), securing the second spot with $49.76 million, up 28.20% higher than BAYC sales in May. The subsequent three leading collections after Uncategorized Ordinal NFT and BAYC NFT sales were Azuki, Azuki Elemental, and SMB Barrel Raffle. Among the top five <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">highest-priced NFT sales</a> in June, four out of five were BTC-based NFTs, with the exception being the NFT Fidenza #545.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, as the token rallied to a multi-month high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $91.73 during Friday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $111.76 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of the rally, litecoin peaked at its strongest point since April 7 last year, when price reached a top at $116.00.</p>

<p>After breaking out of a ceiling at 61.00 on the relative strength index (RSI), <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> bulls took the index past yet another ceiling.</p>
<p>This time at the 68.00 level, with price strength peaking at 73.91 to start the weekend, which is its highest point since January.</p>
<p>Litecoin has since gone on to retreat from today&#x2019;s high, and as of writing, is trading at $110.17.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Another notable gainer on Saturday was dogecoin (DOGE), which climbed to a three-week high to start the weekend.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD jumped to a peak of $0.07079 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after falling to $0.06264.</p>
<p>The move saw the world&#x2019;s largest meme coin jump nearly 5% higher, hitting its highest level since June 10 in the process.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, Saturday&#x2019;s surge saw dogecoin collide with a key resistance level at $0.07000, before dropping lower.</p>
<p>DOGE is now trading at $0.06835, with the RSI hovering around the 56.00 mark, which is marginally above a ceiling at 55.00.</p>
<p>A target of $0.0750 likely remains on the agenda for bulls, however they face some challenges this weekend in order to reach this point.</p>

Markets moved to rebound on Saturday, after better than expected consumer sentiment data in the United Stated spooked traders. Bitcoin also rebounded, after falling below $30,000 on Friday.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>After falling below the $30,000 level during Friday&#x2019;s session, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rebounded on Saturday, however sentiment was still somewhat bearish.</p>
<p>Following a high of $31,093.98 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low at $29,600.28 as the session progressed.</p>
<p>However, the price is now trading at $30,444.75, as bulls moved to buy the dip, pushing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> higher to start the weekend.</p>

<p>As per the chart, the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) found a floor at the 63.00 mark.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 65.64, and seems to be heading for a resistance point around the 70.00 level.</p>
<p>A collision with this target will likely result in bitcoin once again moving above $31,000.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>On the other hand, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was largely bullish to start the weekend, with price surging to a two-month high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD has peaked at $1,945.27 so far on Saturday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $1,831.28.</p>
<p>As a result of this rally, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency jumped to its strongest point since May 6.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this move was a breakout, which saw the RSI move past a ceiling at the 58.00 point.</p>
<p>As of writing, it appears that this break may have been false, and the index is now at a reading of 58.17, giving up earlier gains.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is now trading at $1,914.81.</p>

In an interview on CNBC, Clayton stated that the SEC&#8217;s strategy of bringing myriad cases to court against U.S. corporations was problematic &#8220;at a 30,000-foot level.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Jay Clayton Criticizes SEC&#8217;s Case Volume Strategy</h2>
<p>Jay Clayton, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), voiced his concerns with the new &#8220;ethos&#8221; of U.S. regulators, which involves bringing many cases to court, even those they think won&#8217;t succeed. In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jv8LcYg6QA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> on CNBC, Clayton referred to this enforcement strategy as a &#8220;fundamental shift&#8221; from how Americans view the role of the government.</p>
<p>About this new strategic approach, Clayton stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to be in a place where I know the government is going to bring cases they think they are going to lose; imagine you are the person that is subject to that case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Clayton declared that when agencies have the power of the state, they are &#8220;supposed to only bring cases and only make rules you think are going to pass judicial muster.&#8221;</p>

<h2>U.S. Enforcement Strategy Is &#8216;Problematic&#8217;</h2>
<p>Clayton also noted how state agencies believe that if they are not losing in courts, it can be perceived as if they have failed to fulfill their role as regulators, and how this can present problems for companies involved in these cases.</p>
<p>He explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you are hearing from the leaders of the regulatory organizations is if we&#8217;re not losing cases, if we&#8217;re not being pushed back on by the courts we&#8217;re not doing enough &#8230; At a 30,000-foot level, I think that&#8217;s problematic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Africa&#8217;s Share of Global Blockchain Funding Still Under 1%</h2>
<p>According to the latest Emurgo State of Web 3.0 in Africa report, the African continent’s cryptocurrency market &#8220;grew by over 1,200% between 2020 and 2021.&#8221; In addition, four African countries, namely Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania now feature the in the world’s top 20 for crypto adoption.</p>
<p>As shown by the data shared in the <a href="https://www.emurgo.africa/reports/emurgo-web-3-0-research-report.pdf">report</a>, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa accounted for 70% of the $88.5 million in blockchain funding which the continent received in 2021. However, despite this and the fact that African blockchain venture funding growth &#8220;was 11 times more when compared to general funding growth,&#8221; the continent’s share of total global blockchain funding is only 0.5%. This figure is nevertheless expected to grow when more companies attempt to create solutions to solve problems faced by the continent’s residents.</p>
<p>However, despite the underlying technology&#8217;s promise, as well as the impact that crypto assets have had on African residents, the report reveals that as much as 20% of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have banned crypto assets. The rest have either imposed some restrictions or implicit bans. The Central African Republic is the only African country to designate bitcoin as a legal tender.</p>
<p>As noted in the report, many countries in Africa have not embraced crypto assets due to their perceived risky nature. The collapse of crypto giants like the exchange FTX and subsequent ripple effects have seemingly reinforced governments’ negative perceptions about crypto assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Mitigating Against Risks Arising From Regulatory Changes</h2>
<p>Therefore, in order to help the continent’s crypto industry get on the good side of authorities, the authors of the report urged industry participants to consider working closely with regulators.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the need for the regulation of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies increases, key stakeholders need to work closely with regulators. This will ensure that risks that may arise as a result of regulatory changes are adequately mitigated,&#8221; authors of the Emurgo State of Web 3.0 report said.</p>
<p>More transparent regulations, on the other hand, will ostensibly see blockchain’s use cases increase. This increase in use cases will in turn spur further investments in the industry, according to the report.</p>

A rejection would prevent the exchange from advertising and growing in the major European market and deal another blow to its efforts to do regulated business on the Old Continent.</strong></p>
<h2>Germany Rejects Binance Bid to Obtain Bafin License, Sources Claim</h2>
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bafin</a>) has informed Binance it will not be licensed as a crypto custodian, the German financial news magazine Finance Forward revealed in a <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> quoting sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The digital asset exchange, the world’s largest by trading volume, can only expand its business in Germany if it receives the regulatory approval, the publication noted. Without it, it’s not allowed to advertise, for example, and German regulators have already targeted other crypto companies for that, including trading platforms like Crypto.com and Uniswap.</p>
<p>Bafin declined to clarify the situation with a spokesperson saying the authority does not comment on individual companies. “While we cannot share details of our discussions with regulators, we are continuing to work to meet Bafin requirements,” a representative of Binance was quoted as stating. The spokesperson emphasized this is an ongoing process and also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures in place to continue our discussions with the regulators in Germany.</p></blockquote>
<p> has been under increased pressure from regulatory bodies in Europe and elsewhere. Authorities in Belgium <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> the exchange to cease all crypto services while prosecutors in France <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">launched</a> an investigation based on money laundering allegations.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">exited</a> the Dutch market, after failing to register as a crypto service provider, applied for deregistration in Cyprus, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">cancelled</a> its U.K. authorization. The company also withdrew its application for license in Austria, Finance Forward noted.</p>
<p>This week, news came out that the exchange is looking for a new banking partner for euro deposits and withdrawals after payment processor Paysafe <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-lose-euro-transfers-as-paysafe-drops-support/">announced</a> its decision to discontinue support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEPA</a> transfers to and from the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

The court filing, submitted on Friday, states that the IRS is seeking details pertaining to accounts that registered an annual trading activity of $20,000 or higher during the years 2016 to 2020.</strong></p>
<h2>IRS Gains Court Order for Kraken&#8217;s Customer Data in Crypto Tax Investigation</h2>
<p>Last February, the IRS submitted a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66785511/united-states-v-payward-ventures-inc/">court petition</a> to the Northern District of California, outlining its intention to thoroughly investigate Kraken&#8217;s financial records and data in order to uncover cryptocurrency users who may have neglected their tax obligations. The petition specifically requested access to Kraken&#8217;s &#8220;books, records, papers, and other data.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The IRS is conducting an investigation to determine the identity and correct federal income tax liability of U.S. persons who conducted transactions in cryptocurrency for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020,” the petition declared.</p>
<p>According to the IRS, the tax agency sent Kraken’s parent company Payward Ventures Inc. a summons in 2021 in order to get customer info for traders who used the platform during the 2016-2020 period. The government believes that it has a valid reason for requesting the materials listed in the subpoena. The presiding judge Joseph C. Spero ruled that the IRS is authorized “to obtain items of even potential relevance to an ongoing investigation, without reference to its admissibility.”</p>
<p>Consequently, Spero granted the IRS&#8217;s request and authorized an order for Kraken to disclose comprehensive user information, including full names, pseudonyms or user IDs, dates of birth, taxpayer identification numbers, physical addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses. This requirement encompasses all Kraken users who have engaged in transactions involving cryptocurrency assets, regardless of the transaction type, with a combined value equal to or surpassing $20,000 within any of the stated years.</p>
<p>In November 2017, Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/court-ruling-grants-the-irs-personal-data-of-14000-coinbase-users/">complied</a> with a federal court order in San Francisco that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-compelled-by-irs-to-provide-13000-customers-information/">compelled</a> the company to disclose customer data to the IRS. The ruling mandated Coinbase to provide the tax agency with identifying details of users who had engaged in transactions exceeding $20,000 between 2013 and 2015. The IRS had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-irs-may-get-approved-to-conduct-coinbase-tax-probe/">set its sights</a> on cryptocurrency tax evaders, and Coinbase became entangled in the pursuit for information. The IRS&#8217;s legal tussle with Coinbase was referenced multiple times in the court case against Kraken.</p>

He stressed that there is nothing more destructive to wealth than inflation, emphasizing that the Fed &#8220;must keep their feet to the floorboard to prevent a re-occurrence of inflationary pressures.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Brandt’s Advice for the Federal Reserve</h2>
<p>Veteran trader Peter Brandt has urged the Federal Reserve to remain hawkish and increase interest rates by another 100 basis points. Brandt has been a futures and FX career trader since 1975. He is a chartist and the author of the Factor Report. He trades a variety of markets, including Dow futures, bonds, corn, crude oil, European wheat, Osaka Dow, U.S. dollar, and sugar.</p>
<p>“The U.S. Fed was negligent for not aggressively raising rates in early 2021,&#8221; he tweeted Thursday. &#8220;Traders knew this, but the Ph.D.s had their heads up their butts.&#8221; He added: &#8220;But now, I congratulate the Fed as it wants to remain hawkish. The market is concerned about unemployment and possible recession. Those are the least of our worries.”</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;higher unemployment is the least of our worries,&#8221; Brandt opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is NOTHING more destructive to wealth than inflation. The Fed must keep their feet to the floorboard to prevent a re-occurrence of inflationary pressures. While the Fed was asleep at the switch in 2021, increasing rates another 100 basis points would do wonders to protect the nation&#8217;s wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In March, Brandt tweeted that people who criticized the Federal Reserve for risking a recession because of rate hikes “know not of what they speak.” He believes that a recession would be beneficial in the long term, claiming that “Only those who have lived with rampant inflation (including U.S. in 1970s) can truly understand the destructive impact on wealth of inflation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emphasizing that “The Fed should be slammed” for not raising interest rates by 300 basis points in early 2022, he stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The damage to personal wealth because of inflation is far more dangerous than a recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">paused</a> raising interest rates during its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in June after 10 consecutive rate increases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">more rate hikes</a> this year but at a &#8220;moderate pace.&#8221;</p>
