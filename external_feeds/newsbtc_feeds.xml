					<description><![CDATA[Optimism (OP) is a layer 2 scaling solution that operates on top of the Ethereum mainnet, providing faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum users. It was launched in 2020 and has quickly become one of the most popular scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. On June 6, Optimism released its much-anticipated Bedrock upgrade, which promised to improve the network&#8217;s transaction speed and reduce gas fees.  Related Reading: Ripple Emails Reveal: XRP Buybacks Were On The Table To Prop Up Price Optimism Upgrade Delivers On Promises The upgrade has since delivered on its promises, with daily transactions on the network increasing by about 67% to around 500,000 transactions, and gas fees reduced by approximately 50% to around $50,000. According to Nansen, a leading blockchain data analytics platform, the Bedrock upgrade has been a significant milestone for Optimism. The increased transaction speed and reduced gas fees have made the network more efficient and cost-effective, attracting more users to the platform. Furthermore, the Bedrock upgrade by Optimism has brought significant improvements to the protocol, enhancing the network&#8217;s performance and user experience.  One of the most notable improvements is the enhanced transaction throughput, which has significantly increased the number of transactions processed per second.  This has substantially increased daily transactions on the network, enabling users to execute transactions quickly and efficiently. In addition, the upgrade has also introduced lower gas fees on the Optimism network, reducing the cost of transactions for users, which is especially beneficial for those previously deterred by high gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet, making the network more cost-effective and accessible for all users. The Bedrock upgrade has also introduced several improvements to the developer experience on the network, including better documentation and tooling, making it easier for developers to build and deploy applications on the Optimism network, driving innovation and growth in the platform. Moreover, the Bedrock upgrade has also increased the network&#8217;s decentralization, making it more resilient to attacks and more secure overall. This has boosted user confidence in the network and attracted more users to the platform. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Soars 10% In The Last Week, More Rallies Ahead? Overall, the Bedrock upgrade has significantly improved the Optimism network, delivering enhanced transaction throughput, lower gas fees, improved developer experience, and increased decentralization.  These improvements have cemented Optimism&#8217;s position as a leading Ethereum layer 2 solutions and are set to drive the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Ethereum network. As of the time of writing, OP’s expectations for further recovery and bullish momentum have diminished. Currently, OP is trading at $1,286, and it has been on a minor downtrend since it encountered its nearest resistance wall at the $1,508 level, which it lost in March 2023.  As seen in the chart above, the daily chart of OP&#8217;s Average Directional Index (ADX) shows a significant decline, indicating the loss of its bullish momentum and the entry of a new downtrend test. Despite this, OP investors are depending on the $1.087 support floor in case of further drops to surpass its yearly high of $3,323, which it reached on February 24th.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Crypto investment products are once again proving their market allure, with inflows hitting their highest level since July 2022. European asset management firm, CoinShares, noted an influx of $199 million just last week, signaling revived interest from investors in the crypto space. The surge is seen as a correction, compensating for almost half of the outflows observed in the preceding 9 weeks. CoinShares attributed the surge to recent filings for physically backed ETFs from high-profile issuers. Particularly, the crypto market is evidently witnessing a rebirth of enthusiasm as global asset management giants, such as BlackRock, file for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Takes The Lion&#8217;s Share In this wave of increased inflows, Bitcoin emerged as the undisputed front-runner. Bitcoin-centric investment products saw inflows of $188 million last week, according to CoinShares. On the other hand, short-bitcoin continued its trend of nine consecutive weeks of outflows, reaching $4.9 million. These contrasting trends are a testament to Bitcoin&#8217;s persistent allure amid market fluctuations. Ethereum also registered inflows, albeit at a comparatively lesser scale of $7.8 million. CoinShares’ data implies a currently subdued investor appetite for Ethereum as compared to Bitcoin. Notably, despite the Bitcoin and Ethereum domination, there&#8217;s a visible, albeit &#8220;very minor&#8221;, flow towards alternative cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Solana. This points to a diverse market interest, even if it doesn&#8217;t match the scale of the major cryptos. The improved market sentiment is also persuading investors towards multi-asset investment ETPs. These ETPs saw an inflow of $8 million last week, which further emphasizes the ongoing diversification of investor interests in the crypto asset class. Record High For Crypto Assets Under Management With the increased inflows, the total assets under management (AUM) across fund managers have now also reached $37 billion. This is the highest level noted since before the collapse of Three Arrows Capital. It underscores not just the resilience of the crypto market, but also the continued faith that investors place in it. It is worth noting that alongside the surge in crypto investment inflows, the crypto market particularly large crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has seen a rebound from its losses amid the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. In the past day, Bitcoin experienced a slight dip of 0.6%, but its trading price continues to hover above the recently regained $30,000 benchmark. The past week has seen an addition of over $70 billion to Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap, boosting it from a low of $514 billion the previous Monday to exceed $580 billion today. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been on the fence in the last 24 hours with no significant movement. The second-largest asset by market cap currently has a daily trading volume above $8 billion and a market cap of $226 billion. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like a strong cup of highly-caffeinated coffee or the sound of a rooster crowing at the crack of dawn, some things have the potential to be a real eye-opener. When it comes to altcoins, crypto investors could get a wake up alarm they won’t be able to ignore. Keep reading to learn all about the morning star pattern that recently appeared on the weekly chart of several blue chip cryptocurrencies. Why Crypto Could Be In For A Good “Morning” Earlier in June, the United States SEC launched an onslaught of enforcement action against Binance and Coinbase. Many top altcoins were named as securities in the case. This list explicitly mentioned MATIC, SOL, and a handful of others. The result was a deep selloff, severely worsened as US-based institutions began unloading altcoin holdings en masse without care of market impact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $30,000: Is The Bull Run Back On? However, following the news that BlackRock and several other institutions were filing for Bitcoin ETFs, the market staged a strong recovery. The rebound was especially powerful in altcoins, which have been extremely oversold in the midst of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty. The sharp turnaround was also enough to form a morning star pattern in many top cryptocurrencies . Top altcoins have formed a morning star pattern &#124; ETHUSD on TradingView.com The Morning Star Pattern: A Wake Up Call For Altcoins A morning star pattern has formed on blue chip altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin, Chainlink, and Fetch.ai. This type of Japanese candlestick pattern is a potential bullish reversal pattern with powerful implications. The pattern solidified with Sunday night’s weekly close, but to fully confirm must be followed by further upside.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like a strong cup of highly-caffeinated coffee or the sound of a rooster crowing at the crack of dawn, some things have the potential to be a real eye-opener.</p>
<p>When it comes to altcoins, crypto investors could get a wake up alarm they won’t be able to ignore. Keep reading to learn all about the morning star pattern that recently appeared on the weekly chart of several blue chip cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Why Crypto Could Be In For A Good “Morning”</h2>
<p>Earlier in June, the United States SEC launched an onslaught of enforcement action against Binance and Coinbase. Many top altcoins were named as securities in the case. This list explicitly mentioned MATIC, SOL, and a handful of others.</p>
<p>The result was a deep selloff, severely worsened as US-based institutions began unloading altcoin holdings en masse without care of market impact.</p>

<p>However, following the news that BlackRock and several other institutions were filing for Bitcoin ETFs, the market staged a strong recovery.</p>
<p>The rebound was especially powerful in altcoins, which have been extremely oversold in the midst of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty. The sharp turnaround was also enough to form a morning star pattern in many top cryptocurrencies</p>

<h2>The Morning Star Pattern: A Wake Up Call For Altcoins</h2>
<p>A morning star pattern has formed on blue chip altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin, Chainlink, and Fetch.ai. This type of Japanese candlestick pattern is a potential bullish reversal pattern with powerful implications.</p>
<p>The pattern solidified with Sunday night’s weekly close, but to fully confirm must be followed by further upside. This upside is expected to materialized within 3-5 candlesticks, or in this case, weeks.</p>

<p>With many of these more fundamentally-sound and regulator-friendly coins recovering most of what they lost in June, follow through could spark a more significant bullish trend across the brutalized altcoin space.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The month of June is quickly drawing to an end and although the price of Bitcoin is maintaining a bullish streak, it is still sitting well below expectations. However, all hope is not lost as the market moves into the month of July which has historically been a bullish month for the digital asset. So the question now is, will Bitcoin will able to finally break above the $36,000 level in the new month? July Could Hold The Answers For Bitcoin In a June 26 report, Markus Thielen, Head of Research at Matrixport pointed to a possible bull run for Bitcoin in the month of July. The prediction is not without merit as Bitcoin has historically done well during this month. Although there have been years where this did not hold true, the years in which it did far outweigh the latter. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Becomes 14th Largest Cryptocurrency As Bull Rally Heats Up Thielen points to the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, all of which saw the digital asset move up double-digits. Additionally, in the last decade, July has seen the price of BTC recover significantly for a total of seven years compared to only three years where it failed to rally. Given this, the head of research paints a bullish picture for the cryptocurrency that could see it reach as high as $36,000. This figure plays on the fact that over the last three years, BTC’s price in July has risen an average of 20%, so another 20% move for BTC from its current level will see it move above $36,000. Furthermore, expectations going toward the end of the year 2023 also remain very bullish as Thielen also sees a possible move up to $45,000 for the digital asset. “Bitcoin tends to move 10,000 points up, only to retrace 5,000 and then rally another 10,000 points (until we reach $45,000 by year-end,” the head of research said. July is a historically bullish month for BTC &#124; Source: Matrixport He added that: “We have seen a rally from nearly $15,000 to $25,000 only to drop back to $20,000 due to the U.S banking crisis, then rally another 10,000 points to $30,000 and sell off to $25,000 because of the Binance-SEC lawsuit. Now we appear on the way to $35,000 as the expectations for the Bitcoin ETFs approval will bring more U.S. institutions and U.S. retail into this space.” US Investors Continue To Lead BTC Rally US Investors have been participating more in the crypto market, especially when it comes to Bitcoin, as reported by NewsBTC last week, and this increased participation from the region has been fueling the digital asset’s rally so far. BTC shows strength above $30,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The Matrixport report shows that most of the BTC rally has occurred during US trading hours. To put this in perspective, BTC prices have risen 16% during US trading hours, 1% during European trading hours, and have declined by 7% during Asian trading hours.

					<description><![CDATA[“Crypto is Culture” is one of the main themes behind the ETHBarcelona Conference. The community-led event is gearing up for its second edition at one of the most important civic centers in the world, with a promise of highlighting Ethereum and crypto beyond its market value. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Break $2,000 As $12 Million Short Seller Nears Liquidation Education, social impact, art, price, and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology are some subjects that will be present during the three-day event from July 5 to 7. We sat down with the team behind ETHBarcelona to discuss their vision, running an event amidst a bear market, and why conferences still have value. This is what they told us. Q: Conferences are a big part of anything that wants a place in today’s culture, but what’s different about ETHBarcelona; what’s at the event’s core? And maybe you can tell us more about what inspired its creation. ETHBarcelona Team: What sets EthBarcelona apart from most web3 projects is our unique focus on culture, values, public goods, and social impact, rather than solely prioritizing, it’s the only ETH event largely focused on social impact, which is also why we had about 40 percent of female attendees which is quite rare in Web3 events. The reason being the kind of focus this event has thats different from other ETH events. The idea for EthBarcelona and event organization actually originated back at Devcon V in Osaka, back in 2019. During those early days, when the local places would close early, I would receive numerous messages asking for plans and suggestions on where to go. That&#8217;s when I had the idea to create a group, and thus Blockravers was born. It started with coordinating gatherings of around 20-30 people, and soon it gained traction worldwide, leading us to organize parties. The popularity of Blockravers caught the attention of companies who began inviting us to their events, offering us free tickets. We became known as the curators of good vibes! This trend continued during Devcon in Colombia, and at EthDenver, we even rented a party house, which remained open every day for people to come and go. To ensure a sense of accountability and respect for shared spaces, we introduced a vouching system. In order to enter the party house, individuals needed to be vouched for by someone else. This system helped us maintain order in public spaces with limited resources. Those who caused damage, harassed others, or exhibited racist or homophobic behavior were expelled from the group, and the person who vouched for them also received a yellow card. Two yellow cards would result in expulsion as well. The vouching system extended to Zuzalu, where we rented a house and required people to be vouched for before entering. We even developed an application that initially used Venezuelan Bolivares&#8217; serial numbers as unique identifiers for self-issued identities. As we distributed over 153 Venezuelan banknotes, more Zuzalu residents wanted to participate, leading us to allow anyone with a banknote to register and build trust. The serial numbers, along with a photo, became a way of saying, &#8220;This is me,&#8221; helping us establish a network of trust. As we continued experimenting with the system, we implemented a rule that attendees needed at least three vouches to attend the next party. Our work with identity, reputation, and vouching systems started with parties, but the concept extends far beyond that. It can be applied to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), governance, verification, and more. Token distribution within any community can benefit from this approach as well. We could reward actual humans who genuinely engage with us, contribute to the community, and have been part of the Blockravers journey. They are the ones who bring the vibes and make this community vibrant! So, our journey began with parties, but the potential for identity, reputation, and vouching systems reaches far and wide. It aligns perfectly with our focus on building a strong community and making a positive impact. &#160; Q: What are the challenges of running a community-driven event in 2023? And from your perspective, has the bear market impacted people’s interest in the nascent industry? Is it true that people build more during these price drawdowns?  ETHBarcelona Team: Running a community-driven event in 2023 presents several challenges that organizers need to navigate. One of the key challenges is the issue of budget constraints. As mentioned, budget has always been a challenge, but despite that, we managed to pull off a highly successful event last year. Additionally, the bear market has further exacerbated the funding challenge. During a bear market, where cryptocurrency prices are generally in a downward trend, securing financial support becomes more difficult. But, we are grateful to our sponsors who have stepped in to support the event. Their involvement highlights the continued interest and belief in the nascent industry, despite the market conditions. One positive outcome however is the increased interest in the hackathon event. The bear market has not stopped builders from participating and showcasing their skills and innovations. In fact, it is often during price drawdowns that people tend to focus more on building and developing new ideas. This may be due to a combination of factors, such as lower market speculation and the opportunity to explore new avenues of growth and development. From my perspective, the bear market does impact people&#8217;s interest in the nascent industry, but not necessarily in a negative way. While it may discourage some investors and speculators, it tends to attract individuals who are genuinely passionate about building and creating value in Web3. These individuals are driven by their belief in the technology&#8217;s long-term potential rather than short-term market fluctuations. The bear market has not deterred builders, and if anything, it has fostered a stronger focus on development and innovation within the nascent industry. &#160; Q: With most conversations happening online, do you think conferences are still relevant? As crypto is said to be the bridge between the digital and physical spaces, how does ETHBarcelona embody this idea? ETHBarcelona Team: Oh, absolutely! While online conversations have become the norm especially in the Web3 world, conferences like ETHBarcelona are the ultimate proof that physical events still have their charm and relevance. You see, attending a conference like ETHBarcelona is like stepping into a whole different world—it&#8217;s like a festival for Web3 enthusiasts! First of all, picture this: a bustling gathering of brilliant minds, passionate developers, and crypto-curious individuals from all corners of the globe all with the goal of driving impact using this technology. It&#8217;s a vibrant melting pot where ideas collide and friendships are forged. You can&#8217;t replicate that level of energy and personal connection in a virtual setting! We’re taking the best of both worlds and merging them seamlessly. While the event is firmly rooted in physical interactions, it doesn&#8217;t shy away from leveraging technology to enhance the experience. Attendees get to enjoy captivating presentations, engaging workshops, and hands-on activities, all designed to deepen their understanding of Ethereum and blockchain technology. ETHBarcelona is providing attendees with an exquisite NFT (non-fungible token) ticket. It&#8217;s like owning a little piece of digital art that grants you access to this event. Not only does this embrace the digital aspect of crypto, but it also creates a tangible, collectible experience for participants. Q: How will ETHBarcelona address the negative narrative surrounding cryptocurrencies, such as bankruptcies and company collapses? What should be the dominant narrative in the industry beyond these issues? ETHBarcelona Team: I often am asked this question but to be very honest It is important to note that negative narratives are found in all industries, not solely within the web3 world. The current bear run affects not only the web3 industry but has also affected the tech ecosystem, which has been influenced by factors such as AI disruption, market uncertainty caused by ongoing conflicts, and other diverse elements. But sometimes it feels like people outside of the Web3 ecosystem have a tendency to beat this ecosystem more. Regardless of whatever happens outside, our focus is on shifting the narrative towards one of resilience, creativity, and boundless possibilities. We firmly believe in highlighting the accomplishments of entrepreneurs, startups, and visionaries who are pushing the boundaries of what is achievable. Our emphasis extends beyond mere profit generation—it encompasses the social impact that can be derived from crypto on finance, governance, supply chain management, and culture. Last year we took pride in showcasing projects like Ukraine DAO, which exemplifies how cryptocurrencies can serve as a powerful tool for positive change. This year we have amazing speakers from projects like Worldcoin, Giveth, ReFi DAO and many others! By showcasing the remarkable potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, we aim to inspire confidence, foster innovation, and drive positive change in the industry as a whole. &#160; Q: What can attendees expect from ETHBarcelona? How does &#8220;Crypto is Culture&#8221; relate to financial services, cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum? How do you go from finance to web3 to culture? And what’s the component that allows for this transformation? ETHBarcelona Team: Our event is designed to provide valuable insights, networking opportunities, and a deeper understanding of the intersection between culture, financial services, cryptocurrencies, and the Ethereum ecosystem. The theme &#8220;Crypto is Culture&#8221; encapsulates the idea that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have transcended their purely financial aspects and become intertwined with various aspects of our culture. This includes art, music, literature, social movements, and more. At ETHBarcelona, we explore the cultural impact and potential of the crypto industry, shedding light on its transformative power and the diverse perspectives it brings to the table. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stuck In Range As Risk of Downside Correction Escalates Moreover, ETHBarcelona sheds light on the role of Ethereum and web3 technologies in enabling the creator economy. By leveraging blockchain, artists, content creators, and cultural innovators can tokenize their work, establish ownership rights, and directly monetize their creations. This empowers creators with new revenue streams, facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, and promotes the growth of a vibrant cultural ecosystem.

<p>So, our journey began with parties, but the potential for identity, reputation, and vouching systems reaches far and wide. It aligns perfectly with our focus on building a strong community and making a positive impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the challenges of running a community-driven event in 2023? And from your perspective, has the bear market impacted people’s interest in the nascent industry? Is it true that people build more during these price drawdowns?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>ETHBarcelona Team: </strong>Running a community-driven event in 2023 presents several challenges that organizers need to navigate.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges is the issue of budget constraints. As mentioned, budget has always been a challenge, but despite that, we managed to pull off a highly successful event last year. Additionally, the bear market has further exacerbated the funding challenge. During a bear market, where cryptocurrency prices are generally in a downward trend, securing financial support becomes more difficult. But, we are grateful to our sponsors who have stepped in to support the event. Their involvement highlights the continued interest and belief in the nascent industry, despite the market conditions.</p>
<p>One positive outcome however is the increased interest in the hackathon event. The bear market has not stopped builders from participating and showcasing their skills and innovations. In fact, it is often during price drawdowns that people tend to focus more on building and developing new ideas. This may be due to a combination of factors, such as lower market speculation and the opportunity to explore new avenues of growth and development.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the bear market does impact people&#8217;s interest in the nascent industry, but not necessarily in a negative way. While it may discourage some investors and speculators, it tends to attract individuals who are genuinely passionate about building and creating value in</p>
<p>Web3. These individuals are driven by their belief in the technology&#8217;s long-term potential rather than short-term market fluctuations. The bear market has not deterred builders, and if anything, it has fostered a stronger focus on development and innovation within the nascent industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: With most conversations happening online, do you think conferences are still relevant? As crypto is said to be the bridge between the digital and physical spaces, how does ETHBarcelona embody this idea?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ETHBarcelona Team: </strong>Oh, absolutely! While online conversations have become the norm especially in the Web3 world, conferences like ETHBarcelona are the ultimate proof that physical events still have their charm and relevance. You see, attending a conference like ETHBarcelona is like stepping into a whole different world—it&#8217;s like a festival for Web3 enthusiasts!</p>
<p>First of all, picture this: a bustling gathering of brilliant minds, passionate developers, and crypto-curious individuals from all corners of the globe all with the goal of driving impact using this technology. It&#8217;s a vibrant melting pot where ideas collide and friendships are forged. You can&#8217;t replicate that level of energy and personal connection in a virtual setting!</p>
<p>We’re taking the best of both worlds and merging them seamlessly. While the event is firmly rooted in physical interactions, it doesn&#8217;t shy away from leveraging technology to enhance the experience. Attendees get to enjoy captivating presentations, engaging workshops, and hands-on activities, all designed to deepen their understanding of Ethereum and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>ETHBarcelona is providing attendees with an exquisite NFT (non-fungible token) ticket. It&#8217;s like owning a little piece of digital art that grants you access to this event. Not only does this embrace the digital aspect of crypto, but it also creates a tangible, collectible experience for participants.</p>
<p>Q: How will ETHBarcelona address the negative narrative surrounding cryptocurrencies, such as bankruptcies and company collapses? What should be the dominant narrative in the industry beyond these issues?</p>
<p><strong>ETHBarcelona Team: </strong>I often am asked this question but to be very honest It is important to note that negative narratives are found in all industries, not solely within the web3 world. The current bear run affects not only the web3 industry but has also affected the tech ecosystem, which has been influenced by factors such as AI disruption, market uncertainty caused by ongoing conflicts, and other diverse elements. But sometimes it feels like people outside of the Web3 ecosystem have a tendency to beat this ecosystem more.</p>
<p>Regardless of whatever happens outside, our focus is on shifting the narrative towards one of resilience, creativity, and boundless possibilities. We firmly believe in highlighting the accomplishments of entrepreneurs, startups, and visionaries who are pushing the boundaries of what is achievable.</p>
<p>Our emphasis extends beyond mere profit generation—it encompasses the social impact that can be derived from crypto on finance, governance, supply chain management, and culture. Last year we took pride in showcasing projects like Ukraine DAO, which exemplifies how cryptocurrencies can serve as a powerful tool for positive change. This year we have amazing speakers from projects like Worldcoin, Giveth, ReFi DAO and many others!</p>
<p>By showcasing the remarkable potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, we aim to inspire confidence, foster innovation, and drive positive change in the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What can attendees expect from ETHBarcelona? How does &#8220;Crypto is Culture&#8221; relate to financial services, cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum? How do you go from finance to web3 to culture? And what’s the component that allows for this transformation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ETHBarcelona Team: </strong>Our event is designed to provide valuable insights, networking opportunities, and a deeper understanding of the intersection between culture, financial services, cryptocurrencies, and the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>The theme &#8220;Crypto is Culture&#8221; encapsulates the idea that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have transcended their purely financial aspects and become intertwined with various aspects of our culture. This includes art, music, literature, social movements, and more. At ETHBarcelona, we explore the cultural impact and potential of the crypto industry, shedding light on its transformative power and the diverse perspectives it brings to the table.</p>

<p>Moreover, ETHBarcelona sheds light on the role of Ethereum and web3 technologies in enabling the creator economy. By leveraging blockchain, artists, content creators, and cultural innovators can tokenize their work, establish ownership rights, and directly monetize their creations. This empowers creators with new revenue streams, facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, and promotes the growth of a vibrant cultural ecosystem.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chainlink (LINK) has experienced a surge in bullish sentiment as it rebounded from the $5 support level. In the past week, LINK has surpassed several support levels, resulting in a gain of over  20%. Although there haven&#8217;t been significant changes on the daily chart, the technical outlook for the altcoin has turned notably bullish. Both demand and accumulation have shown significant improvement, while the overall strength of the broader market has also contributed to LINK&#8217;s upward movement. The positive momentum in major altcoins, driven by Bitcoin surpassing the $30,000 mark, has further added to the optimism. Sustaining this price momentum will largely depend on BTC&#8217;s continued upward push. Related Reading: Binance Rescinds Decision To Remove Privacy Coins From European Market While a price pullback cannot be ruled out for LINK, the increased buying power should help prevent a loss of momentum. If LINK manages to maintain its nearest support level, the ongoing price rally is expected to continue as the increase in LINK&#8217;s market capitalization suggests the anticipation of further bullish gains. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart After surpassing the significant psychological level of $6, the price of LINK was $6.20. The $6 mark has demonstrated its importance as a support level and dropping below it would potentially lead to a decline toward $5. On the other hand, if LINK manages to break the overhead resistance at $6.46, it could potentially rally to $6.70, representing a gain of over 11% in the upcoming trading sessions. In the event of a decrease from the current price, support levels to watch out for are $5.60 and $5. The trading volume of LINK in the last session has shown an increase, indicating an influx of buyers into the market. Technical Analysis Recent trading sessions have witnessed notable improvement in buying strength for LINK. Despite a slight dip in price, the buying strength has remained stable on the chart. This is indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) surpassing the 60-mark, signaling growing demand. This suggests the potential for increased gains in the price action. Additionally, buyers have driven the price momentum in the market, causing it to surge above the 20-Simple Moving Average line. The daily chart for LINK has shown buy signals in line with the increasing demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has displayed tall and growing green histograms, which are typically associated with buy signals. This suggests a positive momentum for the altcoin.

While capital inflows still outweigh outflows, the rate of inflows has been declining at press time. Featured image from DataDrivenInvestor, charts from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AAVE, one of the most prominent DeFi tokens, is currently experiencing a market pump, gaining  28.33% in the last 7 days, according to CoinMarketCap data. Over the past week, most of the crypto market has seen a boost in prices following the Bitcoin-fueled recovery, which also saw the premier cryptocurrency trade above $31,000 for the first time since June 2022. AAVE Price Overview  AAVE began last week trading around $50.99 before experiencing some steady gains during the week, causing the DeFi token to close its weekly market at a price of $56.86. Related Reading: Pepe Surge: Trading Volume Outshines SHIB And DOGE – Will This Trend Continue? That said, the AAVE coin experienced a massive spike in price yesterday, June 25, propelling the token by 32% to trade as high as $75.06 for the first time since last month.  Although the token has since declined from this price level, AAVE appears to have found some stability and could be preparing for another breakout. At the time of writing, AAVE is exchanging hands at $65.4, with a 0.67% rise in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume stands at $406 million, having gone up by 1.85% in the last 24 hours.  In addition, AAVE boasts a total market cap of roughly $942 million, allowing it to rank as the 44th biggest cryptocurrency in the market.  AAVE Trading At $65.88 &#124; Source: AAVEUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Behind’s AAVE Rise Following AAVE’s recent price boost, there has been much speculation on the propelling force behind this bullish movement.  According to on-chain analytics firm, Lookonchain, AAVE’s gain in market price appears to be due to massive whale activity by an investor with wallet address “0x5a80” in the last day. Related Reading: Lightning Network Hits Record Highs In Bitcoin And US Dollar Capacity Via a post on their official Twitter handle, Lookonchain reported that Whale “0x5a80” began acquiring massive amounts of the DeFi token in the early hours of yesterday. The individual purchased 182,152 AAVE &#8211; worth $13.2 million at the time &#8211; within a span of 5 hours.  Looking at data from CoinMarketCap, Lookonchain concluded that this massive whale activity coincided with the period in which AAVE&#8217;s surge in market value began yesterday.  As of this morning, the blockchain data platform also reported that the whale “0x5a80”  had acquired a total of 257,147 AAVE tokens &#8211; valued then at $17.2 million &#8211; in the last 24 hours. Before halting their buying spree, whale “0x5a80” is believed to hold an estimate of 474,579 AAVE tokens &#8211; valued at $31.8 million. However, since whale “0x5a80” stopped accumulating AAVE, the token’s market price has been on a nosedive, losing nearly 13% of its value in the last 8 hours.  That said, several AAVE investors are likely to be on the watch for the actions of the whale “0x5a80” over the next few days, as it may be pivotal to the token’s future price movements.

					<description><![CDATA[Kaspa (KAS) has been making waves in the altcoin market lately, with its impressive surge of over 60% in the past 14 days, according to CoinGecko data.  The cryptocurrency is based on the GHOSTDAG protocol, which is a generalization of the Bitcoin Consensus. This protocol offers several advantages over traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms, including higher throughput and faster confirmation times. Kaspa Emerges As Top Performer Recently, the Kaspa team announced a significant new feature that is set to go live on the KAS testnet.  The 10BPS feature promises to deliver &#8220;unmatched&#8221; transaction speeds of up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). This is a massive improvement over the current transaction speeds of other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which typically offer only a fraction of this throughput.

Witness this milestone live: https://t.co/ZjXVeSwUKY#POW #RustyKas #rustlang pic.twitter.com/hjxXXhc5fo — Kaspa (@KaspaCurrency) June 26, 2023 This considerable jump in transaction speed could be a game-changer for the Kaspa protocol, as it looks to gain more market share from established Layer 1 protocols such as Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana. In addition to the 10BPS feature, the Kaspa blockchain offers several other impressive features that make it a compelling choice for developers and users alike. One of the key features of the Kaspa blockchain is its scalability. The protocol is designed to support a high throughput of transactions, which makes it well-suited for use cases that require fast and efficient processing.  This scalability is achieved through the use of the GHOSTDAG consensus mechanism, which allows for a high degree of parallelism and concurrency in the processing of transactions. Another key feature of the Kaspa blockchain is its security. The protocol is designed to be highly resistant to attacks, with a robust set of cryptographic algorithms and other security measures built in. This ensures that the network remains secure and reliable, even in the face of potential threats. Will KAS Bullish Momentum Continue? The cryptocurrency market has been on an upward trend lately, with many cryptocurrencies posting impressive gains over the past week.  Among these is KAS, which has seen a price increase of 28.90% in the last 7 days, outperforming both the global cryptocurrency market (up 9.80%) and similar Layer 1 (L1) cryptocurrencies (up 12.90%). As of today, KAS is trading at $0.02558, with a 24-hour trade volume of $9 million. While the price has declined slightly by 0.83% in the last 24 hours, the overall trend is positive, with the cryptocurrency market showing signs of recovery after a period of consolidation.

However, if the token manages to overcome this resistance level and attract more players to its ecosystem, its bullish momentum may continue and new all-time highs could be within reach. Conversely, in the event of a further price drop, the $0.02449 level may serve as a support floor for KAS. This means that if the price falls to this level, it may find some buying support from investors looking to enter the market at a lower price. According to Coingecko, KAS has a total supply of 19 billion tokens, with a market capitalization of $495,310,928.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kaspa (KAS) has been making waves in the altcoin market lately, with its impressive surge of over 60% in the past 14 days, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/es/monedas/kaspa" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data</a>. </p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is based on the GHOSTDAG protocol, which is a generalization of the Bitcoin Consensus. This protocol offers several advantages over traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms, including higher throughput and faster confirmation times.</p>
<h2>Kaspa Emerges As Top Performer</h2>
<p>Recently, the Kaspa team <a href="https://twitter.com/KaspaCurrency/status/1673122188063285250?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced </a>a significant new feature that is set to go live on the KAS testnet.  The 10BPS feature promises to deliver &#8220;unmatched&#8221; transaction speeds of up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). </p>
<p>This is a massive improvement over the current transaction speeds of other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which typically offer only a fraction of this throughput.</p>

<p>According to the announcement, the 10BPS feature is currently being stress-tested on the KAS testnet, where it is setting new records for crypto BPS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano&#8217;s (ADA) price has scored over 10% on the weekly chart as the broader market sees a correction. Most coins registered unexpected price surges amid the resurgent crypto market last week. However, ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, stood out among the digital tokens with a notable price surge over five consecutive days of the rally.  With a 20% increase on last week&#8217;s Monday trading session, ADA&#8217;s price spiked above $0.30. Although the ongoing market correction has stalled the token’s price rally, it still retains a 10.57% price increase.  ADA’s Recent Price Performance The increased number of ADA transactions captured over the last month by Cardano Blockchain data hasn&#8217;t significantly affected the token&#8217;s price. Hence, ADA&#8217;s price elevation over the past few days seems more connected to external factors than development events on the Cardano network. Related Reading: Lightning Network Hits Record Highs In Bitcoin And US Dollar Capacity Fortunately, the recent market movements driven by the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin coincided with ADA&#8217;s price trajectory. Most of the buzz generated in the market came from the news of BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF application, followed by WisdomTree, Invesco, and Volatility Shares’ ETF filings. Interestingly, observers perceive Cardano (ADA)’s price recent rally as part of the broader market dynamics triggered by the rising institutional attention on Bitcoin and crypto. As of Sunday, June 25, ADA traded at $0.29, a 2.67% price gain from its previous day’s valuation. ADA Price Outlook After the notable price increase in the past few days, the bulls have taken a break as the bullish momentum stalls. As of the time of writing, Cardano&#8217;s (ADA) price has tumbled 2.74% from its past-day price and now trades at $0.288.  ADA has reclaimed $0.288 as its primary support level after the bulls failed to push the price higher. The pullback may be considered a typical occurrence given the rapid price surge in the last week. The token’s trading volume slumped slightly over the weekend, with a 24-hour decline of 25.45%. ADA&#8217;s market capitalization has declined by 2.80% and is at $10 billion at press time. Also, ADA/USD Price Chart on TradingView shows the coin is trading below the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, signifying a bearish trend in the short and long term. As of the time of analysis, the bulls are losing control, and the bears could take back control of the market once the price relapses deeper.  A Spot ETF Approval Could Affect ADA Price It is worth keeping a close watch on how external market events could influence ADA&#8217;s price and investor optimism. Moreover, market participants should watch how the expected changes in the crypto space following the BTC ETF approval would impact crypto asset prices, including ADA&#8217;s. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Plunges The SEC approving the series of ETF applications would boost Bitcoin&#8217;s legitimacy. Also, it would attract more institutional investors who want leveraged exposure to Bitcoin through various investment products that would eventually be available. This improved investor sentiment could rub off on ADA and other cryptocurrencies, propelling their prices upward.
