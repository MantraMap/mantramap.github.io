Only time will tell if Cardano ADA can surpass the $0.41 resistance level and trade above it in the coming days.  ADA Price Trend The recent price fluctuation in the crypto market harmed Cardano (ADA)’s price, causing a significant loss in its market capitalization.

Cardano&#8217;s price may surpass its resistance level of $0.42 if the bulls completely control the market. On the other hand, if bears take control of the trend, ADA&#8217;s price could fall below $0.30 and might hit $0.2777 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction The Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicates a potential trend reversal as the 50-day SMA changes directions. The 50-day SMA is trying to cross below the 200, forming a death cross. This action may generate a bearish signal and indicate a potential selling opportunity. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the neutral level and is heading toward the overbought zone, which might ignite a potential price correction.  The MACD line is above the signal line, indicating a potential buy opportunity. The histogram is slightly above the zero line and is also increasing in size; this means bullish momentum. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com
