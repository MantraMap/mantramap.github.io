					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin whales are witnessing a historic exodus. @CryptoVizArt, a senior researcher at Glassnode has shed light on the significant shifts within the whale cohort in a new analysis. Bitcoin Whales&#8217; Impact: Unveiling The Numbers In a remarkable revelation, the research highlights the substantial impact of whales on recent market activity. According to the data, &#8220;34% of sell pressure in the last 30 day was from Binance whales.&#8221; These influential entities have been instrumental in shaping the recent market dynamics. Moreover, the research also highlights a trend in whale behavior: a noteworthy decline in the total balance of whale entities on exchanges. In the last 30 days, the report states, &#8220;Whale Flow to Exchanges witnessed the largest monthly balance decline in history, hitting -148,000 BTC/month.&#8221; This dramatic decline marks a significant shift within the whale cohort, raising intriguing questions about their motives and strategies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Next Bearish Target But Bears Are Not Done Yet As the market witnessed the rally above $31,000, the influx of whale funds to exchanges surged remarkably. Glassnode’s data reveals that whale inflow volumes reached an impressive +16,300 BTC/day, signifying their active involvement in recent market movements. Notably, this whale dominance accounted for 41% of all exchange inflows, which is comparable to both the LUNA crash (39%) and the failure of FTX (33%). Throughout June and July, whale inflows have sustained an elevated inflow bias of between 4,000 to 6,500 BTC/day. Among all exchanges, Binance emerged as the primary destination for whale inflows. The report discloses that around 82% of whale-to-exchange flows were heading into Binance. In contrast, Coinbase accounted for 6.8%, and all other exchanges account for 11.2%. While the overall balance of whales may have declined, @CryptoVizArt&#8217;s analysis points to intriguing internal dynamics within the whale cohort. As some whales increased their balances, others experienced declines. This phenomenon led the researcher to introduce the concept of &#8216;Whale Reshuffling,&#8217; suggesting that not all whales follow the same strategy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exodus: Exchange Balances Plummet To Lowest Levels Since 2018 The examination of the whale cohort over the last 30 days shows that whales with more than 100,000 BTC have recorded an increase of +6,000 BTC, whales with 10k-100k BTC have decreased their account balance by -49.0k BTC and whales with 1k-10k BTC have increased their account balance by +33.8k BTC. However, in aggregate, the whale group has seen just -8.7k BTC in net outflows. Remarkably, whale entities now account for only 46% of the total supply, down from 63% at the beginning of 2021. Since the early days of Bitcoin, a steady downward trend can be observed. Short-Term Holders: The Driving Force The research also sheds light on the dominance of short-term holders (STHs) among the whale entities. The data indicates that STHs represent a significant portion of recent trading activity, actively trading the market. This behavior is evident as market rallies and corrections lead to notable upticks in profit or loss among this group. Short-Term Holder (STH) Dominance across Exchange Inflows has exploded to 82%. This is drastically above the long-term range over the last five years (typically 55% to 65%). “From this, we can establish a case that much of the recent trading activity is driven by Whales active within the 2023 market and thus classified as STHs”, states the analyst. Each rally in 2023 has seen heightened profit taking. BTC whale transactions can therefore currently be a good indicator. However, special attention also needs to be paid to the STHs, which will eventually run out of bullets at some point. At press time, the BTC price stood at $29,203.

					<description><![CDATA[As XDC, the digital token for XinFin Network, exhibits a powerful display of bullish momentum, the cryptocurrency market is humming enthusiastically. XDC has increased by an incredible 74% in just one week, impressing traders and investors with its massive rise. The altcoin&#8217;s ascent over the past 30 days has been remarkable; it has seen a substantial 56% increase, solidifying its place as one of the market&#8217;s most exciting digital assets. The altcoin has demonstrated its strength by trading at a startling 100% premium over its January opening. XDC&#8217;s price at the time of writing was $0.058, up 16.6% in the last 24 hours. At cryptocurrency market tracker Coingecko, the token continues to lead the list of the top 100 coins for the week. XDC Dominates Weekly Rankings Source: Coingecko XDC Network is a blockchain platform for businesses and developers who want to build decentralized apps (dApps) on an efficient and scalable blockchain infrastructure. The platform is built on an enhanced Ethereum codebase and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In order to attain the target price of $1, analysts predict that the value of the XDC token will increase by a factor of about 24. This suggests a big potential for growth and offers a chance for investors looking for significant returns. XDC market cap currently at $812 million. Chart: TradingView.com XDC has previously shown significant price appreciation. From its lowest price of $0.050 in June 2021, the token&#8217;s value increased by slightly more than three times in just two months. In August 2021, XDC reached its highest recorded price of $0.18 thanks to this outstanding performance. Such a sharp price increase demonstrates the token&#8217;s intrinsic volatility and ability to provide substantial returns in a short amount of time. A total of 37,705,012,600 XDC coins are available, with a circulating supply of 13,851,401,350 and a market cap of $812 million for XDC.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, as exchange balances have dropped to levels last seen in early 2018. This signals a growing trend of investors moving their Bitcoin holdings to cold storage, which is considered to be more secure.  According to a recent report by Bitfinex, while some of this decline in exchange balances may be attributed to the usage of decentralized exchanges and funds not covered in the data, the overarching trend appears to be a widespread movement of people withdrawing their Bitcoin from exchanges. Bitcoin-Backed Funds Lead Crypto Investment Surge  This trend is also reflected in the recent data from CoinShares, which shows that traditional fund investors are demonstrating a renewed interest in Bitcoin.  Crypto-backed investment funds saw a net inflow of $137 million last week, with a staggering 99 percent of this sum directed toward Bitcoin-backed funds.  Related Reading: Elon Musk Incorporates Dogecoin Symbol In Twitter Bio, Triggering 5% Increase In Price According to Bitfinex, this marks the fourth consecutive week of gross inflows into crypto funds, amassing a total of $742 million over the period, representing the largest run of inflows since the final quarter of 2021. The sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds indicate strong investor confidence in the asset, despite the volatility inherent in the crypto market. Additionally, the outflows from short-Bitcoin funds reinforce the bullish sentiment for the BTC price among investors, which has now been in a tight range for months.  This data can thus be used as a proxy for institutional investor bias that the price will break out of this range toward the upside. Meanwhile, Ethereum funds were the only other category to see outflows last week, losing $1.6 million on a net basis. Altcoin funds, on the other hand, recorded slight inflows, with the largest going to multi-asset funds, followed by funds backed by Solana&#8217;s SOL token and Polygon&#8217;s MATIC.  Overall, this data paints a clear picture of Bitcoin&#8217;s continued dominance in the crypto market. While altcoins are making their presence felt, Bitcoin remains the preferred asset for traditional fund investors.  The sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds suggest that investors have confidence in the asset&#8217;s long-term growth potential, despite the short-term volatility in the crypto market.  BTC Whales Increased Activity Indicates Bullish Market Sentiment According to a report by Glassnode, whales, or entities holding 1,000 or more BTC, have been making significant moves in the cryptocurrency market, with whale inflows to exchanges being historically large and accounting for 41% of the total. The dominance of whale inflow volumes to exchanges is significant, with over 82% of whale inflows destined for Binance, the largest exchange in the industry. This trend highlights the importance of the role played by whales in the cryptocurrency market, as their activity can have a significant impact on the price and overall sentiment of Bitcoin. While the report notes that many of these active whale entities are classified as short-term holders, with notable activity around local market peaks and troughs, it also highlights the long-term behavior of whales.  Related Reading: Russian Introduces A Third Form Of Currency As Putin Signs Digital Ruble Into Law Glassnode&#8217;s Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort shows that the smallest entities with less than 100 BTC have slowed down their spending over the last month.  On the other hand, the whale subdivisions with more than 1,000 BTC demonstrated divergent behavior, with those holding more than 10,000 BTC distributing and those holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC accumulating at a significantly higher rate. This behavior suggests that whales are actively reshuffling their holdings, moving funds internally between entities. While this can have short-term implications for the market, it also highlights the long-term potential for Bitcoin to remain a valuable asset for investors.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, as exchange balances have dropped to levels last seen in early 2018. This signals a growing trend of investors moving their Bitcoin holdings to cold storage, which is considered to be more secure. </p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitfinex-Alpha-64.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a> by Bitfinex, while some of this decline in exchange balances may be attributed to the usage of decentralized exchanges and funds not covered in the data, the overarching trend appears to be a widespread movement of people withdrawing their Bitcoin from exchanges.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin-Backed Funds Lead Crypto Investment Surge </h2>
<p>This trend is also reflected in the recent data from CoinShares, which shows that traditional fund investors are demonstrating a renewed interest in Bitcoin. </p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-544182" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_28.jpg" alt="Bitcoin " width="741" height="437" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_28.jpg 741w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_28-460x271.jpg 460w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px"/>
<p>Crypto-backed investment funds saw a net inflow of $137 million last week, with a staggering 99 percent of this sum directed toward Bitcoin-backed funds. </p>

<p>According to Bitfinex, this marks the fourth consecutive week of gross inflows into crypto funds, amassing a total of $742 million over the period, representing the largest run of inflows since the final quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds indicate strong investor confidence in the asset, despite the volatility inherent in the crypto market. Additionally, the outflows from short-Bitcoin funds reinforce the bullish sentiment for the BTC price among investors, which has now been in a tight range for months. </p>
<p>This data can thus be used as a proxy for institutional investor bias that the price will break out of this range toward the upside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ethereum funds were the only other category to see outflows last week, losing $1.6 million on a net basis. Altcoin funds, on the other hand, recorded slight inflows, with the largest going to multi-asset funds, followed by funds backed by Solana&#8217;s SOL token and Polygon&#8217;s MATIC. </p>
<p>Overall, this data paints a clear picture of Bitcoin&#8217;s continued dominance in the crypto market. While altcoins are making their presence felt, Bitcoin remains the preferred asset for traditional fund investors. </p>
<p>The sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds suggest that investors have confidence in the asset&#8217;s long-term growth potential, despite the short-term volatility in the crypto market. </p>
BTC Whales Increased Activity Indicates Bullish Market Sentiment
<p>According to a <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-30-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a> by Glassnode, whales, or entities holding 1,000 or more BTC, have been making significant moves in the cryptocurrency market, with whale inflows to exchanges being historically large and accounting for 41% of the total.</p>
<p>The dominance of whale inflow volumes to exchanges is significant, with over 82% of whale inflows destined for Binance, the largest exchange in the industry. This trend highlights the importance of the role played by whales in the cryptocurrency market, as their activity can have a significant impact on the price and overall sentiment of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>While the report notes that many of these active whale entities are classified as short-term holders, with notable activity around local market peaks and troughs, it also highlights the long-term behavior of whales. </p>

<p>Glassnode&#8217;s Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort shows that the smallest entities with less than 100 BTC have slowed down their spending over the last month. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the whale subdivisions with more than 1,000 BTC demonstrated divergent behavior, with those holding more than 10,000 BTC distributing and those holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC accumulating at a significantly higher rate.</p>
<p>This behavior suggests that whales are actively reshuffling their holdings, moving funds internally between entities. While this can have short-term implications for the market, it also highlights the long-term potential for Bitcoin to remain a valuable asset for investors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fidelity, a leading financial services provider, has recently released a report on Ethereum (ETH) that sheds light on some key metrics to watch for the cryptocurrency in the coming months.  The report highlights several important indicators, including the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MA), the realized price, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio, Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, percent in profit, and the Pi Cycle indicators, all of which can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Ethereum Holds Strong Above Key Support Levels Per the report, Ethereum has remained above key support levels, with the realized price serving as a strong support level since January 10th.  Additionally, the NUPL ratio suggests that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone, while the MVRV Z-Score indicates that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market value is estimated to be just over the &#8220;fair&#8221; zone, potentially setting the stage for a bull run or at least sideways price action, according to Fidelity.  Another interesting metric highlighted in the report is the percent of unique addresses in profit, which currently sits at nearly 66%. While this metric has not touched the green zone since January 2020, it suggests that Ethereum owners may be using the cryptocurrency for trading, DeFi, staking, or buying other digital assets. Related Reading: Bittrex To US Users: Withdraw Your Crypto Or Risk Running Into Issues Furthermore, the Pi Cycle indicators, which have historically been a good cycle top indicator, are showing that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone. As the long-term moving average continues to follow the sunken price downward, it may be setting the stage for more volatility shortly. However, whether this volatility will be to the upside or downside remains to be seen and could depend on a variety of macro factors. ETH Adoption On The Rise On the other hand, Fidelity’s report highlights that while monthly active addresses and the monthly transaction count have fallen by 1%, the number of monthly new Ethereum addresses has slowly increased by 9% in Q2 2023. New addresses are defined as unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction. This metric for momentum may not show direct network usage, but it does indicate a clearer picture of Ethereum adoption. The short-term moving average of new addresses is shown to be rising back above that of the longer-term moving average, indicating that the rate of new users joining the network is increasing. New and existing projects are likely incentivizing new users and helping to drive this increase. Another significant metric highlighted in the report is the net issuance of new supply issued by the network minus burned supply from transactions since The Merge.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge To $29,200 Sends 5.9% Of Supply Into Loss This has driven a supply decrease for over five months now, with net issuance surpassing -700,000 Ether. The report notes that this is important because, in theory, as Ethereum&#8217;s supply is destroyed, it raises the relative ownership level of all remaining token holders. As of writing, ETH’s price is at $1,849, which has decreased by 2% within the last 24 hours. Similar to Bitcoin&#8217;s situation, Ethereum has also lost its 50-day MA, which is currently positioned at $1,869. If the market continues to decline, ETH can anticipate several key support levels that may help prevent a further bearish trend. The closest support level is situated at $1,840, followed by another support level of $1,792. However, the most crucial support floor is the 200-day MA, which is located at $1,780. This will be a significant factor in determining who will dominate in the upcoming months. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On July 24, 2023, Coinglass data revealed that over $41 million worth of Bitcoin long and short leveraged positions were liquidated as the BTC prices unexpectedly crashed below a consolidation level of around $29,500, shrinking by over 4%. The drop below the primary support is heaping pressure on the coin. It may draw more selling pressure in upcoming sessions, pushing prices toward immediate reaction lines, the next being at about $28,300.  Bitcoin Drops, Over $41 Million Of Longs Liquidated In crypto trading, liquidation happens the facilitating exchange, for example, OKX or Binance, forcibly takes over the collateral securing the leverage position whenever prices move against the trader&#8217;s prognosis. In this case, the recent liquidation was triggered by the rapid sell-off in Bitcoin, leading to a more than 4% price decline within a few hours during the New York Session on July 24. Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange and a platform facilitating trading crypto derivatives, liquidated most levered positions. Significant liquidation amounts were also observed in ByBit and OKX. Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits A big chunk of liquidated positions were &#8220;longs,&#8221; meaning traders expected prices to rise in the days ahead. Coinglass said over $41 million of cumulative long positions were closed. Meanwhile, only $2.5 million of short positions were closed despite Bitcoin plunging, moving along the traders&#8217; price prediction. Despite Bitcoin remaining in a bullish formation, prices have been moving inside a consolidation, failing to breach the $31,800 level recorded in mid-July 2023. Coinciding with this expansion, a United States judge had ruled to favor Ripple Labs, saying XRP was not a security, in their case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following this declaration, the broader crypto market edged higher, only to cool off days later. Bitcoin has been no exception, as current price action reveals. Will ETF Applications Support Prices? Still, the collapse comes a few days after the SEC accepted applications from major financial institutions, including BlackRock, a prominent Wall Street giant, to launch Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). News of BlackRock applying for a Bitcoin ETF previously triggered a bull run, pumping prices to 2023 highs.  Bitcoin remains bullish as prices remain within the leg-up established from June 15 to July 13. Even though fundamental factors could support prices, BTC may edge lower should bulls fail to prop up prices and push them within the consolidation of the better half of July 2023.  Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH Technically, a close above $31,800 and July 13 highs may drive the coin towards the $36,000 zone and later $43,000 in a buy trend continuation formation.

					<description><![CDATA[Altcoin sentiment is at extreme lows, but that’s not the only thing reaching extremes. Bitcoin dominance, a measure of the top cryptocurrency by market cap’s weight compared to the rest of the space, also reached the most extreme reading ever on a technical indicator known for its precise timing and ability to pin-point reversals. If accurate, it’s only a matter of time until altcoins once again outperform BTC. Why The 50% Level In Bitcoin Dominance Is Critical In recent weeks, BTC dominance reached above 50% — an important psychological level in the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins. While the metric has been much higher — and lower — in the past, the idea that one coin is the size of all others combined is a massive accomplishment. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead But after reaching only 2% above the 50% zone, Bitcoin dominance has struggled to push any higher and found resistance. The first signs of a possible reversal began as XRP was deemed not a security by a US judge. Since then, the relationship between Bitcoin and alts has since switch course. The change in course coincides with the Fisher Transform flipping downward from the most extreme reading in the history of 2W BTC.D charts. The Fisher is turning down from +4 std. deviation &#124; BTC.D on TradingView.com The Fisher Transform Forecasts A Potential Altcoin Season The Fisher Transform, created by John Elhers, converts price action into a Gaussian normal distribution in order to better highlight precise turning points in markets. The tool’s readings are based on a standard deviation, where readings on the most extreme side of the bell curve are rare, and thus have a higher probability of reversal once the signal turns down. Such moves to extremes require enormous strength behind the underlying trend. But even the most powerful trends must eventually come to an end. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin &#38; Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery Reversing down from the highest point in 2W BTC.D history could suggest the trend favoring Bitcoin has ended, and the altcoins will perform better for the foreseeable future. Whether or not that leads to a sustainable altcoin season remains to be seen. This chart originally appeared in issue #13 of CoinChartist (VIP). Subscribe for free.

<p>The Fisher Transform, created by John Elhers, converts price action into a Gaussian normal distribution in order to better highlight precise turning points in markets.</p>
<p>The tool’s readings are based on a standard deviation, where readings on the most extreme side of the bell curve are rare, and thus have a higher probability of reversal once the signal turns down. Such moves to extremes require enormous strength behind the underlying trend. But even the most powerful trends must eventually come to an end.</p>

<p>Reversing down from the highest point in 2W BTC.D history could suggest the trend favoring Bitcoin has ended, and the altcoins will perform better for the foreseeable future. Whether or not that leads to a sustainable altcoin season remains to be seen.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC), the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a sharp decline recently, mirroring the broader decline in the cryptocurrency market.  This has led to concerns among Bitcoin bulls, who closely monitor the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price movements to determine whether the decline will continue or stabilize the market. Downside Volatility Threatens BTC’s Support According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin is hovering below a critical support level of $29,250. This is a crucial threshold for Bitcoin bulls, as a sustained breach of this level could trigger a macro trend shift and lead to a retest of lower support lines. Rekt Capital notes that Bitcoin has over a week to continue holding this support level, with the July Monthly Candle Close as an essential milestone. However, the analyst also warns that there is plenty of time for the market to shake out investors with downside volatility below this level potentially. BTC currently trades at $29,000, with the $29,250 50-day Moving Average (MA) being momentarily lost. This aligns with Bitcoin&#8217;s squeeze momentum indicator, which points to a downtrend cycle. Historically, such cycles have resulted in a consolidation period of 15 to 30 days after a sharp decline like the one BTC experienced recently.

Bulls need to hold the 200-day MA, as losing it could compromise the current bullish trend.  Bitcoin On The Edge On the other hand, the broader cryptocurrency market is under pressure ahead of Wednesday&#8217;s upcoming interest rate decision. However, according to the crypto trader known as The Wolf Of Few Streets, Bitcoin&#8217;s support levels at 28,800 and 28,300 should prevent a significant fall.  The trader believes that the Bitcoin market has already priced in the expected increase. Ideally, the market should bounce off one of these levels and test $32,000 again after the interest rate data is released on Wednesday.

The trader sees no immediate negatives for BTC and believes that a minor liquidation of long positions has been long overdue, making the timing for a decline perfect. However, The Wolf Of Few Streets does not expect this decline to last long. Overall, The Wolf Of Few Streets remains bullish on Bitcoin and believes the current market pressure is temporary. The trader&#8217;s analysis suggests that the support levels will hold, and positive news regarding ETF decisions could provide further support.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>
