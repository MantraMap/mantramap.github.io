Watkins also claims that the flexibility of such a decentralized network means users can &#8220;rapidly scale and adjust the network to better reflect demand.&#8221; This, in turn, can result in more reliable connections for users. </strong></p>
<h2>A Decentralized Mobile Network Offers Users a &#8216;Greater Level of Security&#8217;</h2>
<p>Watkins also told Bitcoin.com News that his company&#8217;s attempt to bring the internet to the masses via innovative technologies is comparable to past efforts by tech giants like Google and Facebook. The World Mobile founder, however, insisted that his company is not competing with tech giants. Instead, World Mobile — a telecommunication network built on a blockchain — sees tech giants as collaborators, he said.</p>
<p>In written comments sent to Bitcoin.com News, Watkins explained how the company&#8217;s infrastructure model and blockchain technology enable his group to overcome the scalability challenge. He also touched on how ordinary people or subscribers can help secure the network by acquiring or hosting nodes.</p>
<p>Below are Watkins&#8217; answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): The internet is a core pillar of the modern information society, yet an estimated two billion people are still without access. This may be because it is not commercially viable for traditional telecom operators to bring the internet to certain geographical regions. Do you believe a blockchain-powered decentralized network is capable of connecting underserved users in an economically efficient manner?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Micky Watkins (MW):</strong> World Mobile utilizes a unique solution which combines two core elements. The first is our hybrid dynamic network, which consists of a decentralized network of what we call ‘Airnodes.&#8217; Airnodes range from small, wifi-hotspots, right up to Aerostats, which are lighter than air balloons that act as telecommunications towers in the sky. They contain radio equipment and distribute coverage over a much wider area than traditional cell towers, between 75km-100km. This hybrid dynamic network reduces rollout and maintenance costs, allowing for profitable operations in under-connected regions.</p>
<p>This hybrid dynamic network is then connected to our blockchain-powered sharing economy, which incentivizes individuals and businesses to connect their communities with our infrastructure, and subsequently rewards them for doing so.</p>
<p>These two elements combine to significantly reduce both the Capex [capital expenditure] and Opex [operational expenditure], resulting in a network which is at least 12 times cheaper to deploy than a legacy model.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: What advantages, if any, does a decentralized wireless network have over traditional telecom operators and why should a subscriber choose a decentralized wireless network over a traditional carrier?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> I’d suggest that once you understand the advantages of a decentralized operator like World Mobile, there will no longer be a choice to make.</p>
<p>Firstly, the reduced operating cost is passed on to our customers and in Zanzibar, the home of our first commercial deployment, our data bundles are almost 50% cheaper than the average. That alone is impressive, but when combined with the greater accessibility of our network, especially in under-connected and rural locations, it becomes an even more attractive offering.</p>
<p>Secondly, by integrating blockchain, we offer customers a much greater level of security and ownership of their data. It’s a well-known fact that many traditional operators profit from selling customer data, including location data and financial information. Customer and transaction data on World Mobile is encrypted on the blockchain and is immutable. This level of transparency is unattainable when using a traditional operator.</p>
<p>Finally, the flexibility of our infrastructure means we can rapidly scale and adjust the network to better reflect demand, resulting in more reliable connections for our customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p><strong>BCN: Your company claims to be the first global mobile network built on blockchain. Can you tell us what your infrastructure looks like and how the blockchain technology fits into it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> We have developed the World Mobile Chain, a Proof-of-Stake network that is a sidechain of Cardano. The World Mobile Chain is used to process network usage data and transactions. When a user purchases credit and starts to consume data through one of our Airnodes, their data traffic is encrypted and passes through our validator nodes (Earthnodes) which process and authenticate the network usage.</p>
<p>A record of this usage is then stored on a distributed ledger and the participants supporting the network i.e. Airnode Owners, Hosts and Earthnode Operators are rewarded with a share of the revenue, through our native utility token WMT.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Over the last decade or so, a number of technology giants including Facebook, Google, and Spacex have tried to bring Internet connectivity to the unconnected using innovative technologies. Their goals are similar to yours. Do you see them as collaborators or competitors?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> We don’t see them as competitors. Starlink has a great product, but it’s not a solution for the challenge of connecting the unconnected at scale. The upfront cost of the hardware limits accessibility and the lack of subsidies outside the USA makes it unviable in many parts of the world. That said, we do see them as collaborators and World Mobile utilises Starlink as a backhaul to provide connectivity in rural locations.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: World Mobile is said to be a people-run mobile network but it is also known that mobile networks are highly capital-intensive and complex. What are the different ways, if any, in which subscribers can own and operate a mobile network infrastructure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> World Mobile offers subscribers a number of ways to participate and benefit from the sharing economy. You could opt to buy an Airnode. Our entry-level Airnodes will be priced in a similar bracket to popular consumer tech products and will provide owners the opportunity to connect their community, or unconnected communities around the world. This is where Airnode hosts come in. An Airnode owner can choose to host an Airnode at their location or they can allow us to connect them to a host in a different part of the world. The host takes on responsibility for operating and maintaining the Airnode on the ground. Both owners and hosts earn a share of the revenue when mobile users connect to their Airnodes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t stop there though. Our recently launched Android application allows users to actively contribute to network expansion, through a feature currently called ‘scan for points.&#8217; This feature allows users to utilize their smartphone radios to help identify connectivity weak spots and potential Airnode locations, rewarding them with points that can be redeemed in the app’s marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: According to reports, you have completed field tests in several countries including Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, and Pakistan. Scalability often becomes an issue when onboarding millions of users. Can you tell our readers how you solve scalability to provide affordable and reliable internet access to both rural and underserved areas worldwide?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> Scalability might be a challenge for a centralized mobile network operator, which takes on responsibility for the deployment and operation of infrastructure, but scalability is a built-in feature of the World Mobile Network.</p>
<p>Our unique infrastructure model and blockchain-powered sharing economy provide the foundations needed to support and incentivize the rapid rollout of distributed infrastructure wherever demand might be.</p>

The Institute of International Finance Economist urged G7 countries to consider cutting the Russian oil price cap from $60 to $50. </strong></p>
<h2>Ruble Down by Over 18% in 2023</h2>
<p>According to Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Institute of International Finance (IIF), the Russian currency — the ruble — has now &#8220;stabilized&#8221; and is likely to be bolstered by rising oil prices in the coming months. Brooks, a former chief forex strategist at Goldman Sachs, also noted in a tweet that while Russia’s June current was in deficit, G7 countries’ failure to reduce the oil price cap from $60 to $50 per barrel could well give &#8220;the ruble a lift.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russia&#39;s Ruble has stabilized. The summer months are always a soft spot for the Ruble &#8211; the June current acount was in deficit &#8211; but now rising oil prices are giving the Ruble a lift, which helps Russia&#39;s war machine. Cutting the G7 oil price cap from $60 to $50 is way overdue&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/KmVXneErbp">pic.twitter.com/KmVXneErbp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Robin Brooks (@RobinBrooksIIF) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1682834744457801728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>At the time of writing (July 24, 15.30 EST) one U.S. dollar bought just over 90 rubles. In contrast, approximately 73 rubles would buy one dollar at the start of 2023. This means the ruble has <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/RUB-USD?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAiu6viaiAAxVERuUKHeWuDNEQmY0JegQIDRAc&amp;window=YTD">depreciated</a> by just over 18% since the start of the year. Steve Hanke, the Johns Hopkins economics professor, has <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1683227990124285952">said</a> the ruble’s &#8220;free-fall is fueling raging inflation&#8221; in Russia which he measures at 50 per annum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brooks’ July 22 <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1682834744457801728">tweet</a> is the latest in which the IIF economist has urged Western countries to further restrict Russia’s ability to fend off the effects of sanctions via increased oil revenues. As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/american-economists-are-baffled-by-an-unusual-situation-as-russias-ruble-is-the-worlds-best-performing-fiat-currency/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the Russian ruble was at one point in 2022 the world&#8217;s best-performing currency. At the time, some experts attributed the currency’s rise and resilience to surging energy prices.</p>

<h2>Russian Oil Producers Defy Sanctions</h2>
<p>However, after the winter ended demand for oil and gas subsided and this saw the price of Urals crude — Russia’s main grade of oil — drop from a year high of just over $100 per barrel in 2022 to prices under $60 for much of 2023. Many Western commentators have attributed the drop in the prices of Urals to the price cap. Others including Brooks have called for the further reduction of the price cap but the G7 countries have so far ignored the calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, Chinese exports to Georgia, Belarus, Kazakhstan &amp; Turkey are through the roof. The answer here isn&#8217;t to tighten export controls for goods that may end up in Russia. The answer is to lower the G7 cap so Putin doesn&#8217;t have cash to buy stuff,&#8221; Brooks said in an earlier tweet.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a July 22 Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-defies-sanctions-by-selling-oil-above-price-cap-bae1c271">report</a> suggested that the effectiveness of the G7’s price cap may be waning after the price of Urals crude breached $60 in April. The report pointed to the surging demand for Urals crude by countries like India and China as one of the primary reasons why the price of the commodity went past $60. Oil output cuts agreed upon by OPEC countries are cited as the other reason why Russian oil producers were able to sell at prices above the price cap.</p>
<p>Despite this breach, Western officials such as the United States Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo insist that the price cap is still working.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, the price cap is holding down Russia’s revenue significantly, while continuing to create a world in which global markets are being supplied with Russian oil,&#8221; Adeyemo reportedly said.</p>

For Rickards, the &#8220;bric&#8221; (the name he gives to the BRICS currency) will be anchored (but not redeemable or backed) to a weight of gold and will be used for debasing the dollar by propping up commodity prices.</strong></p>
<h2>Jim Rickards Speculates BRICS Currency Will Be Anchored to a Weight of Gold</h2>
<p>Jim Rickards, economist and best-selling author, has commented on his vision of a hypothetical BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) bloc currency and how it could be leveraged to devalue the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>To Rickards, the &#8220;bric&#8221; — the name he gives the BRICS currency — will be anchored to a determined weight in gold, but not backed by it. This is because the BRICS nations will free-ride on top of the gold markets without intervening to manage the bric-dollar peg.</p>
<p>This will also allow its price to go up as inflation and devaluation hit the U.S. dollar, ostensibly leading to the greenback&#8217;s destruction. On this, Rickards <a href="https://usawatchdog.com/new-brics-currency-boosts-gold-destroys-dollar-jim-rickards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a way to destroy the dollar. You don’t need dollars and you don’t need gold. You just need to be smart enough to anchor your currency to gold, and when dollar inflation starts to go up, your currency is going to be worth more because of how you pegged it, not to dollars, but how you pegged it to gold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Rickards acknowledges that this might take years to happen.</p>

<h2>Disrupting Supply Chains</h2>
<p>Rickards stated that another way of turbocharging the debasement of the U.S. dollar would be to interfere with the supply chains of commodities in the world. He mentioned the end of the Black Sea grain deal between Russia and Ukraine as an example, stating that grain prices went up by 10% just after the announcement of the suspension.</p>
<p>On this, Rickards explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, if I were a BRICS member, and I were Russia in particular, and I had this currency tied to gold, and I wanted my currency to be more valuable and your currency (U.S. dollar) less valuable, one of the ways to do that is mess with the supply chain and drive up the price of oil, gasoline, grain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In January, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1566969" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the bloc would discuss an official currency this August. However, South Africa&#8217;s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> this topic was not on the agenda for the upcoming summit.</p>

A verdict that has sparked a ripple, pun intended, in the crypto space, potentially creating waves of disarray for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<em>The following opinion editorial was written by Joseph Collement, General Counsel at Bitcoin.com.</em>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-the-xrp-not-a-security-ruling-mean-for-other-cryptocurrencies-7561320">legal ruling</a> re-echoes the content of the now-infamous 2018 Hinman speech, a speech that the SEC passionately endeavored to keep out of the Ripple case&#x2019;s evidentiary repertoire. This is the same speech whose author, Hinman, was meticulously<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-quietly-removes-director-william-201214915.html"> wiped off</a> the SEC&#x2019;s official website in June 2023, much to the bemusement and consternation of the crypto community. The echo from Hinman&#x2019;s 2018 address rings louder in the SEC&#x2019;s now empty corridors.&#13;</p>
<h2>Who Is William Hinman, and Why Does His Speech Matter?</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
William Hinman served as the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC from 2017 to 2020. On June 14, 2018, Hinman, in a thought-provoking proposition,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418"> suggested</a> that cryptocurrency startups could initially sell tokens as securities to raise funds before transitioning to non-security utility tokens once their networks are operational and the tokens have a functional use.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This perspective recognizes the dynamic nature of digital assets and how their classification can evolve over time, aligning with the economic reality of cryptocurrency projects. This adaptive approach to crypto token regulation, endorsed by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in 2019, showcased an understanding of the &#x201C;economic reality&#x201D; that while some projects may satisfy the Howey test for securities at their inception, this status can evolve over time.&#13;</p>
<h2>The SEC&#x2019;s U-Turn and the Ensuing Saga</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The SEC&#x2019;s initial challenge to Hinman&#x2019;s speech being admissible as evidence in the Ripple case was premised on two assertions. First, the speech was not a reflection of the SEC&#x2019;s official stance. Second, the speech was privileged, owing to Hinman&#x2019;s role as the Director of Corporation Finance. However, the court was unimpressed by SEC&#x2019;s arguments and ruled the speech admissible on a limited basis.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In an eyebrow-raising move, the SEC decided to erase Hinman&#x2019;s digital footprint from its official website on June 6, 2023, a decision that did not go unnoticed by the ever-vigilant crypto community. This deliberate purge underscored the lengths to which the SEC was willing to go to prevent Ripple from using Hinman&#x2019;s insight as part of their defense.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>What Are the Implications for the SEC?</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Ripple ruling, if used as a legal precedent in ongoing and future cases, could deal a devastating blow to the SEC. The court&#x2019;s verdict implies that digital assets traded on secondary markets do not fall under the umbrella of securities, relieving crypto exchanges from the necessity to register with the SEC.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This means that the SEC&#x2019;s hard-fought crusade for jurisdiction over crypto exchanges and digital assets could be rendered futile. Such an outcome is a hard pill to swallow for the regulatory body. However, it could open the door to a new era of thoughtful regulation. Regulation that seeks to safeguard consumers while simultaneously encouraging innovation, without burdening it with unwieldy and costly regulatory prerequisites.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Ripple case not only highlights the ongoing struggle to define and regulate cryptocurrencies but also illustrates the potential for significant shifts in the regulatory landscape based on a single court decision. The SEC, on its part, needs to adapt to these ever-evolving realities of the crypto world rather than resort to prejudgment, erasure, and denial. After all, the crypto tide is not going to recede anytime soon.&#13;<br />

He conveyed that this significant alignment with the five major emerging economies could potentially unlock unprecedented economic prospects for all the nations. </strong></p>
<h2>Algeria Sets Sights on BRICS</h2>
<p>In anticipation of the forthcoming BRICS Summit, there might be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">less emphasis</a> on the oft-debated BRICS reserve currency, yet <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">over 40 nations</a> exhibit a keen interest in becoming part of this influential bloc.</p>
<p>Ambassador Anil Sooklal, South Africa&#8217;s envoy to BRICS, <a href="https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2023/05/24/more-than-30-countries-want-to-join-the-brics/">subtly hinted</a> at an imminent expansion of the group this year. According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/algeria-applies-join-brics-would-contribute-15-bln-group-bank-2023-07-21/#:~:text=TUNIS%2C%20July%2021%20(Reuters),President%20Abdelmadjid%20Tebboune%20as%20saying.">report</a> via Ennahar TV, Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune has announced that Algeria has officially sought to join the BRICS group, currently made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;We officially applied to join the BRICS group, we sent a letter asking to be shareholder members in the bank &#8230; Algeria&#8217;s first contribution in the bank will be $1.5 billion,&#8221; Tebboune told Ennahar in a statement.</p>
<p>Algeria boasts a wealth of resources, ready to enrich the BRICS collective with <a href="https://oec.world/en/profile/country/dza">petroleum gas</a>, crude petroleum, nitrogenous fertilizers, and ammonia. Additionally, the country is a trove of mineral wealth, much of it still ripe for exploration and development. This includes bountiful reserves of iron ore, phosphate, and precious metals like gold.</p>
<p>Eager to steer its economy towards diversification, Algeria is now setting its sights on maximizing its <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2022/10/17/how-algeria-is-to-turning-to-its-mineral-resources-to-diversify-its-economy">untapped gold resources</a>. At present, Algeria&#8217;s economy largely depends on the ever-fluctuating global hydrocarbon prices. However, a potential surge is in sight as the World Bank <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/01/04/algerian-economy-staying-the-course-for-transition">projects</a> a 2.3% growth in Algeria&#8217;s GDP this year.</p>
<p>The much-awaited 15th BRICS Summit is scheduled to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from August 22-24, 2023. This summit will signify the first in-person meeting since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, Russian president <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-warns-of-increased-financial-crisis-risk-says-russia-is-being-subjected-to-hybrid-war/">Vladimir Putin</a> has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">reportedly</a> opted not to attend this year. While it remains uncertain if new countries will be welcomed into the BRICS alliance, speculation surrounding this topic has reached unprecedented levels.</p>

These crypto assets, used within Telegram&#8217;s ecosystem, are leveraged to facilitate automated trades for users on decentralized exchange (dex) platforms. These distinctive crypto assets have turned into a growing economy worth $138 million.</strong></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Bot Coins Enter the Crypto Marketplace</span></h2>
<p>The evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape is a spectacle, consistently enriched by an array of inventive projects. Notably, <a href="https://archive.ph/Pt2uK">Telegram bot coins</a> have created <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&amp;q=Telegram%20bot%20coins&amp;hl=en">interest</a> among crypto investors. They are a type of cryptocurrency used within the Telegram ecosystem, serving as automated programs that facilitate trades for users on decentralized exchanges (dexs) and can implement yield farming strategies.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, these coins empower users by facilitating token trades through Telegram, all in an uncomplicated, chat-like environment. The leading Telegram bot coin in terms of market valuation today is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unibot">unibot (UNIBOT)</a>, boasting a market cap of $117 million. Unibot&#8217;s market cap represents more than 84% of the total Telegram bot coin economy. Below unibot, seven additional Telegram bot coins each hold a market cap of $1 million or more.</p>
<p>The second largest, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mevfree">mevfree (MEVFREE)</a>, has a valuation of around $5.7 million. Of the 36 Telegram bot tokens <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/telegram-bots#:~:text=The%20Telegram%20Bots%20market%20cap,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">listed</a> on coingecko.com, the crypto assets have tallied $32.40 million in global trade volume in the past 24 hours. On coingecko.com, the unibot (UNIBOT) listing carries two warnings. One indicates the project&#8217;s migration to a new contract while the second cautions about a variable tax function on the smart contract. “Do your own research and be careful if you are trading this token,” the warning on coingecko.com advises.</p>
<p>With a circulating supply of 1 million unibot tokens, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xf819d9cb1c2a819fd991781a822de3ca8607c3c9">etherscan.io</a> shows a count of 4,122 token holders. The top ten unibot wallet holders <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/unibot/richlist/">control 16.40%</a> of the total supply. The top 50 holders possess 42.58% of the 1 million unibot coins, and the top 100 addresses control 56.55% of the supply. In comparison, the second-largest Telegram bot coin, mevfree, has <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/mevfree/richlist/">fewer holders</a> with 961 wallets as of July 24.</p>
<p>The top ten mevfree holders govern 43.58% of the total supply, amounting to 52,689,548 mevfree. The coin&#8217;s top 100 wallets encompass 80.52% of the supply. Alongside the inherent volatility of Telegram bot tokens, they feature a pronounced concentration among sizable holders.</p>

Yet, it has since experienced a downturn of $1.42 billion. Over the last week, eight of the top 10 AI-based crypto tokens saw declines against the U.S. dollar.</strong></p>
<h2>Downturn Hits AI Crypto Market</h2>
<p>Once a thriving market, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/ai/">AI-focused cryptocurrency assets</a> have undergone considerable value reductions in the past four months. On February 27, 2023, the AI crypto economy was worth around $4.03 billion, but by May 28, 2023, it had lost $1 billion in value. Since that time, an additional 420 million has been shed from the AI-focused crypto coin market.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, since its peak at the end of February, roughly $1.42 billion has been stripped from the AI-crypto economy&#8217;s worth. The previous week wasn&#8217;t particularly favorable for the top ten coins in this sector either, with most of the leading AI-focused crypto assets recording losses over the last seven days. The top AI crypto asset by market capitalization &#8211; graph (GRT) &#8211; dropped by 4.97% during this period as singularitynet (AGIX) fell by 7.99%.</p>
<p>Ocean protocol (OCEAN) registered the largest loss among the top ten AI tokens this past week with a decline of 13.7% against the U.S. dollar. Fetch.ai (FET) saw a negative impact of 9.94%, while dkargo (DKA) experienced a 4.38% increase. Iexec rlc (RLC) plunged by 8.18%, numeraire (NMR) dipped by 2.56%, and covalent (CQT) experienced a moderate rise of 2.26%. Alethea liquid intelligence (ALI) fell by 7.84%, and phala network (PHA) decreased by 5.62% in value against the greenback.</p>
<p>In total, the combined value of all 89 AI-centric crypto tokens declined by 2.85% over the past day and 5.73% within the previous week. Figures from the last 24 hours suggest that the AI-based coin sector has witnessed $309 million in global trade volume. Weekly data indicates that the top three AI-driven crypto tokens by gains were blockbank (BBANK), idena (IDNA), and ai meta club (AMC), soaring between 46% and 218% during this week.</p>

Recently, a Twitter account named &#x201C;Rev.Hodl&#x201D; demonstrated how a bitcoin miner was employed to dry laundry. While the clothes dryer serves to dry clean laundry, the machine also compensates the owner in satoshis.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining&#x2019;s Novel Approach to Reusing Heat</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The use of bitcoin miners for purposes beyond mining the leading cryptocurrency, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gas-to-bitcoin-mining-firm-crusoe-energy-systems-raises-505-million/">removing flare</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/landfill-gas-mitigation-firm-vespene-energy-gas-to-bitcoin-solutions/">landfill gases</a> from the environment, has steadily gained traction in recent years. Additionally, bitcoin mining rigs have been repurposed to utilize excess heat for a variety of applications, including using it to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptomatoes-using-excess-mining-heat-to-grow-produce/">grow tomatoes</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A bathhouse in New York City <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtuESmhoicI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D">uses</a> bitcoin miners to heat its pools, and many others have <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?s=20">heated hot tubs</a> with bitcoin ASICs. &#x200B;&#x200B;On July 19, 2023, a Twitter user named &#x201C;Rev.Hodl&#x201D; shared a video and images of a clothes dryer that doubles as a bitcoin miner.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Bitcoin Mining Clothes Dryer,&#x201D; Rev.Hodl <a href="https://twitter.com/HodlRev/status/1681835542109888512?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;Using a bitcoin miner instead of the heating element to dry laundry. Less than $100 in materials this dryer pays back sats for the power it uses to dry.&#x201D; Rev.Hodl also shared details on his Nostr account, noting his penchant for replacing any electric heat source with an ASIC miner.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In a <a href="https://twitter.com/HodlRev/status/1659021401578172417?s=20">tweet</a> from May, Rev.Hodl provided examples of a portable space heater, lamb incubator, food dehydrator, and excess solar power hashing. Large-scale miners are also cognizant of the potential benefits bitcoin mining can offer in terms of reusing heat.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Recently, researchers from Hashrate Index and members of the Luxor team visited a bitcoin mine operated by Microbt in Texas. The <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/a-look-inside-an-immersion-and-hydro-bitcoin-mine/">report</a> also addressed the topic of immersion and hydro-cooled machines, specifically highlighting the HS20 hydro container.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The <a href="https://heatcore.tech/2022/10/20/microbt-and-heat-core-inaugurate-first-hydro-cooling-and-heat-recovery-pilot-in-usa/">device</a>, constructed by <a href="https://heatcore.tech">Heat Core</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/samsungs-3nm-gaa-chip-discovered-in-microbts-next-gen-bitcoin-mining-rig/">Microbt</a>, accommodates two hydro-powered Microbt Whatsminer units and can also warm water in a home of up to 200 square meters. The HS20 hydro container is capable of heating a small swimming pool, up to 40 square meters, with a heating capacity of 17,200 kcal/h, according to the Hashrate Index report.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The authors of the report indicate the noise level is relatively low and comparable to the noise on &#x201C;a residential street or a normal conversation between two people.&#x201D; As ASIC miners generate significant heat, this byproduct can be harnessed to power a range of both small and large-scale heating processes.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
These include heating buildings, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/genesis-mining-is-converting-excess-bitcoin-datacenter-heat-into-greenhouse-power-in-sweden/">warming greenhouses</a> for agriculture, or providing heat for industrial procedures. Repurposing heat from bitcoin mining can transform an operational expense into a dual-purpose investment or entirely offset heating costs.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The considerable heat output of mining operations, especially when paired with efficient heat capture and distribution systems, could revolutionize heating economics, particularly in colder climates. For instance, in 2018, a woman in Irkutsk, a province of Siberia in Russia, used bitcoin miners for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-bitcoin-mining-granny-is-bullish-on-industrys-future/">heating purposes</a> and to accumulate bitcoin.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
