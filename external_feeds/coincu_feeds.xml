<p>In a recent statement, Matt Huang, the founder of Paradigm, expressed unwavering dedication to the world of cryptocurrency. Five years ago, when Paradigm was established, there was no grand blueprint but rather a shared passion for the future and a deep belief in the potential of crypto. Today, that conviction remains stronger than ever.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paradigm has never been more dedicated to crypto.<br><br>When Fred and I started Paradigm five years ago, there was no master plan. What we had was a shared curiosity for the future, deep conviction in crypto, and a desire to advance the frontier of what’s possible.<br><br>Our best decision…</p>&mdash; Matt Huang (@matthuang) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1673786399252955137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>One of its most significant early decisions was to create the position of &#8220;research partner,&#8221; an innovative role aimed at attracting exceptional talent like Dan Robinson, a coder and lawyer with a keen interest in research. This move, along with the contributions of Charlie Noyes, laid the groundwork for Paradigm&#8217;s research-driven approach, which continues to define the company today.</p>



<p>Over the years, Paradigm has evolved, integrating investing and research into a cohesive and symbiotic relationship. By embracing a research-driven philosophy, the team has honed their investment acumen, while their investments have provided valuable insights and perspectives for their research endeavors.</p>



<p>At Paradigm, the emphasis is on nurturing a team of inquisitive individuals who are encouraged to follow their instincts. This experimental approach has solidified their identity as a research-driven organization, a concept now prominently reflected on their website.</p>



<p>While Paradigm&#8217;s primary focus remains on the crypto landscape, the team also recognizes the captivating advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. Rather than viewing crypto and AI as competing forces, the firm sees significant potential for collaboration and overlap between the two. As such, they are committed to exploring both realms with equal enthusiasm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX has stopped the sale of its stake in Anthropic, a highly sought-after AI startup valued at $4.6 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>Multiple potential buyers have shown interest in the stake over the past few months, requiring NDA agreements to access private information.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-27/bankman-fried-s-ftx-said-to-halt-sale-of-its-stake-in-ai-startup-anthropic?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-27/bankman-fried-s-ftx-said-to-halt-sale-of-its-stake-in-ai-startup-anthropic?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noreferrer noopener">halted </a>the sale of its stake in AI startup Anthropic. The stake, valued at $4.6 billion, was sought after by buyers in the secondary market.

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2025.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="620" height="349" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2025.png" alt="FTX Halts Sale Of $500 Million Stake In Anthropic AI Startup: Report" class="wp-image-198290" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2025.png 620w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2025-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" title="FTX Halts Sale Of $500 Million Stake In Anthropic AI Startup: Report 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>At the heart of the AI boom, Anthropic, a startup founded by former OpenAI employees, has become one of the most sought-after companies in the field. The startup recently raised $450 million to support the development of its AI bot, dubbed Claude, and is now valued at an impressive $4.6 billion, according to Semafor’s June <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/06/06/2023/ftxs-big-ai-bet-could-help-bail-out-customers" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.semafor.com/article/06/06/2023/ftxs-big-ai-bet-could-help-bail-out-customers" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.</p>



<p>As a result, buyers in the secondary market for shares in private companies have been actively seeking opportunities to acquire stakes in Anthropic, including at a premium. This trend did not go unnoticed by Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX and Alameda, who made a $500 million investment in the startup, according to an internal document circulated before last November’s bankruptcy filing and reviewed by Bloomberg News.</p>



<p>However, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange has halted the sale of its Anthropic stake, which represents one of the biggest bets made by FTX, behind its $1.5 billion investment in crypto miner Genesis Digital. Boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners, an adviser to FTX, informed bidders about the pause, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing confidential information.</p>



<p>The halt came after several months, when multiple potential buyers assessed private information about the Anthropic stake. Perella had asked potential bidders to sign non-disclosure agreements before accessing private information about the target’s finances, which is standard practice in the industry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Revolut is reducing cryptocurrency trading costs for both standard and premium users.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Revolut is reducing cryptocurrency trading costs for both standard and premium users.</em></li>



<li><em>The changes will see fees drop from 1.99% to 1.49% for standard and plus customers and from 1.49% to 0.99% for premium and metal account holders.</em></li>



<li><em>The move was made in response to customer feedback and demonstrated the company&#8217;s commitment to competitive pricing in the cryptocurrency market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Revolut, a British neobank and financial technology company, said on Tuesday that it is lowering some of its cryptocurrency trading costs.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2023.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2023-1024x538.png" alt="Exciting: Revolut Slashes 0.5% Crypto Trading Fees" class="wp-image-198284" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2023-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2023-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2023-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2023-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2023-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2023.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Exciting: Revolut Slashes 0.5% Crypto Trading Fees 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Trading costs for both ordinary and premium users would be reduced under the new arrangement. Crypto trading costs will be reduced from 1.99% to 1.49% for Standard and Plus users and from 1.49% to 0.99% for Premium and Metal customers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been listening to your feedback, and have decided to update our fee structure. So, we&#8217;re happy to announce a reduction to some of our crypto trading fees,&#8221; the company said in the email sent to users.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021.png" alt="Exciting: Revolut Slashes 0.5% Crypto Trading Fees" class="wp-image-198280" width="764" height="642" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021.png 764w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021-300x252.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021-750x630.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" title="Exciting: Revolut Slashes 0.5% Crypto Trading Fees 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>The move was made in response to consumer input, and it demonstrates the company&#8217;s dedication to providing competitive cryptocurrency market prices.</p>



<p>Since November 2017, Revolut, well-known for its banking, investing, and currency exchange services, has enabled cryptocurrency trading on its site. At the last reported fundraising round in 2021, Revolut was valued at roughly $33 billion, making it Britain&#8217;s most valuable firm.</p>



<p>Revolut offered users the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency incentives by allowing the lender to &#8220;stake&#8221; their coins to verify blockchain transactions earlier this year.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2024-1024x682.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2024-1024x682.png" alt="image 2024" class="wp-image-198285" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2024-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2024-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2024-768x511.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2024-750x499.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2024-1140x759.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2024.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Exciting: Revolut Slashes 0.5% Crypto Trading Fees 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>As part of Revolut&#8217;s ambition to extend its crypto-related services, the functionality was made accessible to users in the United Kingdom and roughly 30 additional European nations. Customers might earn up to 11.65% yearly percentage return depending on the token invested and the consumer.</p>



<p>Revolut made its first push into South America last month, with a live debut in Brazil. The company has topped 25 million subscribers globally, as part of a global expansion plan that will see the super app debut in India, Mexico, and New Zealand in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Nevada FID has filed a petition to put Prime Trust under receivership due to financial difficulties.</em></li>



<li><em>The company owes its customers $85,670,000 in fiat cash but only has $2,904,000, and owes $69,509,000 in digital money but only possesses $68,648,000, according to research.</em></li>



<li><em>The appointment of a receiver will safeguard Prime Trust&#8217;s consumers and assets, who will take over the administration, stabilize operations and determine the best course of action.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Nevada FID (<strong>Industry&#8217;s Financial Institutions Division</strong>) has <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/Q5WNMMS/prime-core-technologies-et-al-petition-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a petition to put Prime Trust under receivership, which means that a court-appointed receiver takes control of the company&#8217;s assets and activities to safeguard creditors and other stakeholders&#8217; interests.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018-1024x576.png" alt="Prime Trust Faces Receivership As Nevada FID Seeks to Protect Consumers" class="wp-image-198268" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2018.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Prime Trust Faces Receivership As Nevada FID Seeks to Protect Consumers 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The petition will be heard, and the trustee submitting the petition is required under NRS 155.010 to notify all people entitled to notice. The hearing will evaluate whether Prime Trust should be put under receivership and who should be chosen as the receiver.</p>



<p>In 2021, the Nevada FID Prime Trust lost access to old wallets and spent client money to purchase back cryptocurrency. Prime Trust owes clients $85,670,000 in fiat cash but only has $2,904,000, according to the research. In terms of digital money, the corporation owes its customers $69,509,000 but only possesses $68,648,000.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2020.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="770" height="431" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2020.png" alt="Prime Trust Faces Receivership As Nevada FID Seeks to Protect Consumers" class="wp-image-198276" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2020.png 770w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2020-300x168.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2020-768x430.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2020-750x420.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" title="Prime Trust Faces Receivership As Nevada FID Seeks to Protect Consumers 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>When the Nevada FID files a petition to put Prime Trust into receivership, they are requesting that a court appoint a receiver to take control of the company. This often occurs when a financial institution is in considerable problems, such as when they are unable to satisfy their financial commitments or are in breach of certain laws or regulations.</p>



<p>In this situation, it seems that Prime Trust, a crypto custodian, has been experiencing some difficulties. According to some sources, they have been unable to fulfill consumer withdrawals, resulting in a &#8220;shortfall of customer funds.&#8221; The Nevada FID has even given them a cease-and-desist order.</p>

<p>The earlier agreement with Paxos, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221004006072/en/EDX-Markets-Partners-with-Paxos-for-Digital-Asset-Custody-Services-on-New-Exchange" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221004006072/en/EDX-Markets-Partners-with-Paxos-for-Digital-Asset-Custody-Services-on-New-Exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>last October, would have directed the exchange’s clients to Paxos for custody of crypto assets and allowed Paxos customers direct access to EDX. However, EDX Markets has now shifted to a non-custodial model, meaning it will not hold clients’ digital assets during trading. This is in contrast to existing crypto platforms such as Coinbase Global Inc. and Binance Holdings Ltd., which do hold clients&#8217; digital assets.</p>



<p>EDX’s decision to find a new custody partner is critical to the exchange’s success. CEO Jamil Nazarali said that EDX is already working with a third-party custodian, but did not disclose the new partner&#8217;s name. The exchange’s focus on a non-custodial model is in line with criticism from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has criticized existing crypto platforms for failing to separate different parts of their businesses, such as custody, market-making, and trading, which could result in conflicts of interest.</p>



<p>Anchorage Digital, the new partner EDX is in talks with, is a US crypto custodian with a bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller. It is already listed as one of the vendors and partners on EDX’s website, whereas Paxos is not on the list. However, Anchorage Digital has had its own issues with compliance. The OCC stated last year that Anchorage did not have key money-laundering controls in place and that its compliance program lacked staff and internal processes to verify customers in 2021. Anchorage Digital agreed to correct the issues.</p>



<p>The move away from Paxos comes as the company received a Wells notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission in February, alleging that Paxos should have registered with the regulator regarding the issuance of a Binance-branded stablecoin called BUSD. Paxos has said it disagrees and is prepared to litigate if necessary. </p>

<p>Hootie Rashidifard has launched a new seed-stage crypto fund, Hash3, with a $29 million investment aimed at early-stage startups. The fund will invest between $250,000 and $1 million in passionate founders with the goal of building an open and permissionless future. </p>

<p>Hash3 has made ten investments thus far, including Ajna.finance, Crossmint, and EigenLayer. The fund has been quietly active for the past year, and its largest focus area is infra/middleware. Hash3 aims to become a collective of like-minded individuals, spanning across the portfolio and lp base.</p>



<p>Hash3&#8217;s investment framework is listed publicly, and the investment criteria serve as a starting point for determining whether a prospective opportunity fits the fund&#8217;s underwriting model. When evaluating protocols, Hootie&#8217;s philosophy is that decentralized protocols must maintain immutability, trust minimization, censorship resistance, robust economic policy, and utility to drive a sustainable business model. These are core principles that result in robust participant incentives.</p>



<p>Hootie Rashidifard has a history of investing in crypto and fintech, having spent five years at Canaan Partners, a $7B AUM early-stage fund, where he invested in crypto and fintech starting in 2017. Prior to investing, he worked on the business operations team at LinkedIn (acquired by Microsoft) and in tech investment banking. He graduated cum laude with a B.A. in Mathematics and Economics from Northwestern University.</p>



<p>For founders seeking investment, Hash3 is open for business and actively investing. Hootie is willing to lead, co-lead, or participate in fundraising rounds, and he likes to meet founders early. He can be reached by direct message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s request to dismiss criminal charges against him was refused by a US court.</em></li>



<li><em>Bankman-Fried faces 13 fraud and conspiracy charges, including wire fraud, bank fraud, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, bribery, and campaign finance.</em></li>



<li><em>He is also accused of misappropriating FTX client funds and deceiving investors and lenders.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A US court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.167.0_3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refused</a> Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s request to have criminal charges against him dismissed on Tuesday, opening the way for the founder of now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX to stand trial beginning Oct. 2.</strong></h5>

<p>Bankman-Fried, who is charged with wire fraud, bank fraud, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, bribery, and campaign finance, asked Judge Lewis Kaplan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in May to dismiss at least 11 of the 13 fraud and conspiracy charges he faced.</p>



<p>Judge Lewis Kaplan dismissed the final three of those requests earlier this month, stating that the exchange&#8217;s founder lacked standing to dismiss several of these accusations and did not satisfy the extraordinary conditions for dismissal.</p>



<p>He refused Bankman-Fried&#8217;s pleas to dismiss the accusations of bank fraud, money transmission, political funding, bribery, wire fraud, and other crimes on Tuesday.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, misappropriated billions of dollars in FTX client money to fill losses at his hedge fund, Alameda Research, deceived investors and lenders, and unlawfully contributed to U.S. political campaigns in the names of his colleagues.</p>

<p>The ex-billionaire has pled not guilty. He admitted to poor risk management at FTX but denied taking money.</p>



<p>The judge&#8217;s 41-page commentary explains why he denied the four remaining pretrial motions to dismiss, including problems with the venue and whether prosecutors established genuine property rights in pursuing fraud charges.</p>



<p>Judge Kaplan earlier granted Bankman-Fried and prosecutors permission to separate five of the 13 allegations filed against the former FTX CEO, setting a trial date for those offenses in March 2024.</p>

<p>He <a href="https://coincu.com/195031-sam-bankman-fried-gets-appeal-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that some were based on a legal basis of fraud that the US Supreme Court had rejected and that others were unlawfully filed without agreement from the Bahamas, where he was detained in December and extradited to the US. The court observed that the Bahamas has not yet objected to any of the accusations but that if that changed, a renewed motion might be made.</p>

<p>Users may exchange one digital token for another inside the P2P marketplace. The trading operation is divided into two stages, beginning with a client, known as the &#8216;Maker,&#8217; creating an &#8216;Ad&#8217; on the &#8216;Ad Board&#8217; to express their desire to swap a supported token. This Ad is then shown to other consumers, known as &#8216;Takers,&#8217; who might opt to participate in a deal depending on the terms provided by the Maker.</p>



<p>For enhanced security during transactions, the &#8216;Bitfinex P2P Market Place&#8217; provides a public profile view option. Before starting a deal, customers may receive critical information about a possible counterparty, such as average payment time, trading volume, trade counts, and other significant statistics.</p>

<p>Later this year, a mobile version of Bitfinex P2P will be released, along with additional improvements aimed at improving the client experience. Customers will be able to trade bitcoins on the move with this mobile version.</p>



<p>The introduction of Bitfinex P2P in Latin America is the most recent in a series of attempts by Bitfinex to broaden access to digital asset-related financial services in the area. Bitfinex made an undisclosed investment in Chilean crypto exchange OrionX in May with the goal of growing its presence in Latin America.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle&#8217;s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) is now operating on Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution.</em></li>



<li><em>CCTP allows for USDC to be transferred across blockchain networks by burning native USDC on the originating chain and minting an equivalent quantity on the receiving chain.</em></li>



<li><em>The integration aims to make USDC transactions quicker and more secure across different chains while eliminating the need for &#8220;lock-and-mint&#8221; bridging.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle, the company behind the USD Coin stablecoin, <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1673678076746637318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol is now operating on Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2006-1024x640.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2006-1024x640.png" alt="Circle Now Supports CCTP For Arbitrum To Make USDC Transfer Faster And Safer" class="wp-image-198233" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2006-1024x640.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2006-300x188.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2006-768x480.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2006-750x469.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2006-1140x713.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2006.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Circle Now Supports CCTP For Arbitrum To Make USDC Transfer Faster And Safer 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>CCTP allows USDC to be transferred across blockchain networks by burning native USDC on the originating chain and minting an equivalent quantity on the receiving chain. Arbitrum is the third chain to support CCTP and is now available on the official Arbitrum Bridge.</p>



<p>The protocol is intended to make USDC transactions quicker and more secure across different chains, including Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. Developers may also create applications that provide native cross-chain deposits, swaps, purchases, and other services.</p>

<p>Users using CCTP get native USDC. The official Arbitrum Bridge now allows ecosystem applications that use CCTP to quickly transfer USDC to Arbitrum, eliminating the need for &#8220;lock-and-mint&#8221; bridging. The traditional &#8220;lock-and-mint&#8221; approach has already been linked to security breaches. Moreover, according to Circle, using CCTP aids in faster bridge transfers.</p>



<p>Circle <a href="https://coincu.com/193335-circle-supports-native-usdc-on-arbitrum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> a native version of their stablecoin on the Arbitrum network shortly before the CCTP integration.</p>

<p>Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution created by Offchain Labs. It employs Optimistic Rollup technology to quickly grow transaction throughput for decentralized applications while maintaining the security provided by the Ethereum blockchain. It is currently the seventh blockchain that supports USDC.</p>



<p>Several bridge projects and protocols are focusing on interoperability, such as Celer Network, Li.Fi, Wormhole, O3 Labs, Wanchain, and Router Protocol, have already incorporated CCTP into their systems to enable USDC transfers across their platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>3AC liquidators are seeking to recoup $1.3 billion from its co-founders, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.</em></li>



<li><em>The liquidators claim that Zhu and Davies allowed Three Arrows to amass large amounts of debt after suffering significant losses on investments in Luna coins and other assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-27/three-arrows-liquidators-seek-1-3-billion-from-fund-s-founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) liquidators are chasing $1.3 billion from the crypto hedge fund&#8217;s co-founders, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.</strong></h5>

<p>A source familiar with the liquidators&#8217; claims said that the liquidators raised the charges against Three Arrows co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies in a Tuesday meeting with the hedge fund&#8217;s claimants.</p>



<p>Zhu and Davies are accused of allowing Three Arrows to take on enormous debt between May and June 2022 after the hedge fund incurred large losses on ill-fated Luna coins and other investments. The company was already bankrupt, and liquidators are now suing Zhu and Davies in a British Virgin Islands court to recoup those losses for the firm&#8217;s debt.</p>



<p>Due to a series of leveraged bets gone bad during a cryptocurrency bear market and its exposure to the $40 billion Terra Luna ecosystem, 3AC filed for bankruptcy in the British Virgin Islands in June 2022. Davies and Zhu could not be traced after the bankruptcy filing, despite media reports indicating they spent their time in Dubai and Indonesia.</p>



<p>In June, Zhu wrote on Twitter that his and Davies&#8217; good faith attempts to work with liquidators were met with baiting.</p>

<p>The demise of Three Arrows happened during a slump in digital currencies, and its effects were seen by platforms with exposure to the hedge fund, notably BlockFi, and Voyager Digital Ltd., who filed for bankruptcy weeks after the hedge fund went into liquidation.</p>



<p>The liquidators&#8217; charges against the co-founders increase moves taken against Zhu and Davies, whom they accuse of being uninvolved in their probe. The liquidators, Teneo partners, were appointed by a BVI court last year and are seeking to collect cash for Three Arrows, which is owed around $3.3 billion.</p>



<p>Recently, Open Exchange (OPNX), a platform for exchanging claims against failing crypto companies, has announced the addition of a new ecosystem partner, &#8220;3AC Ventures.&#8221; OPNX was established by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.</p>

<p>3AC claimed to have managed $10 billion in assets at its height. On June 15, 3AC liquidators filed a petition in the United States to place Davies in contempt of court. The move, however, does not apply to Zhu, whose Singaporean citizenship precludes him from being subject to US jurisdiction.</p>
