<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle, the stablecoin issuer, has announced staff reductions and a focus on core business activities to improve its balance sheet.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs at Circle follow similar moves by other cryptocurrency companies in response to challenging market conditions and regulatory pressures.</em></li>



<li><em>Circle continues to prioritize key areas of focus and has recently appointed a former chairman of the CFTC as its new chief legal officer.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle, the stablecoin issuer, has made staff reductions and ended investments in non-core activities in an effort to strengthen its balance sheet. The company&#8217;s actions come as a response to the challenging environment faced by the cryptocurrency sector, which has experienced declining prices and reduced investor confidence.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2-1024x682.jpg" alt="Circle Cuts Workforce To Focus On Core Activities And Strong Balance Sheet" class="wp-image-202262" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1x-1-2.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Circle Cuts Workforce To Focus On Core Activities And Strong Balance Sheet 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>Several other cryptocurrency firms have also announced layoffs this year, including Coinbase Global, Chainalysis, and Gemini. The industry suffered significant losses in 2022, with over a trillion dollars wiped out.</p>



<p>In an email shared with <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/12/circle-cuts-workforce-ends-certain-non-core-activities-will-continue-hiring-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em>, Circle&#8217;s spokesperson emphasized the company&#8217;s commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet by focusing on core business activities and execution. They mentioned that while some non-core investments have been reduced or terminated, new areas for investment have been identified, and the company continues to hire in key areas globally.</p>

<p>The layoffs at <a href="https://coincu.com/200703-circle-released-web3-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Circle</a> reflect a broader trend of staff reductions occurring within the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier this year, in January, crypto trading platform Blockchain.com announced a 28% reduction in its workforce due to significant headwinds faced by the crypto sector. Similarly, crypto exchange Crypto.com decreased its global workforce by 20%, citing economic headwinds and unforeseeable industry events.</p>



<p>In June, Binance.US, a leading crypto exchange, <a href="https://coincu.com/195587-binanceus-fires-50-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off</a> approximately 50 employees in response to allegations of securities law violations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://coincu.com/196743-binanceus-market-share-falling-seriously/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against</a> its parent company, Binance.</p>

<p>Another notable player in the space, blockchain analytics provider Nansen, announced in May that it would be reducing its staff by 30% after years of rapid expansion. The CEO of Nansen at the time described the previous year as &#8220;brutal&#8221; for the crypto sector.</p>



<p>In addition to the staffing changes, Circle recently made headlines with the appointment of Heath Tarbert, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as its new chief legal officer in June. This appointment reflects Circle&#8217;s focus on regulatory compliance and underscores the company&#8217;s commitment to navigating the evolving landscape of the crypto industry.</p>



<p>These developments reflect the ongoing adjustments and challenges within the cryptocurrency industry as companies navigate market fluctuations and regulatory pressures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Google Play announces policy change allowing developers to incorporate digital assets, including NFTs, into their apps and games.<p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com/202234-google-play-now-changes-policy/" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p><p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com"><strong>Coincu News</strong></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Google Play announces policy change allowing developers to incorporate digital assets, including NFTs, into their apps and games.</em></li>



<li><em>Developers must disclose the presence of blockchain elements and be transparent about tokenized digital assets to users.</em></li>



<li><em>The new policy aims to support innovation, user engagement, and loyalty through unique NFT rewards while ensuring a safe and trusted experience on the platform.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Google Play, the app store for Android smartphone users, has <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/new-blockchain-based-content-opportunities-google-play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a significant policy change that will allow developers to incorporate digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), into their apps and games. The move aims to support developers&#8217; ambitions by enabling them to expand their blockchain-based offerings on the platform.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-1024x576.png" alt="Google Play Now Changes Policy, Allowing Digital Assets In Apps And Games" class="wp-image-202240" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Google Play Now Changes Policy, Allowing Digital Assets In Apps And Games 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>Under the new policy, companies offering the ability to buy, sell, or earn tokenized assets must clearly disclose the presence of blockchain elements within their apps. The transparency requirement ensures that users are aware of the tokenized digital assets within the app and prohibits developers from promoting or glamorizing potential earnings from playing or trading activities.</p>



<p>Google Play&#8217;s group product manager, Joseph Mills, emphasized the importance of balancing innovation and user protection. The updated policy allows partners to reimagine traditional games by integrating user-owned content and leveraging unique NFT rewards to enhance user loyalty.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Google Play hosts a variety of blockchain related apps, and we know that our partners are excited to expand on these offerings to create more engaging and immersive digital experiences with tokenized digital assets such as NFTs. Like with any emerging technology, we must balance innovation with our responsibility to protect users. So, we’ve spoken with developers about responsibly supporting those opportunities while continuing to provide a safe, transparent, and trusted experience for everyone.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, apps that violate Google Play&#8217;s Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy or fail to meet eligibility requirements cannot accept payments for chances to win assets, including NFTs. This includes mechanisms such as &#8220;loot boxes&#8221; that offer randomized blockchain-based items with purchases.</p>

<p>Google expects users to start experiencing in-app and game experiences leveraging digital assets later this summer. A select group of developers is currently testing the new policy before its wider rollout to all developers on Google Play later this year.</p>



<p>While Google is embracing the integration of digital assets, including NFTs, within apps, Apple has been more cautious and slower to adopt similar functionalities on its iPhone platform.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Google&#8217;s updated policy reflects a shift in attitude towards Web3 technologies. The company has recently allowed the decentralized data storage app ArDrive Mobile and the popular blockchain game <a href="https://coincu.com/159728-axie-infinity-launches-origins-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axie Infinity: Origins</a> to be listed on <a href="https://coincu.com/184094-nba-top-shot-apple-store-google-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play</a>. Additionally, Google Cloud launched an initiative in April 2023 to support Web3 developers in accelerating their startups.</p>



<p>With these changes, Google Play aims to foster innovation in the blockchain space while ensuring a safe, transparent, and trusted experience for all users.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CFTC obtained a default judgment against Adam Todd and his companies for operating an illegal digital asset exchange Digitex Futures.</em></li>



<li><em>Todd and his companies attempted to manipulate the price of the native token DGTX and offered futures transactions without proper registration.</em></li>



<li><em>The judgment bans Todd and his companies from trading in CFTC-regulated markets and imposes significant penalties</em>.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent development, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida has <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8748-23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a default judgment against Florida resident Adam Todd and his affiliated companies &#8211; Digitex LLC, Digitex Limited, Digitex Software Limited, and Blockster Holdings Limited Corporation.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-1024x683.jpg" alt="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities" class="wp-image-202227" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-750x500.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The judgment comes as a result of their involvement in illegal activities related to their digital asset exchange, operating under the name &#8220;Digitex Futures.&#8221;</p>



<p>The court ruling states that Todd and his companies attempted to manipulate the price of their native token, DGTX, engaged in illegal futures transactions, failed to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and neglected to implement essential compliance measures such as a customer information program, know your customer policies, and anti-money laundering procedures.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777.png" alt="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities" class="wp-image-202230" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>As a result, the court has permanently enjoined Todd and his companies from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets and from registering with the CFTC. Additionally, Todd has been ordered to pay $3,912,220 in disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $11,736,660. This judgment effectively resolves the CFTC&#8217;s enforcement action against Todd and Digitex Futures.</p>



<p>Ian McGinley, the Director of the CFTC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement, highlighted the importance of the ruling, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;This order resolves yet another action against an individual and digital asset exchange illegally offering futures contracts to U.S. customers. The order finds that Todd attempted to manipulate Digitex&#8217;s native utility token, DGTX, by allegedly &#8216;pumping&#8217; the token&#8217;s price through the use of a computerized bot. This case demonstrates that regardless of the technology used, the CFTC will aggressively use its well-established authority to ensure entities are lawfully registered and to address the manipulation of commodities in interstate commerce.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The case against Todd and Digitex Futures originated from a complaint filed by the <a href="https://coincu.com/200430-cftc-sue-celsius-and-former-ceo-earlier-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFTC</a> on September 30, 2022. The complaint alleged that between May 2020 and May 2022, Todd and his company operated a digital asset derivatives exchange from Florida, targeting U.S. customers despite being subject to U.S. regulation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1024x768.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1024x768.png" alt="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities" class="wp-image-202231" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Adam Todd</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The CFTC charged Todd with attempting to manipulate DGTX, the native token of the Digitex Futures exchange. Todd&#8217;s alleged actions included artificially inflating the price of DGTX through the use of a bot and engaging in large over-the-counter purchases from third-party exchanges. These manipulative practices were intended to boost the price of DGTX, benefiting the Digitex &#8220;treasury&#8221; despite the potential trading losses incurred.</p>



<p>The court&#8217;s judgment affirms the CFTC&#8217;s claims of attempted manipulation and other charges related to the interstate commerce of commodities.</p>



<p>While the CFTC cautions that victims may not recover their lost funds due to insufficient assets held by wrongdoers, it remains committed to protecting customers and holding wrongdoers accountable for their actions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has transferred 9,825 Bitcoin linked to the Silk Road darknet marketplace to new addresses in two transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>The DOJ previously sold 9,800 BTC to Coinbase for $215 million and plans to sell the remaining balance of over 40,000 Bitcoins in multiple installments this year.</em></li>



<li><em>There is controversy surrounding the transfers as the assets may potentially be moved back to their original wallets under new addresses, and the transactions are currently experiencing confirmation delays due to insufficient transaction fees of only $8.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Around 9,800 Bitcoin (BTC) linked to the Silk Road are in transit. It would be the biggest transfer of funds associated with the now-defunct darknet marketplace in months.</strong></h5>

<p>According to on-chain statistics, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) confiscated 9,825 Bitcoin worth $302 million in connection with the defunct darknet marketplace Silk Road which were relocated to different addresses earlier today, July 12.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/7dcbeff9e6da0f4ec5133d2f8b6fbe8bb73e05c5ddc8f5e410d408f8150e02ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchair dashboard</a>, the BTC was transmitted to new addresses in two transactions<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qe7nk2nlnjewghgw4sgm0r89zkjzsurda7z4rdg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.</a></p>

<p>A total of 8,200 Bitcoin are being moved to new wallets. The remaining monies are being transferred to new wallets, and there is some controversy about whether this constitutes as formally migrating since these assets may be transferred back to their original wallets under new addresses.</p>



<p>The first transaction sends 0.01 BTC to the wallet 361yog, but the second sends 506 BTC to a different address. These monies come from two wallets, the most important of which is this one.</p>



<p>Yet, US goverment <a href="https://coincu.com/177726-u-s-government-to-sell-41500-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> 9,800 BTC straight to the US-based site Coinbase in March for $21,800 each token, making $215 million. The authorities indicated intentions at the moment to sell the over 40,000 Bitcoin balance in four installments this calendar year.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/196794-explosive-twist-cryptoquant-ceo-silk-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silk Road Bitcoin</a> refers to the more than 50,000 BTC confiscated from <a href="https://coincu.com/181499-silk-road-hacker-received-one-year-jail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Zhong</a> by the US authorities in 2022. Zhong hacked the dark web marketplace to steal cash in 2012, and it took almost a decade for the authorities to retrieve the stolen assets.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice&#8217;s outstanding Silk Road transactions are presently encountering a confirmation delay, which might be caused by insufficient transaction costs.</p>



<p>The DOJ seems to have set aside a pittance of $8 in fees for these transactions. Bitcoin blocks are processed once every 10 minutes on average.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Fantom Foundation is facing persistent interruptions and security problems with the Multichain protocol, leading to substantial financial losses and concerns for users.</em></li>



<li><em>As a response, the foundation is exploring alternative chains such as Axelar and LayerZero as network bridging technologies to reduce reliance on Multichain.</em></li>



<li><em>Recent exploits resulting in significant fund transfers have prompted Multichain to temporarily cease operations, while the absence of Multichain&#8217;s CEO has raised suspicions of an inside job.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Fantom Foundation is <a href="https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1679103844628721664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploring</a> alternate chains to fuel its operations because of the persistent interruption of the Multichain protocol caused by hackers and force majeure.</strong></h5>

<p>After a number of security problems involving the Multichain bridge in which huge sums of crypto assets were transferred under questionable circumstances in two distinct events, the Fantom Foundation is taking strong action. The foundation acknowledged the tough situation that the current Multichain breach had placed Liquidity Providers (LPs), token holders, and general protocol users in.</p>



<p>The Fantom Foundation officially acknowledged the canonical bridge within the network. It serves as a reminder to the community of the ecosystem&#8217;s variety and adaptability in terms of infrastructure.</p>



<p>The development prompted the foundation to recommend Axelar and LayerZero as alternate network bridging technologies. It was also said that Axelar and LayerZero are gaining momentum as a result of the <a href="https://coincu.com/201729-multichain-record-265-million-withdrawn-9-chains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multichain</a> issues.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In light of the current events, the Fantom Foundation is taking a hands-on approach toward reducing the network&#8217;s reliance on any one particular solution for bridging and liquidity. With this, the Foundation will look to seed both Axelar and LayerZero issued asset pools directly with the bridges themselves to encourage protocol liquidity and confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>A possible exploit earlier this month resulted in the transfer of $125 million, followed by another transfer of $103 million in various assets. After the first outflow, Multichain advised users to stop using the project and cancel contract permissions, however, a significant quantity of assets remained on the network.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/200938-fantom-foundation-ftm-unaffected-multichains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantom Foundation</a> said that it is currently awaiting an official announcement from Multichain as well as instructions on its future moves. Remember that the most recent breach discovered by Arkham Intelligence resulted in the theft of around $125 million in various tokens from the Multichain Bridge. The company immediately ceased operations in order to mitigate the devastation caused by this exploit.</p>

<p>The foundation recognized Multichain&#8217;s higher share as the major bridge that supports consumers inside its ecosystem. This situation is growing intolerable, and the protocol has said that it will look for alternate options.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US CPI Maintains Stability: The annual rate of CPI in the United States remained unadjusted seasonally at 3% in June, indicating a steady and controlled inflationary environment.</em></li>



<li><em>Positive Economic Outlook: The stable CPI rate reflects favorable economic conditions in the US, instilling confidence in businesses, investors, and consumers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a promising development, the latest data on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States brings positive news for the economy.</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin-cpi-inflation-11-1024x538.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin-cpi-inflation-11-1024x538.jpeg" alt="U.S. CPI Rate Seen Falling At 3.1% In June, BTC Price Holds Firm

<p>In June, the annual rate of CPI remained unadjusted seasonally at 3%, marking the smallest increase since March 2021. This figure defied expectations of 3.10%, outperforming the previous value of 4%.</p>



<p>Moreover, the annual rate of core CPI in the US for June stood at 4.8%, the lowest since November 2021. This reading exceeded expectations of 5% and marked a decline from the previous value of 5.3%. These numbers indicate a stabilization of price levels and suggest steady economic growth in the country.</p>



<p>Additionally, the monthly <a href="https://coincu.com/194802-cpi-expectations-btc-price-slight-recovery/">CPI </a>rate in the US, seasonally adjusted, showed a modest increase of 0.2% in June, slightly below the anticipated 0.30%. However, it was an improvement over the previous value of 0.10%. This suggests a controlled inflationary environment, providing further confidence in the stability of the US economy.</p>

<p>In tandem with this positive economic news, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a slight uptick, reaching $30,800 USD. This demonstrates the resilience of the cryptocurrency market and its ability to respond to favorable economic indicators.</p>



<p>The stable CPI figures reflect well on the US economy, indicating a healthy balance between supply and demand. This data brings reassurance to businesses, investors, and consumers, fostering an environment of economic confidence.</p>



<p>As the US economy continues to show signs of resilience and stability, market participants are encouraged to analyze the CPI data and adjust their strategies accordingly. Understanding the evolving economic landscape can inform decisions regarding investment, savings, and financial planning.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the latest CPI figures in the United States present a positive outlook, with stable annual rates and a controlled monthly increase. These numbers signify a robust and balanced economic growth trajectory, supporting confidence in the US market. The concurrent rise in BTC price further highlights the positive sentiment among investors and the cryptocurrency community.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>EBA Initiates Consultations on ART Standards: The European Banking Authority (EBA) has begun consultations on draft technical standards under MiCAR, aimed at ensuring fair and consistent handling of complaints from asset reference token (ART) holders.&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><em>By encouraging preparatory action, the EBA aims to minimize disruptive business model adjustments and promote regulatory convergence, ultimately enhancing consumer protection in the crypto market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On July 12, the EBA announced its consultations on draft technical standards under the &#8220;Encrypted Assets Market Regulation&#8221; (MiCAR), demonstrating its commitment to fairness and consumer protection in the crypto market.</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EBA-newsite.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="618" height="300" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EBA-newsite.jpeg" alt="EBA Drives Regulatory Standards For Asset Reference Token Under MiCAR

<p>The EBA&#8217;s release of the consultation paper on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) for processing procedures is a strong indication of its intention to ensure efficient and consistent handling of complaints from asset reference token (ART) holders and other concerned parties. The draft RTSs are set to create a framework that guarantees prompt resolution and fair treatment for all stakeholders involved.</p>



<p>Additionally, the EBA has opened consultations on two sets of draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and a set of Implementing Technical Standards (ITS). These address the authorization of ART issuers and the criteria for assessing acquisitions related to the market regulation of cryptoassets (MiCAR). By establishing clear and transparent guidelines, the EBA aims to regulate the access to the ART market within the European Union, enabling a level playing field for aspiring issuers and individuals seeking influence.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://coincu.com/191269-eba-raises-vigilance-against-crypto/">EBA</a> has issued a statement emphasizing the importance of timely compliance with MiCAR regulations for financial institutions and businesses involved in Asset Reference Token (ART) or Electronic Money Token (EMT) activities. By encouraging proactive measures and preparedness, the organization seeks to minimize potential disruptions and abrupt adjustments to business models. This approach not only promotes regulatory convergence but also safeguards consumer interests, fostering a stable and secure environment.</p>



<p>The EBA&#8217;s commitment to driving regulatory standards for ARTs under MiCAR underscores its dedication to fostering a well-regulated and consumer-friendly crypto market. These initiatives aim to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability, establishing a solid foundation for the future of encrypted assets in the European Union.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Solana (SOL) has experienced a positive trend reversal and has shown no signs of weakening in both short- and long-term time horizons.</em></li>



<li><em>Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (dApps), known for its fast transaction speeds and unique consensus technique called Proof-of-History.</em></li>



<li><em>While SOL&#8217;s trading volume has decreased, its current bullish effect is still evident, with the price holding steady at $22 after bouncing off the $20 resistance.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The price of Solana (SOL) broke out from short-term resistance, showing that the price has initiated a positive trend reversal.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768-1024x538.png" alt="image 768" class="wp-image-202196" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768-1536x806.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Solana Is Now Out Of Bear Price Zone, Next Target Will Be $26.5 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>Since its June 10 low, the SOL price has been on a rip and shows no indications of weakening in either the long- or short-term time horizons.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/200894-solana-has-managed-to-regain-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a> is a high-performance blockchain platform designed to handle decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects while minimizing latency and security risks. Solana&#8217;s protocol employs a novel Proof-of-History consensus technique in addition to the more classic Proof-of-Stake model, allowing it to execute transactions at breakneck rates that few other blockchains can match.</p>



<p>As a result, after events related to FTX or FUD from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, SOL is still the token in the top 10 coins with the largest capitalization in the crypto market at the moment.</p>



<p>Solana&#8217;s trading volume has <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decreased</a> relative to yesterday at $357,068,860. However, the current bullish effect is still evident. SOL is holding steady at $22 after bouncing off the $20 resistance.</p>



<p>One thing to note is that the 61.8% Fib level at $21.2 is also one of the psychological extremes that SOL has crossed, showing that the bulls are quite strong at the moment.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="623" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767-1024x623.png" alt="image 767" class="wp-image-202193" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767-1024x623.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767-300x183.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767-768x467.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767-1536x934.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767-2048x1246.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767-750x456.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-767-1140x694.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Solana Is Now Out Of Bear Price Zone, Next Target Will Be $26.5 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SOL price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While Solana has made a relatively steady upward wave from its low in early June, investors still need to watch for more good signals to join.</p>



<p>Of course, selling now is a relatively risky option, as Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum doesn&#8217;t show much, but altcoins are on the cusp of a recovery, signaling a possible uptrend.</p>



<p>The area we should consider could be the $20 support or the nearest psychological contention between the bulls and the bears at $21.2. This can be the optimal choice for short-term trades.</p>



<p>Potentially, the Fib %78.6 area at $23.4 is the nearest resistance, if SOL crosses this mark, our next target is $26.5.</p>

<p>The native token of the Ethereum scaling network has shown a 12% increase in July as of Tuesday afternoon, while Bitcoin remained flat and Ether saw a decline of 3.2%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies tied to layer-2 solutions Arbitrum and Optimism saw respective declines of 3.5% and 8.9% over the same period.</p>



<p>Industry experts speculate that MATIC’s comparatively strong performance could be attributed to a major network update, <a href="https://polygon.technology/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon 2.0</a>. This major upgrade, which is labeled as a “vision for unlimited scalability and unified liquidity, powered by Zero-Knowledge technology,” per the&nbsp;<a href="https://polygon.technology/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project’s roadmap</a>, is the most relevant technical announcement in the industry at the moment. FalconX research note&#8217;s head of research, David Lawant, stated that “We expect MATIC to keep closing its gap versus peers as more details of the upgrade roadmap become more apparent to the market.”</p>

<p>Polygon Labs collaborated with developers, researchers, node operators, validators and other stakeholders to establish the upgrade roadmap, which is expected to be implemented in several phases. The first phase is geared towards establishing what’s dubbed a “value layer,” which mirrors how the “<a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-2-0-the-value-layer-of-the-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rest of the internet operates</a>.” Other architectural overhauls, including a&nbsp;validium, are intended to reduce costs and boost transaction throughput. There are also plans to revamp tokenomics and governance processes.</p>

<p>Despite MATIC&#8217;s recent gains, it still has a ways to catch up as it is down 3.2% over the year to date, underperforming against BTC, ETH, ARB, and Solana, all of which are up more than a third. However, with the beginning of the implementation of Polygon 2.0, MATIC could potentially catch up to its peers and become a leading cryptocurrency in the market.</p>
