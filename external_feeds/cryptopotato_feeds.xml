            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has exhibited significant volatility recently, surpassing its previous minor swing high while simultaneously encountering substantial rejection. Nonetheless, the price is approaching a crucial area, with the overall price action signalling a bearish outlook.</p>
<h1>Technical Analysis</h1>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>A thorough analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s daily chart reveals the formation of an evident bearish double-top pattern near the major resistance region of $30K. Additionally, the price is facing significant dynamic resistance from the middle-trendline of the ascending channel. It is worth noting that this robust dynamic level has been hindering further price appreciation for several months.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a noticeable divergence between the price and the RSI indicator indicates a shift in the market condition from an uptrend state to a possible downtrend. In case the selling pressure dominates the market, Bitcoin&#8217;s next target would be the 100-day moving average situated around the $28K level.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it seems likely that a rejection from the substantial resistance at $30K is imminent based on Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price action.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261009" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261009" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261009 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_1707231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261009" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>The 4-hour chart demonstrates that Bitcoin&#8217;s price has entered an extended consolidation range following its arrival at the important price zone of $30K. Notably, this critical price range aligns with Bitcoin&#8217;s previous significant swing high, developed on April 14th, which has served as strong resistance due to increased supply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the price has formed an ascending wedge pattern, typically indicating a potential reversal. Most recently, the price experienced a sharp surge, reaching the upper boundary of the wedge, only to face rejection and undergo a rapid decline. However, a break below the lower edge of the wedge suggests the possibility of a mid-term reversal.</p>
<p>Ultimately, in the event of a rejection, Bitcoin&#8217;s next target would be the static support region around $28K.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been volatile, especially after a significant upward surge that brought it close to the crucial resistance level of $30K. This surge has sparked substantial speculation regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to successfully break through this resistance barrier. It is advisable to closely examine the futures market to gain valuable insights into the overall market sentiment.</p>
<p>The provided chart illustrates the Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio, which serves as an essential indicator of the intensity of long and short positions.</p>
<p>Lately, this particular metric has been fluctuating consistently below 1, following a sharp decline. However, there have been no signs of recovery thus far. This signifies that futures traders predominantly maintain a pessimistic outlook on Bitcoin, with their short positions potentially pushing downward pressure on the price in the short term.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the crypto market has exhibited significant volatility, with major coins like XRP and Stellar Lumens first seeing large gains, then experiencing sharp pullbacks.</p>
<p>This volatility has yet to impact the progress of the crypto analytics project yPredict, which is currently in the midst of a highly-successful presale phase.</p>
<p>However, with attention back on the crypto market, projects new and old are benefiting from renewed investor interest – setting the stage for a fruitful few months ahead.</p>
<h2>Ripple Ruling Reenergizes $XRP &#8211; Although Momentum Stalls After Pullback</h2>
<p>XRP ($XRP) has been the talk of the crypto market over the past few days following some huge news regarding the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple – the company behind $XRP.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that Ripple had violated federal securities laws by offering $XRP in an unregistered securities sale.</p>
<p>As such, the SEC argued that $XRP was a security – a statement Ripple vehemently denied.</p>

<p>However, on July 13, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-says-sec-lawsuit-vs-ripple-labs-can-proceed-trial-some-claims-2023-07-13/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Ripple did not violate federal securities law, according to a ruling by US District Judge Analisa Torres.</p>
<p>This landmark legal victory sent the value of $XRP surging over 100%, although the token’s price has pulled back by 22% since the peak of the bullish surge.</p>
<p>While the SEC did win a partial victory concerning $XRP sales to institutional investors, the ruling was seen as a major boost for the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>Thus, with $XRP now trading around the $0.73 level, investors will be keeping a close eye on whether the token can reignite its upside momentum.</p>
<h2>Stellar Soars Then Settles as $XLM Bulls Stay Optimistic</h2>
<p>Stellar ($XLM) also saw its price surge after the favorable Ripple ruling – but this momentum has also cooled off recently.</p>
<p>On the day of the Ripple news, the price of $XLM spiked by 104% to $0.196 before giving back a significant portion of these gains over the weekend.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, $XLM is trading for around $0.126 – 35% lower than Thursday’s high.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261022" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Although $XLM has a different use case than $XRP, the two projects share common origins, and their prices have moved in tandem in the past.</p>
<p>The initial $XLM price spike was driven by the fact that the positive Ripple ruling boded well for the broader crypto market in terms of resolving regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>However, profit-taking has kicked in, bringing $XLM back from its temporary high.</p>
<p>The good news for $XLM bulls is the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stellar" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a> sentiment analysis reveals more than 80% of users are feeling good about the token’s prospects – highlighting there is still plenty of optimism behind Stellar.</p>
<h2>Which New Crypto Projects Are Benefiting from the Market Momentum?</h2>
<p>The surge in $XRP and $XLM has revitalized confidence throughout the entire crypto sector.</p>
<p>This belief has spilled over to new projects like yPredict – an AI-powered crypto analytics platform in the midst of a highly-successful presale phase.</p>
<h2>Presale Project yPredict Pioneers AI-Powered Crypto Insights &amp; SEO Solutions</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_e65e4a9b.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=xrp-price-stellar-lumens-price-rally-cools-off-but-ypredict-is-rising" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">yPredict ($YPRED)</a> is an emerging crypto project riding the wave of positive market sentiment.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Analysts at IntoTheBlock said a large part of the unmoved assets might be coins lost forever.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain data examined by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has revealed that roughly 29% of all bitcoins (BTC) in circulation have remained unmoved for more than five years.</p>
<p>In a Monday tweet, analysts at the firm <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1680834832601939968" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a> a large part of the unmoved assets might be lost coins.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ever wondered how many Bitcoins are lost forever? Our data shows that 29% of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$BTC</a> hasn&#8217;t moved in over 5 years. It&#8217;s possible that a large part of this concerns lost coins. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a></p>
<p>— IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1680834832601939968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>29% of BTC Lost?</h2>
<p>IntoTheBlock&#8217;s latest analysis echoes a recent report from crypto exchange Bitfinex, which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/new-ath-bitcoins-unmoved-supply-peaks-amid-institutional-interest-bitfinex-report/?amp" data-wpel-link="internal">disclosed</a> that the amount of unmoved BTC has reached a new all-time high, leading to a decrease in the asset&#8217;s liquidity.</p>
<p>Bitfinex also reported that approximately 70% of BTC&#8217;s circulating supply has remained dormant for at least a year; this is the highest ever recorded since the inception of the leading crypto asset.</p>
<p>While there is no specific reason for the current and prolonged dormancy of a significant portion of BTC, several factors are considered to have led to the development.</p>
<p>As IntoTheBlock&#8217;s analysts speculated, most of the coins could be lost forever. On the other hand, it could be a sign of growing interest from investors, especially institutions, who have a bullish sentiment toward Bitcoin and believe in the asset&#8217;s long-term potential.</p>
<p>The HODLing attitude from both large and institutional investors indicates an expectation of positive price action for BTC, showing that they consider the crypto asset a viable investment option.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Upcoming Halving Event</h2>
<p>Another factor to consider is the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-halving-effect-on-assets-behavior-still-unclear-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">upcoming</a> Bitcoin halving event slated for April 2024. Every four years, at 210,000 blocks, a mechanism in the Bitcoin network slashes the block reward for BTC mining by half. Bitcoin&#8217;s fourth halving will reduce block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.</p>
<p>The event is viewed as a bullish sign because it enhances BTC&#8217;s prospective scarcity, supports its supply-demand dynamics, and affects its value positively.</p>
<p>As the halving approaches, crypto funds and investment firms are accumulating BTC at its current price level, increasing their holdings, and positioning themselves for positive price action.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meme coin market has exploded in popularity in the past two months – and Wall Street Memes ($WSM) has emerged as one of the most talked-about projects in the space.</p>
<p>This community-centric meme token has already raised over $15m in its presale phase, highlighting the huge level of demand from retail investors.</p>
<p>With this demand showing no signs of slowing down, some are wondering if <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-coin-wall-street-memes-hits-15m-in-presale-is-it-the-next-pepe" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> could follow in the footsteps of Pepe ($PEPE) and replicate its massive returns.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Team Leverages Industry Expertise to Launch $WSM</h2>
<p>Since launching its presale phase at the end of May, Wall Street Memes has swiftly turned heads in the meme coin market.</p>
<p>Raising over $15 million in its presale, the project’s successful launch showcases the substantial community backing already in place.</p>
<p>Despite entering a saturated meme coin market, where hundreds of new tokens are launched each week, $WSM has emerged as a promising contender to become the next $PEPE.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260983" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Importantly, Wall Street Memes is being developed by the creators of the red-hot <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Bulls NFT collection</a> – which sold out in just 32 minutes in 2021.</p>
<p>Now, the creators are leveraging their expertise and understanding of the digital assets space to launch $WSM, allowing holders to gain financial exposure to the growth of the Wall Street Memes brand.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes&#8217; presale is currently in Stage 23 out of 30, with $WSM tokens on offer for just $0.0316.</p>
<p>This stage-based setup means the $WSM price will increase between stages – incentivizing would-be investors to act swiftly to obtain the lowest entry point.</p>
<h2>Hyped Community &amp; Planned Exchange Listings Fuel $WSM Demand</h2>
<p>One key factor driving demand for $WSM is the project&#8217;s already-established community of &#8220;degens.&#8221;</p>
<p>This community comprises over 1.1 million people, spread across several social media platforms.</p>
<p>For example, Wall Street Memes’ <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a> has 253,000 followers, while the official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallstbets/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Instagram page</a> boasts an audience of 534,000.</p>
<p>This backing has helped the Wall Street Memes&#8217; presale become an instant hit, with over $300,000 being invested daily.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260984" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="329" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Considering the hype around $WSM, some suspect it could be a promising prospect for major crypto exchanges, including Binance.</p>
<p>Although this is currently just speculation, <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-coin-wall-street-memes-hits-15m-in-presale-is-it-the-next-pepe" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes&#8217;</a> team has revealed that $WSM will be listed on CEXs and DEXs once the presale concludes – although the names of these exchanges are still under wraps.</p>
<p>Given that 50% of the total $WSM is being reserved for presale investors, it’s clear that early supporters are being given a significant stake in the project’s future.</p>
<p>This distribution strategy not only reinforces the community-centric approach of the creators, but also indicates their confidence in $WSM&#8217;s potential success following exchange listings.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes’ Ambitious Roadmap Attracts Influencer Attention</h2>
<p>As part of Wall Street Memes’ marketing strategy, the team has launched an airdrop campaign for presale supporters.</p>
<p>This campaign will see a whopping $50,000 worth of $WSM split between five lucky winners.</p>
<p>To enter the draw, interested parties must join the official Wall Street Memes <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4E538pzeGX" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> and carry out several straightforward tasks related to the project’s social media channels.</p>
<p>Alongside this airdrop campaign, Wall Street Memes’ team has laid out an impressive roadmap in the project’s <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260985" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="188" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14-300x94.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14-50x16.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This roadmap details plans for high-profile influencer partnerships, global awareness campaigns, and an exclusive “gated community” for $WSM holders.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the developers even aim to reach a $1 billion market cap with $WSM in the future.</p>
<p>Although this goal may seem ambitious, Wall Street Memes’ early presale success and expert team suggest it has the potential to join the top tier of meme coins.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is already making progress towards wider recognition, attracting the attention of prominent influencers.</p>
<p>On July 12, YouTuber Michael Wrubel uploaded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZFYPQGqKog&amp;ab_channel=MichaelWrubel" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a> to his 310,000 subscribers, expressing his optimism for $WSM and highlighting that he had invested in the presale.</p>
<p>With significant interest already on display, Wall Street Memes has all the ingredients to become a major player in the meme coin space.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Solana doubled in price since June, and it seems it wants to go much higher.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $26</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $33</strong></p>
<h2>Uptrend Intact</h2>
<p>The impressive performance by Solana continued in July, and a major breakout took place last Friday when the price moved above $26 and almost reached $33, which is the current resistance. SOL has turned the $26 level into support, and so long as this level holds, this cryptocurrency has a clear path higher.</p>

<h2>Buying Volume Exploded</h2>
<p>Last week&#8217;s buy pressure exceeded any expectation with levels not seen since the start of 2023. This impressive interest from buyers rapidly translated into a higher price. The volume has decreased somewhat compared to last week, but buyers continue to be present.</p>
<figure id="attachment_260956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260956" style="width: 1826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-260956" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43.png" alt="SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43" width="1826" height="845" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43.png 1826w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-1024x474.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-768x355.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-1536x711.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-50x23.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1826px) 100vw, 1826px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-260956" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. RSI is Overbought</h2>
<p>The daily RSI is giving a clear signal that Solana may have reached a local top right now after hitting 82 points. This means a pullback is likely on lower timeframes, and buyers have to do their best to stop sellers at the key support.</p>
<figure id="attachment_260957" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260957" style="width: 1826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-260957" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05.png" alt="SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05" width="1826" height="902" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05.png 1826w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-1024x506.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-768x379.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-1536x759.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1826px) 100vw, 1826px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-260957" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SOL is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SOL Price</h2>
<p>The price action remains bullish for Solana, and momentum is favoring buyers. Nevertheless, a short-lived pullback could take place before the price attempts to break the key resistance at $33. If, for any reason, the support at $26 fails, then the pullback may last longer than initially expected.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Now that the court has partly cleared Ripple’s name, the company behind XRP is expecting business to pick up.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple that had been raging for 3 years was finally settled, at least partially.</p>
<p>Although Judge Analisa Torres ruled that some primary sales of XRP should have been registered as securities offerings, the secondary sale of the asset does not count as unlicensed securities.</p>
<h2>Open for Business Again</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">case</a> may yet go to trial, and financial penalties for the primary sales of XRP may still occur. However, the ruling cleared Ripple’s name as far as using XRP to facilitate money transfers, which in the past not only made potential customers cautious against engaging with the company – it also lost them its biggest customer, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-and-moneygram-part-ways-amid-sec-litigation-while-xrp-eyes-0-50/" data-wpel-link="internal">Moneygram</a>.</p>
<p>Brad Garlinghouse – Ripple’s CEO – previously stated that the court’s decision will allow the firm to pursue new moneymaking avenues again.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse says that a federal court&#8217;s decision means that its crypto token XRP “is not a security,” giving the digital-payments company more freedom to pursue various business opportunities <a href="https://t.co/lpNFuakr6K" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/lpNFuakr6K</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZKmb1nt4Ac" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ZKmb1nt4Ac</a></p>
<p>— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1679931605165694977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Furthermore, Garlinghouse believes the outcome of this landmark case will be beneficial for the entire industry, not just Ripple.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the SEC, it is really an overreach to suggest, as the Chair has said many times, that basically, everything in the crypto space is a security. Well, you now have a judge who is very clearly saying that is just not true and very clearly saying XRP is not a security on exchanges and all these different use cases, which I think helps the whole industry, for sure.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Ripple to Explore Deals Regarding Cross-Border Transactions</h2>
<p>Now that the dust has settled, Stu Alderoty, Ripple’s general counsel, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the company will begin talks with new potential clients starting in the third quarter, which is only 2 weeks away.</p>
<p>According to Alderoty, Ripple will seek to enter deals with firms in the American banking sector. Chief among target customers are banks and payment processors who do business abroad, as Ripple’s XRP token eliminates the need for pre-funded banks on the receiving end.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think we’re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business. […] Hopefully, this quarter will generate a lot of conversations in the United States with customers, and hopefully some of those conversations will actually turn into real business.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although most of Ripple’s revenue is reportedly generated outside of the U.S., this was more a matter of necessity due to the legal troubles. Now that those have largely been done away with, Ripple is looking to pivot strongly towards U.S. business partners yet again.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The pricing structure for .eth domains on Unstoppable will remain consistent with that of the ENS website with optional add-on services such as the Vault feature and auto-renewal. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web3 domain provider Unstoppable Domains is extending support to .eth domains enabling users to purchase via the official website. Unstoppable Domains typically offer domain endings such as .crypto, .blockchain, .nft, etc, while the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the only place Ethereum enthusiasts have been able to purchase the .eth domain names.</p>
<p>The addition of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) based .eth domains to the Unstoppable website aligns with its broader plans to become the first &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for Web3 domains with support for all leading naming systems and blockchains.</p>
<h2>Unstoppable Domains&#8217; New Functionality</h2>
<p>According to the official press release shared with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the launch will allow anyone to natively buy .eth domains via Unstoppable for the first time. New functionalities such as will be incorporated to attract and engage a fresh audience to .eth.</p>
<p>For one, users can access the optional Unstoppable Vault &#8211; Domain Vault &#8211; to secure their .eth or other Web3 domains within a private vault managed by Unstoppable. This feature enables users to acquire .eth domains without the immediate need to connect them to a crypto wallet.</p>
<p>Besides offering an added layer of security, the domains stored in the vault are entirely owned by the users themselves and not by Unstoppable, which can be easily transferred to a self-custodial wallet whenever desired.</p>
<p>To address the challenge of remembering on-chain Ethereum renewals and preventing the accidental loss of .eth domains, Unstoppable will also introduce an optional auto-renewal feature specifically for .eth domains. This functionality will let users choose the duration of renewal, with each auto-renewal priced at $4 per renewal period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform will also offer new options for buying.eth domains, including credit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay, along with Bitcoin and 11 other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In an exclusive statement, Unstoppable Domains&#8217; COO Sandy Carter said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The ultimate mission of Unstoppable Domain is to become the first universal “one-stop shop” for every user’s web3 domain and digital identity-related needs. To achieve this goal, we are constantly striving to offer support for all leading naming systems and blockchains, and the recent addition of .eth functionality was a big step in this direction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a bid to ensure no naming collisions, every .eth domain acquired from Unstoppable&#8217;s website will be registered through the ENS smart contract with the same full functionality as other .eth domains.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Unstoppable domains will enable users to manage .eth domains, including setting crypto addresses, managing on-chain profile data, and transferring .eth domains.</p>
<p>The development comes more than a year after the platform <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/web3-registrar-unstoppable-domains-secures-65-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> closing $65 million in Series A funding, making it a unicorn. The capital infusion was said to have been deployed to fuel product innovation and forge partnerships in the Web3 space.</p>
<h2>Addressing Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite being a novel technological advancement, the Web3 domain sector initially faced a lack of adoption. While the tides are indeed turning, challenges still persist.</p>
<p>To that extent, Carter believes that blockchain-based platforms still require a higher tech acumen than major centralized services, intentionally designed to be as accessible as possible even as the former offers countless innovative features that were &#8220;simply untenable&#8221; just a few years ago.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To address these issues, Unstoppable Domains and other web3-native companies focus on making the web3 ecosystem user-friendly and easy to understand, allowing users to easily navigate web3 via decentralized domains and self-owned digital identities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
