			            <description><![CDATA[Hong Kong’s security watchdog wants to limit retail investors to a few whitelisted crypto tokens.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Regulators in Hong Kong will soon decide which crypto tokens its citizens can invest in amid a raft of new digital asset policies coming this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The move is the latest crypto regulatory step taken by Hong Kong in a market that has a long association with significant digital asset trading volume.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Hong Kong to Issue Consultation Paper</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is preparing a list of crypto assets open to retail traders, Reuters<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hong-kong-set-shortlist-crypto-tokens-retail-trading-2023-01-11/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"> reported</a> on Wednesday. The SFC’s new CEO, Julia Leung Fung-yee, said these whitelisted crypto tokens will be highly liquid ones deemed safe enough for non-professional investors. Leung made these comments during a panel session at the Asian Financial Forum held in Hong Kong on Jan. 11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Some virtual assets platforms have over 2,000 products, but we do not plan to allow retail investors to trade in all of them,” Leung<a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3206435/virtual-assets-hong-kong-retail-investors-will-only-have-access-highly-liquid-products-sfcs-new-boss" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"> stated</a>, adding, “We will set the criteria that would allow retail investors to [only] trade in major virtual assets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Apart from the list of approved tokens, Leung added that the SFC will liaise with the public on regulations for retail crypto trading. The approved list is part of a broader crypto regulatory push that will include the publishing of a consultation paper before the end of Q1 2023. This regulatory push will also contain new licensing protocols for crypto exchanges and other virtual asset service providers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Leung, the goal is investor protection. The regulatory chief noted the massive price decline occasioned by the current bear winter. CryptoPotato previously<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hong-kong-investors-lost-50m-from-crypto-scams-in-2022-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"> reported</a> that investors in Hong Kong lost $50 million to crypto scams as of August 2022.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Asia Could Reignite Crypto Bull Run</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The planned regulations for retail participants are the latest positive crypto development to come out of Hong Kong. Stakeholders in the city-state have long since<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hong-kong-intends-to-become-a-crypto-hub-could-that-trigger-next-bull-run/" data-wpel-link="internal"> stated</a> the goal of making it to be a crypto hub in the next bull run.</p>
<p dir="ltr">BitMEX Co-founder Arthur Hayes noted in October 2022 that the bull market will return when China and Hong Kong “love crypto.” At the time, Hong Kong finance officials were posturing to reclaim the city’s previous crypto-friendly stance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A series of stringent crypto measures over the past two years did dampen enthusiasm for the asset class in Hong Kong. This led to the likes of Thailand and Singapore becoming home to several crypto projects and leading the charge for adoption in Asia.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The miner produced only 147 BTC in December, compared to 198 BTC in November, because of the snow blizzard that hit Texas.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The bitcoin mining giant &#8211; Argo Blockchain &#8211; mined 147 BTC in December, roughly 25% less than the production levels registered in November.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The main reason for the decrease was a massive winter storm that hit the US last month and negatively affected the company&#8217;s Helios facility in Dickens County, Texas.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Cyclone&#8217;s Effect</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The severe snow blizzard that impacted much of the States around Christmas <a href="https://argoblockchain.com/news-room/2022-december-operational-update" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">prompted</a> Argo Blockchain to join other Texas BTC miners in reducing electricity usage. With a diminished production power, the firm mined 147 bitcoin (worth approximately $2.6 million at current prices), compared to the 198 bitcoin in November. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;While our mining results for December were lower than anticipated, the primary driver was the winter storm which led us to curtail operations at Helios. We made this decision in order to not only reduce power usage on the grid, but also to prioritize the needs of the local community and safety of our Helios employees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After the winter storm and associated freezing temperatures had subsided, we safely brought Helios back online and resumed operations,&#8221; CEO Peter Wall stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Lone Star State, which rarely experiences cold weather, saw temperatures falling below freezing around the Christmas holidays. The local power grid struggled to cope with the challenge, and the US Department of Energy declared an energy emergency in the region. The climate stabilized in the following days, meaning that domestic BTC miners could restore their previous production capacity.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Argo Blockchain further revealed that it held 141 BTC as of the end of December 2022, its total debt stood at nearly $80 million, while its bank balance totaled around $20 million.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Deal With Galaxy Digital</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The miner recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/argo-blockchain-agrees-to-sell-helium-facility-to-galaxy-digital-for-65m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">agreed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to sell its Helios facility to the investment management firm &#8211; Galaxy Digital &#8211; for $65 million. This allowed Argo to decrease its overall debts and avoid filing for bankruptcy protection. Speaking on the acquisition, Wall said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;These agreements with Galaxy mark the beginning of a new chapter for Argo. We built a world-class mining facility at Helios, and I believe that Galaxy has the right team and resources to build upon the foundation that Argo established.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mike Novogratz &#8211; the CEO of Galaxy Digital &#8211; previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/helios-is-a-transformative-acquisition-for-galaxy-digital-says-novogratz/" data-wpel-link="internal">described</a> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the Helios agreement as a &#8220;transformative acquisition&#8221; for his organization. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We are long-term believers in BTC and expect the lowest-cost miners to win over time,&#8221; he added.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price volatility at historic lows poses some interesting questions. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin price has taken a battering over the past year. But at the same time, its volatility is at a historic low. Will BTC critics finally admit it&#8217;s a currency yet?</p>
<p>Crypto markets are making a rebound in January, but there&#8217;s no certainty as to whether the bottom is in. Nearly all the major cryptocurrencies are up by double digits on the seven-day chart.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dominance-at-2-month-high-as-btc-stands-firm-above-20k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">soared</a> over 20% to breach the $20,000 level.</p>
<h2>Crypto Markets Explode to Start 2023: BTC Surges 23%</h2>
<p>Crypto markets seem to be reacting favorably to the latest CPI report. The official U.S. inflation measure <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/consumer-prices-fell-0point1percent-in-december-in-line-with-economists-expectations.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">saw prices edge down</a> in December, calming global recession fears.</p>
<p>But the explosion of crypto prices has a long way to go before anyone can speak of a steady Bitcoin price recovery.</p>
<p>Still, one interesting aspect of this crypto winter is the freeze on Bitcoin price volatility. Even with a blowout crypto price rally, 24-hour Bitcoin price volatility has hardly notched upward.</p>
<p>While a recent report appearing in Yahoo Finance <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/bitcoins-volatility-smile-shows-increased-105939145.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">speaks of</a> Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8220;volatility smile,&#8221; the reader should be advised: The volatility smile article refers to crypto derivatives, Bitcoin put and call futures options.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price volatility itself has no wry smile on the charts going into this mid-January weekend. The price remains very stable with a smooth arc as the original gangster crypto trades upward.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Volatility is at a Long-Running Historic Low</h2>
<p>Over the long term, Bitcoin volatility has remained very stable at a historic downtrend for over a year. Some pros of volatility are that it often goes with an extended bull run, skilled crypto traders can make profits from it, and that incentivizes liquidity and attracts more capital to crypto.</p>
<p>So volatility is not all bad. However, on the con side, Bitcoin&#8217;s critics <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/investing/davos-central-bank-digital-currencies-crypto/index.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">say it&#8217;s not</a> a currency because of its volatility. They argue that it can&#8217;t be used as a medium of exchange if it&#8217;s worth substantially more or less in the afternoon than it is in the morning.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s starting to change, it would seem. Bitcoin price is stabilizing even as it spends some months seeking where to consolidate.</p>
<p>So since the volatility is steadily declining, does that make BTC a currency yet? All the anti-Bitcoin people at Davos or on CNBC keep saying it&#8217;s not a currency because it&#8217;s too volatile. Who would buy coffee with it?</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s achieving greater daily price stability at a greater scale than ever before. Will any of the naysayers admit that it might shape up to be your household&#8217;s daily driver someday? What if it does one of these years before 2030? Will they admit it then (maybe even use it to grab their morning joe)?</p>
<p>This is an opportune time for the question: Is Bitcoin a currency yet?</p>
<p>Because when Bitcoin is in a bull market, its critics say it is too volatile to be a currency. When it is in a bear market, they say it is no inflation hedge. Which one is it to spare the logicians from crypto critics still having their cake and eating it too?</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Harrison also said he is launching a new crypto business, and Scaramucci will invest in it. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brett Harrison, who stepped down from his role as President of the US branch of FTX just weeks before the implosion, finally broke the silence and shed some more light on his relationship with SBF.</p>
<p>He added that neither he nor any of the other execs at FTX US knew about the fraud that SBF and his closest partners were perpetrating in the Bahamas.</p>
<h2>It Took Only a Few Months</h2>
<p>Harrison explained that he knew Sam Bankman-Fried from his days at Jane Street and had &#8220;fond memories&#8221; of him. Harrison described SBF as a &#8220;conscientious junior trader&#8221; as well as a &#8220;sensitive and intellectually curious person who cared about animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>SBF asked him to join FTX US as President in March 2021, and the first few months were &#8220;wonderful.&#8221; He said he worked on expanding the team and was &#8220;largely independently of Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things started to change six months after he joined the firm as he wanted to establish FTX US as a separate brand and company from FTX.com. However, SBF disagreed and didn&#8217;t react well when someone questioned him.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">16/49 I saw in that early conflict his total insecurity and intransigence when his decisions were questioned, his spitefulness, and the volatility of his temperament. I realized he wasn’t who I remembered.</p>
<p>— Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614371378144374787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">January 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The arguments between the two continued in the following months, and Harrison noted that Bankman-Fried often responded with &#8220;dysregulated hostility, at times with gaslighting and manipulation.&#8221; This pushed Harrison into submitting a formal, written complaint about the organizational issues he saw in the company. That, though, didn&#8217;t go well either.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">29/49 In response, I was threatened on Sam’s behalf that I would be fired and that Sam would destroy my professional reputation. I was instructed to formally retract what I’d written and to deliver an apology to Sam that had been drafted for me.</p>
<p>— Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614373852187869184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">January 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Leaving and Starting a New Crypto Business</h2>
<p>After that communication from SBF and his team, Harrison said he had made his decision to leave, which took a few months to organize. He finally <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-us-president-brett-harrison-steps-down/" data-wpel-link="internal">left</a> the exchange in September 2022, just a few weeks before the SBF-led empire <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">crumbled.</a></p>
<p>The former FTX US President is <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/scaramucci-invests-in-crypto-firm-set-up-by-former-ftx-us-head-1.1870107#:~:text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20Anthony%20Scaramucci%20said,he%20said%20in%20an%20email." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reportedly</a> preparing to launch a crypto software company, allowing traders to write different algorithms for their strategies.</p>
<p>SkyBridge Capital&#8217;s Anthony Scaramucci, who recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/skybridge-capital-to-buy-back-the-stake-it-sold-to-ftx-says-scaramucci/" data-wpel-link="internal">said</a> he wants to repurchase the company stake he had sold to FTX last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/Scaramucci/status/1614397188091817984" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">commented</a> under Harrison&#8217;s threat that he will invest in the latter&#8217;s new start-up.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Anthony has been a true mentor and friend to me since I joined the crypto industry two years ago. I’m honored to have him as an investment partner, and know his guidance will be invaluable as I begin this new chapter.” &#8211; Harrison told Bloomberg.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[BNB Chain lost over $750 million to hackers in 2022, making it the biggest victim of blockchain attacks last year.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">2022 was indeed a challenging year for the crypto industry, marked by significant declines in the value of major assets, liquidity issues for many firms, and an unfortunate number of bankruptcy filings. The industry also faced substantial security threats as hackers stole billions of dollars from users and DeFi protocols.</p>
<p class="p2">A <a href="https://www.slowmist.com/report/2022-Blockchain-Security-and-AML-Analysis-Annual-Report(EN).pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">report</span></a> by blockchain security firm SlowMist, titled &#8220;Blockchain Security and AML Analysis,&#8221; provided an overview of the security status of various sectors within the crypto industry, analyzing the flow of stolen funds in more than 300 hacks that occurred in 2022.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Hackers Stole Over $3.7B in 2022</b></h2>
<p class="p2">According to the document, 303 blockchain-related security incidents happened last year, resulting in losses of an estimated $3.7 billion (calculated at the market price at the time of the exploit).</p>
<p class="p2">The amount lost represents a 61% drop from the $9.795 billion lost in 2021, although SlowMist did not consider the value lost due to market volatility.</p>
<p class="p2">The report revealed that about 255 security incidents affected various ecosystems, including DeFi, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hackers-have-drained-1-4-billion-worth-of-crypto-since-the-beginning-of-2022-research/" data-wpel-link="internal">cross-chain bridges</a>, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Additionally, there were ten security incidents involving crypto exchanges, 11 attacking public chains, six exploiting wallets, and 21 of other types.</p>
<p class="p2">The <span class="s1">DeFi</span> ecosystem <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/defi-under-attack-1-5b-stolen-in-top-5-crypto-heists-of-2022-forbes/" data-wpel-link="internal">lost</a> $2.075 billion to hackers, approximately 55% of the total losses for the year, while cross-chain bridges recorded $1.212 billion of stolen funds, about 32% of the entire amount during the year.</p>
<p class="p2">Per the paper, there were 56 security incidents reported in the NFT space, resulting in losses totaling over $65.44 million.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Many of these incidents were caused by phishing attacks, accounting for about 39% (22 incidents), followed by Rug Pulls, accounting for about 21% (12 incidents). The remaining 30% (17 incidents) were caused by contract vulnerabilities or other internal factors,&#8221; the report stated.</p>

<h2 class="p3"><b>BNB Chain – The Biggest Hack Victim in 2022</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The report shows that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-smart-chain-paused-following-600-million-bnb-hack-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">BNB Chain</span></a> (formerly known as Binance Smart Chain &#8211; BSC) was the biggest victim of blockchain security incidents last year. The blockchain experienced 79 attacks, resulting in losses of up to $785 million.</p>
<p class="p2">The research found that blockchain mixers gained popularity last year, with them being the favorite tool for hackers to launder their ill-gotten proceeds. Per the report, 1,233,129 ETH (approx. $2.83 billion) was deposited to the now-sanctioned crypto mixer <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-tornado-cashs-activity-didnt-cease-completely-post-ofac-sanctions/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">Tornado Cash</span></a>, while 40,065 BTC was deposited to ChipMixer in 2022.</p>
<p class="p2">The report also revealed that some industry projects have started implementing effective measures for blockchain anti-money laundering to prevent attackers from profiting from their crimes.</p>
<p class="p2">Stablecoin issuers <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-and-centre-blacklist-40-addresses-in-total-worth-over-46m/" data-wpel-link="internal">Tether</a> and Circle blocked 376 addresses in 2022 to prevent funds in the wallets from being moved out by attackers.</p>
<p class="p2">Meanwhile, while crypto theft exceeded $3.7 billion in 2022, another report <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/illicit-crypto-transactions-in-2022-surpassed-20-billion-for-the-first-time-chainalysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed </a>that illicit crypto transactions reached a record high of $20 billion during the same period.<strong> </strong></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Despite sliding slightly since yesterday, bitcoin continues to trade above $20,000.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance has recovered more than 2% in the past week or so and tapped a multi-month high as the asset maintains above $20,000.</p>
<p>This comes even though the altcoins experienced notable gains yesterday, but many have retraced hard today.</p>
<h2>BTC Dominance Above 41%</h2>
<p>Ever since bitcoin finally broke above $17,000 at the start of this week, the landscape around the asset has seemed significantly more bullish than it was at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The past few days saw gains that the community hadn&#8217;t witnessed in months. The cryptocurrency first spiked above $18,000, overcame $19,000, and came close to $20,000 on Friday evening. The bulls initiated another <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/600m-shorts-liquidated-as-bitcoin-skyrockets-to-21k/" data-wpel-link="internal">leg up</a> in the following hours that brought BTC to $21,250 (on Bitstamp).</p>
<p>This became its highest price tag in over two months and meant that bitcoin has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-fully-recovers-from-ftx-crash-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">recovered</a> all losses from the FTX-Alameda fiasco. Despite losing some ground since that local peak, BTC still trades above $20,000, and its market capitalization is close to $400 billion amid ongoing <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-yearly-start-may-signal-an-incoming-bull-market-glassnode/" data-wpel-link="internal">speculations</a> about the start of a new bull run.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance over the altcoins is also on the rise. The metric had fallen to 39% last week but has pumped to over 41% as of now for the first time since November 8.</p>

<h2>Alts Retrace Today</h2>
<p>The alternative coins charted notable gains yesterday, but most have turned red on a daily scale now. Solana was at the forefront of the rally, skyrocketing by 40% at one point. Thus, SOL painted a multi-month high of its own at above $23, but it&#8217;s currently below that level, following a 4.5% daily decline.</p>
<p>Binance Coin is down by a similar percentage and is just under $300. Ethereum has sustained above $1,500 even though it has retraced by 1.5%.</p>
<p>Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, Polygon, Polkadot, Litecoin, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche have lost the most value in a day by up to 7%.</p>
<p>The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has retraced to $970 billion on CMC, but it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-market-cap-taps-1-trillion-as-solana-polkadot-explode-double-digits/" data-wpel-link="internal">touched</a> $1 trillion yesterday on CoinGecko.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The MicroStrategy co-founder discusses where he sees bitcoin in the next eight years.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of American business intelligence firm <span class="s1">MicroStrategy</span>, has shared what he thinks will happen to bitcoin (BTC) in the next eight years while outlining how it will come into play.</p>
<p class="p2">In a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/Cgdwme_GhIw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">interview</span></a> with Cory Klippsten, the founder and CEO of Swan Bitcoin, Saylor noted that he sees bitcoin becoming a global store of value by 2031.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Institutional Adoption</b></h2>
<p class="p2">According to him, institutional adoption is one of the first drivers of the digital asset&#8217;s global store of value status in the coming years. The bitcoin proponent believes institutional adoption is possible through the &#8220;utterances&#8221; of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and decisions by traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p class="p2">Saylor mentioned some traditional financial institutions, such as <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-taps-coinbase-for-institutional-crypto-trading-and-custody-services/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">BlackRock</span></a> and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-to-offer-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trading-to-retail-investors/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">Fidelity</span></a>, that are beginning to embrace bitcoin in recent times due to its potential despite previously distancing themselves from the asset.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>The Explosion of Lightning Network</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The <span class="s1">MicroStrategy</span> co-founder also cited the explosive growth of the <span class="s1">Lightning Network</span> as another factor that will make the digital asset a global store of value.</p>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-lightning-network-beginners-guide/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">Lightning Network</span></a> is a layer-2 solution built on the bitcoin protocol to make transactions faster and cheaper. Interestingly, <span class="s1">MicroStrategy</span> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-to-introduce-bitcoin-lightning-applications-next-year/" data-wpel-link="internal">plans</a> to develop applications powered by the <span class="s1">Lightning Network</span> that could reach millions of users.</p>
<p class="p2">According to Saylor, developing &#8220;killer apps&#8221; like Lightning Wallets that move digital dollars and BTC and swaps in and out of local currency will create massive demand for the asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;I just describe this as in 1991, you had TCP IP, and we had the internet, but not many people used it. In 1994, you had the Netscape browser, and now that was the killer app for the internet, and pretty soon you had 100 million people download that browser and it caught fire,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Macroeconomic Headwinds</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The billionaire also noted that macroeconomic headwinds, such as the United States Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate hikes, are major factors that will help bitcoin achieve a global store of value status.</p>
<p class="p2">To tame inflation, the Fed raised the federal funds rate seven times in 2022, with more expected to happen this year. Saylor stated that inflation would increase once the Fed reduces its interest rate hikes which will be a marketing driver for the leading cryptocurrency.</p>
<p class="p2">According to the MicroStrategy executive chairman, the combination of these factors will &#8220;play out against the new reality: bitcoin is the only digital commodity, it is the only crypto asset, and there is no second best crypto asset.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Are Chinese crypto traders exploiting the Kimchi premium, or is it just free-market behavior?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a crypto study out of South Korea recently of Chinese Bitcoin arbitrage traders and Korea&#8217;s &#8220;kimchi premium&#8221; on Bitcoin prices. Its characterization of the cross-border Bitcoin trade and recommendations miss some key economic foundations.</p>
<p>A recently published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1544612322004056?via%3Dihub" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">crypto study</a> by Incheon National University and the Bank of Korea is making the rounds. The authors found a strong correlation between the &#8220;kimchi premium&#8221; and international remittances to China.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Kimchi Premium&#8217; Is The Persistently Higher Bitcoin Price in South Korea</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-kimchi-premium-and-why-it-exists-explained-14370162.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">kimchi premium</a> is the higher Bitcoin and crypto prices in South Korea. That&#8217;s because of the higher relative demand for Bitcoin within the Korean economy against fiat payments. It&#8217;s also a result of lower BTC supply.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s authors infer that Chinese arbitrage traders are selling Bitcoin to South Koreans. They suggest it is because the Chinese Bitcoin sellers are going after the kimchi premium. They&#8217;re selling it to South Korean crypto traders specifically to get a higher price.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s authors frame this as Chinese crypto traders taking advantage of Korean crypto traders. They call South Korea a &#8220;target&#8221; and say Chinese crypt traders are &#8220;exploiting excess demand.&#8221; Moreover, they also call for international standards of regulation of cryptocurrency to protect investors.</p>
<p>But Chinese crypto traders aren&#8217;t fleecing South Korean crypto traders. The South Korean Bitcoin buyers don&#8217;t mind being fleeced if that&#8217;s what it is. They are willing to pay higher prices to get ahold of more Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Chinese Are Serving the Higher Demand</h2>
<p>The study originated from the economics department of Incheon National. But the paper itself isn&#8217;t very economical. The author does not seem to consider the cross-border trade of bitcoin economically.</p>
<p>Higher prices specifically exist to attract more sellers. That&#8217;s how markets work to coordinate supply and demand. There isn&#8217;t as much Bitcoin in South Korea as people in the market for it there <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-to-re-enter-south-korea-by-acquiring-local-exchange-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">would like</a>.</p>
<p>So they are willing to pay a higher price to get more Bitcoin. That is a free market. It&#8217;s not exploitation. This is how prices distribute resources to where people want them most in the fair trade-offs we all make.</p>
<p>The Chinese traders getting the kimchi premium are responding to an incentive. Bitcoin buyers in Korea raise that incentive with their own money. They use the higher price they&#8217;re willing to pay as BTC bait.</p>
<p>Ironically, the paper calls for policy intervention. That&#8217;s ironic because it&#8217;s policy (<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/monitoring-crypto-whales-korean-regulators-with-new-legislation-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">strict Korean capital controls</a>) that creates the Bitcoin shortage in South Korea. That shortage of BTC is the cause of the kimchi premium.</p>
<p>A decrease in government controls on financial markets could be more apt to cut the premium. The mutually beneficial trade relationship between Chinese and Korean crypto traders is not exploitation. It&#8217;s economy.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[For as long as modern finance existed, there have been bank runs and insolvencies. The lesson in the Alameda-FTX bankruptcy is actually that government regulation is no good for crypto markets.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scale of the financial damage to crypto investors last year was colossal. Not just from FTX International going under but also the rest of them: Three Arrow Capital, Celsius, Genesis, Gemini, Voyager Digital, and BlockFi.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price still hasn&#8217;t recovered from the ongoing streak of crypto bankruptcies, although it deleted some of the losses from the FTX fiasco. Over crypto exchanges, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-bitcoin-price-winter-continue-in-2023-8-key-considerations/" data-wpel-link="internal">BTC kept taking steep discounts</a> all year. Every new bankruptcy headline plunged the Bitcoin price lower.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no telling whether the most recent Bitcoin price rally to $21K is a breakout or a January bull trap. Meanwhile, last year&#8217;s insolvencies continue to unravel in bankruptcy and criminal court.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy lawyers said Wednesday that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-locates-5-billion-in-assets-attorney-says-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX has found $5 billion</a> in liquid assets. While under house arrest on a $250 million bail bond, <a href="https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried began blogging</a> on Substack on Jan 12. He wrote in a post entitled &#8220;FTX Pre-Mortem Overview&#8221; that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In November 2022, an extreme, quick, targeted crash precipitated by the CEO of Binance made Alameda insolvent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the concluding point of SBF&#8217;s &#8220;post-mortem&#8221; is not that FTX didn&#8217;t have their customer&#8217;s money. It&#8217;s that a competitor&#8217;s CEO told the public that FTX didn&#8217;t have their customer&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried wasn&#8217;t some unregulated cowboy on the digital frontier. Satoshi Nakamoto was. SBF was, in fact, a political megadonor who nurtured cozy relations with the U.S. regulatory regime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the TradFi attitude toward finance that plagued crypto last year is exactly why we need crypto. Bitcoin is supposed to fix this. So are other open-source, peer-to-peer ledgers.</p>
<h2>How Wall Street TradFi Bros Ransacked The Buzz Surrounding Crypto</h2>
<p>At the close of the year, Bloomberg Businessweek published <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story-FTX-collapse-matt-levine/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">a sequel</a> to its Oct 2022 long-form presentation, &#8220;The Crypto Story.&#8221;</p>
<p>The follow-up piece was about Sam Bankman-Fried and the Alameda FTX foibles. The story is entitled &#8220;How Not To Play The Game.&#8221; The article deftly diagnoses the problem of TradFi imports to crypto:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You might find yourself building out a snazzy user interface and a fast, clever trading algorithm, because those are fun and profitable things to do, but you might find yourself neglecting the accounting department, because that&#8217;s boring. You might get really good at attracting customer money, with your snazzy interface and your sense of fun, but also really bad at keeping track of the customer money with your lack of accountants and your sense of fun.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Crypto is fundamentally a no-nonsense, hard-money, anti-Wall Street industry. But the TradFi bros turned it into Wall Street&#8217;s evil twin. They created a parallel crypto menagerie of financial shenanigans and accounting horrors:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One imperfect but useful way to think about crypto is that it allowed for the creation of a toy financial system. There was already a regular financial system, a set of abstractions and procedures&#8230; And then crypto came along with a new set of stuff to do finance to.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But the way veteran financial columnist Matt Levine describes it: Crypto needs <em>more</em> regulation. Where the article gets it wrong is leaving the influence of government out of the picture. Because the story does not address the influence of government regulation on the insolvency crises of the past year.</p>
<p>The way &#8220;How Not To Play The Game&#8221; tells it, the government was not at play in this game. But that is not exactly the case. The article itself advances some of the evidence against this characterization.</p>
<p>Because in it, the author tells about how &#8220;crypto&#8221; businesses resold the worst excesses of Wall Street as crypto products. These bad business ideas did not originate on Wall Street in a vacuum. They happened with the permission and even the support and design of regulators:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This game was played by young people who came from the world of traditional finance, from banks and hedge funds and quantitative proprietary trading firms, people who already liked finance and wanted to play with a toy version of it they could shape however they wanted.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Could the picture be any clearer? Crypto&#8217;s bubble was not driven by the humble miner running their ASIC rigs. It was driven by these Wall Street entrants who brought along with them the heavily regulated Wall Street&#8217;s reckless financial culture.</p>
<p>What else should investors expect from any substantial interventions by the government into crypto markets but more misaligned incentives and unintended consequences?</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s U.S. TradFi Regulation That Hurts Investor Finances</h2>
<p>It was the U.S. financial regulatory regime that allowed the Dot Com bubble in 1999 and 2000. Regulators let people trade dot com stocks with huge market caps for glorified home pages.</p>
<p>The advocate itching to regulate cryptos looks and sees that 91% of altcoins from 2014 are now defunct and sees a reason to pass more rules for cryptos.</p>
<p>But they want regulation from the same authorities that incentivized the Dot Com bubble. They conveniently forget the track record of regulated securities performing the exact way that the crypto sector did in 2020 &#8211; 2022. For example, they ignore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_affected_by_the_dot-com_bubble" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Dot Com companies that</a> spent hundreds of millions of dollars on their way to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was regulators asleep at the wheel in the housing savings and loans crisis. That created a real estate and financial bubble from 2005 until 2007. By 2008 it had shaken the entire world economy into recession.</p>
<p>Vast government-sponsored enterprises, financial institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, fueled the madness with low-interest loans for subprime mortgage customers.</p>
<p>Wall Street giants, with close regulatory partnerships with the government, invented mortgage-backed securities as an exotic fixed-income derivative for big financials to sell back and forth to each other.</p>
<p>By 2007 the chickens had come home to roost. Housing prices began to crater. At that point, the regulated traditional finance sector&#8217;s involvement with the bubble was beyond insane. It was unethical.</p>
<p>Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger would call it decadent and immoral. Well ahead of the housing bubble&#8217;s inevitable crash, Buffett and Munger warned about it.</p>
<p>In 2005, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2005/05/01/news/fortune500/buffett_talks/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">they considered</a> the residential real estate bubble and the destabilizing effect of hedge funds on financial markets to be the biggest threats to America after a nuclear terrorist strike.</p>
<h2>How Did Regulation Prevent The Above?</h2>
<p>It was on the U.S. financial regulators&#8217; watch that these crises formed. And it was in traditional finance companies that were compliant with regulation if not directly responding to regulatory incentives.</p>
<p>The damage done to investors and household finances lasts to this day. The U.S. Treasury <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-much-did-the-financial-crisis-cost/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">estimates the housing crash cost</a> the economy $19 trillion in household wealth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is the SEC that allows algorithmic trading logjams, arcane derivatives, and insane leveraged trading. That TradFi mess dressed up as &#8220;crypto&#8221; and made a ton of money while damaging many people&#8217;s finances. So that doesn&#8217;t make what FTX did the same as what Bitcoin created the crypto segment for.</p>
<p>Crypto is supposed to be a movement toward financial sanity, propriety, and honor. While the traditional finance world was going through the shocks of 2000 and 2008, so much for regulation, the world was blissfully unaware that Bitcoin would be one answer to solve the problems of finance in our modern, connected, global world.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that forces of reaction would appropriate the good reputation and glamor of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But these so-called crypto projects that conduct the funny money business as usual are counterfeit crypto, not the real thing.</p>
<h2>What Happens When Crypto Gets Cozy With Government and Regulation</h2>
<p>The crypto businesses that went under worst of all were those with the most government influence.</p>
<p>There were, of course, many reports that SBF was very active in U.S. federal politics after the FTX collapse. The non-profit group, Open Secrets, which keeps track of public federal election donation records, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/11/megadonor-no-more-sam-bankman-fried-spent-his-way-into-the-good-graces-of-washington-then-lost-it-all/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported in November</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX, was a darling in some Washington D.C. policy circles. He proselytized for digital assets in testimony on Capitol Hill and gave more than $990,000 to candidates plus an additional $38.8 million to outside groups this election cycle, making him the sixth biggest individual donor of the 2022 midterms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Before the fortunes of Alameda-FTX turned, SBF had planned to give over $1 billion to support his chosen candidates and issues in the 2024 elections.</p>
<p>The Winklevoss brothers and their Gemini exchange are also very cozy with Washington. Like SBF, they bring the big finance mindset to crypto and are very active in lobbying and talking to regulators. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/winklevoss-twins-advice-to-zuckerberg-and-libra-work-with-regulators.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Their advice</a> to Mark Zuckerberg back when Facebook was working on Libra was:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Work with regulators. Talk with them. You know, we definitely went through the front door, and we tried to educate the regulators and shape the regulation in a thoughtful manner because if you get the regulation wrong it can stifle innovation, but the right regulation allows for innovation to flourish, and we think we have achieved that right balance with New York.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So there have been plenty of reports of the involvement of these businesses with regulators. But has anyone drawn the connection that the TradFi regulatory mindset is what caused the insolvencies?</p>
<p>The regulatory mindset isn&#8217;t a business mindset. It&#8217;s a control function. It is not concerned with how to produce anything. It&#8217;s concerned with how to control an already productive system and how to freeze it against competition from new entrants to give it time to grow.</p>
<p>Crypto&#8217;s ethos is that it doesn&#8217;t need special treatment and protection. It doesn&#8217;t need regulatory entrenchment to thrive. Crypto thrives on openness and freedom, not barriers and regulation.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s community hopes its great-grandchildren will use the money and that it will be more valuable than ever. It&#8217;s a currency started by a borderless, nationless online community. So it doesn&#8217;t see its future resting on TradFi government regulation. It sees its future in the code working as is.</p>
<h2>Governance Through Trustless Code, Not Through Trusting Regulation</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are something that can be subject to government regulation. Government can make laws outright banning crypto, as China has. But crypto is not an agent of the government.</p>
<p>Companies, even private companies, are agents of the government. They register with the government, ostensibly comply with its regulations, and pay taxes out of payroll and profits.</p>
<p>While a cryptocurrency platform or its monies may be an object of government action, they are not a subject of government. They are more like commodity goods (like gold or oil) that way than like joint stock corporations.</p>
<p>Cryptos like Bitcoin are not constituted the way private, and public companies are. They are simply software scripts and databases of information that serve the platform&#8217;s users.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s origin is not in regulation but in code and a market economy. A market economy is regulated automatically and naturally by its realities and the self-direction of its participants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto companies like FTX or Binance are agents of government and subject to its regulation the day they register with a government to engage in commerce. While Bitcoin and most cryptos are open-source projects, FTX, Genesis, Gemini, Three Arrows, Voyager, (etc.) were regulated private companies.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re doomed from the start. <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/if-people-withdrew-everything-from-binance-us-we-would-still-have-millions-in-assets-ceo-says/" data-wpel-link="internal">Binance has remained solvent</a>, and it&#8217;s a regulated private company. It&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-us-receives-initial-approval-to-acquire-voyager-digitals-assets-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">even buying its rivals</a> that failed in the insolvency crisis.</p>
<p>Many of the world&#8217;s most beloved brands and greatest fortunes were created by private and public companies under the direction of government regulation.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin is just one of the amazing new products that represent a complete paradigm shift away from government regulation. It belongs to a paradigm shift called open source, and the open source movement is just beginning to create exciting new possibilities for the world.</p>
<p>In open source, the greatest solutions to age-old human problems will be found in autonomous network governance.</p>
