<h2>Putin and Lula Discuss Various Topics, Including Ukraine War and BRICS Cooperation</h2>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, engaged in a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, following his discussion with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this week. Among the topics the leaders discussed was cooperation across major multinational organizations, such as the BRICS. The BRICS economic bloc comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>In a tweet Friday, Lula wrote (translated from Portuguese by Google):</p>
<blockquote><p>I just spoke by phone with the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. I thanked him for an invitation to attend the International Economic Forum in Saint Petersburg, and replied that I could not go to Russia at the moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Brazilian president added that concerning the war in Ukraine, he “reiterated Brazil&#8217;s willingness, along with India, Indonesia, and China, to talk to both sides of the conflict in pursuit of peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to an announcement published by the Kremlin Friday, the Brazilian president shared his impressions of participating in the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/g7-nations-discuss-countering-chinas-economic-coercion/">Group of Seven</a> (G7) summit in Hiroshima, Japan, and the two leaders exchanged their assessments of the situation around Ukraine.</p>
<p>In addition, Putin and Lula discussed the Russian-Brazilian strategic partnership and expressed mutual interest in deepening cooperation in various fields, the Kremlin detailed, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Issues related to joint work within the BRICS and other multilateral platforms were considered.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The conversation was constructive and informative,” the Kremlin concluded.</p>

<h2>Xi Jinping and Lula Discuss Global Situation, Strategic Partnership, and BRICS Summit</h2>
<p>Lula also tweeted that he had a conversation on the phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Brazilian leader wrote Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday I had a telephone conversation with the president of China, Xi Jinping. We talked about the global situation, the need for peace in Ukraine, the participation of our countries in the BRICS summit in August. And about our strategic partnership at the bilateral level.</p></blockquote>
<p>The BRICS group has been pushing for de-dollarization and there is a proposal for a common BRICS currency that is expected to be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discussed</a> at the next leaders’ summit in August.</p>
<p>Lula has voiced <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-voices-support-for-brics-currency/">support</a> for the creation of a BRICS currency. “I am in favor of creating, within the BRICS, a trading currency between our countries, just like the Europeans created the euro,” he said in April. In addition, he urged developing countries to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-urges-developing-countries-to-abandon-dollar-as-global-reserve-currency/">abandon the U.S. dollar</a> as a global reserve currency.</p>
<p>Putin said this week that Russia is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-rejects-russian-economic-collapse-predictions-highlights-active-brics-sco-cooperation/">actively working</a> with major international associations, including the BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), as well as multilateral organizations in Latin America and Africa.</p>

President Lula da Silva also vowed that the bank will improve cooperation with its African counterpart.</strong></p>
<h2>Brazil Wants the New Development Bank Under BRICS to Strengthen as Financing Instrument</h2>
<p>Authorities in Brasilia consider the New Development Bank (<a href="https://www.ndb.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NDB</a>), created by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), as a promising alternative to traditional financial institutions, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was quoted as saying by the Tass news agency.</p>
<p>Lula made the statement during a meeting with ambassadors from African countries. “We want the BRICS bank to strengthen as an alternative instrument for financing, and we will reinforce our cooperation with the African Development Bank,” he emphasized.</p>
<p>Current international financial and banking institutions ignore the needs of developing nations and are not suitable for them, because many of those countries are being “strangled by overwhelming debt burdens,” he elaborated on Thursday.</p>

<p>The BRICS countries established the NDB, formerly called the BRICS Development Bank, after signing an agreement in Fortaleza, Brazil, in the summer of 2014, when Dilma Rousseff was President of Brazil. In March 2023, she was elected president of the bank.</p>
<p>The BRICS’ development bank funds infrastructure and sustainable development projects in the bloc’s member states and developing countries. In 2021, the NDB admitted Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Uruguay to the scope of its activities.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 projects for almost $33 billion have been approved by the bank since its launch in areas such as transport, water supply, clean energy, digital and social infrastructure, and urban construction, the report noted.</p>
<p>In April of this year, the Shanghai-headquartered bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-re-taps-into-usd-bond-market-with-1-25-billion-green-bonds/">announced</a> it has issued its first “green” bonds in U.S. dollars in the amount of $1.25 billion. The proceeds from the placement will be used to finance or refinance eligible “green” projects in participating nations.</p>

The agency said a confidence-sapping policy mistake such as the U.S. Congress&#8217;s failure to raise the debt limit poses the &#8220;greatest near-term danger to the dollar&#8217;s position.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Rival Currencies Cannot Match the U.S. Dollar&#8217;s Core Traits</h2>
<p>The global credit rating agency Moody’s has said while the spectre of the U.S. dollar losing its dominance is real, at the moment there are no viable alternatives to take its place. In a note <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/us-dollar-dominance-persist-decades-despite-challenges-moodys-2023-05-25/">reportedly</a> released on May 25, Moody’s insisted that the current rivals to the greenback such as the euro and the Chinese yuan will not be able to quickly match the core traits that made it the most dominant currency.</p>
<p>As has been reported by various media outlets including Bitcoin.com News, the dollar’s longstanding position as the world’s reserve currency is being threatened by countries that are seeking to create an alternative global currency. The calls for the establishment of a rival to the dollar are being propagated by countries that accuse the U.S. of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-warns-of-catastrophic-fall-in-american-living-standard-elon-musk-weighs-in-on-de-dollarization-us-dollar-weaponization/">abusing</a> the greenback’s dominance. Led by Russia, these countries have proposed several steps including the creation of a BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) currency.</p>
<p>However, according to Moody’s latest note, none of the proposed or current rivals to the dollar are backed by an economy as big as that of the United States. In addition, none of the dollar’s current rivals is anchored by a treasury market that compares to that of the U.S. both in terms of depth and perceived safety.</p>

<h2>U.S. Default a Near-Term Danger to the Dollar</h2>
<p>The note nonetheless still warned of factors that pose a real threat to the U.S. dollar’s position. The note said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The greatest near-term danger to the dollar&#8217;s position stems from the risk of confidence-sapping policy mistakes by the U.S. authorities themselves, like a U.S. default on its debt for example.</p></blockquote>
<p>As has been reported by Bitcoin.com News, the U.S. Congress’ inability to agree on a deal that raises the debt ceiling to $31.4 trillion could result in the United States government failing to meet its obligations. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-insists-us-could-default-on-june-1-goldman-sachs-estimates-real-deadline-is-a-week-later/">warned</a> of an economic catastrophe if the U.S. government defaults.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), warned of a major disruption to the world economy if the United States government defaults.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US Treasury market is the anchor of stability for the global financial system, you pull the anchor, the world economy — the ship on which we all travel — is in choppy and even worse, unchartered waters,&#8221; the IMF chief <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/debt-ceiling-negotiations-05-26-23/index.html">said</a> on May 26.</p>
<p>At the time of writing (May 26, 2023, at 3 p.m. EST), talks between the two U.S. political parties were said to be continuing. However, the prospects for an agreement were reportedly still slim.</p>

The company attributes the move to the &#8220;challenging regulatory environment&#8221; and the enduring effects of the &#8220;prolonged crypto winter,&#8221; signaling the conclusion of its subsidiary&#8217;s operations.</strong></p>
<h2>DCG to Shut Down Institutional Trading Arm Tradeblock by the Month’s End</h2>
<p>According to a DCG spokesperson who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-25/digital-currency-group-closes-tradeblock-institutional-platform?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google#xj4y7vzkg">spoke</a> with Bloomberg, Digital Currency Group (DCG) has decided to close its trading platform, Tradeblock, this month. The Connecticut-based institutional trading platform, founded by Greg and Jeff Schvey in 2013, was acquired by crypto news outlet Coindesk in January 2021. Tradeblock successfully raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/funding_total/tradeblock">$53.1 million</a> across five funding rounds since its inception.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to reporters Olga Kharif, Anna Irrera, and Hannah Mille, a DCG spokesperson confirmed that Tradeblock is set to cease operations on May 31. Notably, the trading platform provided trade execution services but also prime brokerage options. Although initially founded by Greg and Jeff Schvey, the company was led by Breanne Madigan, a former Goldman Sachs employee. Tradeblock&#8217;s data also served as a reference index for Coindesk&#8217;s Defi Index methodology.</p>
<p>“Due to the state of the broader economy and prolonged crypto winter, along with the challenging regulatory environment for digital assets in the US, we made the decision to sunset the institutional trading platform side of the business,” a DCG spokesperson told Bloomberg on Thursday.</p>

<p>DCG&#8217;s latest announcement comes in the wake of its missed payment to creditors for $630 million, a setback experienced during its subsidiary Genesis&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings. Just three days ago, Genesis informed Bitcoin.com News that, “as part of the ongoing mediation process, the parties are discussing potential terms of forbearance, a standalone chapter 11 plan for Genesis and other options to recover assets and maximize value to stakeholders.” Earlier this year, reports <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/genesis-parent-company-dcg-shutters-its-wealth-management-division">surfaced</a> regarding DCG&#8217;s closure of its wealth management business operation, HQ Digital, due to similar challenges.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Difficulty Nears 50 Trillion Milestone</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-reaches-all-time-high-as-miners-face-second-largest-increase-this-year/">mining difficulty</a>, already at an unprecedented level of 49.55 trillion, seems poised to breach the 50 trillion threshold within five days. Although the process of mining bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) has become increasingly challenging, the hashrate has maintained an average rate of 364 exahash per second (EH/s) during the last 2,016 blocks. As of May 26, 2023, the hashrate hovers around 367.29 EH/s based on a 24-hour analysis.</p>
<p>On May 2, 2023&#x2014;a noteworthy event in Bitcoin&#x2019;s lifetime&#x2014;its hashrate reached a historic high at block height <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/787895">787,895</a> with an impressive figure of <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">491.15 EH/s</a>. The network&#x2019;s hashrate spiked again in mid-May to reach 453 EH/s and today, it achieved a peak of 427 EH/s. Block intervals have hastened, and the most recent block recorded at block height 791,491 had a duration of approximately nine minutes and 53 seconds.</p>

<p>The acceleration in block intervals or times outpacing the ten-minute average suggests that another rise in difficulty looms next week. Already, projections reveal a potential increase on May 31 that could range from 1.1% to 2.51%. Should this transpire, Bitcoin&#x2019;s mining difficulty will land in the vicinity of 50.79 trillion&#x2014;a milestone for surpassing the 50 trillion mark for the first time in Bitcoin&#x2019;s lifespan.</p>

<p>Currently, Foundry USA leads the pack among mining pools with a 127.93 EH/s hashrate&#x2014;amounting to 35.54% of the entire network&#x2019;s total. Antpool, F2pool, Viabtc, and Binance Pool trail closely in the respective rankings of overall hashrate per mining pool. Over the previous month, a total of 4,396 blocks were unearthed by Bitcoin miners, with Foundry discovering 1,373 blocks by May 26.</p>

The global crypto market marginally rose during today&#x2019;s session, following yesterday&#x2019;s downturn. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> was another notable gainer.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) was one of Friday&#x2019;s big movers, as the token rose to a multi-week high during the day.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.8802 on Thursday, MATIC/USD hit an intraday high of $0.9514 during today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of the move, polygon recorded its strongest point since May 8, breaking out of a key resistance of $0.9500 in the process.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that this breakout occurred as the 10-day (red) moving average moved closer to an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) moved past its own ceiling at the 49.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 52.93, with an upcoming ceiling of 56.00 a possible hurdle for bulls.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> (formerly ripple), also saw an increase in bullish momentum, as it rebounded from a recent one-week low.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.4673 earlier in the day, following a low of $0.4472 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s peak saw the token move closer to its long-term resistance level of $0.4690, which was last broken in April.</p>

<p>Earlier gains in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> have somewhat eased, as the RSI also moved near a ceiling of its own at 55.00</p>
<p>As of writing this, the index is currently tracking at the 54.80 mark, with the price currently at $0.4673.</p>
<p>Should this ceiling at 55.00 be broken, there is a possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> will hit a one-month high in the upcoming days.</p>

Just a fortnight ago, the Fedwatch tool indicated a slim possibility of the federal funds rate reaching 5.50% next month. The following day on Friday, the Fedwatch tool now shows a 37.7% chance. </strong></p>
<h2>From Slim Odds to High Probability: Fedwatch Tool Indicates Higher Chance of June Rate Hike</h2>
<p>Until recently, many investors and market analysts held the belief that the likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s FOMC raising the benchmark bank rate in June was extremely low. Set to convene on June 14, 2023, the FOMC appeared to have only a <a href="https://archive.is/5LNGA">20.1% probability</a> of implementing a quarter-point hike, according to the CME Fedwatch tool&#8217;s data on May 9.</p>
<p>The Fedwatch tool employs futures contract prices to provide an estimated probability of interest rate adjustments determined by the U.S. Federal Reserve before their official decisions. By May 14, 2023, the chances of a rate hike dwindled even further to a mere 15.5%, leaving an overwhelming 84.5% probability that the federal funds rate would remain unchanged.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">June rate hike is now &quot;game on&quot; <a href="https://t.co/ViyomZwMvj">pic.twitter.com/ViyomZwMvj</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jim Bianco biancoresearch.eth (@biancoresearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1661769949210112001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-chair-powell-hints-at-possible-pause-in-interest-rate-hikes/">dropped hints</a> suggesting that the Fed might hit pause on rate hikes during the upcoming FOMC meeting in June. The most recent increase in rates, a 25 basis points (bps) hike, took place on May 3, marking the tenth consecutive rise since March 2022.</p>
<p>Despite emphasizing the soundness and resilience of the U.S. banking system, the FOMC acknowledged the possibility of &#8220;appropriate&#8221; further policy adjustments. Jumping ahead to the present day on May 25, a dive into data from the Fedwatch tool reveals a 51% probability of a 25bps increase occurring on June 14.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the tool indicated a nearly balanced 49% chance of the rates staying the same. While the Fedwatch tool boasts a track record of accuracy, a few skeptics have pointed out <a href="https://www.investing.com/analysis/cme-fedwatch-and-bloomberg-rate-hike-odds-still-wrong;-deflationary-bust-264780">rare instances</a> when it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cafzxq/cme_fed_watch_tool/">missed the mark</a>. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the Fedwatch tool&#8217;s predictions can fluctuate as the central bank&#8217;s FOMC meetings draw nearer. The Fedwatch tool’s prediction on Thursday follows the recent rate hike <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-boss-warns-everyone-should-be-prepared-for-interest-rates-going-higher-from-here/">remarks</a> from JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon.</p>

<p>During the bank&#8217;s investor day event, Dimon confidently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-boss-warns-everyone-should-be-prepared-for-interest-rates-going-higher-from-here/">expressed</a> to analysts that it is only logical to anticipate higher rates moving forward. Although he didn&#8217;t specifically mention the June 14 meeting, he did acknowledge the possibility of the rate climbing as high as 6% to 7%.</p>
<p>As of now, the federal funds rate stands at 5-5.25%, marking its highest point in nearly 16 years. Powell, at the press conference held on May 3, addressed the concept of the peak interest rate, remarking that &#8220;we may not be far off&#8221; and even suggesting that &#8220;we&#8217;re possibly even at that level.&#8221; Following the 51% figure recorded on Thursday, the following day, chances of the rate increasing by 25bps <a href="https://archive.ph/15U48">dropped to 37.7%</a>.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rose slightly higher on Friday, as prices moved away from a recent two-week low.</p>
<p>Following a low of $25,890.59 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to a peak at $26,591.52 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move saw bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) once again climb above a point of support at the $26,300 level, which has been in place for the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Despite this latest rebound, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> remained almost 2% lower than at the same point last week.</p>
<p>For bulls, a positive sign comes in the form of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which failed to break out of a floor at 39.00</p>
<p>The last time breakout took place was back on March 10, which led to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> falling below the $20,000 mark.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) rose back above the $1,800 mark on Friday, after dropping to a multi-week low of its own yesterday.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a high of $1,817.16 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes a day after the price fell to a bottom at $1,788.29.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s slight rebound, the 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly on the verge of crossing its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>

<p>The chances of this occurring come as price strength once again bounced from support at 44.00, leading to a reentry of long-term bulls.</p>
<p>As of writing this, the index is now tracking at 46.39, with the next visible resistance level at 51.00.</p>
<p>Should momentum continue to climb, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could hit $1,900 this coming weekend.</p>

Kral also argued that the implementation of these regulations will force non-compliant entities or those that cannot &#8220;deliver the required standards&#8221; to leave the European Union market.</strong></p>
<h2>The Impact of MiCA Regulations on Crypto Industry Participants</h2>
<p>In his written answers to questions from Bitcoin.com News, the CEO suggested that the new regulations will ensure incidents such as the collapse of FTX will not recur. In addition, the regulations will stop human trafficking rings or criminal gangs from moving funds via Europe.</p>
<p>Concerning fears that the implementation of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dutch-financial-regulator-vows-strict-treatment-of-crypto-business-under-mica/">MiCA regulations</a> will see crypto firms leave Europe just as some have done in the United States, Kral said much will depend on their objectives. For crypto firms whose objective is to deliver the best service for users, the implementation of MiCA regulations is not going to affect their operations. On the other hand, crypto firms that &#8220;prefer to avoid transparency,&#8221; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-parliament-to-vote-on-adopting-the-regulation-on-mica-expert-says-industry-needs-legal-clarity/">MiCA regulations</a> may force them to abandon the European market.</p>
<p>Also, in his answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, Kral spoke of how Europe-based crypto exchanges are preparing for MiCA regulations. Below are the rest of the Zondacrypto CEO&#8217;s responses to the questions sent.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Your crypto exchange is one of Europe&#8217;s long-standing digital asset exchanges. Does the approval of MiCA regulation pose a new or unusual threat to Zondacrypto? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Przemyslaw Kral (PK):</strong> At Zondacrypto, we have long called for greater regulatory clarity, so we are well-prepared for the new regulation. We have already achieved great success in cementing our positive regulatory stance with licences in several European countries. In our case, we do not need to make any additional preparations as we have long been adapting our activities and even going beyond the legal requirements to ensure that our users feel safe.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: There is no doubt the collapse of FTX in late 2022 has highlighted the importance of corporate governance in the crypto space. The European Commission has said the MiCA regulation aims to support innovation and the uptake of new financial technologies whilst ensuring that investors are protected. In your view, is MiCA balanced? </strong></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> Although MiCA may be difficult to implement, especially for smaller start-ups, I believe the result will be positive for everyone. Regulatory clarity is good for everyone: institutional and individual investors, users, and companies – everyone can benefit, which will ultimately mean that the European market will grow. But of course, it also means that those companies that can&#8217;t deliver the required standards or don&#8217;t have the best interests of users at heart will have to leave the EU or change their business model.</p>

<p><strong>BCN: What will change for the crypto customers when MiCA regulations come into force?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> From the point of view of customers of regulated exchanges such as Zondacrypto, the changes won&#8217;t be very significant or noticeable, as such exchanges already have strict KYC and AML procedures in place. However, users of unregulated or non-compliant exchanges may encounter withdrawal issues and will likely be asked to provide additional information regarding their identity and source of funds.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: What sort of market manipulations and insider dealings do you see today that MiCA seeks to deal with or solve?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> The recent collapse of FTX is an example of the kind of risks that can arise from inadequate regulation, and MiCA will go a long way to ensuring that a similar disaster doesn&#8217;t happen in the EU. MiCA will also ensure that money moving through EU-based exchanges is not used to fund terrorism, trafficking or similar crimes. With strict procedures and heavy fines for non-compliance, rogue exchanges will no longer be allowed to profit from or ignore criminal activity on their platforms.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: In the United States, critics assert that the approach taken by regulators will result in many crypto firms leaving the country. Do you foresee the MICA regulation having a similar effect?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> It all depends on the company and its objectives. If they have the best interests of their users in mind, they will already have some procedures in place to vet users and make sure that no shady activities can happen on their watch. But for those companies that prefer to avoid transparency, leaving the European market may be the only viable option – and I&#8217;m sure their regulated competitors will take advantage of the situation to bring more customers into the European market. Those who play fair will win, and those who prefer to resort to dodgy tactics will have to move on.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: How are European crypto exchanges reacting or preparing for the new regulation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> The exchanges that have previously ignored regulatory requirements will need to adapt their procedures to the new legislation, including more thorough vetting processes for users. This can mean more jobs in crypto, as the exchanges will be seeking new specialists to help them process various user verification procedures. And, of course, it will mean more safety and security for everyone involved in the industry.</p>
