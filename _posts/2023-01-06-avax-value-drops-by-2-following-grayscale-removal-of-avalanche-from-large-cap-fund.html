In its latest quarterly update, Grayscale announced the rebalancing of funds for the fourth quarter of 2022. As part of the rebalancing, Grayscale sold off a certain amount of its Digital Large Cap Fund and dumped its held tokens, including Avalanche Network token AVAX.   AVAX has slipped by 2% following the sell-off in the past 24 hours. According to Grayscale, the sold-off AVAX tokens were replaced with the purchase of the existing fund components in proportion to their respective weightings. Grayscale Purchased And Existing Tokens The AVAX sell-off was only part of the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. In its CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index and Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund portfolio rebalancing, the company sold off Algorand native token ALGO. In its CoinDesk DeFi Select Index methodology, Grayscale adjusted its DeFi Fund’s portfolio and purchased Synthetix (SNX) after selling some existing assets.  Related Reading: Grayscale Says It May Return 20% Of Investor Capital, Bitcoin Refuses To Budge As of now, the Grayscale portfolio fund now includes 65% Bitcoin (BTC), 30% Ethereum (ETH), 1.86% Cardano (ADA), 1.39% Polygon (MATIC), and 1% Solana (SOL). Meanwhile, its DeFi Fund’s Fund Components include  65.05% Uniswap (UNI), 12.39% Aave (AAVE), 8.15% MakerDAO (MKR), 6.02% Synthetix (SNX), 4.58% Curve DAO Token (CRV), and 3.81% Compound (COMP).  Since July, Grayscale has been carefully monitoring the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index. The index launched in April tracks the market capitalization-loaded performance of “the largest and most liquid digital assets.” During Grayscale usage of the Index, the quarterly scheduled rebalancing resulted in the dumping of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), and more Uniswap (UNI) purchases. AVAX Slips After Grayscale Dumped Before the sell-off, AVAX was still sitting at a $12 zone; however, after Grayscale dumped its holdings, the AVAX token dropped by 2% and traded at $11.39 Friday morning.  AVAX has appreciated over the past months. It has surged from around $9 to $13. Notably, Grayscale fund’s portfolio, which currently has $163 million in assets under management (AUM), only held a small portion of AVAX tokens. As of September 30, AVAX made up less than 1% of the company’s fund’s assets, according to its previous quarterly report.

It fell from a range of $0.17 to $0.15. As of the time of writing, ALGO currently trades at $11.73 with a 24-hour trading volume of $45 million.  On the other hand, AVAX seems to be gaining momentum to the upside at the time of writing as it has already formed a retracement; a reversal is likely to happen. AVAX currently trades at $11.73, down by 0.8% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $125 million over the same period.
