<p>In a vast sea of diverse cryptocurrencies, each boasting distinct features and functionalities, it can be hard figuring out which ones are perfect for you. To those on the outside of the crypto community, it can seem like the only thing that matters about a coin is how much money it can make you - and while that is of course important, there are plenty of other things that every single crypto enthusiast looks for in these projects.</p>
<p>This article will talk about two top cryptos, Avalanche (AVAX) and Cardano (ADA), and what aspects they offer that attracted their user bases. Also, what type of users could be attracted to DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), an exciting new meme coin project that's currently in presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cardano And Avalanche Are Straight Business</p>
<p>Both Cardano and Avalanche are very similar projects in many ways, so it makes sense to compare them as they undoubtedly have similar - if not the same - user bases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are Ethereum inspired blockchain networks that support tokens using less bloated, faster and more environmentally-friendly tech than many of the other competition on the market. Both built using PoS consensuses that allow them to offer these services without any catches, all while remaining affordable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest difference between them is their intended usages. Whereas they both benefit from their aforementioned aspects, Avalanche is more focused on transaction speeds overall. Cardano on the other hand is driven by innovation, focusing on the development and creation of new tokens and other decentralized applications. With that being said, Avalanche can still be used for that too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When considering everything mentioned above, it&rsquo;s clear what type of crypto enthusiast is attracted to these projects: the serious kind that is completely focused on the growth and improvement of the industry for everyone rather than just their own personal profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>DogeMiyagi Is All About Fun</p>
<p>When you look at DogeMiyagi purely from the perspective of it being a meme coin, its quite easy to guess who the project will attract the most. Those crypto enthusiasts who find more enjoyment in the market when it isn&rsquo;t taking itself too seriously and all about crazy and exciting moves! The r/wallstreetbet users, the Elon Musk fans, the ones who helped blow the trend up in the first place.</p>
<p>But DogeMiyagi is actually more than just that! The platform that hosts the meme coin is all about community. It plans to establish a place where users can come to discuss current events in the crypto world while at the same time creating and sharing their own memes; all while earning through plenty of incentives. DogeMiyagi will also jump into the NFT space, creating its own secret club where users can buy the exclusive NFTs and a marketplace to trade them on.</p>
<p>Something else worth mentioning is that the project will become 100% community driven upon launch, meaning that users can personally take part in its evolution towards becoming the ultimate meme coin and platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi will likely be perfect for users who both enjoy having fun but also want to have a tight knit community with a real sense of belonging, where you can make friends, get advice and develop both lasting relationships and investments in crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know what type of users are most likely to gravitate towards different cryptos and what these cryptos do to attract them in the first place. Each one of these three are great investments to make regardless of what you&rsquo;re searching for though! DogeMiyagi is especially interesting at the moment because of its presale, which is selling out fast already!</p>
