<p>Republican lawmakers have questioned whether the US SEC has assured enough security measures before granting Prometheum Inc. the license to operate as crypto broker. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/lawmakers-gary-gensler-prometheum-sec-approval/">Republican Lawmakers Seek Answer from Gary Gensler over Prometheum&#8217;s SEC Approval</a></p>
<p>Republican lawmakers at the US Congressional Committee overseeing the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) are demanding an answer from SEC chair <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/gary-gensler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler</a> over how Prometheum Inc secured a unique approval to operate as a crypto broker-dealer.</p>
<p>Led by Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a group of 23 House Financial Services Committee lawmakers raised questions about how the recently revealed company managed to secure SEC registration as a special-purpose broker-dealer for digital assets. They also sought clarification on the factors that led to this decision and the timing of its conclusion, considering other applicants in the process.</p>
<p>Additionally, the lawmakers also sent a letter to the head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). It&#8217;s an industry-funded group that enforces securities standards under the SEC&#8217;s watch. The letter noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The timing of the approval raises concerns that it was aimed at demonstrating that legislation is not needed because there is a workable regulatory framework for the custody of digital asset securities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>SEC&#8217;s Special Treatment to Prometheum?</h2>
<p>The letters ask important questions about whether the SEC chose Prometheum as a prime example to support Gensler&#8217;s view that new laws aren&#8217;t necessary for regulating crypto in the US. This happened just as McHenry&#8217;s committee was preparing to send digital assets legislation to the House floor.</p>
<p>However, Prometheum&#8217;s leaders have said they&#8217;ve been following the registration process like any other company. Co-CEO Aaron Kaplan believes his company will show how to create a crypto platform that follows the rules properly. In a statement on Tuesday, August 15, the company said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Prometheum purpose-built its technology with the goal to develop a market infrastructure for digital asset securities that is compliant with the federal securities laws. This technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Lawmakers are also joining others in asking for more details about Prometheum&#8217;s sudden appearance in Washington. The company hasn&#8217;t started trading yet. Both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and House have raised concerns about this, and Ritchie Torres, a Democrat on McHenry&#8217;s committee, has asked for the SEC to be investigated.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-connect-shut-down/">Binance to Shut Down Its Buy-and-Sell Service Binance Connect</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has decided to close its buy-and-sell service Binance Connect amid challenges its provider faced with support for card payments. Starting from August 16, Binance Connect is no longer available.</p>
<p>Binance has confirmed the news, the announcement has also been revealed by BNB Chain-based platform Biswap in a tweet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Biswappers,</p>
<p>The Biswap team keeps abreast of the latest DeFi news and aims to inform you right away.</p>
<p>After a thorough consideration, <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@binance</a> has made a difficult decision to disable <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_Connect?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Binance_Connect</a> on 15 August due to its provider closing the supporting card payments… <a href="https://t.co/HcooyLn4sg">pic.twitter.com/HcooyLn4sg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Biswap (@Biswap_Dex) <a href="https://twitter.com/Biswap_Dex/status/1691358029914996736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As Binance has stated, it will shift its focus to its main products and long-term goals.</p>
<p>Binance representative commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We periodically review our products and services to ensure that our resources continue to be focused on core efforts that align with our long-term strategy. In the last six years, Binance has grown from being an exchange to a global blockchain ecosystem with multiple business lines. We consistently adapt and modify our business approach in response to changing market and user needs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Launched in March 2022, Binance Connect (formerly Bitfinity) was connecting traditional finance to world-leading and emerging blockchains, transforming how businesses and people send and receive money around the world. Its aim was to create an open, financial world where people from all walks of life and businesses, big or small, can participate and realize their financial goals.</p>
<p>Serving as the official fiat-to-crypto payments provider for Binance, Binance Connect supported as many as 50 cryptocurrencies and major payment methods, including Visa and Mastercard. The service was also supposed to be the hub for the exchange’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-are-non-fungible-tokens-nfts/#:~:text=NFTs%20are%20created%20using%20blockchain,a%20token%20on%20the%20blockchain." target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) checkout solution. The feature was not added.</p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Legal Battles</h2>
<p>One of the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchanges is currently facing challenges caused by regulatory scrutiny around its business. Earlier this year, Binance faced lawsuits filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>) accusing the company of misleading investors through opaque business practices. The violations included operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies, misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on the Binance.US platform, as well as the unregistered offer and sale of securities. In total, SEC filed more than a dozen charges against Binance this year so far.</p>
<p>According to SEC, Binance has been manipulating its Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes to conceal its US customer base and avoid regulatory oversight. Besides, the company has been accused of encouraging its US customers to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their locations and bypass restrictions. Out of Binance’s 62 million global customers, only 25 million had submitted KYC documentation.</p>
<p>European regulators turned out to be not really welcoming as well. In June, Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) reportedly <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-german-license-denied-bafin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> the Binance exchange’s application for a crypto custody license. Besides, Binance withdrew its application with the Financial Market Authority of Austria. Earlier this year, Binance also exited the Netherlands after failing to secure regulatory approval, as well as abandoned its Cyprus and UK registrations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/x-access-facebook-instagram-bluesky/">Elon Musk&#8217;s Platform X Slows Down Access to Facebook, Instagram, and Bluesky</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>&#8216;s social media platform X, formerly <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, has stirred up a digital storm by intentionally slowing down access to certain websites, setting off debates about online power dynamics and user manipulation. The targeted sites, which include heavyweights like The New York Times, Instagram, Facebook, Bluesky, Threads, Reuters, and Substack, were subjected to a noticeable five-second delay when users tried to access links originating from X. The timing of the controversial move raised eyebrows, especially given Musk&#8217;s history of publicly expressing his disapproval of these platforms.</p>
<p>Slowing down traffic to specific websites raises critical questions about the role of platforms in shaping user experiences and the potential impact on the businesses being targeted. Even a minor delay can drastically affect user engagement and ultimately influence ad revenue for these platforms. Users have grown accustomed to near-instantaneous loading times, and such delays can lead to impatience and frustration.</p>
<h2>YouTube and Fox News Remain Unaffected</h2>
<p>On August 15, tech enthusiasts at Hackers News discovered that X had slowed down access to certain websites on Tuesday afternoon. Interestingly, the throttling strategy appears to selectively target websites that have faced Musk&#8217;s previous ire in the past.</p>
<p>According to the Washington Post, links to sites like Fox News, The Washington Post, and social media platforms such as Mastodon and YouTube remained unaffected. The move raises concerns about the ethics of using a platform to indirectly suppress competitors or platforms one disagrees with.</p>
<p>The former head of trust and safety at Twitter, Yoel Roth, chimed in on the matter, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yoyoel.com/post/3k4zcmly6wu2u" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">describing</a> the event as &#8220;one of those things that seem too crazy to be true, even for Twitter, until you see it inexplicably takes 5 seconds for Chrome to receive 650 bytes of data&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to him, this seemingly innocuous delay can have far-reaching implications, as research shows that even a 1-second delay can significantly impact user behavior, leading to higher bounce rates and less time spent on the site.</p>
<p>A touch of drama was added when <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/mark-zuckerberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms</a>, the conglomerate behind Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/Cv-EJEeLBHT/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to a Threads post discussing the throttling with a contemplative &#8220;thinking face emoji&#8221;. The gesture comes amidst an ongoing feud between Musk and Zuckerberg, with Musk previously suggesting a real-life face-off in a cage match.</p>
<h2>X Restores Access to Affected Platforms</h2>
<p>Musk&#8217;s influence over X&#8217;s operations has manifested in the past, blocking links to competitors like Substack and Threads and removing The New York Times&#8217; verification ticker while labeling it as &#8220;propaganda&#8221;.</p>
<p>The platform has remained tight-lipped in response to the throttling controversy, maintaining a trend of non-responsiveness since Musk took over the company.</p>
<p>However, in a twist of events, X is gradually reversing the throttling tactics, with the delay in accessing news sites showing signs of improvement. According to the Post, the newly rebranded platform has completely restored the delay time to zero.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/allianceblock-launch-nexera/">AllianceBlock Announces Launch of Nexera Exchange </a></p>
<p><a href="https://allianceblock.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AllianceBlock</a>, a blockchain agnostic platform designed to bridge the gap between the traditional finance (TradeFi) ecosystem and the world of decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) , has announced the launch of a new exchange dubbed <a href="https://nexera.exchange/">Nexera Exchange</a>. In a press release shared with Coinspeaker, the company said the exchange is on track to revolutionize how people trade cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The newly introduced exchange is an upgraded successor of AllianceBlock DEX, a platform designed to harness the power of Automated Market Maker (AMM) to &#8220;meet the demand of streamlined user interface&#8221;. Since its launch last year, the platform has gained recognition in the crypto community.</p>
<p>Building upon this success, AllianceBlock has launched Nexera Exchange to serve as an intermediary to the DEX protocol, making it more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
<p>While decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have grown in popularity, they sometimes lag behind their centralized counterparts in terms of user-friendliness. This is where Nexera Exchange steps in by incorporating an on-chain order book protocol to provide a new era of liquidity for various digital currencies and tokenized assets.</p>
<h2>Unleashing Liquidity with Uniswap Integration</h2>
<p>AllianceBlock said it has collaborated with Uniswap, a popular deFi marketplace based on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> blockchain. Through this partnership, the company&#8217;s newly launched exchange will leverage Uniswap V3&#8217;s liquidity to enable it to provide limited orders that ensure competitive prices.</p>
<p>With the help of Uniswap, the exchange aims to become a hub for on-chain limited order aggregation, connecting liquidity from diverse, decentralized exchanges. The vision is set to empower traders with an unparalleled decentralized trading experience.</p>
<p>Nexera Exchange also plans to introduce a stability staking pool, which lets traders earn rewards while actively participating on the platform. By staking NXRA tokens, its native crypto, traders can partake in a share of the trading fees, turning trading into a rewarding endeavor.</p>
<h2>A Toolset of DeFi Wonders</h2>
<p>AllianceBlock said the exchange is not just a platform but a treasure trove of DeFi features explicitly made for advanced trading strategies.</p>
<p>These features open up new dimensions for traders, from stake-enabled on-chain order books to order-triggering matches, yield-optimized staked orders, and dynamic range order book provision.</p>
<p>Regarding safety, the company said it had equipped the exchange with quality security measures, including the KYC/AML procedures.</p>
<p>Nexera Exchange is also built to maintain compliance with regulations across its markets.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Nexera Exchange is primed to redefine crypto trading, offering advanced features, improved liquidity, and security measures that are set to shape the future of digital asset trading.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/home-depot-q2-2023-earnings/">Home Depot&#8217;s Q2 2023 Earnings Surpass Expectations amid Sales Dip</a></p>
<p>American retail giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/home-depot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a> (NYSE: HD) has once again demonstrated its financial resilience by surpassing Wall Street’s expectations for its Q2 2023 earnings. Despite a slight dip of 2% year-over-year sales, the company reported impressive results, reaffirming its position as a competitive player in the retail sector.</p>
<h2>Home Depot Beats Q2 2023 Earnings Expectation</h2>
<p>For the three-month period ending July 30, Home Depot <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/home-depot-hd-earnings-q2-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> earnings per share of $4.65, outperforming the analysts’ consensus estimate of $4.45 per share. In addition, the company recorded revenue of $42.92 billion for the second quarter exceeding Wall Street&#8217;s projection of $42.23 billion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Home Depot recorded a net income of $4.66 billion for the fiscal second quarter, translating to $4.65 per share. These figures represent a decline from last year’s results of $5.17 billion in net income and $5.05 per share.</p>
<p>While the decrease in net income and earnings per share might raise concerns, Home Depot’s recent financial report showcased a notable <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/home-depot-fiscal-q4-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reversal</a> of fortune, as the company exceeded Wall Street&#8217;s revenue projections for the first time in three quarters.</p>
<p>The unexpected surge highlights Home Depot&#8217;s resilience in the face of economic challenges, reflecting its adaptability and responsiveness to evolving market dynamics.</p>
<h2>Navigating with Caution</h2>
<p>Despite the favorable revenue surprise, Home Depot saw a moderated fiscal year earnings projection implying that the corporation remains cautious about the road ahead. The retailer reiterated its forecast for sales and comparable sales to decline within a range of 2% to 5% when compared to the same period in the previous year.</p>
<p>Home Depot&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer, Richard McPhail, stated that consumer behavior remains cautious, particularly in terms of larger-ticket and discretionary purchasing. He mentioned that some homeowners made large purchases during the pandemic, while others are deferring such purchases because of rising interest rates.</p>
<p>McPhail also noted that some pandemic-induced dynamics are gradually reversing. Transportation expenses have decreased, and vendors are less likely to request price increases.</p>
<p>Home Depot’s challenges are compounded by a weakening housing market, which can impact home improvement spending. Additionally, the shift in consumer preferences towards spending more on services than goods is affecting the company’s performance.</p>
<p>The company is responding to these changing dynamics by adjusting its pricing strategies. McPhail explained that Home Depot is currently experiencing a period of “price settling,” characterized by adjustments to retail prices, including instances of lowering prices in various categories.</p>
<p>Addressing concerns about inflation, McPhail assured that the company does not anticipate significant inflation in the latter half of the year. He highlighted the typical Home Depot customer remains financially stable, partially due to substantial home equity gains during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company’s shares have experienced a 4% increase year-to-date, which lags behind the broader <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a>&#8216;s nearly 17% gain over the same period. As of Monday’s close, the company&#8217;s shares were trading at $329.95, a slight decline of less than 1%.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jacobi-europe-first-bitcoin-etf/">Jacobi Asset Management Makes History with Europe&#8217;s First Bitcoin ETF Listing</a></p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s financial landscape is undergoing a significant change as Jacobi Asset Management company lists its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-an-exchange-traded-fund-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETF</a>) on Euronext, a stock exchange platform based in Amsterdam. The move comes two years after the investment vehicle was approved by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) in October 2021. The fund, named the Jacobi FT Wilshere Bitcoin ETF, was initially planned for release last year. But the company turned back on the plans due to the market conditions and other negative news in the industry, including the catastrophic collapse of the Terra (LUNA) blockchain and the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> fiasco.</p>
<p>After months of postponement, Jacobi finally announced on August 15 that the Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) spot ETF is now available for trading on the stock exchange. The investment fund will be traded on Euronext under the ticker BCOIN. Investors are charged a 1.5% annual management fee.</p>
<h2>Europe Beats the US with the Launch of BCOIN</h2>
<p>According to the official <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815404630/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a>, Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of the famous financial services company Fidelity Investments, will become the custodian of BCOIN. Similarly, Flow Traders has been authorized to serve as the official market maker for the fund, while Jane Street and DRW will serve as participants.</p>
<p>Regarding the fund&#8217;s benchmark, the FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index, Jacobi said that Wilshire Indexes would provide the services with the REC solution created in collaboration with the digital asset platform Zumo.</p>
<p>With the listing of this investment vehicle in Amsterdam, Europe, the continent has emerged as the first region to introduce BTC investing opportunities for traditional corporate investors, beating the US and Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up Bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want safe, secure access to the benefits of digital assets using familiar and regulated structures like our ETF,&#8221; said Martin Bednall, CEO of Jacobi Asset Management.</p>
<p>Despite multiple applications <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submitted</a> to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) over the years, none have been approved. Nonetheless, the tide may be shifting, with industry heavyweights like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> leading new applications designed to address concerns related to market manipulation.</p>
<h2>First Decarbonized Digital Asset Fund</h2>
<p>The Jacobi FT Wilshere Bitcoin ETF listing marks a significant achievement for the firm and the broader European crypto investment landscape. In a departure from exchange-traded notes (ETNs), this ETF introduces a fresh approach, offering investors direct ownership without the complexities associated with debt securities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike other products in the European market, which are debt instruments, our fund owns the underlying asset directly. Jacobi is proud to be supported by Tier1 partners at the forefront of this digital asset market evolution while pioneering an innovative, environmentally sound solution for European investors,&#8221; Bednall continued.</p>
<p>The fund goes beyond technological innovation – it embraces sustainability. Aligned with Article 8 of the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), the ETF is hailed as the first decarbonized digital asset fund. The partnership with digital asset platform Zumo facilitates the integration of a Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution, ensuring institutional investors align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives while participating in Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>As digital assets carve out a place within traditional finance, Jacobi&#8217;s debut as Europe&#8217;s first Bitcoin ETF showcases the region&#8217;s pioneering spirit in seizing transformative opportunities. By ushering in transparency, direct ownership, and sustainability considerations, the ETF marks a significant stride toward integrating digital assets into the heart of conventional financial systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tencent-music-q2-2023-revenue/">Tencent Music Reports Surge in Q2 2023 Revenue as More Chinese Users Pay</a></p>
<p>On Monday, August 15, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, China&#8217;s leading online music and entertainment platform, reported a surge in revenue for Q2 2023. The company&#8217;s total revenue, which stood at RMB7.29 billion (US$1.01 billion), surged by 5.5% from a year ago.</p>
<h2>Tencent Music in Q2 2023</h2>
<p>This growth specifically comes from the growth in the paying users on its Spotify-like music-streaming platform as well as the recovery in the advertising market. Following a period of cautious expenditure, businesses are beginning to witness a recovery, driven by indications of decreasing inflation and an improving consumer outlook for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>Revenues from the music subscription represented a 37.2% year-over-year growth. The count of active paying users rose to 99.4 million, marking a 20.2% increase compared to the previous year and a growth of 5.0 million users from the previous quarter. Mr. Cussion Pang, Executive Chairman of Tencent Music Entertainment <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-music-entertainment-group-announces-second-quarter-2023-unaudited-financial-results-301900506.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are pleased to report a solid second quarter, supported by the continued strong growth of our online music services. As we continue driving the healthy development of China&#8217;s online music industry, we have seen users become increasingly accustomed and willing to pay for copyrighted music, whether for songs they want to listen to or for premium listening features they enjoy. This trend is evidenced by the all-time high paying ratio and ARPPU recorded by our online music services in the reported quarter. Such achievements led to revenues from online music services exceeding that of social entertainment services for the first time in our Company&#8217;s history. This marks a significant step along TME&#8217;s growth trajectory.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>TME Plans Further Expansion</h2>
<p>The company has been increasing its original content offerings to draw in more users and counter competition from platforms like Cloud Music owned by NetEase and ByteDance&#8217;s Douyin, a short-video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Mr. Cussion Pang, the Executive Chairman of TME, has stated that the company has initiated several service enhancement and risk control measures since the latter part of the second quarter of 2023. These measures aim at fostering a more music-centric live-streaming atmosphere.</p>
<p>While these actions are expected to exert pressure on revenues from social entertainment services in the latter half of 2023, potentially impacting total revenues for the year, Mr. Pang believes that these measures will ultimately lead to an optimized user experience and contribute to the company&#8217;s long-term business development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ev-vinfast-nasdaq-spac/">EV Maker VinFast to Debut on Nasdaq Following SPAC Merger</a></p>
<p>Vietnamese Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturer, VinFast is set to debut on the tech-focused <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-nasdaq-composite-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq Composite</a> (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) this morning in New York. This significant step follows the successful completion of its merger with the US-listed Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), Black Spade.</p>
<p>CEO Le Thi Thu Thuy articulated the magnitude of VinFast’s achievement in a recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/vinfast-completes-spac-merger-set-to-start-trading-on-nasdaq.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It&#8217;s a big milestone for us to be listed in the US. The listing is going to open access to the capital markets for us in the future.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>VinFast’s Journey to Nasdaq</h2>
<p>VinFast&#8217;s journey to Nasdaq is a remarkable tale of ambition, innovation, and the convergence of global markets. Founded in 2017 as part of the Vingroup conglomerate, VinFast&#8217;s mission was to put Vietnam on the map as a serious contender in the automotive industry, focusing initially on traditional gasoline vehicles.</p>
<p>However, it did not take long for the company to pivot towards EVs, recognizing the critical role they play in addressing environmental concerns and the global shift toward sustainable transportation.</p>
<p>By 2021, VinFast had not only produced a line of electric automobiles but also electric buses and scooters, demonstrating its versatility and commitment to green mobility. This daring path caught the interest of investors, setting the road for its historic merger with Black Spade Acquisition.</p>
<p>The allure of SPACs lies in their ability to expedite <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initial Public Offering</a> (IPO) processes, offering companies like VinFast an efficient way to access capital markets. VinFast stated in a recent joint statement that its merger with Black Spade is valued at approximately $23 billion.</p>
<p>The merger not only elevated VinFast’s financial position but also integrated Black Spade as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the EV maker. Consequently, Black Spade is anticipated to delist from the New York Stock Exchange, streamlining VinFast’s presence on Nasdaq.</p>
<h2>VinFast Displays Competitive Edge in the US EV Market</h2>
<p>In the heart of the rapidly evolving EV market in the United States, the Vietnamese automaker is confidently carving out its niche.</p>
<p>Faced with giants such as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) and BYD VinFast’s CEO <a href="https://vinfastauto.us/newsroom/press-release/vinfast-and-black-spade-acquisition-co-complete-business-combination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted</a> the company’s strategy, which includes “offering premium quality products at affordable pricing with excellent after-sales service”. This strategy is the foundation of the company’s success, allowing it to present its goods as high-quality alternatives to other market competitors.</p>
<p>A notable example of VinFast’s pricing strategy is evident in its 5-seater VF 8 model, starting from $46,000, closely competing with the basic Tesla 5-seater Model Y priced from $47,740.</p>
<p>While Tesla benefits from federal tax credits for its vehicles, VinFast&#8217;s vehicles currently do not qualify for these incentives as they are not manufactured in the US. Notably, VinFast is constructing a manufacturing facility in North Carolina in order to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/vinfast-us-ipo-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhance</a> its foothold in the US.</p>
<p>With a projected annual capacity of up to 150,000 vehicles, the factory is poised to become a crucial asset in VinFast’s expansion strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/singapore-regulatory-framework-stablecoins/">Singapore Unveils Comprehensive Regulatory Framework for Stablecoins</a></p>
<p>Singapore, a global financial hub known for its innovative approach to technology and finance, has taken a decisive step in shaping the future of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/stablecoins-how-manage-operate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stablecoins</a> within its jurisdiction. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has introduced a detailed regulatory framework designed to ensure stability and security in issuing and operating single-currency stablecoins (SCS) around the city-state.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-finalises-stablecoin-regulatory-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> on August 15, the newly introduced regulatory framework comes after extensive consultations and assessments, reflecting the country&#8217;s commitment to responsible innovation in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Under these guidelines, stablecoins pegged 1:1 to the value of the Singapore dollar or any other G10 currency, such as the United States dollar, the European euro, and the British pound, when issued within Singapore, fall under the regulatory purview of MAS. However, MAS explained that the regulation is subject to currencies with a total circulation of over 5 million Singapore dollars ($3.7 million).</p>
<h2>Monetary Authority of Singapore Outlines Three-Day Transfer Window for SCS Stablecoins</h2>
<p>According to MAS, non-bank issuers of stablecoins exceeding S$5 million in circulation will be subject to these regulations, with such stablecoins designated as MAS-regulated stablecoins. While the framework will require legislative amendments for full enforcement, its introduction showcases the authority&#8217;s proactive approach to fostering responsible financial innovation.</p>
<p>The central bank authorities emphasized the importance of maintaining value stability for stablecoins. Reserves backing SCS are subject to stringent requirements pertaining to composition, valuation, custody, and audit. This ensures a high level of assurance regarding the stability of these tokens. Furthermore, the financial authorities have outlined three business days as the transfer window for moving SCS tokens, despite suggestions for a more robust time frame.</p>
<p>The authorities said that companies creating stablecoins must maintain a minimum base of capital and liquid assets, reducing the risk of insolvency and enabling a controlled business wind-down if necessary.</p>
<p>MAS also said in the announcement that only stablecoin issuers meeting the requirements of the newly introduced guidelines would only be considered for regulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only stablecoin issuers that fulfill all requirements under the framework can apply to MAS for their stablecoins to be recognized and labeled as &#8216;MAS-regulated stablecoin&#8217; This label will enable users to readily distinguish MAS-regulated stablecoins from other digital payment tokens, including &#8216;stablecoins&#8217; which are not subject to MAS&#8217; stablecoin regulatory framework,&#8221; MAS said in the announcement.</p>
<h2>Stablecoin Issuers Are Mandated to Full Disclosure</h2>
<p>Another aspect of the stablecoin guidelines includes full transparency. MAS said the newly introduced framework also requires issuers to promptly return the par value of stablecoins to holders within five business days of a redemption request.</p>
<p>Additionally, the financial regulator said that stablecoin creators in Singapore are mandated to provide users with comprehensive disclosures, including information about the value stabilizing mechanism, rights of stablecoin holders, and the results of reserve asset audits.</p>
<p>Ms. Ho Hern Shin, the deputy director at MAS, believes that stablecoins are a credible digital medium of exchange and potentially serve as a bridge between the traditional finance ecosystem and the emerging economy. The MAS director also encouraged issuers to start making early preparations for compliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We encourage SCS issuers who would like their stablecoins recognized as &#8216;MAS regulated stablecoins&#8217; to make early preparations for compliance,&#8221; Shin said.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/prime-trust-bankruptcy-protection/">Prime Trust Files for Bankruptcy Protection amidst Financial Struggles</a></p>
<p>Prime Trust, a crypto custodian company based in the United States, has officially <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X274/12452/PLEADINGS/1245208152380000000024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to its financial challenges. The filing was made in Delaware on August 15, with the company citing a significant shortfall in customer funds as the primary reason behind its drastic decision.</p>
<p>The latest filing comes a few weeks after the company&#8217;s subsidiary Banq filed for separate <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/banq-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bankruptcy</a> protection at the United States Bankruptcy Court in Nevada in June. Its parent company Prime Trust has followed in its footsteps, seeking Chapter 11 protection.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing revealed the company&#8217;s complex financial situation, estimating its liabilities to fall within $100 million to $500 million. The figure far outweighed its estimated assets worth between $50 million and $100 million. The company&#8217;s dire circumstances have compelled it to take action to address these financial discrepancies.</p>
<h2>$105M to Be Paid to Unsecured Creditors</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prime-trust-llc-files-voluntary-010000180.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> accompanying the filing, Prime Trust announced its intention to present a series of motions to the court. These motions aim to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of strategic alternatives available to the company. Among these options is the potential sale of its assets and operations, which could help stabilize its financial standing.</p>
<p>Part of the motion also includes plans to continue paying employees wages without restricting their full benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is anticipated that these motions will include requests to continue to pay wages and provide benefits to ongoing employees as usual,&#8221; Prime Trust said.</p>
<p>According to the court document, Prime Trust has between 25,000 and 50,000 creditors. This massive number of creditors highlights the wide-ranging impact of the company&#8217;s financial instability, affecting a substantial network of stakeholders.</p>
<p>In terms of creditors, the company&#8217;s top five unsecured creditors have asserted claims totaling around $105 million, with the largest single claim amounting to $55 million. The entities filing for Chapter 11 relief include Prime Core Technologies Inc., Prime Trust, LLC, Prime IRA LLC, and Prime Digital LLC.</p>
<h2>Genesis of Prime Trust&#8217;s Financial Woes</h2>
<p>Prime Trust&#8217;s financial woes started with crypto lender Celsius during the 2022 crypto winter, prompting the firm to shut down operations and subsequently initiate bankruptcy protection in a US court. According to reports, Prime Trust held up to $119 million of Celsius assets which it returned to the company after its business contract ended in 2021.</p>
<p>However, Celsius claimed that the company still held $17 million in crypto, which Prime Trust has refused to pay back. In August 2022, the bankrupt lender brought legal action against the Prime Trust to claw back the funds. The company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-provider-prime-17m-celsius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to return the crypto assets two months after the suit.</p>
<p>Aside from Celsius, Prime Trust faced other challenges. Most notably, Nevada&#8217;s Department of Business and Industry regulators issued a cease and desist order against the company on June 21, citing its inability to honor the customer&#8217;s withdrawal request.</p>
<p>According to the regulators, the company&#8217;s financial condition has significantly deteriorated, causing Prime Trust to default on withdrawal requests.</p>
<p>Shortly after the cease and desist order, the regulator took legal action against the company, successfully placing Prime Trust into receivership on July 18. This decision was based on the substantial disparity between the company&#8217;s assets and liabilities, revealing a significant financial gap.</p>
<h2>BitGo Backs Out Acquisition Deal with Prime Trust</h2>
<p>Aside from Prime Trust&#8217;s issues with Nevada regulators, the company also faced challenges when its rival BitGo, which wanted to buy out the firm, suddenly changed its heart and backed out of the deal in June. The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitgo-cancels-acquisition-prime-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">termination</a> of the supposed acquisition deal further heightened the company&#8217;s financial challenges.</p>
<p>The Prime Trust situation was exacerbated by regulatory findings that the firm had improperly utilized customer funds to fulfill withdrawals. The misuse of the funds allegedly began in December 2021, further adding to the company&#8217;s financial strain.</p>
<p>While the bankruptcy filing aims to provide a platform for evaluating strategic alternatives, the litany of problems faced by Prime Trust over the past year may complicate the search for a suitable buyer.</p>
