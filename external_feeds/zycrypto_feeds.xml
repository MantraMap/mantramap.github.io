<ul>
<li>Mark Cuban makes acquiring more Bitcoin a top priority in the new year and hopes to get them at a cheap price.</li>



<li>He takes a swipe at gold in comparison with digital assets and says BTC is a better way to store value.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Experts weigh in on the unending Gold versus Bitcoin debate in light of new points by Cuban.</li>
</ul>



<p>For the majority of bulls, this has been a disappointing year, but that is not the story of Mark Cuban, who sees new possibilities in the bear market.</p>



<p>The Shark Tank host revealed his plans to buy more Bitcoin (BTC) next year, restating his <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mark-cuban-deems-bitcoin-a-superior-store-of-value-but-maintains-dogecoin-will-dominate-payments-heres-why/">bullish</a> stance. He added that he wants the price of the top digital asset to go down more so that he can pick them up at a cheaper rate.</p>



<p><em>“I want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>Speaking on Bill Maher’s ‘Random Club’ podcast, the tech billionaire praised digital assets as the game changer of investments. He went ahead to diss gold, saying investing in gold “<em>isn’t worth it anyway.”</em></p>



<p>He added that owning gold these days is exactly like owning a digital transaction, and he would rather invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets to expand his portfolio.</p>



<p>The billionaire finally referred to Bitcoin as a safer investment than gold making reference to how gold can be easily stolen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Gold is a store of value, and so is Bitcoin. If everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f*** out of you or kill you and take your gold bar. It’s useless.”</em></p>



<h2 id="h-the-unending-debate">The unending debate&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Mark Cuban has not always been on the side of bitcoin as he was once a major critic, but the Dallas Maverick owner says he now sees it as a wise investment. During the show, Maher argued that Bitcoin is not backed by anything, making it a risky investment, but Cuban fired back by claiming that holding “<em>shares in 90% of companies out there” </em>are pointless. </p>



<p>After a turbulent year for the market leader, which saw it lose over 55% of its market cap and 75% of its value since its all-time high last year, BTC currently trades at $16,862. Gold, on the other hand, has had a better 2022, selling at $1,800 per ounce. </p>



<p>Mark Cuban is a huge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/billionaires-elon-musk-and-mark-cuban-bullish-on-dogecoin-as-doge-dominates-traditional-retail-market/">investor</a> in Polygon, BTC, Ethereum, Dogecoin (DOGE), etc., and his Dallas Mavericks outfit has incorporated DOGE payments.</p>

<p>iPhone users can now stake <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-price-massively-discounted-ada-envisioned-to-moon-dramatically-in-2023/">Cardano&#8217;s</a> native token ADA on the Trust wallet, earn interest, and secure the platform. The official Binance self-custody wallet app rolled out the service for Android users in December.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the staking option is done in three simple steps. You first send $ADA to the Trust wallet and click the &#8216;stake&#8217; button on their login address. Then select the validator to stake with.</p>



<p>The wallet team added that staking rewards are not automatically rolled over and that one must have at least 4 ADA to stake and unstake their funds. As reported by Binance, data shows that the Cardano network increased smart contract usage by 340% in 2021 amid a growing developer interest, despite the ongoing bear cycle. </p>



<p>Some of the benefits that iOS users will enjoy from the new offering include direct ADA purchases from the Trust Wallet app. According to the announcement, users can also transfer and receive ADA through a single application, including a unified interface for tracking price movements of their stored assets for a better trading strategy. The latest app supporting Trust wallet via Cardano&#8217;s network is version 6.16.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-increasing-popularity-of-cardano-s-monthly-active-users-and-the-popularity-of-self-custody-wallets"><strong>The increasing popularity of Cardano&#8217;s monthly active users and the popularity of self-custody wallets</strong></h2>



<p>Further, following the collapse of FTX, there is a growing trend of individual and institutional investors moving their funds to self-custodial wallets. Analytics platform CryptoCompare shows that the increasing popularity of the wallets has expanded Cardano&#8217;s active users by 5.34% to 2.32 million as of last month, the highest volume ever recorded since April.</p>



<p>According to its website, Trust Wallet is a non-custodial wallet powering more than 3 million crypto assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs.) The platform supports over 65 blockchains and lets users store their private keys away from centralized exchanges. It is used by more than 50 million people globally.</p>



<p>Described by its co-founder <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-says-indias-anti-crypto-regulatory-environment-is-preventing-cardanos-entry/">Charles Hoskinson</a> as the third generation of blockchain, Cardano is an open-source consensus, which boasts more than 1,000 projects building on it. The blockchain uses a proof of stake consensus algorithm to secure its transactions, powered by its native token, ADA, which is used for settling transaction fees on the blockchain.</p>

<p>Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sees-new-twist-as-ripple-and-sec-push-for-extension-of-joint-motion-to-january-13/">XRP</a> gained upwards of 6% in the last week up to December 27, following the announcement that the blockchain was working with Micronesia island nation Palau on a stablecoin project. During a cryptocurrency conference held in Singapore, the President of the Western Pacific nation, Surangel Whipps Jr., said his country was involved in various crypto projects, including a government-issued stablecoin in collaboration with Ripple.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Palau is also taking a step in collaborating with Ripple to explore the creation of national stablecoin, which we hope to launch soon and help make payments easy and secure&#8221;.</em> Whipps added that Palau was also in talks with Binance to launch a &#8220;<em>digital residency country in the country.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>In November, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-counsel-gives-strong-argument-about-xrp-as-landmark-lawsuit-nears-end/">Ripple</a> released a white paper on the importance of stablecoins in 2023. The company foresees a case where more and more institutional investors will continue to use cross-chain capability. In addition, the new stablecoin will reportedly be designed in an eco-friendly manner.</p>



<p>The blockchain wrote on its website that &#8220;<em>Ripple is working with the Republic of Palau to help explore a potential government-backed stablecoin on the public XRP (XRP Ledger). The ledger’s inherently green design is highly important to a country known for its leadership on climate issues.</em>&#8220;</p>



<h2 id="h-palau-banks-on-crypto-to-diversify-its-economy"><strong>Palau Banks On Crypto To Diversify Its Economy</strong></h2>



<p>The President of the Archipelago of more than 500 islands stated that as a small country, it was essential to look for ways to broaden its economy, including taking advantage of new technologies. One includes a Digital Residency Act, marketed as ideal for making easy and secure payments.</p>



<p>Palau is also banking on support from the co-founder of Ethereum, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-discloses-three-landmark-opportunities-for-crypto-in-2023/">Vitalik Buterin</a>, around the option of opening up the R&amp;S ID ecosystem to the developer community. About whether a private or decentralized crypto ecosystem and CBDC could complement each other, Whipps opined that the two were symbiotic. &#8220;<em>In developing our collaboration with Ripple, we aim to have a USD-backed stablecoin, which is a step towards our own CBDC, you could say.</em>&#8220;</p>

<p>Recent reports by on-chain analyst, BowTiedIguana, now suggest that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-arrest-of-sam-bankman-fried-only-marks-the-start-of-expected-lengthy-legal-proceedings/">Sam Bankman Fried</a>, the embattled FTX co-founder, may have pulled out 570ETH worth close to $682,000 from his wallet, potentially violating the conditions for bail set by the court.</p>



<p>According to the published tweets, a cursory look at on-chain transactions suggests that SBF may have moved funds from a Sushiswap address inherited in 2020 after the takeover of the embattled exchange. BowTiedIguana identifies 32 separate wallet addresses belonging to Alameda Research which contributed up to 56% of the transferred funds, with the remaining $322,000 from other addresses.</p>



<p>According to the pseudonymous analyst, all funds were transferred to Renbridge, Fixedfloat and another Seychelles-based crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The withdrawal, if proven true, may indicate a violation of the bail condition stipulating that SBF remains under house arrest at his parent’s home and without access to personal funds above $1000 unless authorized. Such a violation will set sail for paying a $250 million bail bond or possible jail time spanning decades.</p>



<p>An intelligence report from Arkham suggests that Alameda Research, FTX&#8217;s indicted subsidiary, have gone on a secret selling spree, offloading close to $1.7 million worth of Ethereum-based tokens into BTC and USDT stablecoins. The Carol Ellison-run company has lost or sold nearly 20% of its $140 million token stack since November.</p>



<p>Besides splashing $546 million on Robinhood stocks, SBF&#8217;s flamboyant lifestyle includes a $300 million Bahamas estate, another $40 million penthouse, and a $16.4 million family house, among others. It is unclear if these properties will form part of the bankruptcy seizures as aggrieved creditors stack higher than the empire state.</p>



<p>However, the court will have to prove that SBF tampered with assets earmarked for bankruptcy payments and not monies from his personal entitlements. Much of SBF’s assets – approximately $3.5 Billion – have been seized by securities regulators back in the Bahamas, where SBF lived lavishly before his arrest and extradition, securities regulators have seized close to $3.5 billion in assets.</p>



<p>SBF, last week, opted for extradition to the US, where both parents are law professors, after harsh prison conditions in the Bahamas threatened his wellbeing in detention, and he has been placed in compulsory parent custody. Gary Wang and Carol Ellison, close associates of SBF, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sbf-bags-250-million-bail-could-face-up-to-100-years-in-jail-as-close-associates-plead-guilty/">have pleaded guilty</a> to fraud and corruption, opening up the possibility of more findings on mismanagement by the disgraced co-founder.</p>



<p>Damages did by the fall of FTX ripple far beyond monetary losses. A staggering 9,500 workers have been laid off within the space, most emanating from crypto exchanges that recently have lost public trust and investor confidence.</p>

<p>Solana, the crypto once backed by FTX’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-arrest-of-sam-bankman-fried-only-marks-the-start-of-expected-lengthy-legal-proceedings/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, is one of the leading Layer 1 networks to have suffered in the enduring crypto winter. Despite the prices of top crypto assets like bitcoin and Ethereum remaining relatively stable over the last four weeks, SOL has bled out.</p>



<p>However, the Solana token somewhat stemmed the brutal losing skid on December 30 after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin voiced support for the rival blockchain project. In a tweet, he commented that the network has a “bright future”.</p>



<h2 id="h-sol-still-down-97-from-november-2021-ath"><strong>SOL Still Down 97% From November 2021 ATH</strong></h2>



<p>Once among the most valuable cryptos on the market, Solana has since joined the ranks of the worst-performing tokens of 2022.</p>



<p>The so-called Ethereum killer sank as low as $8.17 on Thursday, the lowest price level since February 2021. While the year has been brutal for the markets, SOL has taken a more severe beating following news of FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy. The cryptocurrency was once highly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-home-to-immense-network-activity-as-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-expresses-faith-in-the-blockchain-amid-outages/">praised </a>by alleged con artist Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>Even at the slightly rebounded price of $9.16 as of publication, Solana is down 22.4% over the past seven days and 34.6% in a two-week time frame. Overall, SOL has lost 97% of its value since peaking at $259.96 in November 2021, compared to a 76% decline for Bitcoin and Ethereum from their respective all-time highs the same month. SOL is also down 94.7% since the start of the year.</p>



<p>Solana’s market capitalization now stands at $3.5 billion, which makes it the world’s 17th biggest crypto asset, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>



<h2><strong>The Future Is Bright For The High-Speed Layer 1: Buterin</strong></h2>



<p>Writing in a tweet on December 30, right before Solana’s recovery started, Ethereum whiz Vitalik Buterin noted that “awful opportunistic money people have been washed out.&#8221;</p>



<p>This year, a lot of investors invested in SOL with the hopes of reaping huge financial rewards within a short time without necessarily caring about the future of the blockchain. With such investors now wiped out, Vitalik thinks it&#8217;s time for honest developers passionate about the Solana network to shine.</p>



<p><em>“Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future,” the Ethereum creator tweeted.</em></p>



<p>While the network has many challenges to overcome, including repeated outages, it&#8217;s abundantly clear that many positive developments could be on the horizon for the Solana protocol. In June, Solana <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shattering-crypto-adoption-barrier-solana-labs-to-launch-its-own-web-3-android-smartphone/">announced </a>it was launching a Web3 phone called Saga.</p>



<p><em>“Hard for me to tell from outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive,” Buterin summarized.</em></p>

<p>A trove of mixed feelings trailed the crypto community as one of its foremost Bitcoin evangelists, Michael Saylor, announced an additional purchase of 2,500 BTCs. In a tweet yesterday afternoon, Saylor disclosed that his company had gone Bitcoin shopping over the last seven weeks at a price of approximately $16,500 per BTC, bringing the company’s total BTC stack to 132,500.</p>



<p>Saylor’s tweet sparked mixed reactions as a camp of crypto enthusiasts hailed the move as encouraging, while others warned of the risks of centralization. Previous buys had earned the 57-year-old crypto proponent the title “gigachad” and with the new purchase, Saylor is to be known as a ‘rockstar.’</p>



<p>The duo of Willy Woo and Dan Held – popular crypto analysts – took turns to explain Saylor’s move as both healthy and unhealthy for crypto. Woo added that Bitcoiners should only celebrate the adoption of Bitcoin by: “normal people using it to solve problems.” In a clap back, Dan Held labelled the fear of centralization as “unnecessary” as network structure and control of Bitcoin remains decentralized regardless, and holding power does not necessarily translate to control of the distribution. Held’s counter-argument hinged based on the fact that the purchase of Bitcoin can not be controlled or regulated if decentralization is anything to go by.</p>



<p>Amidst surrounding arguments, this round of purchases marks the fifth Saylor’s company has made since 2022 – a stash originally worth over $4 billion and with a growing loss value to the tune of $1.9 billion.</p>



<p>Michael’s dedication to promoting Bitcoin has created a small cesspool of pro-Bitcoin devotees eager to keep buying and continue holding till the embattled crypto trailblazer flashes a hopeful silver lining.</p>



<p>But the Virginia-based company itself, many have not stayed true to the buy-and-hold mission. In July, rumours erupted of a possible sell-off to the tune of approximately 132,000 BTC as online data tracking website, Cryptoquant, traced the transaction to a Coinbase-based wallet address. But as financial reports have shown, Saylor’s only recent sell-off happened barely a week ago, and it was for the reasons of offsetting capital gains that 704 BTCs were sold.</p>



<p>The embattled crypto believer still remains optimistic about a green comeback for Bitcoin even as he hopes to come out of a tax evasion charge by the District of Columbia, which implicates <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mammoth-btc-whale-the-chinese-government-holds-more-bitcoin-than-michael-saylors-microstrategy/">MicroStrategy</a>.</p>



<p>With the latest purchase, MicroStrategy has become the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>On-chain data gives compelling reasons why <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-developers-roll-out-new-ultra-bullish-innovations-ahead-of-2023/">Cardano</a> is trading at a substantially discounted price. In a blog post on Monday, Santiment argues that ADA has grown, but the price hasn’t kept pace in 2022. Does this mean the token will moon in 2023?</p>



<h2 id="h-metrics-point-to-ada-being-underpriced"><strong>Metrics Point To ADA Being Underpriced</strong></h2>



<p>Cardano is dramatically undervalued compared to Ethereum, Solana, and other top competitors.</p>



<p>Blockchain analytics firm Santiment published a blog post highlighting some signals that ADA sellers are slowly getting exhausted. There are fewer coins at a loss on the blockchain on every ADA price downswing, meaning the selling power is continually declining.</p>



<p>Another reason to be optimistic is the decreasing trading volumes. This is typically one of the strongest trend reversal signals in crypto markets. As this trend continues, the bears or bulls gradually lose their grip leading to a trend reversal. Such a scenario could be witnessed for ADA in 2023, especially if the broader crypto market is recovering. Santiment analysts believe ADA’s price will “increase in value” based on the aforementioned indicators, though it&#8217;s not guaranteed.</p>



<h2><strong>Is ADA Bullish Or Nah?</strong></h2>



<p>It’s been quite a rough year for markets, and crypto hasn’t been spared in the fallout.</p>



<p>The near-term outlook for Cardano looks bleak. Despite Santiment suggesting the coin is trading far below its actual value.</p>



<p>ADA cryptocurrency is down 2.59% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.2514. At its peak in September 2021, it traded at $3.09, according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko.</p>



<p>Even as new entrants join the market and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sharks-scoop-up-83-million-worth-of-ada-even-as-price-continues-to-head-south/">sharks accumulate</a>, the global macro environment, dwindling investor confidence, and recent price action hint that there’s no apparent reason for the ADA narrative to flip bullish anytime soon.</p>

<ul>
<li>The rebranded Terra Luna token has surged double-digit with record inflows.</li>



<li>Binance’s Terra LUNA airdrop distribution to LUNC holders could be behind the gains.</li>
</ul>



<p>LUNC – the original crypto of Terra Luna – jumped 16% on Dec.27 to an intraday high of $0.0001848, beating Bitcoin to become the top performer in the festive season. On the other hand, the flagship crypto was trading at $16,787 in the same period, per CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>In December, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-second-round-of-terra-luna-airdrop-distribution-to-terra-classic-lunc-and-terraclassicusd-ustc-holders-6c9ca64a94064973a273328edc99019a">announced</a> that it had completed the second round of airdrop distribution to Terra Classic (LUNC) and TerraClassicUSD (USTC) holders. The announcement added that the next distribution would come in Dec. 2022 or June 2023. Besides, there have been significant activities on the blockchain. Among them, the Terra Classic Shuttle bridge will reportedly ‘‘sunset’’ at the end of January 2023.</p>



<p>In that regard, Terra Classic urged users to ‘‘<em>strongly bridge assets back to Terra using classic-bridge.Terra.money before January 31 for the funds not to disappear.</em>’’ The announcement, however, noted that assets affected do not include the transfers via Wormhole of IBC. Assets bridged through the two platforms will be available on Terra Bridge Classic up to May 30, 2023.</p>



<h2 id="h-lunc-records-high-inflows-defying-reports-its-founder-do-kwon-is-still-at-large"><strong>LUNC Records High Inflows Defying Reports Its Founder, Do Kwon, Is Still at Large</strong></h2>



<p>In the same period, Terra Classic has recorded a surge in inflows – rising to $1.1 billion on Dec.27 from a low of $861 million on Dec.26 – representing an increase of 27%. Pundits argue the surge could be tied to the efforts by Terra Classic to revive the ecosystem since its spectacular collapse in May.</p>



<p>A token burn mechanism is part of the efforts to reduce the circulating LUNC supply. The burn has received support from industry players, including Binance – which has agreed to burn LUNC and margin trading fees.</p>



<p>LUNC bullish sentiment is despite reports that Terra co-founder Do Kwon was hiding in Serbia to escape fraud charges levelled against him by The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors, who have been following him for months. On-chain data further confirmed that the disgraced blockchain entrepreneur had cashed out $120,000 worth of BTC from Luna Foundation Guard while in hiding.</p>

<li>The much-anticipated metaverse has suffered a string of losses ranging from dwindling daily users to billions wiped off its market capitalization.</li>



<li>After investing billions in the project, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta lost almost 75% in value as its augmented reality division recorded losses in each quarter.</li>



<li>Investors across metaverse platforms are optimistic that just like the crypto winter ravaging the whole sector, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.</li>
</ul>



<p>If wishes were granted on the metaverse, the first would be to delete the year 2022 from the history books and push on with the highs of 2021.</p>



<p>The metaverse had resonated in crypto spaces for a while but boomed in late 2021 when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg joined the train announcing a metaverse platform and changing the company’s name to Meta.</p>



<p>This year may have crushed the hopes of many as the metaverse recorded a series of unfortunate events. Leading the pack is Meta&#8217;s poor outing this year. Their flagship game, Horizon Worlds, has fallen short of users&#8217; expectations. Things got out of hand when it was revealed that Meta’s staff were unhappy with the game.</p>



<p>Away from Horizon Worlds, Meta’s virtual reality division <a href="https://zycrypto.com/meta-reports-a-3-67-billion-loss-in-its-metaverse-division-signaling-more-problems-for-the-company/">lost</a> over $3 billion in the third quarter of 2022, a shocking increase from its second-quarter loss of $2.7 billion. Meta’s financial losses led to the company letting go of about 13% of its employees after Zuckerberg announced that it would sack 11,000 employees.</p>



<p>Following Meta closely are Sandbox and Decentraland, who were tipped to become the future of the metaverse after early prospects. After losing thousands of daily users this year, both platforms have recorded a combined loss, almost hitting $10 billion, with Sandbox losing $4.4 billion while Decentraland lost $4.92 billion.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel"><strong>Is there light at the end of the tunnel?</strong></h2>



<p>After an abysmal 2022 by the future of the internet, several users have lost their early bullish drive in the sector. However, executives and creators in the sector remain hopeful that just like the crypto winter and seasonal bear market, the downtrend in the metaverse will soon be an old story. </p>



<p>Despite record losses this year, Zuckerberg has asked users to keep the faith alive because of the “<em>countless possibilities</em>” that come with the metaverse. On the technology, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/zuckerberg-optimistic-metaverse-will-pick-despite-2b-quarterly-losses/">acknowledged</a> the fact that graphics are not so great at the moment but restated his commitment to a “<em>better experience in the future</em>.”</p>



<p>Sebastien Borget, the co-founder of Sandbox, has expressed optimism in the small successes recorded this year across metaverse platforms and hopes for a greater 2023 in the industry.</p>

<p>The ranging inflation figures witnessed in 2022 have plunged households across the globe to contend with rising food, rent, and energy prices. The stubborn inflation has compelled multiple central banks to embrace contractionary monetary policies. The macroeconomic tool has aimed at reducing the money supply – cash and readily cashable funds circulation in the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Primarily, the majority of central banks, such as the Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of England (BoE), have raised interest rates to cool the demand fueling inflation by making borrowing expensive for borrowers. The hawkish policy imposed to curb inflation has influenced the pricing of risky assets.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency assets are no exemptions from the reaction to the aggressive monetary policy, particularly after consistently remaining uncoupled from the leading risk and uncertainty indicators. The price movements in the global crypto market have displayed an observable reaction to each interest hike announced by the Fed and BoE to rein inflation.</p>



<p>Investors of high-risk assets consider higher interest rates to imply a lower appetite for high-return assets such as crypto assets. With the cryptocurrency market increasingly correlated to the stocks, the bearish steam portrayed by the crypto in 2022 is a consequence of the worsening macroeconomic outlook.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-impact-of-interest-hikes-on-the-crypto-market"><strong>Impact of Interest Hikes on the Crypto Market</strong></h2>



<p>A review of the recent crypto market downtrend reveals the impact of the interest hikes. In particular, the Federal Reserve meeting on January 26 plunged Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price by 6% from the $38,000 support level to $35,600 in a day. The adverse impact of the Fed&#8217;s tight monetary policy traces to the FOMC December 14-15 minutes released on January 5, 2022. The publication eroded BTC, the largest crypto asset per CoinMarketCap data, price by $3200 to exchange at $43200 in hours. The reaction to the interest rate increase sank BTC price by 10% to $41,500 a few days later.  </p>



<p>Since the FOMC publication early this year, BTC has led other crypto assets on a longer-term bloodbath. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $797 Billion, a 75.36% loss in total value from one year ago, according to CoinGecko data captured in Figure 1 below. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tOZIcz_5Wj3uhYRJfIqGUPbCCtrOiBJc7p92Jxtam1rcgDXri4HSxVgk8EzoRrg0FvRI5Ps0E9Clh1vU3U0Gw6qDuaYxjmLYf1SbNmdDpWYNGd7Z392YEqq2YPljbzwsXd6LirjOzsPkX2C1F_R0Q7x47_Lc5htmvnkU4M_gOKScHqXqJUpvnuB2ometM2jbjOrkvm6EjA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The downward spiral displayed above is an accumulative effect of the Fed&#8217;s increasing hawkishness, delivering a depressive market sentiment to crypto investors. The hawkish stance demonstrated by Fed in 2022 is the driving factor of downswings witnessed in risky assets and turning 2022 into a bearish year of the global crypto market.</p>



<p>Fed&#8217;s decision to raise the federal benchmark rate by 25 basis points on March 16 2022, to a target range of 0.25%-0.50% wielded power over the crypto market, with its total value plummeting to $1.788 trillion. The market capitalization slipped to $1.286 trillion in the subsequent May 4 announcement to increase the target range to 0.75% and 1% and reduce its balance sheet through treasury and mortgage-backed securities disposal.</p>



<p>The elevated inflation led to a 75 basis points increase on June 15, raising the target range to 1.5% &#8211; 1.75%. The crypto market reacted to the higher Fed&#8217;s fund rate with a $411 billion decline to a total value of $875.772 billion. </p>



<p>The July 27 review through the Consumer Price Index illustrated that inflation rose to 9.1%. It compelled the Fed to announce a 0.75% increment to the target range of 1.5% and 1.75%. It coincided with the BoE&#8217;s 50 basis points increment of the interest rate- the highest in 27 years. The two largest single-rate increments brought widespread consequences that restricted the total crypto market value to $899.752 billion.</p>



<p>The crypto market gained bearish steam following the September 21 announcement when the Fed replicated the previous increment in July of 0.75%, pushing the target range to 2.25% &#8211; 2.5%. Similarly, BoE replicated the half-point increment in July, targeting a 2.25% benchmark rate to arrest the climbing inflationary pressure that has outpaced other major economies. It prompted the projection of looming recession threats with a sizable value of crypto assets eroded.</p>



<h2><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>



<p>Surging inflation rates witnessed across major economies have defied the tight monetary policies. In particular, the BoE is concerned with the deteriorating economic outlook acknowledged by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) during the CPI reading indicating inflation burst to 10.1%. The re-emergence of double-figure inflation dashes hopes of a dovish monetary policy from the BoE.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, BoE&#8217;s governor, Andrew Bailey, admitted that a substantial interest rate hike is imminent, with inflation unlikely to fall amidst higher energy bills in winter. The Federal Reserve is under immense pressure from the September CPI reading released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, indicating an 8.2% rise. The soaring inflation reported in the UK and US constitutes ground for consecutive tighter monetary policies that will have widespread consequences for high-risk investments. Higher benchmark interest rates in Fed and BoE rate-setting announcements will accelerate further crypto meltdown in the last quarter, making 2022 a bearish year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coinbase Institutional predicts that BTC and ETH could surge in 2023.</li>



<li>The exchange is also optimistic about the future of DeFi and self-custody wallets.</li>
</ul>



<p>Coinbase Institutional has released a series of predictions on Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, and crypto mining in its <em>2023 Crypto Market Outlook report. </em>The exchange predicts significant growth in major cryptocurrencies, particularly BTC and ETH, next year. Not so for the non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies besides Ethereum. The research predicts an extended crypto winter in the segment.</p>



<p>The report said, &#8220;<em>We expect digital asset selection will transition towards higher-quality names like bitcoin and ether based on factors (of) sustainable token economics, the maturity of respective ecosystems, and relevant market liquidity</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Coinbase attributed the selection to macroeconomic factors, including high inflation rates, rising borrowing costs, and low equity earnings. According to the research firm, the bearish outlook comes despite relief from the earlier-feared economic recession in the US. Elevated job numbers and government-backed stimulus is boosting the economy, and riskier assets could see a steady recovery next year.</p>



<p>Regarding risk assets, the platform noted that the correlations between cryptocurrencies and traditional risk assets remain. &#8220;<em>We assign a low probability to the chances that crypto performance will decouple from traditional risk assets in the first few months of 2023, particularly without a differentiated catalyst</em>.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="h-ethereum-s-dominance-could-be-challenged-in-2023"><strong>Ethereum&#8217;s dominance could be challenged in 2023</strong></h2>



<p>The 57-page report foresees that the dominance of the second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, could change next year. Furthermore, it raised concerns about the blockchain&#8217;s reliance on layer-2 solutions, citing fraud and a lack of interoperability.</p>



<p>Overall, Coinbase believes that altcoins could take a long time to recover in 2023 due to the impact of deleveraging – referring to attempts by corporations to reduce their debt – following the recent events in the sector. Specifically, with the collapse of FTX, DeFi platforms that had loaned their assets to market makers on the exchange were affected and may have to wait longer before receiving funds.</p>



<p>Coinbase Institutional believes we could see notable expansion in DeFi and self-custody wallets. The report praised DeFi for its on-chain and auditable properties, which could attract investors moving away from the not-so-transparent centralized exchanges. That does not mean that DeFi is free from drawbacks. The report shows rising cases of smart contracts exploits, price volatility, and the demand-supply imbalance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Former US President Donald Trump expresses delight over his newly released NFTs and says the art is “sort of cute.” </li>



<li>The NFTs, which sold out in 12 hours, have raked in over $1 million though Trump claims he does not see it as an investment.</li>



<li>NFT lovers praise Trump, and they want more political actors to mint art in the coming months.</li>
</ul>



<p>People in several works of life have released non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for many reasons ranging from investments, value, artistic expression, etc.</p>



<p>Former United States Commander-in-Chief says his newly released NFTs were motivated by his love for the art as the images of him were “<em>sort of cute.” </em>In an interview with One America News, he said the release was not a form of investment but rather an artistic endeavour. </p>



<p>“<em>I didn&#8217;t view it as an investment. I viewed it as &#8211; I thought they were cute. For $99, you&#8217;re getting these visions that are very beautiful and interesting, I think, and I viewed it that way much more so than as an NFT,” </em>said Trump.</p>



<p>Trump went further, revealing that he had no prior knowledge about how digital art works before releasing the NFTs, which depicted him as a hero.</p>



<p>“<em>Well, I knew nothing about them, and then a group came and I loved the art. They showed me the art. You know, it&#8217;s sort of comic book art when you think of it, but they showed me the art and I said, gee, I always wanted to have a 30-inch waist.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Trump <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-is-selling-superman-themed-nft-trading-cards/">released</a> his NFTs, which depicted him as a superhero, astronaut, and cowboy, in December amid several criticisms. Despite the talks, the card was sold out in an incredible 12 hours for about $99 in the initial release, and it is reported to have raked in over $1 million to the creators.</p>



<h2 id="h-bad-year-for-nfts"><strong>Bad year for NFTs</strong></h2>



<p>Like the wider digital asset market, 2022 was terrible for digital art compared to landmarks attained in 2021. From poor volumes to a general waning interest by collectors, NFTs fell short in all metrics this year. NFT marketplace giant OpenSea recorded a sharp decline this year as trading volume dropped from $3 billion in September 2021 to $350 million in September 2022.</p>



<p>The fall of NFTs worsened as metaverse platforms <a href="https://zycrypto.com/metaverse-projects-struggle-as-trading-volumes-plunge-by-nearly-80-casting-doubt-over-the-industry/">recorded</a> fewer daily users and creeping NFT purchases compared to the previous year. Despite the fall, celebrities and other media personalities have continued to drop more projects, with more users hoping for a pickup in 2023.</p>

<p>The Ripple and SEC case continues to take new turns as it approaches settlement. Crypto-focused investment firm Paradigm Operations LP&#8217;s application to join the case as an amicus curiae has gotten further backing from an interested attorney.</p>



<p>Lewis Rinaudo Cohen, the co-founder of blockchain-focused law firm DLx Law LLP, has filed a motion to appear as &#8216;pro hac vice&#8217; on behalf of the investment firm. Attorney James K. Filan, a prominent XRP community influencer, first noted the development.</p>



<p>Pro hac vice is a legal term for adding an attorney to a case in a jurisdiction where they are not authorized to practice. Cohen noted in his filing that he is a member in good standing with New York and DC bars. The filing adds that he is not facing any pending disciplinary action in any state or federal court, keeping with legal protocol.</p>



<p>Paradigm first filed its amicus brief in November in a show of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-coinbase-asks-court-for-permission-to-support-ripple/">support for Ripple</a>. An amicus curiae, also known as a “friend of the court,” is an individual or organization not a party to a legal dispute. The third party can assist the court by providing relevant information, expertise, or insight. </p>



<p>Previously, lawyer Rodrigo Seira filed a motion requesting to appear as pro hac vice on behalf of Paradigm Operations LP in the case. Attorney Michelle Kallen of Jenner &amp; Block LLP also filed a similar motion.</p>



<h2 id="h-xrp-community-members-hungry-for-a-close-of-the-case"><strong>XRP community members hungry for a close of the case</strong></h2>



<p>Members of the XRP community have pointed out that the filings may have come too late. This is because they may no longer impact the judge&#8217;s decision. Some opine that the filings may be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-eager-to-receive-verdict-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-as-attorney-sets-tentative-settlement-date/">stalling the case</a>, which has already gone on for too long.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ripple and the SEC have filed their final briefs requesting summary judgment in the case. The entire XRP community is focused on when presiding judge Analisa Torres will make her ruling on the case.</p>



<p>Attorney Filan has predicted that this ruling may come in around March 2023. If this ruling arrives in favour of Ripple, the community expects the price of XRP to skyrocket as investor confidence returns.</p>



<p>The expectation is tied to the regulatory clarity that XRP will have with such an outcome. In contrast, an outcome favouring the SEC would largely enable the SEC to go after more crypto firms. XRP trades at around $0.36, down 2.18% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Cardano, the third largest proof of stake cryptocurrency, continued to fall during the weekend as traders took leave to celebrate the Christmas holiday. At press time on Sunday, ADA was trading at $0.2596 after a 0.68% drop in the past 24 hours, with the coin’s trading volume plunging by roughly 36.28%, according to data by CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>Ostensibly, this holiday season hasn’t exactly been filled with cheer for crypto investors. Apart from battling inflation and market volatility, a recession seems to be looming ahead, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-sentiments-reveal-historically-bullish-indicator-has-surfaced/">keeping cryptos</a> such as Bitcoin, Ethereum Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu enmeshed. Since tapping an all-time high of $3.10 last November, Cardano has plunged by over 91.64%, the highest among all the other top 10 cryptos by market cap.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-sharks-accumulating-ada-rapidly"><strong>Cardano Sharks Accumulating ADA Rapidly</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the brutal winter, Cardano sharks seem to be splurging more money towards ADA at current discounted prices. According to on-chain and social metrics platform Santiment, ADA key shark addresses now hold 4 billion ADA after accumulating 331M more since the FTX implosion. Sharks for this particular cryptocurrency as addresses which hold 10,000-100,000 ADA.</p>



<p>As per the firm, whereas these addresses have been accumulating steadily since June 2021, they seem to have taken this level of dip buying to a new level since the FTX fallout in early November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Addresses holding 10k to 100k </em><em>ADA</em><em> have added $83M worth of coins since November 7</em><em><sup>th</sup></em><em>,”</em> wrote Santiment. Notably, this cohort currently holds its largest percentage of supply in 1.5 years, that is, since June 2021.</p>



<h2><strong>Key Metrics Encourage Investors</strong></h2>



<p>Besides large addresses adding to their bags, over 200,000 new Cardano wallets have been added in November alone. According to data provided by the Cardano Foundation, the overall number of wallets has risen to 3.80M from just under 3.62 million at the start of November. The cryptocurrency network also recounts <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-reigns-as-the-most-developed-crypto-asset-as-ada-leaps-forward/">explosive growth</a> since 2021, with the number of smart contracts based on Plutus, a smart contracts platform by Cardano, surging by 394% to 4,445.</p>



<p>Furthermore, roughly 7.30M native tokens are already running on Cardano after a 192% spike in the past year, with the number of transactions surpassing 56.9 million, up 139% from 2021. Although these developments are yet to show in price, large investors are likely to continue purchasing ADA with the incentive to hold it for longer as their focus increasingly shifts from value rather than hype-driven investments.</p>
