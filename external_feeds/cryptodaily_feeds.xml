			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Toronto, Canada, 28th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><ul>
  <li>Dr. Ming Wu, co-founder of Conflux Network, was invited to Hong Kong to speak with various government and private organizations about the digital economy, innovation and technology, and has reached an initial strategic cooperation intention.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Conflux is already in the process of registering related entities for the entry into Hong Kong, solidifying its role as foundational infrastructure for Web3.</li>
  <li>This follows October&rsquo;s announcement of the &nbsp;&ldquo;Policy Declaration on the Development of Hong Kong Virtual Assets&rdquo; which has paved the way for a more hospitable blockchain environment in Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Ming Wu, Co-Founder of Conflux Network, &nbsp;was invited by the Hong Kong Government to discuss the rise of tech innovation through Web3 and how the Conflux Network could play a foundational role in these developments. During the visit, Dr. Ming Wu had an in-depth discussion with the heads and reception staff of various institutions under the new "Policy Declaration on the Development of Hong Kong Virtual Assets" officially released in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past several years, stringent COVID-19 travel control measures and regulatory uncertainty saw many Hong Kong blockchain and crypto companies shift their businesses to more hospitable areas. &nbsp;This policy shows a significant refocus on digital assets and coincides with the launch of the first two exchange-traded funds for cryptocurrency in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Dr. Ming Wu introduced the Conflux Tree-Graph public chain, explaining it is the only compliant, public and permissionless chain in China and has achieved 3000+ TPS, 5000+ nodes and 0.5s block generation. In terms of throughput, confirmation time, and cost of use, it has 2-3 orders of magnitude advantages over the international first-generation public chain "Bitcoin" and the second-generation public chain "Ethereum". The system performance ranks first in the world.</p>
<p>Dr. Mig Wu said 'Hong Kong's open environment for crypto provides more opportunities for practitioners in Web3 and Metaverse, especially for those from China. People here have more freedom to make the technique and business innovations in a compliant manner. This will also accelerate the integration of Web3 into the traditional internet business and economies to maximally extract its value. By expanding to Hong Kong, Conflux will be able to take a whole different strategy and have the potential to become the foundation to fulfill the Web3 vision of Hong Kong.'</p>
<p>The expansion follows Conflux Network being named a potential unicorn, a private startup company valued at over $1 billion, in the Emerging Giants in Asia Pacific joint report from HSBC and KPMG. &nbsp;One of only five blockchain-related companies to make the prestigious list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Conflux</p>
<p>Conflux is a permissionless Layer 1 blockchain connecting decentralized economies across borders and protocols. Recently migrated to hybrid PoW/PoS consensus, Conflux provides a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain environment with zero congestion, low fees, and improved network security.</p>
<p>As the only regulatory-compliant public blockchain in China, Conflux provides a unique advantage for projects building and expanding into Asia. In the region, Conflux has collaborated with global brands and government entities on blockchain and metaverse initiatives, including the city of Shanghai, McDonald's China, and Oreo.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">MicroStrategy has increased its #Bitcoin Holdings by ~2,500 #BTC. As of 12/27/22 @MicroStrategy holds ~132,500 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin. $MSTRhttps://t.co/lcMeULcGQk</p>

</p>
<p>MicroStrategy, a business software vendor co-founded by crypto advocate Michael Saylor, has continued to add to its bitcoin (BTC) holdings, purchasing approximately 2,395 bitcoins for $42.8 million between November 1 and December 21 through its MacroStrategy subsidiary.&nbsp;</p>
Very first sale of bitcoins
<p>However, for the very first time, the company did sell around 704 bitcoins for $11.8 million last Thursday, but it was made clear that this was in order to offset previous capital gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Saturday, the company then acquired an additional 810 bitcoins for $13.6 million, bringing its total holdings up to 132,500 bitcoins, worth approximately $2.25 billion at current prices, compared to the company's acquisition cost of $4 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This marks the first time that MicroStrategy has sold bitcoin since it began acquiring the cryptocurrency in 2020. Overall, since November 1, the company has added approximately 2,501 bitcoins to its holdings, spending a net $44.6 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shares of MicroStrategy were slightly up in premarket trading, while the price of bitcoin has taken a slight dip to around $16,600 at time of going to press.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The fiasco surrounding the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried continues. The latest news to break indicates that SBF and ex-FTX CTO Gary Wang used $546 million from Alameda Research to buy stock in Robinhood. The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a criminal probe into the hack following FTX&rsquo;s bankruptcy declaration and a group of former FTX customers has filed a class-action lawsuit to get their funds back. </p>
SBF and Gary Wang Use Alameda Funds to Purchase Robinhood Shares
<p>An affidavit filed by former FTX CEO, SBF, on the day of his arrest has revealed that he along with FTX co-founder Zixiao &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; Wang took out loans from Alameda Research through four promissory notes between April and May this year to fund the purchase of Robinhood Shares. According to the documents, on April 30, loans to the value of $316.6 million and $35.1 million were awarded to SBF and Wang respectively. Additionally, on May 15, two loans to the value of $175 million and $19.4 million were awarded to SBF. Per the details of the affidavit, the loans were used to fund SBF&rsquo;s Antiguan-based shell company, Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., which purchased a 7.6% stake in Robinhood in May at a price of $648 million at the time.</p>
Justice Department Launches Criminal Probe in $400M FTX Hack
<p>Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the United States Justice Department has launched an investigation into the alleged hack that drained close to $400 million out of FTX-controlled wallets on the night the exchange filed for bankruptcy. Bloomberg cites persons familiar with the matter. Suspicious activity was recorded in the form of massive outflows out of FTX and FTX US&rsquo;s wallets and a hack was later confirmed by FTX CEO John Jay Ray. According to Bloomberg&rsquo;s report, blockchain experts have identified several clues that indicate the hacker was an FTX insider.</p>
FTX Customers File Class-Action Lawsuit
<p>As government agencies continue to probe into FTX and its former executives, a group of former FTX customers has taken matters into their own hands to get their money back first. The lawsuit, filed on December 27, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, involves four plaintiffs who claim the be representing a class of former FTX customers, which might be up to 1 million customers. The class action seeks to obtain priority rights to return digital assets held by FTX and FTX.US to its customers. The plaintiffs claim that per the FTX User Agreement, the platform was not permitted to use customer funds for its own purposes &ndash; which make up the majority of the allegations against FTX and SBF.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The founders of cryptocurrency exchange, Gemini, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, are reportedly facing a new lawsuit from investors over the interest-earning program Gemini Earn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed on December 27th in Manhattan federal court, alleges that the Winklevoss brothers refused to honour any further investor redemptions after halting them due to exposure to troubled trading firm Genesis Global Capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plaintiffs claim that the products have not been registered, preventing them from making a proper risk assessment for using Gemini Earn.</p>
<p>Gemini Earn was launched last year and was designed to generate as much as 8% in interest on crypto holdings. However, the platform faced major issues in mid-November, shortly after reports emerged of liquidity issues at FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, withdrawals on Gemini Earn were halted and the platform remains unavailable for users, with millions of dollars reportedly stuck on Genesis. According to some reports, crypto lender Genesis and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) owe up to $900 million to Gemini clients.</p>
<p>On December 20th, Cameron Winklevoss took to Twitter to announce that Gemini had come up with a plan on behalf of the creditor committee to resolve the liquidity issues at Genesis and DCG and recover the assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This followed a letter from Genesis to its customers on December 7th, claiming that the withdrawal freeze was likely to last a few weeks while a solution was sought to recover users' assets. The freeze had been implemented on November 16th, citing "unprecedented market turmoil" caused by the collapse of FTX.</p>
<p>As crypto progresses deep into its winter it remains to be seen how the case will progress and whether the plaintiffs will be successful in their claims. The Winklevoss twins will no doubt be hoping that their exchange weathers the incoming storm.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The charity event is seeking to collect funds to benefit victims of the nervous system disease ALS, which the late Hal Finney himself was afflicted by.&nbsp;</p>
Charity Event Invites BTC Donations
<p>Hal Finney was one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, in 2009. He succumbed to the ravages of the disease and passed away from complications in 2014. On Tuesday, his widow Fran Finney took to her late husband&rsquo;s Twitter handle to announce the charity event, &ldquo;Running Bitcoin,&rdquo; a half marathon for Bitcoin holders to raise funds that would be contributed towards finding a cure for ALS. Those willing to participate would be covering a half-marathon distance between January 1st through 10th to raise funds through BTC donations for ALS research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are determined to find a cure for this devastating condition and any support you can provide will make a big difference&hellip;If you'd like to participate in the 'Running Bitcoin' event and make a donation, you can do so by visiting our website http://runningbitcoin.us and following the instructions there.&rdquo;</p>

More On &ldquo;Running Bitcoin&rdquo;
<p>It is interesting to note that the marathon name, &ldquo;Running Bitcoin,&rdquo; was informed by the first-ever tweet about the crypto made by Hal Finney himself, indicating how much of an early adopter he was. In fact, he was the second person to run a Bitcoin node after Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Finney tweeted those two words just a few days after Bitcoin went live in 2009. Prior to his diagnosis, Finney had frequently run distances. The Running Bitcoin website has also revealed that he especially favored the half marathon distance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notice on the website reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Join Honorary Chair Fran Finney and the Running Bitcoin Challenge Committee as we honor legendary cypher punk, Hal Finney. This is THE EVENT that combines Hal Finney's love of running and Bitcoin and is raising funds and awareness to help defeat ALS, which claimed his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other information on the event reveals that participants can complete the half marathon in one day or throughout the campaign duration. The website also collects donations in Bitcoin and fiat currency, where certain donators will receive certain benefits. A minimum $100 donation will earn a special event t-shirt, while the top 25 contributors will receive a Hal Finney collectible autographed by Fran Finney. The campaign has already raised $10,000 of its $50,000 goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered renewed selling pressure early in the Asian session as the pair was unable to move back above the 17000 figure, peaking around the 16777.35 area in a test of the 50-bar, 4-hour simple moving average.&nbsp; Buying pressure earlier emerged around the 16554.77 area, right around the 76.4% retracement of the appreciating range from 15992.64 to 18385.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair continues to orbit the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16780.41 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16757.19.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, Solana is one of the most affected altcoins, hitting a new local low of $10.</p>
Solana FUD
<p>Solana ($SOL) hit new lows this morning on investor concerns that institutional holders of the token could be preparing to offload large amounts in order to save some of their investment.</p>
<p>All this fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) over Solana is taking place amid a crypto winter that shows no sign of ending, making it very conducive for funds and investors to take any profits they might have, or indeed for many to just cut their losses.</p>
Loss of confidence
<p>Since early November $SOL has fallen off a cliff, losing 74% of its value in just under 3 months. The lack of confidence in the token since the FTX debacle has caused investors to sell $SOL even harder than most other cryptocurrencies, even though the Solana ecosystem was arguably the foremost layer 1 blockchain after Ethereum.</p>
<p>Very worryingly, the odd project is jumping ship off the Solana ecosystem and into other ecosystems with perhaps perceived lower risk. DeGods, and Y00ts are two NFT projects that have recently announced their desire to leave Solana and port over to the Polygon ecosystem, the leading layer 2 blockchain for Ethereum.</p>
Alarming technicals
<p>From a technical aspect, things do look slightly alarming for $SOL holders. $10 dollars can certainly be a support level that is able to stop the rot from continuing. The support here goes back to February 2021, and of course, $10 is a nice round number.</p>
<p>However, should the FUD persist and the $10 support breaks to the downside, the next step down, with nothing but thin air below, could take the token down to the next very strong support between $4 to $5 dollars.</p>
<p>This would be quite some collapse since the November 2021 high of $260 when everything appeared to be going so well for Solana.&nbsp;</p>
Make or break
<p>For the time being, investors will have to weigh up their options. Getting in at $4 to $5 could be the most incredible opportunity if the ship rights itself and the lightning fast network eventually fulfils all its early promise.</p>
<p>On the other hand though, should not even $4 hold, and the current bank run-like sell-off continue apace, then it could spell the end of an incredibly innovative project in the crypto space.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Kraken has decided to close its operations in Japan and deregister from the Financial Services Agency, blaming a weak market.</p>
<p>Kraken announced in a blog post earlier today that it has decided to close its operations in Japan and deregister from the Financial Services Agency (JFSA) effective January 31, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It said that its decision was part of its efforts to focus on areas that align with its strategy and that would best position the crypto exchange for long-term success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blog post explained that the current market conditions in Japan, combined with a weak global cryptocurrency market, made it difficult for Kraken to justify further investment in Japan at this time, and as a result, Kraken would no longer be able to provide services to clients in Japan through Payward Asia. The blog post said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We value the trust our clients put in us and we will do what we can to minimize the impact of our decision for you. That&rsquo;s why we are committed to ensure a seamless transition and we hope the information in this email will help you decide what is the best option for you. Kraken is fully funded to ensure all affected clients can withdraw their assets in a timely manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In explaining exactly what this means for customers, the blog post laid out that clients have until January 31, 2023 to withdraw all their fiat and crypto holdings from the platform.</p>
<p>It was stated that deposit functionality would be removed from accounts on January 9, but that trading functionality would remain so that balances could be converted to the asset of the client&rsquo;s choice ready for withdrawal.</p>
<p>It seems that Kraken, like many other crypto exchanges, is doing what it can to survive this long crypto winter. At the end of November, the exchange cut its workforce by around 1100, effectively reducing it by 30%.</p>
<p>The downsize was the last act for the then CEO Jesse Powell, who stepped down, allowing Dave Ripley to take over the role. Kraken said that the measures were necessary in order to sustain its business over the longer term.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto trader behind the infamous Mango Markets exploits had previously claimed that his actions were legal and part of a profitable trading strategy.&nbsp;</p>
FBI Files Fraud Charges
<p>Law enforcement has arrested the infamous Mango Markets hacker, Avraham Eisenberg, who had claimed responsibility for the attack and stated that his actions were not illegal at all. However, his claims of &ldquo;legal open market actions&rdquo; seem unfounded, as he has been charged with market manipulation and fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A previously sealed complaint filed with the Southern District of New York was made public recently, revealing that the FBI had charged Eisenberg with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation in the Mango Markets case.&nbsp;</p>
Eisenberg&rsquo;s Mango Market Takedown&nbsp;
<p>The takedown of the crypto exchange took place in the month of October 2022, which is already being touted as &ldquo;Hacktober&rdquo; in the crypto circles due to the overwhelming number of hacks and exploits. Eisenberg targeted the platform&rsquo;s native token, MNGO, and artificially inflated its price with respect to the USDC. His team then proceeded to take significant loans against their inflated collateral, thus draining the Mango treasury of cryptocurrencies worth $110 million. Eisenberg had, however, never attempted to hide his identity or his actions, claiming that whatever profits he had gained were part of a regular trading activity. In fact, he had even entered into negotiations with the Mango team immediately after the maneuver to discuss the return of the funds. Days later, the Mango team revealed that around $67 million of various crypto assets had been returned to the exchange treasury.&nbsp;</p>
FBI Deems Eisenberg Guilty
<p>However, the FBI did not buy into Eisenberg&rsquo;s claims of the entire exploit being just a &ldquo;profitable trading strategy.&rdquo; on December 23, the federal agency lodged a formal complaint alleging that Eisenberg had wilfully and knowingly manipulated the market and committed fraud through intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of the perpetual futures on Mango Markets. The funds that he drained from the exchange&rsquo;s treasury came directly from the deposits of other investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, according to FBI special agent Brandon Racz. Eisenberg was aware of the illegality of his actions as he had left the country for Israel the day after the exploit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Racz said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Based on the timing of the flight, the travel appears to have been an effort to avoid apprehension by law enforcement in the immediate aftermath of the Market Manipulation Scheme&hellip;Due to [Eisenberg&rsquo;s] withdrawals, other investors with deposits on Mango Markets lost much, or all, of those deposits.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Andy Yen, the founder and CEO of ProtonMail, has cast doubt on whether the firm will continue to hold Bitcoin (BTC) in the future, expressing concern at the current state of the crypto markets.</p>
<p>ProtonMail had added support for Bitcoin back in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
ProtonMail&rsquo;s 2017 Bitcoin Pivot&nbsp;
<p>ProtonMail is an end-to-end encrypted email provider used by millions of users. In 2017, the company added official support for accepting payments in Bitcoin. Support for Bitcoin payments started from version 3.11 of ProtonMail, allowing users to pay for the premium ProtonMail service using BTC. At the time, ProtonMail stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have designed the payment system to work seamlessly so that Bitcoin payments are automatically converted to ProtonMail credits which can be used to pay for upgrades, pay invoices, or top up your account. This feature was long overdue, so we are glad to finally introduce this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company also added that it viewed holding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as a hedge against the uncertainty and fragility of the traditional financial sector, stating that it currently holds a significant portion of its reserves in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
A Change In Outlook&nbsp;
<p>ProtonMail acknowledged in 2019 that the company had been holding the BTC sent to them by customers. However, the recent downturn in the crypto markets has prompted Proton CEO and founder, Andy Yen, to cast doubt on whether the company will continue to hold BTC in the future. Yen made the comments during an interview with Forbes, published on the 27th of December, 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yen, while acknowledging that the company held Bitcoin in reserve, added that it isn&rsquo;t guaranteed that the firm may continue to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an internal debate: I don&rsquo;t have the answer to that yet &mdash; I&rsquo;m not sure if we continue to hold Bitcoin or not hold Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>

A Number Of Concerns&nbsp;
<p>Yen discussed his thoughts about Bitcoin and crypto in general, adding that several factors concerned him. According to the CEO, these were largely tied to fraud, the numerous scams, and short-lived bubbles such as the recent NFT bubble and the ICO craze of 2017. Additionally, he stated that the short-lived interest in crypto is cyclical and short-lived, leading to spikes and crashes that decimate the crypto markets every three to four years. Yen elaborated during the interview, stating,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are not going to have faith and confidence and trust in an asset class if it is frequently having 80% crash cycles. We need the crash cycles to be less and less severe over time, and that&rsquo;s just not happening.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
Self Regulation And Moderation Are Key&nbsp;
<p>So how does one address the issue? According to Yen, more robust moderation and self-regulation within the crypto sector are key to confronting the problem, adding that he opposed lawmakers' regulation. However, the skepticism displayed by the ProtonMail CEO does not mean the firm would stop accepting Bitcoin payments and transactions. In fact, reports have suggested that the firm is currently in the process of integrating Lightning Network payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proton&rsquo;s close association and work with cryptocurrencies in 2018 also saw rumors that it was planning on launching its own token through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). However, the firm categorically denied such rumors at the time.&nbsp;</p>

Additionally, he stated that the short-lived interest in crypto is cyclical and short-lived, leading to spikes and crashes that decimate the crypto markets every three to four years. Yen elaborated during the interview, stating,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are not going to have faith and confidence and trust in an asset class if it is frequently having 80% crash cycles. We need the crash cycles to be less and less severe over time, and that&rsquo;s just not happening.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
Self Regulation And Moderation Are Key&nbsp;
<p>So how does one address the issue? According to Yen, more robust moderation and self-regulation within the crypto sector are key to confronting the problem, adding that he opposed lawmakers' regulation. However, the skepticism displayed by the ProtonMail CEO does not mean the firm would stop accepting Bitcoin payments and transactions. In fact, reports have suggested that the firm is currently in the process of integrating Lightning Network payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proton&rsquo;s close association and work with cryptocurrencies in 2018 also saw rumors that it was planning on launching its own token through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). However, the firm categorically denied such rumors at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the world&rsquo;s largest investment giants, Fidelity Investments, submitted trademark applications in the United States to the U.S. Patent Trademark Office (USPTO) on December 21, which included a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace and financial investment and crypto trading services in the metaverse. Mike Kondoudis, a licensed trademark attorney in the U.S. shared the news on Twitter:</p>

<p>Fidelity has said that one of its key areas of focus will be the metaverse. The firm said that it will offer a wide range of investment services in the virtual world including mutual funds, retirement funds, investment management, and financial planning according to reports by Cointelegraph. Fidelity may also be planning to launch metaverse-based payment services that would include electronic bill payments, fund transfers, and the &ldquo;financial administration of credit card accounts in the metaverse and other virtual worlds.&rdquo; The filing further indicates that Fidelity could launch trading and management services in the metaverse as well as provide virtual currency wallet services. The filing indicates:</p>

<p>Electronic wallet services in the nature of electronic storage and processing of virtual currency for electronic payments and transactions via a global computer network; digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency digital token.</p>

<p>Fidelity has also indicated that it could offer educational services in the metaverse by &ldquo;conducting classes, workshops, seminars and conferences in the field of investments and in the field of marketing financial services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The filing reads:</p>

<p>Providing business information to financial service providers by means of an internet website, in the field of business marketing in the metaverse and other virtual worlds; referral services in the field of investment advice and financial planning in the metaverse and other virtual worlds.</p>

<p>The announcement is also in line with Fidelity&rsquo;s recent announcement that it is growing its digital asset division by 25%.</p>
Fidelity Cautioned Against Offering Bitcoin to Customers
<p>Fidelity was recently issued with a letter from three U.S. senators urging them to drop its 401(k) Bitcoin plan. The senators cite the fall of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX as the reason for the asset management firm to revise its Bitcoin offering to retirement savers. The letter stated:</p>

<p>Once again, we strongly urge Fidelity Investments to reconsider its decision to allow 401(k) plan sponsors to expose plan participants to Bitcoin. Adding, The recent implosion of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, has made it abundantly clear the digital asset industry has serious problems.</p>

<p>Two of the senators also sent a letter in July commenting that the offering was a bad idea.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>While Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) may be more well-known names in the cryptocurrency space, they have received negative reviews from analysts and have struggled to gain traction in the market. In contrast, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has been gaining popularity with its impressive 655% growth during phase 2 of its presale, positioning it for a potential 60x return by the end of the presale. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is quickly catching up and making a name for itself as a standout performer. ORBN is currently in phase 3 of the presale.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Solana (SOL) is down over 93% in the past year</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) is considered a competitor to Ethereum (ETH). Solana (SOL) has gained popularity due to its capacity to process transactions quickly. Solana (SOL) can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) also can generate smart contracts. These smart contracts can aid in decentralized application development. Increasing numbers of decentralized apps are currently hosted on Solana (SOL). As more projects are launched on Solana (SOL), the interest in DeFi increases. Solana (SOL) is also capable of creating NFTs.</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) is one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies of the year, having lost approximately 93% in a single year.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">TRON (TRX) fails to stay relevant</p>
<p>TRON (TRX) has gained much attention since its inception, owing to its desire to establish a fully decentralized network. It demonstrates that TRON (TRX) has turned a substantial portion of its interest into market value over time. </p>
<p>The creators of TRON (TRX) are ambitious and determined. TRON (TRX) are attempting to create a decentralized internet. TRON's cutting-edge technology might substantially alter the economics of content creation. Aside from that, it has recently attracted so much investment that its market value surpasses that of several popular cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>But all of that hasn't been enough to keep the investors of TRON (TRX) happy, as TRON is currently trading over 76% lower than its all-time high. TRON (TRX) fails to stay relevant in bearish market conditions and, for this reason, is off the analyst's radar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) shines with 655% returns</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a decentralized investment platform aiming to revolutionize the crowdfunding and venture finance market. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) intends to accomplish this by using fractionalized non-fungible tokens, or F-NFTs, which businesses can issue as a form of equity or rewards and which can be traded for as little as $1.</p>
<p>This enables ordinary investors to gain the benefits of early-stage investing and helps startups to raise capital at a lower cost. In addition, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses a "Fill-or-Kill" mechanism that guarantees all investors are refunded if a startup fails to fulfill its funding objective.</p>
<p>ORBN is the project's utility token, and the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale is currently in its third stage. Following a 655% rally, ORBN is currently selling for $0.0302. Analysts expect ORBN to gain 6000% in the following months.</p>
<p>In the presale, only 40% of the total supply of ORBN is up for grabs. ORBN holders receive various platform-wide perks, including staking bonuses, governance rights, transaction cost savings, and access to exclusive investor groups.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>A temporary outage of LBank&rsquo;s trade platform in December sparked discussion among users about how exchanges should approach cloud hosting. LBank CEO Allen Wei addressed the issue during a Twitter Space AMA on December 26th.</p>
<p>Why this matters: Veteran crypto exchanges like LBank are trying to uphold a long-standing reputation of seeing little service downtime and thwarting hackers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driving the discussion: Alibaba Cloud, LBank&rsquo;s Cloud Service Provider, experienced technical issues on December 18th, rendering the trading platform temporarily inaccessible for over 7 million users.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Our engineers got word from Alibaba Cloud that there was a server crash ongoing and immediately started collaboration. It took quite some time to recover our services, but luckily we recovered access to our websites through other cloud services quite early on. The incident not only affected us, but a lot of other exchanges and internet companies,&rdquo; Wei said.</li>
  <li>LBank stresses that these kinds of outages have no impact on user assets whatsoever. &ldquo;We take regular back-ups of platform data. The wallet side is especially secure because we utilize cold storage controlled by our own servers,&rdquo; Wei added.</li>
  <li>Addressing the FUD that popped up on social media during the incident, Wei stated this phenomenon isn&rsquo;t an abnormality in the financial industry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through this before ever since kicking off in 2015 and are nonetheless still supporting crypto and blockchain tech. The community continues to trust us and trade on our platform, which underlines the potential of crypto,&rdquo; the LBank CEO said.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Big Picture: Wei points out that exchanges should approach cloud hosting with a multipronged strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The exchange will take even more frequent back-ups of platform data in the future and will look towards other Cloud Service Providers to mitigate downtime. &ldquo;We are slowly moving some of our services to other Cloud Providers, like Amazon&rdquo;, Wei stated.</li>
  <li>Continuing to provide excellent stability of the trading platform is an integral part of LBank&rsquo;s global goals, Wei said. &ldquo;In 2023, we would also like to expand on the local community relations we established this year&rdquo;, he concluded.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Indian crypto exchanges suffered extremely badly during the crypto bear market of 2022. Trading volume on WazirX fell a massive 97% over the year.</p>
Severe drop in trading volumes
<p>According to an article in the business section of the Outlook India</p>
<p>news platform, exchanges based in the country experienced a severe drop in trading volumes.</p>
<p>Data quoted from CREBACO stated that WazirX&rsquo;s trading volume plummeted 97.99%, CoinDCX&rsquo;s decreased 88%, Bitbns fell 67%, and ZebPay went down 94%. All over the course of 2022 taken from January to December.</p>
Indian authority&rsquo;s negative view on crypto
<p>Other exchanges across the world are likely to have suffered large dips in trading volume as well, but the Indian market probably suffered more due to the very negative crypto view of the government and the Royal Bank of India.</p>
<p>In line with this, a 30% capital gains tax was introduced for all those citizens trading in crypto. Furthermore, a 1% tax was also levied on every single single transaction.</p>
Crypto sector dwindles in India
<p>The result of this was to dampen the Indian crypto market to a very high degree, and in addition, some crypto infrastructure such as exchanges, moved overseas and a brain drain was also experienced.</p>
<p>With far more regulatory laws about to descend on crypto in India, and also in various jurisdictions across the world, it remains to be seen how this will affect the sector.</p>
Regulation - good or bad?
<p>Some say that the clarity and certainty produced by more regulatory oversight can lend the aura of respectability to the industry that is required by institutions wishing to invest in the sector.</p>
<p>However, others might say that the type of regulation that is incoming in places like Europe (MiCA), could have the effect of squashing the life out of crypto and of drastically curtailing the innovation that has been freely flowing out of the sector.</p>

<p>With far more regulatory laws about to descend on crypto in India, and also in various jurisdictions across the world, it remains to be seen how this will affect the sector.</p>
Regulation - good or bad?
<p>Some say that the clarity and certainty produced by more regulatory oversight can lend the aura of respectability to the industry that is required by institutions wishing to invest in the sector.</p>
<p>However, others might say that the type of regulation that is incoming in places like Europe (MiCA), could have the effect of squashing the life out of crypto and of drastically curtailing the innovation that has been freely flowing out of the sector.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 16922 Technical Level:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 28 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) failed to sustain recent upside progress early in the Asian session as the pair fell back to the 16795.53 area after trading as high as the 16920.10 level, representing a test of the 50% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pair continues to orbit the &nbsp;16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16792.55 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16816.39.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>New York, United States, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>With sales of non-fungible tokens falling for the 6th straight month, and falling by 60% in just Q3 to Q4 this year, it&rsquo;s understandable to say the market is feeling pessimistic. A number of factors contribute to this such as interest rate increases cooling the economy and the novelty of purely aesthetic NFTs failing to attract investor attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pessimistic Donkey College, hopes to rally the bear market by introducing the NFT project that provides a new investment opportunity with a focus on long-term growth of an investor community. This new project will be launching on January 15, 2023.</p>
<p>In order to help support investors, the project is also going to be run on a royalty-free model to encourage trading and participation in the project post-launch. This is in line with the innovative stake system being developed to run alongside it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an addition to launching the NFT, Pessimistic Donkey College will be producing a weekly mental health podcast to raise awareness and educate their audience on the increasingly important topic. This approach of pairing an NFT with a socially conscious project is a new step for the industry and demonstrates that NFT projects can be used for the public good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evolutionary goals of the project and their commitment to bringing pessimistic investors together in the bear market show an understanding that NFT projects need to change and develop past tools of investment and move into community-driven environments and can enact a positive social impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Pessimistic Donkey College
Pessimistic Donkey College is a new NFT project by co-founders: JAY, Draco, DEL, TT, and their teams. One of the project's major goals is to reinvigorate interest in the face of the bear market by offering a new collection of images as well as utilities and a royalty-return system.</p>
<p>The plans for this project are to take another step in the NFT space beyond previous competitors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the minting of NFTs, the project will also produce a weekly mental health podcast.&nbsp;</p>ContactDracoPessimistic Donkey Collegeinfo@pessimisticdonkeycollege.com]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto.com promotes its very experienced and successful COO to president. Eric Anziani will now carry out both roles.</p>
<p>Eric Anziani, who is currently the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Crypto.com, has been promoted to President of the company. In this expanded role, Anziani will continue to oversee operations and lead strategy, product, sales, international expansion, data, research, and blockchain integration.&nbsp;</p>
A key roll
<p>Anziani has been with Crypto.com since 2018 and has helped the company secure licences in various locations, grow its user base to over 70 million people, build its product and NFT offerings, advance Web3 innovation, and establish partnerships with prominent brands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anziani has extensive experience in the tech industry, having worked for Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, PayPal, and Global Fashion Group in various locations around the world.</p>
<p>Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, said of the promotion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eric is a leader and strategic thinker who has helped guide the Company&rsquo;s vision and solidified Crypto.com as a world-class platform built on security, compliance, and trust. Eric&rsquo;s expanded role will allow him full visibility of growth opportunities for the company and the ability to continue building and innovating to position Crypto.com for continued success.&rdquo;</p>

Advertising issues
<p>The UK's advertising regulator recently ruled against Crypto.com and Turtle United for promoting NFTs (non-fungible tokens) without clearly outlining the risks of investing in them or adequately disclosing transaction fees.&nbsp;</p>
Exchanges seek to prove financial stability
<p>This decision comes as crypto exchanges are trying to demonstrate their financial stability following the failure of FTX. On December 9th, FTX released a proof-of-reserves study conducted by Mazars, but the auditing firm later announced that it would no longer offer its services to the crypto industry.</p>
