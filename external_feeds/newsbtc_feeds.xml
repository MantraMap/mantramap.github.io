Bitcoin is showing bearish signs below the $28,500 resistance zone. The price is trading below $28,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $28,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

					<description><![CDATA[In a day when Bitcoin prices are crashing, posting worrying drops from April 2023 peaks, the underlying network is processing record transactions. Bitcoin Prices Dropping, But Why? Dune Analytics data on May 1 shows that the platform is processing record transactions which, if going by historical performance, would typically point to demand. In a normal scenario, this demand could translate to buying pressure. However, as seen in the chart below, the spike in the activity on the Bitcoin network is attributed to the non-fungible token (NFT) collection &#8220;Ordinals.&#8221; The demand for these assets has interfered with the normal on-chain dynamics. We can see a shift in preference as it relates to inscription types. Image Inscriptions 🟧 dominated until very recently, but have been surpassed by text based 🟦. Over 2.39M Inscriptions have been added to the #Bitcoin ledger, adding 9.3GB in data, and paying 212 $BTC in fees. pic.twitter.com/KZPy074WoP &#8212; glassnode (@glassnode) April 30, 2023 In that sense, despite the high block demand, BTC prices are down 4% in the past 24 hours, crashing 10% from April 2023 peaks, and are likely to clear critical support levels immediately. Notably, sellers have quickly reversed the gains of April 27.

Key reaction points remain at $31,000 on the upper hand, a level flashing with April 2023 peaks, and $26.5k on the lower end, a support level marking the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the March to April trade range.  Moreover, from mid-March 2023, BTC rallied approximately 60%, floating higher as the financial markets feared another meltdown in the United States banking sector.

Bitcoin prices are now cooling off, looking at the performance in the daily chart. This is despite positive news based on blockchain activity.  According to Dune Analytics, the Bitcoin network has processed more transactions than any other day since launching 14 years ago. On May 1, on-chain data showed that the platform processed 568,300 transactions, 78,000 more than it processed at the peaks of the 2017 Bull Run. Even though activity has exploded, an analysis of the chunk of transactions processed revealed that over 50%, or 307,000, were inscriptions from Bitcoin Ordinals. Dune data shows that the number of inscriptions is up 16% from April 29 and maintains an upward trend pointing to increasing user demand. The Bitcoin Ordinals allow users to attach or “inscribe” files on the Bitcoin network, including apps, videos, audio, images, texts, and more.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Potential Price Drop To $25,000, On-Chain Data Signals Bearish Trend These files are unique, &#8220;inscribed” at the Satoshi level, and permanently stored on Bitcoin blocks.

The underlying network is a transactional layer, enabling the transfer of funds. It is not meant for storing files, a development that could dent the appeal of the most valuable blockchain and slow down BTC demand leading to a permanent spike in its transaction levels.  Feature Image From iStock, Chart From TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pepe coin, the meme cryptocurrency based on the popular internet meme, has become the newest sensation across crypto.

Read This Before Buying Few meme coins these days are a bigger deal than Pepe, rising from nothing to into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap in a little over two weeks since its launch. It&#8217;s vastly out-performed meme coin brethren Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, and the dozens of new coins that Pepe&#8217;s runaway success has spawned.

Since the chart&#8217;s inception, it has brought investors 3,000% ROI. Earlier adopters turned $250 into a cool mil. Those who bought the top might be at risk of turning a million into lot less, considering the risk of a more than 80% correction. The risk is due to the parabolic curve pictured above breaking down violently. Related Reading: PEPE Goes To The Moon: Meme Coin Listed On OKX, Binance Listing In the Works? A rule of thumb in technical analysis is to expect at minimum an 80% retracement of a parabolic rally. Crypto holders would do well to remember that Peter Brandt famously called for an 80% collapse in Bitcoin after the 2017 peak. After that parabolic rally ended, BTCUSD dropped at full 84% from top to bottom before it was over. Brandt nailed the target over a year in advance. If Pepe coin has topped out after a 3,000% gain, a roughly 80% correction might be due. But much like Bitcoin then, after the correction, Pepe coin being such a new and hot coin should eventually bring substantial returns again. However, while the greater crypto market corrects, profit taking could aggressively spill into Pepe holders, who have a lot more room to fall compared to the rest of the market. As a result, things could get ugly quickly.

					<description><![CDATA[PEPE, the popular meme coin, has recently been listed on OKX, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This move has generated excitement among investors who believe that the coin has the potential to become a major player in the crypto market and the meme coin sector.  Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Retests Multi-Month Trend Line, Bulls Prevailing Again? PEPE Coin Leaps Into The Big Leagues The recent listing on OKX is a significant milestone for PEPE, providing the coin with greater exposure and access to a larger pool of investors. OKX is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and its listing requirements are rigorous, which speaks to the increased enthusiasm generated by the cryptocurrency. This move also bodes well for the coin&#8217;s future, as it may lead to additional listings on other major exchanges. Furthermore, there is speculation that Binance, another major player in the crypto space, may list PEPE if it meets their criteria. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently hinted at this possibility during an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session, further fueling excitement around the coin. In addition to the already thrilling news, there has been a surge of over 90% in the value of the meme coin since yesterday. This has resulted in a record-breaking market capitalization of over $435 million, making it the 101st most valuable coin in the cryptocurrency market, as reported by NewsBTC. Frogging Amazing, Meme Coin Takes The Crypto World by Storm According to Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, three “SmartMoneys” have sold a portion of their PEPE holdings and made a profit of over $1 million. This impressive feat was achieved in just two weeks. Lookonchain has reported that an individual with the following wallet has significantly profited from investing in PEPE. According to Lookonchain, the wallet holder purchased 5.42 trillion PEPE tokens for the equivalent of 1 Ethereum, worth approximately $2,100. The wallet holder sold 3.42 trillion PEPE tokens for 929 Ethereum, worth around $1.77 million. Despite selling some holdings, the individual still holds 2 trillion PEPE tokens, worth approximately $2.37 million at current market prices. If this investor were to sell their remaining meme coin tokens at the current market price, it could potentially profit approximately $4.14 million.  Furthermore,  a user using dimethyltryptamine.eth has made a significant profit investing in the cryptocurrency project. The user reportedly purchased 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens for the equivalent of 0.125 Ethereum, worth approximately $251. Dimethyltryptamine.eth sold 2 trillion meme coin tokens for 560 Ethereum, worth around $1.06 million. Despite selling a portion of their holdings, dimethyltryptamine.eth still holds 3.9 trillion PEPE tokens worth approximately $2.37 million at current market prices.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners have continued to sell recently, a sign that can be bearish for the price of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Been Going Down Since Rally Started As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, BTC miners have continued to shave coins off their reserve recently. The &#8220;miner reserve&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that all miners are holding in their wallets currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Emerges As the King Of Assets,10X Growth Over Gold During US Banking Crisis When the value of this metric goes up, it means the miners are depositing a net number of coins into their wallets. This trend suggests these blockchain validators are accumulating the cryptocurrency. As miners are often a source of selling pressure in the market, their holding on and adding to their supply can be bullish for the price. On the other hand, a decreasing value in this indicator implies that miners are transferring some BTC out of their reserve. Since one of the main reasons why these investors may withdraw from their wallets is for selling-related purposes, such a trend can have bearish consequences for the asset&#8217;s value. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner reserve over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have gone down in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the Bitcoin miner reserve saw a sharp plunge just as the rally began in January, suggesting that these investors sold to take advantage of the profit-taking opportunity. The drawdown in the metric was also quite sharp in this case and surpassed the levels seen during the FTX crash last November. The miner reserve has only moved sideways or down since this selloff, suggesting that these holders haven&#8217;t participated in any accumulation in recent months; they have only been looking at chances to exit. Recently, when Bitcoin plunged from the $30,000 mark, the indicator again saw a sharp leg down, meaning that this cohort was again selling their BTC. The drawdown in the indicator has also continued through the volatile price action observed in the last few days, suggesting that the BTC miners are still disposing of their coins. Though these investors may have been selling a net amount of coins recently, the actual scale of their selling isn&#8217;t that significant compared to their total reserve (they currently hold upwards of 1.82 million BTC in their wallets). Related Reading: Internet Computer (ICP) Social Dominance Hits 23-Month High, Top In? The quant notes, however, that the miners holding onto their coins for longer periods could be one of the crucial factors for the bullish trend&#8217;s health. It now remains to be seen whether these holders can reverse the trend anytime soon or if they will continue to sell Bitcoin in the short term. Either possibility is likely to have a profound effect on the BTC price. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,100, up 3% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has been experiencing a volatile price action since late April, with significant fluctuations in its value. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 3% decline in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $28,400. However, it has now settled within an accumulation range of $27,800 to $30,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Destroys 3.26 Billion SHIB in April Amid Price Decline Bitcoin Bulls Take Caution BaroVirtual from Cryptoquant recently shared his analysis regarding the potential downside targets for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the bearish divergence of the BTC: On-Chain Summation Index suggests a target of approximately $27.200. A Head and Shoulders (H&#38;S) pattern also indicates a lower range target of $25,000. The BTC on-Chain Summation Index is a metric that tracks the number of Bitcoin being transferred on the blockchain. When the index shows a bearish divergence, it suggests a decrease in the amount of Bitcoin being transferred, which could lead to a decline in price. On the same note,  Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, received its largest single Bitcoin deposit in the past week. The deposit, made to an address that had remained inactive for four months, came from five separate addresses and totaled over 1,200 BTC, worth over $35M at current market prices. Arkham, a blockchain analytics firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions, reported the news. The firm noted that the deposit was made in a single transaction and that the funds were sent to a previously unused deposit address. Will this translate into an extension of the bearish momentum? It remains to be seen.  Moreover, according to Material Indicators, a crypto analytics firm, the recent Bitcoin monthly candle close/open has signaled a potential short-term price correction for the cryptocurrency. The firm&#8217;s Trend Precognition A2+ algo flashed a short signal, indicating a potential decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, as seen in the chart below.  However, according to Material Indicators, the signal is tentative until the candle closes, and a pump above the April high could invalidate it. Additionally, Wednesday&#8217;s upcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Federal Reserve interest rate decision could catalyze a significant price move in either direction. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 25 basis points, it could lead to a stronger US dollar and put downward pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. However, continuing to pause or maintain current rates could boost investor confidence and lead to a price increase for the cryptocurrency. Although the potential downside targets predicted for BTC, evidence suggests that the $27,000 mark could support the cryptocurrency and push back the bears. This level has already demonstrated its resilience as a support floor, holding up well against significant selling pressure since April 21st.

<p>If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 25 basis points, it could lead to a stronger US dollar and put downward pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. However, continuing to pause or maintain current rates could boost investor confidence and lead to a price increase for the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Although the potential downside targets predicted for BTC, evidence suggests that the $27,000 mark could support the cryptocurrency and push back the bears. This level has already demonstrated its resilience as a support floor, holding up well against significant selling pressure since April 21st.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While Bitcoin (BTC) has continued a downtrend, the asset has recently recorded a high volume in daily transactions nearing its all-time high. According to a report by on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, “Bitcoin daily transaction counts are approaching All-time-highs, seeing an explosive uptick in 2023.’ Regardless of this news, Bitcoin has continued to move downward after its weekend plateau of trading at just between $29,300. The asset trading volume has also surged slightly indicating a possible violent sell-off.   Bitcoin Records Daily Transactions Nearing Peak Levels According to Glassnode, on the 30-day moving average, Bitcoin daily transactions have reached an amount of 348,700. While the peak level which was seen in 2017 remains at 379,000 transactions per day. This has proved Bitcoin’s daily transactions are beginning to near the all-time high last seen about 5 years ago. Furthermore, according to the Glassnode report, this surge in Bitcoin daily transactions is thanks to the Ordinal inscriptions. The Ordinal inscriptions also known as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or Ordinals, are inscriptions (digital artifacts) inscribed on satoshis (sats) – little units of Bitcoin. Glassnode noted the inscription accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of mined transactions and 10% to 20% of fees paid. Meanwhile, the remaining majority of transactions are monetary in nature, frequently conducted through exchanges.  According to Glassnode, compared to Ordinals activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, BTC exchange activity is relatively low, representing roughly 30% of fees and transactions. The trend of creating inscriptions initially gained popularity in February when users started inscribing NFTs on satoshis. However, the recent resurgence has been dominated by inscriptions that are based on text. Glassnode noted: Bitcoin transaction counts, address activity, Inscriptions, and Mempool congestion are all elevated. As is the degree of HODLing, and supply acquired below $30k. Conviction remains. BTC Continues Downtrend Bitcoin (BTC) is yet to make any significant move in the past few days. Instead, it has only seemed to pick up from where it left off in its downward trend in recent weeks. Over the past 24 hours, the top crypto has plummeted nearly 4% with a market price of $28,435, at the time of writing.  This downtrend follows a notable fall from the $30,000 region in recent weeks. So far, Bitcoin has a 24-hour range between a low of $28,315 and a high of $29,944. Meanwhile, the BTC market cap is still in the green while its trading volume signals selling pressure, indicating a possible continuous bearish trend.  Over the past week, Bitcoin’s market capitalization has surged from a low of $528 billion on April 24 to as high as $550 billion as of today. Its trading volume has also spiked from a daily trading volume of $15.4 billion to $19.8 billion, over the same time period. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The bearish trend a few days ago brought Chainlink (LINK) down to $6.735 on April 26. The bulls tried to recover and drove the price of LINK to a solid 24-hour high of $7.30, but it later fell to a 7-day low of $6.773. Due to the current FUD and increased regulatory pressure in the United States, Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price dropped below $29,000. But if the bulls build strong momentum, BTC may test $30k and climb higher, dragging the rest of the altcoin market, including LINK, with it. Will Bearish Trend Continue? As of the time of writing, the LINK market is still moving down, falling by 2.49% to $7.06. According to CoinMarketCap info, LINK&#8217;s market cap decreased by 3.11%, while its 24-hour trading volume rose by 30.83% during the downtrend.  Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying The increasing trading volume suggests a possible change in investors&#8217; sentiment for LINK. It indicates that network activities are increasing despite the downturn, which might push the LINK price to a rally.  However, if more traders attempt to sell their holdings, a market sell-off may occur, potentially adding to downward pressure on the price. Notably, due to the ongoing Spring 2023 hackathon, long-term holders stopped selling. This recent event might draw new network players and start a long-lasting bull movement. LINK Technical Analysis LINK has seen a few rejections at the supply zone of $7.50 in the past few days, which is also the primary resistance zone. On April 30, the LINK price hit the resistance zone and went down, which attracted the bears. Chainlink trades between support and resistance levels of $6.773 and $7.500. The first significant resistance level for LINK is $7.500. The following resistance zone is $8.831 if the price moves above this current zone. But if the bears build strong momentum, the next support will be $5.492. Related Reading: Pepe Coin’s Mega Rise Pinned To This Smart Contract Fix The market is down due to a change in market structure caused by the 50-day SMA change in direction. If the bullish momentum doesn&#8217;t pick up, the trend may change to a potential bearish market.  The 50-day SMA established a Death Cross by crossing below the 200-day SMA, indicating a potentially bearish signal and suggesting a selling opportunity. At the time of analysis, the RSI is 40.86 below the neutral zone. Therefore, this shows that LINK is not in the overbought zone but seems to be heading toward the oversold zone.  The bears are aggressively pushing the price of LINK to the oversold zone while the bulls are still trying to hold the market, even though the momentum is weak. The MACD is currently trading below the signal line, showing bearish sentiment in the market. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shibburn reports that over 3.26 billion Shiba Inu tokens were burned in April 2023 across 125 transactions. These figures are lower than the total SHIB burns in March 2023, which was 6.78 billion SHIB tokens burned through 540 transactions. Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying The SHIB burn process involves sending Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens to an address known as a &#8220;burn address.&#8221; This address is a designated address created to hold the tokens to be burned permanently. The Shiba Inu community carried out these burn transactions to reduce the total supply of SHIB in circulation. Notably, a token&#8217;s scarcity sees demand higher than supply leading to a boost in price. Despite the high number of token burns, SHIB&#8217;s price is still declining. Koyo Retains Top SHIB Burner Status From March 2023 Koyo (KYO) retains its top SHIB burner status for a second consecutive month burning a whopping 2.59 billion tokens. It burnt 6.15 billion SHIB tokens in March 2023 through multiple transactions. The largest of its burn transactions in March was a transfer of 924.15 million SHIB to the dead wallet on March 17. Also, Koyo burned another 794.85 million tokens on March 28. Koyo continued its aggressive burn rate in April 2023, sending 1.10 billion SHIB to the dead wallet on April 9. Also, Koyo followed up with another massive burn event on April 14, burning 1.49 billion SHIB tokens.  However, the burns didn’t affect Shiba Inu’s value as the token’s price is still down by over 2% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Pepe Coin’s Mega Rise Pinned To This Smart Contract Fix The current price slump could be a temporary pullback due to the recent market downtrend. One thing that could change the trajectory of the price is the Shibarium upgrade, which is yet to be announced. Shiba Archives said a top SHIB developer claimed the Shibarium upgrade would be here before May. However, the developer did not specify the year or give further information. Notably, some SHIB community members reacted to the reduced burn rates in April 2023. A Twitter user, Macguy, stated that the developers don&#8217;t want to listen to the SHIB community&#8216;s calls for more burns. He believes the burns are slow and dragged on purpose, announcing that he did his part by burning 10 million SHIB tokens.  Shiba Inu Price Analysis SHIB is in a downtrend today, dropping below its support level of $0.0000102. Also, it is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bearish sentiment for the short and long term. SHIB&#8217;s resistance levels are $0.0000118, $0.000012, and $0.0000113 as it is currently trading at $0.00000996. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.26 and descending into the oversold region of 30.  SHIB will likely experience further price decline in the coming days. However, the $0.00000973 support will prove critical and can act as a price pivot for a recovery. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview]]></description>

<p>Shiba Archives said a top SHIB developer claimed the Shibarium upgrade would be here before May. However, the developer did not <a href="https://twitter.com/rockolantigua/status/1652013474862759936" rel="nofollow">specify the year</a> or give further information.</p>
<p>Notably, some <a href="https://twitter.com/Chinmoy42052534/status/1642022231940431874" rel="nofollow">SHIB community members</a> reacted to the reduced burn rates in April 2023. A Twitter user, <a href="https://twitter.com/macguy1984/status/1652890963688460289" rel="nofollow">Macguy</a>, stated that the developers don&#8217;t want to listen to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHIBCommunity?src=hashtag_click" rel="nofollow">SHIB community</a>&#8216;s calls for more burns. He believes the burns are slow and dragged on purpose, announcing that he did his part by burning 10 million SHIB tokens. </p>

<p>SHIB&#8217;s resistance levels are $0.0000118, $0.000012, and $0.0000113 as it is currently trading at $0.00000996. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.26 and descending into the oversold region of 30. </p>
<p>SHIB will likely experience further price decline in the coming days. However, the $0.00000973 support will prove critical and can act as a price pivot for a recovery.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AVAX has been expanding its reach in various areas over the past few months, but one aspect that has seen tremendous growth is its smart contract deployment.  With this significant milestone, many investors and traders alike are speculating whether this development could be the catalyst that propels the Avalanche Network native token&#8217;s price to new heights.  Will this newfound growth in smart contracts lead to a surge in AVAX&#8217;s value? Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential Contract Deployment Spike Could Boost AVAX Adoption  According to the latest CoinMarketCap data, Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a minor 2.04% dip in its price over the last 24 hours, but still remains relatively steady at $17.04.  Despite this slight setback, data from Artemis reveals that the network has witnessed a significant spike in contract deployment, which can be a positive indicator for the protocol&#8217;s usage and adoption. The contract deployment of $AVAX has recently hit its highest levels in over six months.

This increased adoption and usage can ultimately drive up demand for AVAX. If the trend of contract deployment continues to rise, it could be a sign of a healthy and growing ecosystem on Avalanche. This, in turn, can further boost the token&#8217;s value. Avalanche Network TVL. Image: Defillama Avalanche’s DeFi Performance Disappoints Despite a significant increase in smart contract deployment on the Avalanche network, the platform&#8217;s performance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has been less than stellar.  Recent data shows a sharp decline in the platform&#8217;s decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, falling from 311 million to 13.74 million in just a few months. This has had a direct impact on Avalanche&#8217;s total value locked (TVL), which has also seen a decline. One of the contributing factors to the decline in Avalanche&#8217;s DeFi performance has been the decreasing interest in BTC.b, a wrapped Bitcoin token on the network used for DeFi purposes. According to data from Dune Analytics, all DEXes on the Avalanche network have witnessed a decline in BTC.b usage, indicating a lack of interest in the platform&#8217;s DeFi offerings.
