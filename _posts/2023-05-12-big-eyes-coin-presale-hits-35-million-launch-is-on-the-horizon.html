<p>This article will offer insights into the latest and most relevant updates in the crypto world, focusing on Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s (BIG) launch date, a bull market for Fantom (FTM), and the recent struggle of Uniswap (UNI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into how these tokens are performing and their potential for future growth!</p>
<p>BIG&rsquo;s Launch Date!</p>
<p>After months of suspense, the launch date of Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has finally been&nbsp; announced. The token&rsquo;s immensely popular presale will come to an end on June 3rd, and the official launch will take place less than two weeks later, on June 15th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has raised over $35 million in investments, making it the largest presale token of 2023! Furthermore, the token is well-known for its exceptional offers and bonus deals.

<p>Fantom Enables Token Trading Via Twitter!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM) was initially created as a smart contract platform, making it a viable alternative to Ethereum. The primary objective behind its design was to address the shortcomings of prior blockchains in areas such as scalability, security, and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its launch, the platform has been particularly successful in solving issues related to transaction speed, having achieved a reduction of less than two seconds!</p>
<p>Recently, FTM has experienced a significant surge in value. This is thanks to a new feature that enables users to send FTM and other tokens within the Fantom ecosystem via Twitter. This works by connecting users' Twitter accounts to their messenger which can transfer tokens to specific identities. Since a significant number of crypto communities connect on Twitter, FTM has made the perfect choice to incorporate this platform, which is why their recent rally may be just the beginning!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Uniswap Declines by 40%!</p>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) was founded in 2018 by a man named Hayden Adams, who aimed to offer the market a more efficient platform for cryptocurrency trading. To his success, UNI has become one of the most popular siteswaps on the crypto market today!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, UNI has seen a significant price drop in the last few months and its year-on-year performance has fallen by almost 40%! The price reports display a steady resistance at $5.60 and support at $5. Upon entering 2023, the crypto&rsquo;s recovery has been notably sluggish. Despite reaching an all-time trading volume of $1.5 trillion, Uniswap has faced challenges in maintaining its bullish momentum.</p>
<p>The crypto world is always evolving. BIG has had a hugely successful presale and will officially launch soon, offering bonus deals for investors. FTM has surged in value due to its integration with Twitter, allowing for easier token trading. However, UNI has struggled with a significant price drop over the past few months, and its recovery has been slow despite reaching an all-time high in trading volume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how these tokens develop in the future, but for now, BIG and FTM appear to be offering potential for growth, while UNI faces challenges.</p>
