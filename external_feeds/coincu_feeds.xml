<ul>
<li><em>Indonesia launches a national crypto asset bourse to monitor and regulate the growing crypto sector.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform allows the legal exchange of digital assets and aims to protect investors while strengthening regulatory oversight.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The government of Indonesia has taken a significant step in the cryptocurrency space by announcing the launch of a national cryptocurrency exchange. This move aims to provide regulators with transparent transaction records and offer better protection to crypto investors in the country.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1444.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1444.png" alt="Indonesia Steps Closer Into The Crypto Future with National Exchange Launch" class="wp-image-204625" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1444.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1444-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1444-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1444-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Indonesia Unleashes A Thriving Crypto Ecosystem With National Exchange Launch 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) revealed that the launch of the exchange and clearing house also seeks to strengthen monitoring of the rapidly growing sector during a transition in regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>The national cryptocurrency exchange, which was unveiled a week ago, has now commenced operations, as per a statement from the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency. This exchange will be the sole platform in Indonesia allowed for the legal exchange of digital assets. Bappebti confirmed the opening of the exchange on July 20 and <a href="https://bappebti.go.id/siaran_pers/detail/12795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> a Futures Clearing House along with the exchange to act as a mediator between buyers and sellers, ensuring smooth transactions.</p>



<p>It was previously reported that cryptocurrency sales in <a href="https://coincu.com/169798-indonesia-national-cryptocurrency-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indonesia</a> would be restricted to local transactions while aligning with international market developments. Licensed traders have been given one month to join the exchange.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1447.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1447-1024x538.png" alt="Indonesia Steps Closer Into The Crypto Future with National Exchange Launch" class="wp-image-204634" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1447-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1447-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1447-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1447-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1447-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1447.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Indonesia Unleashes A Thriving Crypto Ecosystem With National Exchange Launch 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Notably, while Indonesia bans the use of cryptocurrencies as a payment method, it permits investments in these assets. The pandemic-driven surge in interest led to a substantial increase in crypto investments, with data showing that as of June, approximately 17.54 million people in Indonesia had invested in digital assets, surpassing the number of investors registered with the stock exchange, according to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/indonesia-launches-new-crypto-bourse-clearing-house-2023-07-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>.</p>



<p>The launch of this national crypto exchange has been <a href="https://coincu.com/158082-indonesia-to-launch-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under development</a> since at least December 2021 and was initially scheduled for the end of 2022. However, it was delayed until June 2023 to facilitate the review of potential exchange participants. During that time, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan announced that all active crypto exchanges with national registration would be eligible to join the exchange. The recent integration tests between traders, exchanges, clearing, and depository indicate the project&#8217;s progress.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448-1024x605.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="605" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448-1024x605.png" alt="Indonesia Steps Closer Into The Crypto Future with National Exchange Launch" class="wp-image-204635" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448-1024x605.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448-300x177.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448-768x454.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448-1536x908.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448-750x443.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448-1140x674.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1448.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Indonesia Unleashes A Thriving Crypto Ecosystem With National Exchange Launch 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Under a new law signed earlier this year, the regulation, supervision, and oversight of crypto will be transferred from Bappebti to the Financial Services Authorities, with a two-year transition period. In response to the substantial growth of physical crypto asset trading, the Deputy Minister of Indonesia&#8217;s Ministry of Trade, Jerry Sambuaga, proposed policy changes, including the requirement for two-thirds of directors and commissioners at crypto firms to be Indonesian citizens.</p>



<p>Despite a recent decline in crypto transactions due to rising global interest rates, Indonesia&#8217;s crypto market remains attractive. In 2021, around 4% of the country&#8217;s population, nearly 11 million people, had invested in cryptocurrencies, according to Bappebti data. The launch of the national crypto exchange is expected to boost the <a href="https://coincu.com/149374-bank-of-indonesia-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indonesian crypto ecosystem</a> and facilitate enhanced regulatory oversight in this rapidly evolving industry.</p>

This innovative addition will make dappOS stand out as a cutting-edge platform in the highly competitive Web3 space.</p>

<p>Another exciting feature highlighted in the roadmap is the implementation of a new bidding system. This addition is expected to foster a competitive environment, driving innovation and encouraging developers to create ever more exceptional decentralized applications.</p>



<p>The V2 roadmap is divided into three distinct phases, each with its own set of objectives and milestones. The first phase, &#8220;super stable,&#8221; focuses on building a robust and reliable foundation for the protocol, ensuring its seamless integration into the Web3 ecosystem.</p>

<p>On-chain data shows some whales – or large holders of an asset – added upward of $6 million to their link holdings during the morning, with the increased demand lifting prices as much as over 22%.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/203471-chainlink-new-protocol-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CCIP</a> is designed to help build cross-chain applications and services. It was being tested by at least 25 partners that are now beginning to move to the mainnet and was pushed live for early access users on the Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains.</p>



<p>The protocol will expand <a href="https://coincu.com/188774-chainlink-vrf-live-on-arbitrum-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink</a>’s use case by making it possible for companies like banks and insurance firms to join the blockchain. The announcement came a month after Chainlink announced that it was running a trial of linking banks to the blockchain through its partnership with Swift.</p>



<p>On Thursday, CCIP will become available to all developers across five testnets: Arbitrum Goerli, Avalanche Fuji, Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Goerli, and Polygon Mumbai.</p>

<p>Chainlink price rise led the crypto market gains on Friday as the altcoin found sudden optimism from its investors. The reason behind this was a speech from the project’s founder that highlighted the potential impact of their new service on the blockchain industry.</p>



<p>LINK shot up on Thursday following the comments from its co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, during an interview at the EthCC event. Nazarov was discussing the company’s newly launched cross-chain interoperability protocol, which would ease the transfer of funds between blockchains.</p>



<p>LINK could be seen trading at $8.46 after noting a near 20% rally in the span of 24 hours, up from $6.88. The green candlestick marked the largest single-day growth for the altcoin this year, bringing the cryptocurrency to a three-month high and near the year-to-date high.</p>

<p>There are signs that whales have started buying the coin. Data shows that two whales <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1681942827880820736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> 788,877 LINK tokens this week. They bought these tokens by swapping their stETH and ETH tokens for LINK. Historically, accumulation by whales is usually one of the best buy signals in the market.</p>



<p>Most of these transactions ended up generating profits for the LINK holders, which makes the market susceptible to potential profit-taking. If such selling was to take place, the cryptocurrency is bound to absorb some selling pressure.</p>



<p>However, up until the time of writing, the supply of exchanges has only observed a decline and not incline. This translates to optimism from investors of a further increase in price, which is why they have been mostly accumulating for the past month, ramping it up in the last week.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>McDonald&#8217;s Hong Kong launches its own metaverse in celebration of the 40th anniversary of Chicken McNuggets.</em></li>



<li><em>The McNuggets Land metaverse, built on The Sandbox platform, offers players mini-games and rewards in the form of SAND tokens and virtual accessories.</em></li>



<li><em>McDonald&#8217;s joins global brands like Adidas and Coca-Cola in embracing blockchain technology and the metaverse for innovative brand promotion.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>McDonald&#8217;s Hong Kong has taken a step into the metaverse, following the likes of Adidas, Nike, and Starbucks. The fast-food giant <a href="https://sandboxgame.medium.com/celebrate-chicken-mcnuggets-40th-anniversary-in-the-sandbox-dda3a0a115c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> its own virtual world called &#8220;McNuggets Land&#8221; on the Ethereum blockchain-based platform, The Sandbox.</strong></h5>

<p>This metaverse allows users to engage in mini-games and quests set in a McNuggets-themed virtual space.</p>



<p>Players can earn rewards, including the native cryptocurrency of the Sandbox ecosystem called SAND tokens, as well as in-game accessories. The initiative celebrates the 40th anniversary of the iconic Chicken McNugget, which was introduced globally in 1983.</p>



<p>McDonald&#8217;s Hong Kong participation in The Sandbox reflects its recent track record of collaboration with hundreds of global companies and IPs, many of whom are now constructing a virtual brand experience for their audience.</p>

<p>Sebastien Borget, co-founder and COO of The Sandbox said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Collaborating with a global brand like McDonald’s, with its extensive customer base, takes The Sandbox to a new level and brings us closer to realizing the ultimate goal of mass adoption of the metaverse.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In McNuggets Land, Hong Kong Sandbox users have the opportunity to earn real-world McDonald&#8217;s coupons by successfully completing quests. The metaverse access will be available until August 28, providing customers with an immersive experience in the McNuggets-themed virtual realm.</p>



<p>This is not McDonald&#8217;s first foray into the world of blockchain technology and digital assets. In late 2021, both the US and China branches of the fast-food chain launched their own NFT collections, tapping into the growing interest in non-fungible tokens.</p>



<p>As Web3 gains prominence, major global brands like Adidas, Coca-Cola, and Louis Vuitton are actively exploring decentralized blockchain technologies, the metaverse, and NFTs as creative avenues to promote their products and enhance customer engagement. The metaverse&#8217;s growing popularity offers companies exciting opportunities to interact with consumers in immersive and engaging ways.</p>

<p>The Sandbox, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands Corporation Ltd., enables users to create, monetize, and take ownership of their gaming experiences within the metaverse. Notable celebrities and brands, such as Snoop Dogg, and Warner Music Group, have already partnered with The Sandbox to develop their decentralized virtual worlds.</p>



<p>Moreover, McDonald&#8217;s has continued its innovative marketing strategies using cutting-edge technology. For the Lunar New Year campaign, the company collaborated with digital content artist Karen X Cheng, incorporating AI and AR elements. The 30-second ad featured a QR code leading viewers to additional campaign content, inspired by Cheng&#8217;s cherished childhood memories of the event.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>US prosecutors accuse FTX co-founder Samuel Bankman-Fried of using private documents to discredit potential witness Caroline Ellison in a criminal fraud trial.</em></li>



<li><em>Bankman-Fried allegedly shared selective documents with the media to portray Ellison as the sole perpetrator of FTX&#8217;s alleged crimes, seeking to undermine her credibility.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US prosecutors have accused Samuel Bankman-Fried (SBF), the co-founder of crypto exchange FTX, of using private documents to discredit his ex-girlfriend and potential witness, Caroline Ellison, in an ongoing criminal fraud trial.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research LLC, had previously pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to a cryptocurrency exchange collapse and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the case against SBF.</p>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-21/bankman-fried-leaked-ex-s-writings-to-discredit-her-us-alleges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg News</a></em>, prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried selectively shared certain private documents with <em>The New York Times</em>, portraying Ellison as a jilted lover responsible for the alleged FTX crimes. The purpose behind this action was to undermine Ellison&#8217;s credibility and advance his defense through the media, bypassing the confines of the courtroom and rules of evidence.</p>



<p><em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> a story based on writings by Ellison found in Google Docs and personal journals. These writings appeared to reveal her ambivalence about her role at FTX and her relationship with Bankman-Fried.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy-1024x682.jpg" alt="US Prosecutors Accuse Bankman-Fried Of Attempting To Discredit Witness In Trial" class="wp-image-204603" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy-750x500.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1671035700-carolineellisontwittercopy.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US Prosecutors Accuse Bankman-Fried Of Attempting To Discredit Witness In Trial 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>Prosecutors argued that the documents excerpted in the article did not come from materials provided to Bankman-Fried during pretrial information sharing. They suspect the documents were sourced from his personal Google Drive account.</p>



<p>The government contends that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense strategy aims to cast Ellison as the sole perpetrator of the alleged FTX crimes, despite overwhelming evidence suggesting otherwise. Prosecutors view these attempts to malign Ellison&#8217;s credibility in advance of trial as prejudicial and improper.</p>



<p>In response to these developments, prosecutors have requested that the judge issue an order limiting extrajudicial statements by parties and witnesses to ensure a fair trial by an impartial jury.</p>



<p>In a separate legal battle, FTX has <a href="https://coincu.com/204533-ftx-sues-sbf-and-former-executives-recover-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit in the United States Bankruptcy Court against <a href="https://coincu.com/198247-bankman-fried-pretrial-motions-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> and other key executives from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange. The complaint seeks to recover over $1 billion in allegedly misappropriated funds. The lawsuit names Caroline Ellison, FTX co-founder Zixiao &#8220;Gary&#8221; Wang, former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh, and Bankman-Fried as defendants.</p>

<p>FTX accuses the former executives of breaching their fiduciary duties by continuously misappropriating customer funds for personal purposes, such as luxury condominiums, political contributions, speculative investments, and other projects.</p>



<p>In previous news, Ellison <a href="https://coincu.com/204571-former-alameda-co-ceo-admits-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> that FTX.com had a cash deficit of more than $10 billion about eight months before FTX collapsed.</p>



<p>As the legal battles unfold, the crypto community closely watches the developments, which have significant implications for the future of crypto regulation and legal responsibilities within the industry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Crypto advocacy groups, CoinCenter and the Blockchain Association, criticize the US Senate&#8217;s &#8220;Crypto Assets National Security Enhancement Act of 2023.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>The bill proposes strict regulations on individuals involved in decentralized finance (DeFi), making platform operators and stakeholders responsible for illegal uses of their platforms.</em></li>



<li><em>Critics argue that the bill extends sanctions and Bank Secrecy Act obligations to individual developers, potentially leading to overreach and restricting free speech.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Two prominent crypto policy advocacy groups, CoinCenter, and the Blockchain Association, have expressed strong criticism of the &#8220;Crypto Assets National Security Enhancement Act of 2023&#8221; introduced in the US Senate. </strong></h5>

<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/204102-us-senate-proposes-new-bill-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bill</a>, titled the Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement and Enforcement Act (CANSEE), aims to impose strict regulations on individuals involved in decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>



<p>If passed into law, the CANSEE Act would hold DeFi platform operators and major stakeholders accountable for any illegal use of their platforms. However, CoinCenter and the Blockchain Association believe that the bill carries significant flaws and overreaches that could have negative consequences for the crypto community.</p>



<p>In a joint statement, CoinCenter and its executive director, Jerry Brito, <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-cansee-act-is-a-messy-arbitrary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">condemned</a> the proposal as messy, arbitrary, and unconstitutional. One major concern raised by CoinCenter is that the bill would extend sanctions and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations to individual developers, giving the Secretary of the Treasury full power to decide who controls specific protocols. The proposed exemption does not adequately address this issue.</p>



<p>The groups also expressed apprehension over potential overreach, as the bill could result in enforcement actions against those who publish books containing code. This, <a href="https://coincu.com/133214-coin-center-sues-us-treasury/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinCenter</a> argues, could limit free speech and stifle innovation within the crypto space.</p>

<p>While acknowledging the government&#8217;s intention to combat money laundering, CoinCenter believes that the bill takes a &#8220;blanket ban&#8221; approach and lacks the necessary nuance to protect individual rights. They urge the authorities to consider a more balanced and targeted approach to achieve their objectives.</p>



<p>The Blockchain Association also <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1681689788225650689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a response to the CANSEE Act, highlighting that illegal transactions accounted for a mere 0.24% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2022. According to the advocacy group and its CEO, Kristin Smith, current regulations already provide sufficient powers to enforce the law effectively. They deem the bill &#8220;unworkable&#8221; and simply incompatible with digital asset technology.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1434.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1434.png" alt="CoinCenter Strongly Criticizes With US Senate&#039;s New DeFi Regulation Bill" class="wp-image-204595" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1434.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1434-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="CoinCenter Strongly Criticizes With US Senate&#039;s New DeFi Regulation Bill 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Both CoinCenter and the <a href="https://coincu.com/143673-blockchain-in-secs-against-ripple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchain Association</a> expressed support for alternative efforts to prevent illicit activities, such as amendments to the National Defense Act that specifically target cryptocurrencies. The groups assert that these targeted measures would better address concerns without compromising individual freedoms and the growth of the crypto industry.</p>



<p>The CANSEE Act was introduced in a bipartisan manner on July 19 by members of the US Senate Banking Committee, including Democratic senators Jack Reed and Mark Warner, along with Republican senators Mike Rounds and Mitt Romney. The bill is now under review in the US Senate, where further discussions and potential amendments are expected. If enacted, it could have far-reaching implications for the DeFi space and crypto stakeholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Former Alameda Research Co-CEO Caroline Ellison admits fraud and estimates a cash deficit of over $10 billion at FTX.com before its collapse.</em></li>



<li><em>Court documents reveal that FTX.com owed customers more than $8 billion in fiat currency, which it couldn&#8217;t repay.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX sues founder Sam Bankman-Fried and former executives to recover more than $1 billion allegedly misappropriated before the exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a shocking revelation, court documents <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> in the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings for FTX, the once-prominent cryptocurrency exchange once an empire with sister company Alameda Research, have unveiled a staggering cash deficit of over $10 billion about eight months before the platform&#8217;s collapse, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-20/alameda-co-ceo-saw-over-10-billion-ftx-cash-gap-in-march-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-1024x683.png" alt="Former Alameda Co-CEO Admits Fraud, Estimates $10 Billion Cash Deficit" class="wp-image-204586" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Former Alameda Co-CEO Admits Fraud, Estimates $10 Billion Cash Deficit 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the documents, Caroline Ellison, the former co-CEO of Alameda Research, made this eye-popping estimate in March 2022 through private notes. This disclosure adds another layer of complexity to the already tumultuous situation surrounding FTX.</p>



<p>Moreover, the court filing further alleges that FTX executives, along with Ellison, privately estimated in August of the preceding year that the exchange owed customers more than $8 billion in fiat currency, which it was unable to repay. The scale of these figures indicates a grave financial crisis brewing within FTX, raising questions about the management&#8217;s decisions and the overall financial health of the exchange.</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, has been at the center of the controversy. FTX&#8217;s downfall last November sent shockwaves throughout the crypto sector and triggered calls for stricter regulatory oversight of digital assets from authorities in the United States and beyond. US authorities have accused FTX of using customer funds for trading activities at the affiliated hedge fund Alameda and for personal expenses. The situation has escalated into one of the highest-profile bankruptcies ever witnessed in the US crypto landscape.</p>

<p>The gravity of the situation has led <a href="https://coincu.com/204325-ftx-recover-71m-charity-life-science/">FTX</a>, under the guidance of a new executive team led by restructuring expert <a href="https://coincu.com/151386-john-ray-refutes-contention-re-ftx-solvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Ray</a>, to take legal action against its own founder and three other former executives. The lawsuit <a href="https://coincu.com/204533-ftx-sues-sbf-and-former-executives-recover-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aims</a> to claw back more than $1 billion that the company claims was misappropriated in the months leading up to the exchange&#8217;s collapse. The allegations encompass a wide range of transactions, including share awards, real estate purchases, and cash transfers.</p>



<p>One notable incident detailed in the lawsuit involves Caroline Ellison, who was previously responsible for FTX&#8217;s trading arm, Alameda Research. It is alleged that Ellison paid herself a substantial bonus of $22.5 million, part of which was later transferred to a personal bank account and eventually invested in a company specializing in artificial intelligence research. The lawsuit also implicates Zixiao &#8220;Gary&#8221; Wang, a co-founder of FTX, and Nishad Singh, a former employee of both FTX and Alameda, as beneficiaries of illicit transfers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="862" height="485" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431.png" alt="Former Alameda Co-CEO Admits Fraud, Estimates $10 Billion Cash Deficit" class="wp-image-204588" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431.png 862w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" title="Former Alameda Co-CEO Admits Fraud, Estimates $10 Billion Cash Deficit 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>The legal proceedings have taken a dramatic turn as Ellison, Wang, and Nishad Singh have all pleaded guilty to various charges, including fraud, in separate criminal cases unrelated to the recent lawsuit. However, Sam Bankman-Fried has entered a plea of not guilty to US criminal charges, which include fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance violations.</p>



<p>As the bankruptcy proceedings continue to unfold, the fate of FTX remains uncertain. The exchange&#8217;s executives are diligently working to recover funds and repay creditors, all while trying to restore confidence in the crypto sector. The outcome of the legal battle and the efforts to unwind the alleged misappropriated assets will likely have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry, influencing regulatory measures and investor trust in the market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Recent NYDIG research speculates that momentum from Bitcoin Spot ETFs could bring in $30 billion in new demand for the digital asset.</em></li>



<li><em>Currently has $28.8 billion in bitcoin assets under management with $27.6 billion in spot-like products.</em></li>



<li><em>The US SEC has accepted six spot bitcoin ETF proposals for consideration.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a recent research <a href="https://viewemail.nydig.com/estimating-the-size-of-spot-etf?ecid=ACsprvtc_0cO7kdkM7J6U0cnRWG73-wGxdDEOaNEGQv4RGLXD4cd0RmQC1ejvDhujo1CX3XoZykT&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=266380078&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TDHBegA66jxJDo8pBMdolD_XE5W-iPqYVyv87jKPVBQlVbzFwn1srAYKZW2EHJTFpRpIujEN-SLP52npxzZ_pjg1oug&amp;utm_content=266380078&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by crypto exchange NYDIG, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs registration craze could generate $30 billion in new demand for the crypto market.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1423.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1423.png" alt="Trending Bitcoin Spot ETFs Could Drive $30 Billion In New Demand: Report" class="wp-image-204574" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1423.png 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1423-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Trending Bitcoin Spot ETFs Could Drive $30 Billion In New Demand: Report 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Currently, NYDIG has modeled that there are $28.8 billion in bitcoin assets under management with $27.6 billion in spot-like products.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold, so it will inevitably be compared to the gold ETFs listed in the early 2000s. Currently, gold ETFs hold only 1.6% of the total global gold supply, the NYDIG pointed out, compared with 17.1% of central banks, while bitcoin funds hold 4.9% of the total bitcoin supply.</p>



<p>There is a huge demand gap for digital and analog versions of assets in funds. There is over $210 billion invested in gold funds, while only $28.8 billion is in bitcoin funds due to the asset&#8217;s high volatility.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1425.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="516" height="494" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1425.png" alt="Trending Bitcoin Spot ETFs Could Drive $30 Billion In New Demand: Report" class="wp-image-204576" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1425.png 516w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1425-300x287.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" title="Trending Bitcoin Spot ETFs Could Drive $30 Billion In New Demand: Report 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The NYDIG&#8217;s conclusion that the real potential of a Bitcoin ETF lies in a convergence of factors: the launch of an ETF, a weaker US dollar, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s shift to quantitative easing, and a generational transfer of assets to younger individuals who are more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>In a twist on July 19, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://coincu.com/204120-sec-adds-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-federal-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accepted</a> applications to create a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund from six companies, including BlackRock (BLK.N), for consideration, the first step in the agency&#8217;s process to decide whether or not to approve the latest round of proposals.</p>



<p>The SEC also officially recognized applications from Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree (WT.N), Fidelity, and Invesco (IVZ.N) for a similar spot bitcoin ETF, with those proposals appearing on the Federal Register on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>



<p>It has been more than 10 years since the first application statement was filed for a spot bitcoin ETF, and investors are once again excited about the prospect that one of the existing applications will be approved.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Aave community conducts a vote for introducing a Stability Module (PSM) for the GHO stablecoin.</em></li>



<li><em>The proposed module aims to maintain GHO&#8217;s peg with innovative features and price strategies.</em></li>



<li><em>It includes Debt Ceiling control, Capital Allocator, and risk management mechanisms.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aave community has <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x98bdd30f645b2981320f82c671ae9fee31ee771766c13cd2627b66a22f0d438e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken</a> a significant step towards enhancing the stability of the GHO token by proposing the introduction of a Peg Stability Module (PSM) for GHO. </strong></h5>

<p>Through a governance vote, community members are actively participating in a temperature check to gauge approval for the proposed stability module. The voting, which commenced on the Snapshot voting page, is set to conclude on July 23. This innovative mechanism, known as a Peg Stability Module, has proven effective in other stablecoin projects like MakerDAO, enabling the seamless conversion of two tokens at a predetermined ratio.</p>



<p>The proposed GHO Stability Module (GSM) draws inspiration from the successful PSM models while introducing unique features that cater to GHO&#8217;s specific requirements. One of the key features of the GSM is the introduction of &#8220;Price Strategies.&#8221; These strategies offer flexibility in adjusting the pricing ratio between GHO and governance-accepted stablecoins. The Price Strategies can be either fixed or dynamic, based on market conditions, price oracles, linear curves, or stableswap curves. For its initial launch, the proposal recommends implementing a Fixed Pricing Strategy, allowing for smooth integration.</p>



<p>To exercise control over exposure to specific assets backing <a href="https://coincu.com/201480-aave-dao-to-launch-gho-on-through-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GHO</a>, the proposed GSM includes a &#8220;Debt Ceiling&#8221; feature. This feature empowers the DAO to set a maximum limit on the exposure to exogenous assets. If a user attempts to mint GHO and the amount of exogenous assets exceeds the defined Debt Ceiling, the transaction will be automatically reverted, ensuring risk management and stability.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-1024x576.png" alt="Aave Community Proposes Innovative Stability Module For GHO Token" class="wp-image-204578" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave Community Proposes Innovative Stability Module For GHO 25"></a></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, the GSM incorporates a &#8220;Capital Allocator,&#8221; providing a method for a designated &#8220;fund manager&#8221; to allocate and earn yield from a pre-defined portion of exogenous assets within the GSM. The configurable threshold for capital allocation will be decided through a separate governance process, ensuring transparency and effective asset management.</p>



<p>In the face of rapid increases in exogenous asset risk, the GSM is equipped with &#8220;Last Resort Liquidations&#8221; to mitigate potential threats. This mechanism allows the liquidation of the exogenous asset in extreme scenarios, offering an effective safeguard in times of crisis.</p>



<p>Moreover, the GSM features &#8220;Price Bounds and Swap Freezes&#8221; to address any price deviations of the exogenous asset from the 1:1 ratio. These safeguards allow for temporary halting of trading when significant deviations occur, thereby preventing adverse fluctuations in the system.</p>



<p>The temperature check vote will serve as a significant milestone, setting the stage for community discussions and governance processes. If the proposal receives community approval, the next steps include engaging community auditors to review the GSM codebase. Following the audit, the codebase will be shared with the community alongside an Aave Request for Comment (ARFC) based on the Facilitator Onboarding Process Framework.</p>

<p>During the subsequent governance stage, the community will have the opportunity to decide on various GSM configurations, such as initial Debt Ceilings, Exogenous Assets, Pricing Strategy, Distribution for Capital Allocation, and Price Bounds for Swap Freezes.</p>



<p>The Aave community is confident that GHO Stability Module will play a pivotal role in maintaining GHO&#8217;s stability and bolstering confidence in the platform&#8217;s peg stability mechanism. As <a href="https://coincu.com/203057-aave-wants-to-launch-v3-on-linea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave</a> continues to foster active community engagement and governance, it reinforces its position as a leading DeFi ecosystem, driving innovation and resilience in the decentralized finance space.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/203080-aave-unleashes-gho/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Aave announced that GHO has successfully launched on the Ethereum mainnet. This is a huge step forward for the Aave protocol and its community since GHO aspires to be a decentralized stablecoin that empowers users and encourages a people-powered financial ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The OpenSea NFT Marketplace has announced the launch of the &#8220;Deals&#8221; peer-to-peer NFT trading function.</em></li>



<li><em>The new feature allows collectors to trade NFTs directly with each other as well as adding WETH to simplify the transaction process further.</em></li>



<li><em>To initiate the swap, users need to connect their wallet and search for the person they want to trade NFT using their username, address, or ESN.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to official news, NFT marketplace <a href="https://coincu.com/203742-etherfis-ether-fan-nft-collection-opensea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea </a>has launched a &#8220;Deals&#8221; peer-to-peer NFT trading function, which can help traders interact directly with other collectors.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="567" height="337" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png" alt="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot;" class="wp-image-204560" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png 567w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" title="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot; 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>OpenSea said in a tweet that Deals will allow collectors to trade NFTs with each other &#8211; as well as include coated ether (WETH). It added that OpenSea&#8217;s native NFT protocol Seaport powers the feature to ensure smooth transactions and save gas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Deals: offer your NFTs for theirs, securely on OpenSea.<br><br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK" target="_blank">https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK</a> <a href="https://t.co/KR2MLbi7jh" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/KR2MLbi7jh</a></p>&mdash; OpenSea (@opensea) <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1682077991029932032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With the Deals function, collectors can now connect with each other easily. To initiate the swap, users need to connect their wallet and search for the person they want to trade NFT using their username, address, or ESN. Once defined, users can select an NFT from their collection that they wish to trade and select an NFT of their choice from the other.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deals website</a>, users can enter the username, ENS name, or wallet address of the person they want to make a transaction with. They can then choose up to 30 NFTs, as well as the amount of WETH they want to add to the swap, if any.</p>



<p>Next, they choose the asset they want to offer for trading, and then they can submit the transaction for review. Currently, OpenSea requires that NFTs on both sides of the deal be on the same chain and from badged (verified) collections.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="722" height="343" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png" alt="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot;" class="wp-image-204561" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png 722w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" title="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot; 28"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The swap proposal could also include WETH token incentives, adding more flexibility to the process. The other party can then review and accept the agreement directly through this NFT platform.</p>



<p>An OpenSea spokesperson said Deals aims to invite more users to join the NFT community by simplifying the transaction process. This move signifies the NFT platform&#8217;s commitment to providing a superior experience for NFT enthusiasts and staying ahead in the competitive market.</p>
