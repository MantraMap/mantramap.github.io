					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu coin showed its teeth over the weekend, with a solid 15% increase in value. Shiba Inu is creating a name for itself in the financial world and is far from being just another cryptocurrency begging for attention. This coin&#8217;s recent increase has raised the question: Does it have the ability to come out stronger in a bear market &#8211; or is it just all noise? Shiba Inu made a sharp rally after exiting a phase of consolidation on Friday afternoon. At the time of writing, the meme coin was trading at $0.0000097, up 9.2% in the last 24 hours, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. The highlight of SHIB&#8217;s solid upward trajectory was in the seven-day timeframe, registering an impressive 15.1% rally. At last check, the coin&#8217;s 24-hour volume climbed 236% to $683 million. Its market cap also increased by 12.3% to $5.81 billion.

After Binance disclosed that the meme currency was a recognized collateral asset for loans on the exchange, the price increased. Holders will be able to deposit SHIB as collateral to get &#8220;Flexible Loans&#8221; on Binance as a result of this development. Additionally, the action is thought to give the coin more credibility than its meme roots and cause a jump in its value, reviving investor interest. This development highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where the intersection of social media trends, technological advancement, and institutional acceptance can drive meme coins like SHIB to achieve notable objectives and draw interest from both crypto supporters and the mainstream financial community. SHIB market cap currently at $5.8 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com Ahead of the debut of Shiba Inu&#8217;s blockchain initiative Shibarium, enthusiasm toward cryptocurrencies has also strengthened in recent days.

					<description><![CDATA[A new report has shown investors who held Bitcoin actually outperformed most cryptocurrency funds in the first half of 2023. This is because, between January and June, Bitcoin gained over 80% in value.  Crypto funds, on the other hand, on the other hand, returned only about 15.2% profits on average. While still a positive return, it lagged far behind what regular Bitcoin investors made by just buying and sitting tight.  21e6 Capital’s Crypto Fund Performance in H1 2023 According to a recently released report from Switzerland-based investment adviser 21e6 Capital AG, Bitcoin traders outperformed most crypto funds by 68.8% in H1.

When crypto is hot, that cash doesn’t appreciate like BTC would unless the funds’ assets perform significantly better than Bitcoin. The report also noted that directional crypto funds generally outperformed non-directional crypto funds.

This influx of capital could spark a fresh bull market for all cryptocurrencies, leading to further gains for BTC holders. This new volume could see the price of BTC rise above $30,000 once more.

About 13% of crypto hedge funds shut this year, as a few of them have struggled to present a favorable value proposition to potential investors.</p>

<p>The price of Bitcoin seems to be struggling to break over $30,000, but the outlook for Bitcoin in the second half of 2023 still looks positive. If approved, the price of Bitcoin is expected to spike further in the coming months as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/us-institutional-investors-flocking-back-to-bitcoin-bottom-in/">major investment companies start to offer Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>. </p>
<p>This influx of capital could spark a fresh bull market for all cryptocurrencies, leading to further gains for BTC holders. This new volume could see the price of BTC rise above $30,000 once more.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $29,043.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Massive XRP whale wallets are at it again as recently, some of the largest holders of XRP have dumped over 100 million tokens, putting major selling pressure on the XRP price.  On-chain data shows that since July 19, the overall supply in addresses holding between 100,000-1,000,000 coins has decreased from 6.85 billion to 6.75 billion. Whales Taking Profit After Pump The actions of whales or large holders of cryptocurrencies seem to always tell the nature of general market sentiment. When whales sell off chunks of their holding, it often triggers a cascade of smaller holders selling in response, driving the price down.  Related Reading: These Are The Factors That Could Lead To Another Bitcoin Rally: ARK Invest While retail investors and smaller holders often get caught up in the excitement of price rises and buy-in at the top, whales are more likely to sell off after massive price jumps and buy back in after the pullback.

The price of XRP rose over 70% in less than 24 hours to $0.85 on the back of the news but has since declined about 15% from the yearly high. Data shows that the price decline started two weeks ago, around the same time when XRP whales started selling off their holdings.

Sell-offs are likely to trigger more selloffs. So In the short term, we’re likely to see some price volatility and fluctuations as the market absorbs the impact of such a large amount of tokens entering circulation.  The price of XRP, on the other hand, is doing well compared to the overall market. It was reported earlier last month that whales have been amassing more than $500 million in XRP since February in anticipation of positive developments within the ecosystem.  Ripple, the company behind the altcoin, says it is now eyeing the tokenized assets market as it hopes to unlock trillions of dollars of value in the global financial system.

At the time of writing, the premier cryptocurrency is trading at around $29,022, with its daily trading volume valued at $10.746 billion, having gone down 12.54%.  However, amidst Bitcoin&#8217;s current downtrend, it appears the token&#8217;s larger performance could be indicating a bullish market in the coming months.

					<description><![CDATA[In the midst of the ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape, Optimism (OP) has shown remarkable resilience, posting a notable price increase of 13.53% in the past seven days. Despite facing a slight decline of 1.80% in the last 24 hours and a further 1.35% shrinkage within the hour, Optimism remains on an upward trajectory. With the current price sitting at $1.68 per OP and still 48.38% below its all-time high of $3.26, traders and investors are eager to uncover the reasons behind its recent gains. This article explores the factors contributing to Optimism&#8217;s recent surge and analyzes its prospects. High Profile Hack Could Stall Optimism (OP) Bullish Trajectory  Optimism&#8217;s positive trajectory took an unexpected turn when Coinbase&#8217;s newly launched BASE network, built on the Optimism Stack, fell victim to a backdoor contract exploit. This unfortunate event resulted in the loss of 597 Ether, equivalent to approximately $1 million. The exploit involved infiltrating a backdoor contract on the BASE Chain, which enabled the continuous minting of tokens that were subsequently sold for profit. The exploiters managed to mint 40 different tokens, generating significant profit, which was then moved out of the perpetrators&#8217; address. Related Reading: Curve Finance Exploiter Returns 61,000 ETH After Protocol’s Stern Warning As BASE anchors the OP Stack, there are concerns that the recent exploit could have repercussions on all associated protocols, including the Optimism network. Furthermore, the hype surrounding BASE had attracted several new addresses to the Optimism network, potentially dampening investor sentiment and a subsequent impact on OP&#8217;s price. The number of active addresses on the Optimism network increased following BASE&#8217;s launch in late February. However, the recent hack may stall this growth, as investors might exercise caution in the wake of the exploit. Will The Bulls Sustain The Impressive Rally? Despite the recent BASE exploit, Optimism (OP) has managed to maintain a sense of optimism in the market. The OP/USD daily chart displays promising signs of bullish momentum, with the bulls surpassing critical support levels. Short green candlesticks formed above the $1.631 support level indicate the market&#8217;s resilience and determination to keep the price afloat despite the challenges posed by the recent exploit. The technical indicators further reinforce the bullish outlook for Optimism. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) remains above the signal line, characterized by green histogram bars that signify the asset&#8217;s bullish momentum. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered the overbought region, reaching a value of 75. This suggests a considerable increase in buying pressure on OP as investors show confidence in the token&#8217;s potential for future growth.

The recent BASE exploit has raised concerns about the potential impact on Optimism&#8217;s network and the broader sentiment surrounding the token.  The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and external events can have significant implications for token prices. It is crucial for market participants to closely monitor developments related to the exploit and assess any potential consequences for Optimism&#8217;s price trajectory. Despite the positive indicators and bullish momentum, staying informed and vigilant in such a rapidly changing market is essential for making well-informed decisions.

<p>As BASE anchors the OP Stack, there are concerns that the recent exploit could have repercussions on all associated protocols, including the Optimism network. Furthermore, the hype surrounding BASE had attracted several new addresses to the Optimism network, potentially dampening investor sentiment and a subsequent impact on OP&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>The number of active addresses on the Optimism network increased following BASE&#8217;s launch in late February. However, the recent hack may stall this growth, as investors might exercise caution in the wake of the exploit.</p>
<h2><strong>Will The Bulls Sustain The Impressive Rally?</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the recent BASE exploit, Optimism (OP) has managed to maintain a sense of optimism in the market. The OP/USD daily chart displays promising signs of bullish momentum, with the bulls surpassing critical support levels. Short green candlesticks formed above the $1.631 support level indicate the market&#8217;s resilience and determination to keep the price afloat despite the challenges posed by the recent exploit.</p>
<p>The technical indicators further reinforce the bullish outlook for Optimism. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) remains above the signal line, characterized by green histogram bars that signify the asset&#8217;s bullish momentum. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered the overbought region, reaching a value of 75. This suggests a considerable increase in buying pressure on OP as investors show confidence in the token&#8217;s potential for future growth.</p>

<p>However, while the market sentiment remains positive, traders and investors should exercise caution. The recent BASE exploit has raised concerns about the potential impact on Optimism&#8217;s network and the broader sentiment surrounding the token. </p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and external events can have significant implications for token prices. It is crucial for market participants to closely monitor developments related to the exploit and assess any potential consequences for Optimism&#8217;s price trajectory. Despite the positive indicators and bullish momentum, staying informed and vigilant in such a rapidly changing market is essential for making well-informed decisions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin, may now be the 11th largest bitcoin holder in the world. This comes after the stablecoin issuer recently published its attestation report for Q2 2023. According to the report, Tether recorded an increase in excess reserves, which grew by $850 million. This brought the company’s total excess reserves to approximately $3.3 billion. These excess reserves are profits that the company does not distribute to shareholders as dividends. Instead, Tether keeps them to shore up its 100% reserves, which are used to back all USDT in circulation and keep the token stable. Related Reading: USDT Issuer Tether Reports A 30% Decline In Profit Tether Holds $1.6 Billion Worth Of BTC In Single Wallet? In the last quarter, Tether published that it held more than $1.5 billion worth of BTC (about 53,495 BTC) in its reserves. Based on the latest quarterly report, this figure has grown by more than $176 million, bringing the company’s Bitcoin holdings to roughly $1.676 billion (around 55,022 BTC). Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co, found in the last quarter that Tether may be holding all their Bitcoin in one wallet, making them the 12th largest BTC holder at the time. Fast forward to Q2 2023, it appears that the analyst has confirmed his initial speculations. In the first quarter, the BTC holdings of Tether’s “possible” wallet address matched the BTC amount published in the company’s attestation report. The BTC balance of this address has also increased in the second quarter, corresponding with the amount provided in Tether’s Q2 report. The analyst noted that only one Bitcoin address matches the figures of Tether’s BTC reserves. And this address, which may belong to the stablecoin issuer, is now the 11th largest Bitcoin holder in the world. While Wan sought Tether and the company’s CTO Paolo Ardoino to corroborate his findings, there has been no official confirmation from the stablecoin issuer. Tether’s BTC Holdings Consistent With Initial Plans This significant amount of BTC Tether holds in its reserves comes as no surprise, especially as the firm has always been clear about its Bitcoin investment intentions. In May, the stablecoin issuer announced plans to invest 15% of its future profit in Bitcoin. Tether’s CTO Paolo Ardoino, a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, stated that the cryptocurrency’s resilience is the reason for the company’s continuous investment in the asset.  Ardoino said:  The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset. Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.

					<description><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market is currently growing in a variety of ways, but the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem&#8217;s tokens are currently noticeably on a positive run. Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), one of the leading tokens in the meme coin ecosystem, is on a clear uptrend, rising as much as 5.6% in the previous day to $1.74. The coin has increased by more than 25% over the last week as a result of the ecosystem&#8217;s overall buzz. The price of Bone Shibaswap has made a significant recovery in recent months. After soaring to a high of $1.7410, the highest point since March, it exceeded several of the initially pessimistic expectations. BONE price all in green in the weekend chart. TradingView.com BONE Showing Solid Performance While the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum has stabilized, the BONE cryptocurrency has increased by more than 130% since its June lows. The anticipation stems from the belief that the upcoming August mainnet release of Shibarium will mark the beginning of a transformative era. Ever since the launch timeline was disclosed earlier, members of the community have been attributing special significance to this event, particularly emphasizing the role of BONE. BONEUSD trading at $1.74 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com This enthusiasm is fueled by the potential impact of Shibarium&#8217;s launch on the overall landscape and the specific importance of BONE within this context.

					<description><![CDATA[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been flooded with many applications for Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in just one week. The applications currently stand at 12, with the latest addition coming from ProShares, a popular fund manager.  The platform filed four applications for Ether-based ETFs, including a dual Ether and Bitcoin futures strategy ETF, an Ether Strategy ETF, and a short Ether Strategy ETF.  Will The SEC Approve An Ethereum Futures ETF? The recent surge in applications started on the 28th of July this year after Volatility Shares filed its application. Ever since, other asset management companies, including ProShares, Roundhill Financial,  Bitwise, Van Eck, and Grayscale Investment, have filled submissions, with some bringing multiple applications.  Related Reading: These Are The Factors That Could Lead To Another Bitcoin Rally: ARK Invest The most recent application, filed on August 3 by ProShares, proposes an equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether ETF to measure the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly Ether and Bitcoin contracts.  According to renowned Financial Expert at Bloomberg Intelligence, James Seyffart, ProShare filed four separate applications with the SEC. Bitwise also submitted three applications, while Grayscale Investments filed two applications.  However, despite the growing optimism, it remains to be seen if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve these filings. The SEC has never approved an ETF that tracks Ether Futures contracts, unlike Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been around since October 2021. Many market experts have argued that these applications are a mere gamble by these asset management companies, who do not want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the United States.  ETH price holds steady above $1,830 amid ETF race &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com The likelihood of receiving the SEC’s approval remains slim as the regulatory body has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing. Add to the mix the consistent refusal of SEC’s Chair, Gary Gensler, consistent refusal to answer if the agency considers ETH a security. This has further compounded regulatory uncertainty around the network. If none of the applications before the SEC get denied, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from their respective filing dates. Analysts expect the Volatility Shares ETF to lead the charge on 12th October.  Understanding The Difference Between Futures And Spot ETF Products The primary difference between futures and spot ETF products lies in the fact that while the former tracks the price of futures contracts, the latter requires the issuers to purchase the underlying assets. Spot ETFs are generally considered more valid since they require the fund manager to purchase and hold underlying assets.  Related Reading: Bank Of Canada Study Shows Crypto Ownership In The Country Fell In The Last 2 Years The current spike in Ether-based applications comes amidst a wave of filings from leading asset management companies, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, among others.

Whatever decision the agency takes is likely to affect the attractiveness and accessibility of crypto investments, especially for larger institutional investors.  Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>
