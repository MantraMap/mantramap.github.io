The App Store prefers that customers buy things inside of apps.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Apple Protecting Profits...</h3><p>This is purely profit motivated.<br /><br />Currently, if an app has premium features, users unlock them for a fee, processed by Apple. The app developer gets their cut, and so does Apple.&nbsp;</p><p>But if someone can unlock app features by purchasing an NFT from anywhere online, then an app includes a way for someone to verify ownership of that NFT -&nbsp; Apple was just removed from the process.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Making Enemies in the NFT World...</h3><p>This comes after another recent move by Apple that angered the NFT world, when they announced they will allow NFT sales, but they will include a 30% going to them.</p><p>While it's hard to pity the projects that mass produce low quality gimmick NFTs, the actual artists who put a lot of time and work in to creating unique excuse content to be sold as NFTs, a 30% cut going to a company that just processed a transaction is rather offensive.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">---------------<br /><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Oliver Redding<br /></i><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span><span style="color: #cc0000;">Seattle Newsdesk&nbsp;</span></span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/" style="backface-visibility: hidden; box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; display: inline; margin: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; touch-action: manipulation;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></span></span></i><br /><br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
