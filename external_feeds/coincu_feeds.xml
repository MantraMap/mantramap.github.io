<ul>
<li><em>Bitfinex recovers $315,000 in cash and crypto from the 2016 hack with the help of US authorities.</em></li>



<li><em>The assets, including 6.917 Bitcoin Cash, were seized from individuals accused of laundering the stolen funds.</em></li>



<li><em>The recovered funds will be distributed to holders of Bitfinex&#8217;s Recovery Right Tokens (RRT) in a pro-rata manner.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto exchange Bitfinex <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1676967823065878532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it collaborated with authorities to recover around $315,000 in cash and cryptocurrencies stolen in a 2016 hack on its website.</strong></h5>

<p>The assets came from the US Department of Homeland Security, which was essential in capturing the stolen digital assets and prosecuting the perpetrators, Bitfinex stated in a statement on Thursday. Around 120,000 Bitcoins, worth approximately $72 million at the time, were taken. The haul is worth around $3.7 billion at the current market price.</p>



<p>The digital asset trading platform Bitfinex reported the restitution of $312,219.71 in cash and 6.917 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) from the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of continuing efforts to recover assets taken during the 2016 security incident. The recovery value at today&#8217;s Bitcoin Cash pricing is $314,196.</p>

<p>Heather &#8220;Razzlekhan&#8221; Morgan and Ilya &#8220;Dutch&#8221; Lichtenstein, a couple detained last year for allegedly laundering billions of dollars in Bitcoin from the robbery, are among individuals previously accused of keeping cash from the attack. The seizure was carried out by US Customs and Border Protection, a law enforcement department inside the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Bitfinex&#8217;s Chief Technical Officer, Paolo Ardoino, acknowledged the company&#8217;s happiness with this recovery milestone and thanked for law enforcement authorities&#8217; efforts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This specific seizure demonstrates the commitment of law enforcement officials to diligently track all the proceeds of the crime committed against Bitfinex almost seven years ago,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The fund will be given to holders of Bitfinex&#8217;s Recovery Right Tokens, which are digital tokens given to individuals who lost money in the breach. Since there are around 30 million RRTs in circulation, each investment will most likely get just a tiny portion of the recovery. RRT holders will have their tokens redeemed pro rata today, July 6, 2023, at 12:00.01 AM UTC, depending on the amount of their RRT holdings. Bitfinex is continuing to work actively with law enforcement and legal institutions to retrieve the stolen assets.</p>

<p>The proposal, unveiled on July 6, aims to enable users to actively participate in protocol governance while ensuring adequate liquidity for decentralized exchanges. By implementing the 8020 Initiative, Balancer offers a unique solution to the liquidity issue faced by DeFi platforms. The structure allows token holders to engage in governance activities while simultaneously providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges. This approach ensures that the locked governance tokens do not hinder the availability of liquidity within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Several prominent protocols have already joined the 8020 Initiative, including Radiant, Aave, Alchemix, Y2K Finance, OATH Finance, Paraswap, and Timeless Finance. The collaboration of these projects further strengthens the ecosystem by pooling resources and expertise to enhance liquidity provisions across DeFi platforms.</p>

The ongoing collaboration and continuous development of innovative solutions like the 8020 Initiative reinforce the growth and resilience of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>Balancer&#8217;s release of the 8020 Initiative signifies its commitment to addressing liquidity constraints in the DeFi space, fostering greater accessibility and usability for users, and further advancing the broader adoption of decentralized finance.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeSo, the social blockchain platform, is offering an enticing opportunity for developers by providing bounties of up to $1 million.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1.jpeg" alt="DeSo&#039;s $1 Million Bounty Program Empowers Developers To Revolutionize Social Blockchain" class="wp-image-200739" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1-300x180.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1-768x461.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1-750x450.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DeSo&#039;s $1 Million Bounty Program Empowers Developers To Revolutionize Social Blockchain 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The rewards are aimed at those who can create alternatives to the Reddit chain on DeSo&#8217;s platform. This initiative comes as a response to Reddit&#8217;s recent decision to restrict API access, leading to discontent within the community due to limited access to content.</p>



<p>DeSo believes that building a decentralized version of Reddit on its blockchain will grant users complete control over their content, free from censorship or the risk of being banned at the protocol level. By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology, the firm aims to empower users with greater freedom and ownership over their social media experiences.</p>



<p>The announcement of the bounty program comes on the heels of the platform successful financing round in 2021, which secured a substantial $200 million in funding. Prominent investors, including a16z and Sequoia Capital, participated in the financing, highlighting the growing interest and support for DeSo&#8217;s innovative blockchain-based social platform.</p>

The bounties serve as incentives for developers to harness their skills and creativity, as well as to fuel the growth and development of the DeSo ecosystem.</p>



<p>By encouraging developers to build on its platform, DeSo aims to foster innovation and expand the possibilities of social blockchain technology.

<p>As DeSo continues to gain traction and support from investors, it remains at the forefront of the social blockchain revolution, offering an alternative path to social media that prioritizes user control and content ownership.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Crypto attacks rose by 65.3% in Q2 2023, while the total damage decreased by 60.4%.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum were the main targets of the attacks, with hacking being the most common method.</em></li>



<li><em>The North Korean hacker group Lazarus was responsible for almost half of the illegal attacks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the second quarter of 2023, the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors witnessed a significant increase in the number of attacks, according to a <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/zgX5ZJPLIiJgPDngenEsQ/209d1fb848f9bcbe5d41a0da3b4eeff1/Immunefi_Crypto_Losses_in_Q2_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by Immunefi. Despite a rise in the number of incidents, the scale of damage caused by these crypto attacks decreased compared to the same period last year.</strong></h5>

<p>Immunefi&#8217;s analysis revealed that the number of <a href="https://coincu.com/164099-crypto-attacks-cause-3-8-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto attacks</a>, including hacking incidents, rose by 65.3% from 49 to 81 cases in Q2 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. However, the total funds stolen during these attacks decreased by 60.4% in Q2 2023, indicating improved security measures within the industry.</p>



<p>The report estimated that nearly half of the illegal attacks, approximately 49.7%, were attributed to the notorious North Korean hacker group known as Lazarus. Hacking attacks accounted for 83.1% of the damages caused in Q2, with fraud, scams, and rug pulls accounting for the remaining portion.</p>



<p>In terms of targets, the Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Ethereum were the primary targets for these attacks. The BNB chain accounted for 44.4% of the total damages, while Ethereum accounted for 32.1%.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433.png" alt="Crypto Attacks Surged In Q2, But The Scale Of Damage Decreased: Report" class="wp-image-200738" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Crypto Attacks Surged In Q2, But The Scale Of Damage Decreased: Report 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>Despite the decrease in stolen funds, the overall damage to the cryptocurrency industry in Q2 2023 amounted to approximately $265.5 million. It is worth noting that only a small portion, $10.5 million, was recovered, representing just 3.9% of the total damages.</p>



<p>Additionally, the report highlighted a concerning trend regarding targeted attacks on blockchain networks. Arbitrum, which had no incidents in Q2 2022, experienced a significant rise in attacks, with 10 major incidents in Q2 2023. This places Arbitrum as the third most targeted blockchain for two consecutive quarters, with a total of 18 incidents recorded year-to-date. Other notable blockchain platforms, such as Polygon and zkSync, also experienced multiple incidents during the quarter.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, believes that BlackRock does not have an advantage over ARK Invest in the application of a Bitcoin spot ETF.</em></li>



<li><em>Wood suggests that if the US SEC loses the &#8220;Grayscale v. SEC&#8221; case, the chances of approving a Bitcoin spot ETF would increase.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood spoke to Fortune magazine about a Bitcoin spot ETF filing and SEC approval.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg" alt="Cathie Wood Bullish: US SEC Ruling Impact on Bitcoin Spot ETF" class="wp-image-200725" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Cathie Wood Bullish: US SEC Ruling Impact on Bitcoin Spot ETF 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In an interview with Fortune magazine, Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, expressed her perspective on the application of a Bitcoin spot ETF and its potential approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wood believes that BlackRock does not hold an advantage over ARK Invest in this regard, stating that any necessary revisions to their application profile can be made swiftly.</p>



<p>Wood highlighted that while BlackRock&#8217;s application includes a supervisory sharing clause, ARK Invest can easily adjust their application to align with industry standards. Wood emphasized that multiple institutions are moving towards this direction and have submitted their respective applications. The SEC is expected to review ARK Invest&#8217;s application by mid-January next year, while BlackRock&#8217;s review is anticipated before March next year.</p>

<p>Cathie Wood pointed out that the SEC has already approved some Bitcoin futures ETFs and recently granted approval for a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF. However, she believes that spot ETFs, such as the grayscale version, offer greater security as they are fully backed by bitcoins stored in cold wallets, in contrast to futures that involve swaps. Wood finds the SEC&#8217;s approval situation contradictory, with futures ETFs being approved while spot ETFs are rejected.</p>



<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coincu.com/193117-cathie-wood-binances-troubles-help-coinbase/">Wood</a> stated that if the SEC were to lose the ongoing &#8220;Grayscale v. SEC&#8221; case, the likelihood of approving a Bitcoin spot ETF would increase. This case outcome could potentially shape the SEC&#8217;s stance on spot ETFs and pave the way for their approval.</p>



<p>As the regulatory landscape evolves, investors and industry players eagerly await the SEC&#8217;s decisions on Bitcoin spot ETFs, which could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market and investment opportunities.</p>

<p>In a recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York test, some of the world&#8217;s largest banks, including Citigroup and Wells Fargo, participated in a 12-week trial using a regulated liability network technology. This technology allows banks to simulate issuing digital money representing their customers&#8217; funds before settling through central bank reserves on a distributed ledger. The test proved that digital dollars can improve wholesale payments without altering the legal treatment of the deposits.</p>



<p>Unlike public blockchains commonly seen in cryptocurrencies, the test was conducted on a private blockchain that requires permission to participate. The project concluded that there were no significant legal impediments under existing US laws that would prevent the establishment of a digital dollar. However, further engagement with regulators would be required before reaching a final conclusion.</p>



<p>A central bank digital currency is not yet a reality in the US, but bank deposit tokens issued on a blockchain could be more widely used than stablecoins. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has said they see promise in deposit tokens. Meanwhile, some officials at the Federal Reserve have expressed doubt over the need for a central bank digital currency.</p>



<p>The New York Innovation Center emphasized that the proof-of-concept was not intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a central bank digital currency or any other product or service. The project aimed to explore the potential functional benefits of central bank and commercial bank digital money operating together on a shared ledger.</p>



<p>The pilot found that the technology could help synchronize dollar-denominated payments and facilitate settlement in near-real time. This could greatly benefit cross-border settlements, which are often lengthy and cumbersome due to the many different systems banks and governments use worldwide.</p>

<p>Circle&#8217;s wallet-as-a-service developer platform is designed to facilitate instant access, allowing developers to sign up with an email address and start building immediately. The platform adopts a pay-as-you-go pricing model, starting at affordable rates and decreasing as volume increases. While users currently self-custody their private keys, Circle plans to introduce updates that will grant developers control over user private keys in the future.</p>

<p>After the introduction of Japan&#8217;s amended Payment Services Act, Circle&#8217;s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, has <a href="https://coincu.com/200440-circle-issuing-stablecoin-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown</a> interest in releasing the company&#8217;s USDC stablecoin in the country.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>HIVE Blockchain Technologies announces a strategic rebranding and name change to HIVE Digital Technologies to reflect its expansion into AI-focused HPC data centers.</em></li>



<li><em>The company aims to leverage its green energy data centers and GPU Cloud computing technology for AI, machine learning, and advanced data analysis.</em></li>



<li><em>The name change will not affect trading symbols or share structure, and the company&#8217;s shares will continue to trade on the TSX Venture Exchange and Nasdaq.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HIVE Blockchain Technologies, a global leader in blockchain technology, has <a href="https://hiveblockchain.com/news/hive-blockchain-announces-rebranding-and-name-change-to-hive-digital-technologies-ltd-to-reflect-our-hpc-strategy-and-updates-gpu-bitcoin-equivalent-for-fiscal-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its plans for a strategic rebranding and name change to HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.</strong></h5>

<p>This move comes as the company aims to expand its operations in HPC data centers and utilize Nvidia&#8217;s high-performance GPU chips for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.</p>



<p>The rebranding reflects HIVE&#8217;s commitment to harnessing the potential of its green energy data centers and GPU Cloud computing technology in the growing AI, machine learning, and advanced data analysis sectors. HIVE has been a prominent player in the cryptocurrency mining industry since 2017.</p>



<p>The name change, which is set to take effect on or around July 12, 2023, will not impact the company&#8217;s trading symbols or share structure. HIVE&#8217;s shares will continue to trade on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) and Nasdaq under the existing symbols.</p>

<p>In addition to the rebranding announcement, the company made a correction to its previous news release, stating that the number of Bitcoin equivalents mined during the year was understated by 792. The corrected figure stands at 4,295 Bitcoin equivalent, including digital assets mined from GPUs.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the company granted 620,000 incentive stock options to employees, officers, and consultants. These stock options, exercisable at C$6.86 per share, are subject to certain vesting requirements.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/186954-hive-blockchain-quadruple-computing-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HIVE Blockchain Technologies</a>, known for its sustainable green energy focus, operates state-of-the-art data centers in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland. The company&#8217;s shares provide investors with exposure to digital currency mining operating margins and a portfolio of Bitcoin assets. With its rebranding and continued focus on innovation, HIVE aims to bridge the gap between the blockchain industry and traditional capital markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Namibia&#8217;s National Assembly approves measures to regulate digital assets and service providers.</em></li>



<li><em>The legislation focuses on licensing, consumer protection, and risk mitigation.</em></li>



<li><em>The Bank of Namibia maintains cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in the country.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Namibia&#8217;s National Assembly has <a href="https://www.parliament.na/b12-2023-virtual-assets-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopted</a> a bill to regulate domestic digital assets, cryptocurrencies, and digital asset service providers.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="716" height="425" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png" alt="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset" class="wp-image-200694" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png 716w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" title="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>The legislation&#8217;s goal is to provide a framework for licensing and regulating virtual asset service providers (VASPs). It also intends to appoint a regulator to regulate these providers and their actions. Important goals include consumer protection, limiting market misuse, and lowering the danger of money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation in the virtual asset market. Before it can be implemented, the measure must first be officially published.</p>



<p>Importantly, the Bank of Namibia (BON) maintains that cryptocurrencies are not legal cash in the nation.</p>



<p>The measure is now awaiting formal publication before going into effect. Namibia&#8217;s Minister of Finance and Public Enterprises, Iipumbu Shiimi, indicated in his report the formation of a regulatory agency to regulate and give licenses to VASPs in the nation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419.png" alt="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset" class="wp-image-200695" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Namibia’s first Bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Noncompliant providers might face fines of up to ten million Namibian dollars and a ten-year jail sentence.</p>



<p>Kazembire Zemburuka, the BON&#8217;s director of strategic communications and international relations, stated the bank&#8217;s position in the report, indicating that once the associated risks of innovations like virtual assets are better managed, the bank will assess and decide whether to accept them into the financial system.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="728" height="479" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png" alt="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset" class="wp-image-200696" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png 728w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" title="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>The execution of a bill to legitimize digital assets by the parliament seems to contradict the BON&#8217;s declaration at the end of 2022. BON, in particular, feels that cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal money in this nation. On the other hand, the bank has said that it would not prohibit companies and merchants from taking cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Although the bill&#8217;s approval by the Namibian parliament was lauded as a move in the right direction, other experts emphasized that its implementation should not create needless barriers to innovation.</p>

<p>Bakkt, the digital asset platform, has revealed plans to expand its operations to Hong Kong, the United Kingdom (UK), and the European Union (EU) in an effort to capitalize on regions with more regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. According to Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael, the lack of a clear regulatory framework in the United States has prompted the company to focus on international expansion.</p>



<p>The decision to target Hong Kong, UK, and EU stems from the fact that these regions have made significant progress in establishing cryptocurrency regulations, surpassing the regulatory developments in the US. Michael highlighted the UK&#8217;s commitment to clear crypto regulations, Hong Kong&#8217;s allowance of trading in select cryptocurrencies, and the EU&#8217;s passage of the MiCA framework for crypto regulation.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/187027-bakkt-delists-25-tokens-including-aave-link/">Bakkt</a> is keen on leveraging Bitcoin&#8217;s Layer 2 Lightning Network for custody and settlement services, particularly in the realm of cross-border payments. Exploring the potential of this technology opens up opportunities for Bakkt to offer efficient and secure financial services.</p>



<p>The company believes that there is more traction and momentum in the crypto markets outside the US, attributing it to the faster pace of regulatory clarity in these regions. As a result, Bakkt aims to tap into these markets to drive the growth of its platform and better serve its international customer base.</p>



<p>By expanding its operations to Hong Kong, UK, and EU, the company hopes to navigate the regulatory landscape more effectively and capitalize on the growing demand for digital asset services in these regions. With a focus on jurisdictions that offer clearer guidelines, Bakkt aims to position itself as a leader in the global digital asset market.</p>
