<h2>2. Rally Continues</h2>
<p>The first important resistance of this rally is found at $0.00000106. If the momentum continues to pick-up, then SHIB can target $0.0000012 next. Considering the current price action, this memecoin has a good chance to reach these levels.</p>

<h2>3. Momentum Picking-Up</h2>
<p>The MACD shows that the bullish momentum took no break this week, on the contrary, it intensified. This is shown by the histogram that has been making consistent higher highs since late July.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SHIB is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SHIB Price</h2>
<p>Keep your eyes on the resistance at $0.00000106 as sellers could appear there. If they don&#8217;t manage to push back the price in a significant way, then expect buyers to aim for $0.0000012.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The next major Bitcoin market cycle peak will come much earlier than previous ones have according to one prominent crypto analyst.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an increasing narrative among crypto market analysts that the next bull market and cycle peak could come as soon as Bitcoin halving.</p>
<p>This follows months of consolidation where BTC has failed several times to break above $30K, and volumes and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-derivatives-volumes-drop-to-new-lows-amid-volatility-crush/" data-wpel-link="internal">volatility</a> have fallen to record lows.</p>
<p>On Aug. 10, market analyst “CrediBULL Crypto” told his 344,000 X followers that the next BTC halving in April/May 2024 “will likely mark our bull cycle TOP rather than the ‘start’ like many are expecting.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Why the next <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$BTC</a> halving in April/May 2024 will likely mark our bull cycle TOP rather than the &#8220;start&#8221; like many are expecting and why we will likely be in the depths of a MAJOR bear market by 2025:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve previously explained that the amount of time we are spending… <a href="https://t.co/lQrGSo4rRs" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/lQrGSo4rRs</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Bull Market Shift?</h2>
<p>The analyst noted that the amount of time markets have been consolidating will be the longest in history. Markets have been range bound for five months now and haven’t really seen any large swings since their climb in mid-March.</p>
<p>The consolidation phases before the bull markets have always been much longer than the parabolic advance, he noted.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Once we break out of this consolidation I expect that our parabolic phase will begin- and, based on the data below, would expect the parabolic phase to end somewhere around May 2024.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If this scenario plays out, 2025 will be the beginning of a multi-year bear market, he noted.</p>
<p>However, there were a large number of respondents to the tweet that saw a new all-time high in just eight months’ time as an impossibility.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the sentiment has been echoed by others, such as cryptographer Adam Back who <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/adam-back-bets-1-million-satoshi-for-btcs-price-to-reach-100k-before-2024-bitcoin-halving/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> prices would reach $100,000 at or after the halving. He said that miners would need prices to be much higher to remain profitable as the block reward is cut in half.</p>
<p>Fellow Bitcoiner Samson Mow also predicted a new all-time high for Bitcoin “pre-halving, not post.”</p>
<h2>BTC Price Outlook</h2>
<p>For now, the consolidation continues, and markets remain in their state of torpor. A very brief kiss of $30K this week has already started to break down, with BTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-retreats-from-30k-as-xrp-slumps-toward-0-6-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">falling back</a> towards $29K again.</p>
<p>Markets have been gradually down trending since June 21, with $29K serving as solid support and anything over $30K as solid resistance.</p>
<p>Total capitalization remains at $1.21 trillion, a level that markets have oscillated around for the past five months, so maybe a big move upward would not be that outlandish.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jinwook Shin, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitsonic, has been apprehended by South Korean law enforcement on August 7th. He is currently being investigated for allegedly embezzling investments and deposits from users of the exchange.</p>
<p>According to the report by South Korean news agency Chosun Biz, Shin is being accused of fraudulently manipulating cryptocurrency prices and trading volume on Bitsonic, which led to the misappropriation of approximately 10 billion won ($7.5 million) from exchange users from January 2019 to May 2021.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prosecution stated that Shin <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/topics/topics_social/2023/08/08/W2KPDGP5SZCRRPMOS36DMLS6JM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">operated</a> Bitsonic but did not purchase cryptocurrency during the same period.</li>
<li>But the CEO persisted in providing cryptocurrencies to new customers despite the onset of liquidity problems and the suspension of withdrawals on the crypto platform, Seoul&#8217;s cyber crime department alleged.</li>
<li>BitSonic announced shutting down its operations in August 2021 and attributed the decision to &#8220;internal and external issues.&#8221;</li>
<li>Shortly thereafter, the South Korean authorities closed down 11 domestic cryptocurrency platforms for alleged fraudulent activities.</li>
<li>The ensuing inquiry also claimed the involvement of the company&#8217;s vice president in orchestrating a scheme to acquire the crypto held by the CEO within the exchange system.</li>
<li>In the process of manipulation, Shin purportedly utilized a shell company established in Singapore.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the vice president of Bitsonic is also slated to face trial without being subject to preliminary detention.</li>
<li>Off late, South Korean authoritoes have taken a hardline approach against fraudulent activities within the digital asset industry.</li>
<li>Last month, Korea Securities Depository <a href="https://www.fnnews.com/news/202307261412399732" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">unveiled</a> a partnership with Code, a firm specializing in Travel Rules, to promote the issuance and utilization of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) within the virtual asset market.</li>
<li>This initiative seeks to tackle the surge in unlawful activities within the market while also fulfilling the demand for enhanced investor safeguard.</li>
<li>Besides, the Korean government was reportedly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-korea-to-build-a-crypto-tracking-system-to-prevent-cybercrime-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">building</a> a crypto-tracking system to prevent cybercrime.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by Banco Central do Brasil is reportedly set to see the light of day in 2024. Its main purpose will be to boost financial services in the country.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The South American nation is not the only one willing to introduce such a monetary product. China, Russia, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and many more have also displayed such intentions. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-central-bank-names-its-digital-currency-drex-scheduled-2024-launch-2023-08-07/?rpc=401&amp;" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by Reuters, Brazil&#8217;s CBDC will be named DREX and is expected to go live next year. It will employ distributed ledger technology (DLT) to settle wholesale interbank transactions, whereas retail access will be based on the digital equivalent of existing bank deposits. </span></li>
<li>Fabio Araujo &#8211; coordinator of the digital real &#8211; said DREX will aim at advancing the domestic financial network by improving access to monetary services. He raised hopes that it could also boost investments, lending, and insurance services.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;By enabling simple and reliable access to registered values through DLT technology, we reduce costs and democratize access to financial services,&#8221; he stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Araujo argued that some Brazilians have already started conducting digital settlements via the payment platform Pix. </span></li>
<li>It is interesting to note that well-known finance companies have supported Brazil&#8217;s CBDC project. Some examples are the payment processing giant Mastercard and the leading developer of software services Sinqia.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The highly-anticipated layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium, is set to launch soon, leading many to anticipate that it could catalyze a Shiba Inu ($SHIB) price rally.</p>
<p>By enhancing transaction speeds and cutting costs, Shibarium promises to increase $SHIB&#8217;s utility and reignite excitement post-launch.</p>
<p>Other meme coins, such as Wall Street Memes ($WSM) and Shibie Coin ($SHIBIE), might also capitalize on the rising investor interest due to Shibarium’s launch and its potential impact on the wider market.</p>
<h2>1. Improved Utility for $SHIB</h2>
<p>The first reason that Shiba Inu could turn bullish after Shibarium’s release is the vastly improved utility it will provide the token.</p>
<p>By implementing layer-2 technology to boost transaction speeds and cut network fees, Shibarium will make $SHIB a far more practical option for those looking to make transactions and payments.</p>
<p>With the ability to send $SHIB faster and cheaper, real-world adoption and usage of the token could increase significantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265704" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="353" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This expanded utility will likely boost demand as more individuals and businesses seek to acquire $SHIB to leverage its new capabilities.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/shib/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from Cryptwerk.com</a>, only 767 merchants worldwide accept $SHIB – a figure that could rise post-Shibarium.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any demand increase would translate into more positive price movements, which would be further bolstered since $SHIB also has a built-in burn mechanism.</p>
<h2>2. Renewed Hype Around the Shiba Inu Ecosystem</h2>
<p>In addition to enhanced utility, the launch of Shibarium will likely boost the hype and investor interest around the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>
<p>The community has been waiting for Shibarium’s release for a while, meaning its launch is primed to generate tremendous excitement.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies often thrive on momentum, which is even more pronounced for meme coins like $SHIB – meaning the post-Shibarium phase could drive new token investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265703" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="179" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13-300x89.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, $SHIB holders will be encouraged that the Shiba Inu team delivered on their promises, potentially convincing a percentage of the investor base to purchase more tokens.</p>
<p>This could create a snowball effect, where the price rises and FOMO ensues, leading more people to buy $SHIB.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a successful Shibarium rollout will kickstart the project&#8217;s momentum again, igniting the bullish sentiment around $SHIB from an investment perspective.</p>
<h2>3. Increased Likelihood of New $SHIB Use Cases</h2>
<p>The third factor likely to turn $SHIB bullish after Shibarium is the expanded adoption it could fuel by enabling new use cases.</p>
<p>By improving transaction efficiency, Shibarium opens the door to creating uses for $SHIB that weren’t previously viable.</p>
<p>This includes use cases related to NFTs, metaverse integrations, blockchain gaming applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265702" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="496" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16-300x247.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16-50x41.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>With a more scalable platform, decentralized application (dApp) developers are more likely to build their platforms on Shibarium, which will drive further adoption of $SHIB.</p>
<p>As of now, <a href="https://shibaswap.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShibaSwap</a> is the only noteworthy platform on the Shiba Inu network, serving as the ecosystem&#8217;s native DEX</p>
<p>But with Shibarium lowering network fees and enabling faster transactions, the path is clear for many more dApps to be deployed.</p>
<p>This influx of new products and services could attract fresh users to the ecosystem, spurring demand for $SHIB.</p>
<h2>Which Other Meme Coins Could Benefit from Shibarium’s Release?</h2>
<p>While Shiba Inu stands to gain the most from Shibarium’s release, other meme coins could also capitalize on renewed investor interest.</p>
<p>Two meme coin projects worth watching that could ride the Shibarium hype are Wall Street Memes and Shibie Coin.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Presale Nears $23 Million Raised Ahead of Shibarium Launch</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=will-shiba-inus-price-pump-after-shibarium-wall-street-memes-also-bullish" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is an emerging meme coin that has raised nearly $23 million during its presale phase.</p>
<p>This impressive traction is thanks to the community interest around the $WSM token, which is available for $0.0331.</p>
<p>The creators of Wall Street Memes have leveraged their previous experience developing the popular <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall St Bulls NFT collection</a>, which sold out rapidly back in 2021.</p>
<p>Now the creators aim to bring the same community-building expertise to the meme coin space with the release of $WSM.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265701" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="197" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10-300x98.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10-50x16.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>A full 50% of the total $WSM supply is being allocated to presale participants, highlighting the community-focused approach of Wall Street Memes’ creators.</p>
<p>The other half will be split between exchange liquidity, marketing, and rewards.</p>
<p>Demand for $WSM shows no signs of slowing, with the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">project’s Telegram channel</a> seeing hundreds of new members join daily.</p>
<p>$WSM demand has also been boosted by Wall Street Memes’ ambitious roadmap, which showcases plans for Tier-1 CEX listings and even a $1 billion market cap.</p>
<p>All in all, Wall Street Memes&#8217; potential is clear – setting it up to benefit from the meme coin buzz that will likely surround Shibarium’s launch.</p>

<h2>Shibie Coin Also Looks to Ride Post-Shibarium Hype</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_6e47ad52.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=will-shiba-inus-price-pump-after-shibarium-wall-street-memes-also-bullish" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin ($SHIBIE)</a> is another brand-new meme coin that could benefit from the release of Shibarium’s mainnet.</p>
<p>This unique project brands itself as a Shiba Inu-Barbie crossover, aiming to capitalize on the hype surrounding the viral Barbie movie.</p>
<p>The token also leverages the popularity of “Doge-themed” meme coins, such as $DOGE and $SHIB.</p>
<p>Shibie Coin’s presale has been an instant hit with investors, raising over $265,000 in just two weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265700" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="156" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6-300x78.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6-50x13.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Alongside $SHIBIE’s provocative branding, demand has also been spurred by the token’s low price of $0.000167.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://shibie.io/whitepaper/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin’s whitepaper</a>, the project&#8217;s distribution structure has been designed with the community in mind, given that 60% of the total supply is reserved for presale investors.</p>
<p>This means over half of the $SHIBIE tokens will be in the hands of early adopters – establishing a broad token holder base essential for community engagement.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://twitter.com/ShibieCoin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin’s Twitter account</a> seeing significant growth, the project&#8217;s social media marketing push is bearing fruit, positioning it to benefit from Shibarium’s long-awaited release.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A group of customers of the once-prominent cryptocurrency exchange FTX has reportedly filed a lawsuit against the law firm Fenwick &amp; West, insisting that it contributed to the alleged scam orchestrated by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and the subsequent multi-billion losses it brought. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The former leader of the exchange has pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges against him.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The group of investors described Fenwick &amp; West as the main outside law firm for FTX, maintaining that its attorneys had insight into the exchange&#8217;s &#8220;convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, Fenwick &amp; West supposedly enabled the marketplace to secure certain regulatory licenses in the USA without applying directly with watchdogs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One interesting fact is that Daniel Friedberg (the former leading lawyer of crypto exchange FTX) has previously worked at the sued law firm.

As such, the trial against the former CEO Bankman-Fried is highly anticipated not only by fallen investors but also by broad society.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Multiple authorities and regulators have named SBF the main culprit behind the crash, insisting on a maximum prison sentence.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, he has not admitted any of the crimes and was allowed to live at his parents&#8217; house under a whopping $250 million bond. The mega trial against him is set for October 2, whereas some of his former associates might testify against him.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One example is his ex-girlfriend and former leader of Alameda Research &#8211; Caroline Ellison.

			            <description><![CDATA[The Gemini crypto exchange has announced that users can now deposit XRP tokens on the platform.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini confirmed it now accepts XRP deposits after days of speculation driven by a cryptic post on its verified X account. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post, a thinking face emoji, was made <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1682416629097873408?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">in response</a> to a question by crypto journalist David Gokhstein, who wondered whether Gemini would relist XRP.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its </span><a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-adds-support-for-xrp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Gemini clarified that it would initially only accept XRP deposits, but it is working on enabling XRP-related trading pairs in the coming days. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exchange also asked its users to update their mobile apps to allow the new feature to take effect.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini is the latest to <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1689634981738401793" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">relist XRP</a> after Ripple won a partial </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-secondary-sales-of-xrp-not-an-investment-contract-judge-rules-following-over-3-year-long-legal-battle/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">victory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a case brought against it by the SEC. In a July 14 ruling, presiding Judge Analisa Torres found that XRP may not be considered a security if sold on secondary markets. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the verdict, several crypto exchanges, including Kraken, Bitstamp, and Crypto.com, </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/these-crypto-exchanges-re-listed-xrp-following-ripples-victory-against-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> XRP.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a new twist, the SEC has signaled its intention to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/is-xrp-in-trouble-again-sec-signals-appeal-in-ripple-case/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Judge Torres’ decision after it filed a letter of appeal on August 9.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, Ripple has been made a </span><a href="https://t.co/yDQmdOmp9m" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">member</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) cross-border payments taskforce.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BIS serves as the hub for international monetary authorities. Many observers believe Ripple’s inclusion into the 33-member committee shows the company’s growing acceptance in the mainstream financial space since its win against the SEC. </span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase and Binance's wallets were prone to the vulnerability, but both have already been patched. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto infrastructure giant Fireblocks has publicly revealed security vulnerabilities in the technology used by over a dozen major digital asset wallet providers.</p>
<p>If unaddressed, the company warned that attackers could exploit the bugs to steal from millions of customers.</p>
<h2>The Bitforge Exploits</h2>
<p>The set of vulnerabilities – collectively referred to as “Bitforge” – apply to popular multi-party-computation (MPC) protocols, including GG-18 , GG-20, and Lindell17. These protocols allow cryptocurrency to be controlled and managed by multiple individuals and groups.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The BitForge vulnerabilities, if left unremedied, would enable attackers to exploit a newly discovered flaw in the GG18 and GG20 protocols by exfiltrating the full private key due to a missing zero-knowledge proof,” wrote Fireblocks in a <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/bitforge-fireblocks-researchers-uncover-vulnerabilities-in-over-15-major-wallet-providers" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a> on Wednesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company stated that all vendors using the protocols “should be considered vulnerable.”</p>
<p>The Lindell17 vulnerability, it wrote, was due to wallet providers deviating from the academic paper, “creating a backdoor for attackers to expose part of the private key when signing fails.” The exploits have already been validated on major open-source implementations.</p>
<h2>Coinbase and Binance Affected, But Funds Are Safe</h2>
<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fireblocks-researchers-uncover-vulnerabilities-impacting-dozens-of-major-wallet-providers-301897357.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">press release</a>, Fireblocks named popular providers including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-releases-encrypted-decentralized-messaging-functionality-in-wallets/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a> WaaS, Zengo, and Binance as having been impacted by the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>However, having been privately notified by the firm beforehand, Fireblocks said the prior three firms have already patched the issues, and the relevant academic papers have been appropriately revised.</p>
<blockquote><p>“While Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation,” said Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer at Coinbase, regarding the patch.</p></blockquote>
<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also clarified on Thursday that the exchange has patched the vulnerability and that no user funds had been affected.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1689556596332867584</p>
<p>In a statement, Fireblocks CTO Pavel Berengoltz wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While we are encouraged to see that MPC is now ubiquitous within the digital asset industry, it is evident from our findings — and our subsequent disclosure process — that not all MPC developers and teams are created equal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The CTO noted that over $500 million were stolen in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hackers-continue-laundering-funds-through-binance-kucoin-huobi/" data-wpel-link="internal">wallet thefts</a> and attacks over the first half of 2023.</p>
