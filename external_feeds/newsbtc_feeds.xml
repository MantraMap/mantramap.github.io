					<description><![CDATA[In the context of the constantly changing and complex cryptocurrency industry, Bitcoin is currently facing a critical point in its trajectory, as it confronts a range of heightened price pressures that pose significant challenges. The upcoming halving event in 2024 has generated significant anticipation, drawing attention to the complex interaction of various elements that contribute to the value and destiny of the subject in question. Bitcoin&#8217;s value has increased by 75% so far this year despite having to deal with regulatory scrutiny and fraud.

Bitcoin&#8217;s Price Performance Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $29,411, up a meager 0.2% in the last day, but managed to gain a decent 1.4% in the last week, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Bitcoin is currently showing a neutral stance in the market and facing resistance as it tries to surpass the key $29,600 mark.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has managed to shake off recent price dips, rekindling bullish optimism among investors. This resurgence comes on the heels of a determined effort by sellers to flip the altcoin&#8217;s trajectory bearish, following a price rejection at the critical $29 resistance level.  However, SOL&#8217;s retreat from this resistance proved to be a strategic move as it found support in the bullish order block (OB) at $22, setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. SOL&#8217;s journey from the formidable $29 price mark to the bullish order block at $22 was pivotal. A recent price analysis has underscored the importance of this OB as a key level for the altcoin&#8217;s potential reversal of fortunes.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Keeps Energy Alive, Snags 26% Gain – Here’s The Inside Scoop With a long-term perspective in mind, Solana&#8217;s ability to rally from this OB demonstrates the resolve of buyers to reclaim control. This recovery has not only bolstered sentiment but also signified the strategic importance of this price juncture in steering the trend. BTC&#8217;s Influence On SOL&#8217;s Trajectory One notable factor underpinning Solana&#8217;s current narrative is the role of Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency. As SOL seeks to flip the $25.3 resistance level into a supportive base for further gains, its success may very well depend on the continued bullish advance of Bitcoin. The interplay between these two prominent cryptocurrencies remains a significant aspect to monitor, as BTC&#8217;s trajectory often influences the broader altcoin market sentiment. At present, Solana stands at a price of $24.50, as per CoinGecko data. Despite a slight decline of 1.0% over the last 24 hours, the altcoin has showcased a commendable seven-day rally of 8.8%, indicative of its capacity to rebound from adversities.  Solana weekend price action. Source: Coingecko However, a notable challenge emerges as SOL inches closer to the $25.7 mark. The impending supply pressure at this level could potentially stall the upward momentum, prompting a sideways trend and leading to a consolidation phase. Solana: Clearing The Path Forward Should the SOL price encounter intensified supply pressure around the $25.7 threshold, a distinct possibility is the emergence of a narrow price range during trading sessions. This consolidation phase, while seemingly a temporary lull, may serve a vital purpose. By trimming away weaker positions, this period could pave the way for a definitive directional movement.

A recent <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/solana-offers-bullish-movement-but-buyers-remain-cautious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price analysis</a> has underscored the importance of this OB as a key level for the altcoin&#8217;s potential reversal of fortunes. </p>

<p>With a long-term perspective in mind, Solana&#8217;s ability to rally from this OB demonstrates the resolve of buyers to reclaim control. This recovery has not only bolstered sentiment but also signified the strategic importance of this price juncture in steering the trend.</p>
<h2><strong>BTC&#8217;s Influence On SOL&#8217;s Trajectory</strong></h2>
<p>One notable factor underpinning Solana&#8217;s current narrative is the role of Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency. As SOL seeks to flip the $25.3 resistance level into a supportive base for further gains, its success may very well depend on the continued bullish advance of Bitcoin. </p>
<p>The interplay between these two prominent cryptocurrencies remains a significant aspect to monitor, as BTC&#8217;s trajectory often influences the broader altcoin market sentiment.</p>
<p>At present, Solana stands at a price of $24.50, as per <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CoinGecko data</a>. Despite a slight decline of 1.0% over the last 24 hours, the altcoin has showcased a commendable seven-day rally of 8.8%, indicative of its capacity to rebound from adversities. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-546991" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-61.png?resize=966%2C62" alt="" width="966" height="62" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-61.png?resize=966%2C62?w=966 966w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-61.png?resize=966%2C62?w=460 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-61.png?resize=966%2C62?w=768 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-61.png?resize=966%2C62?w=860 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-61.png?resize=966%2C62?w=750 750w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></p>

<p>However, a notable challenge emerges as SOL inches closer to the $25.7 mark. The impending supply pressure at this level could potentially stall the upward momentum, prompting a sideways trend and leading to a consolidation phase.</p>
<strong>Solana: Clearing The Path Forward</strong>
<p>Should the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/solana-price-path-to-30-double-bottom-pattern-sparks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SOL price</a> encounter intensified supply pressure around the $25.7 threshold, a distinct possibility is the emergence of a narrow price range during trading sessions. </p>
<p>This consolidation phase, while seemingly a temporary lull, may serve a vital purpose. By trimming away weaker positions, this period could pave the way for a definitive directional movement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/4zC7yRye/" width="2475" height="1179"/></p>


<p>The shedding of less robust positions would ideally set the stage for a more sustainable bullish advance, as the altcoin continues its journey to reclaim lost ground.</p>
<p>As the altcoin navigates potential consolidation, investors are watching closely, anticipating the emergence of a clearer path forward in this dynamic crypto landscape.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[GMX, the native token powering GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange for trading complex crypto derivatives, is under intense selling pressure when writing on August 11. Trackers show that the governance token is down 7% on the last trading day, pushing monthly losses to 24%. This downturn has seen prices tumble close to $40, a critical support level last printed in January and June 2023.  Whales Dumping, Prices Fall Despite this setback, DeFiLlama&#8217;s data is stable as GMX&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) remains over $534 million. Most of the trading platform&#8217;s liquidity is locked in Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Additionally, another portion is locked on Avalanche, a fourth-generation Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform focused on decentralized finance (DeFi). The sell-off on August 11 coincides with actions by GMX &#8220;whales.&#8221; According to Lookonchain data, four whales sold 62,274 GMX worth $3 million. Address &#8220;0xb824&#8221; liquidated 19,786 GMX, translating to 514 ETH, and &#8220;0xa38a&#8221; sold 11,667 GMX for 305 ETH, losing $50,000 in the process. Meanwhile, &#8220;0X85b7&#8221; sold 20,000 GMX for 510 ETH, and &#8220;0x0b80&#8221; mirrored this move, dumping 10,820 GMX. Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon Whales are selling amid a constant decline in TVL in DeFi. This contraction can be traced to the general cool-off from late 2021, when crypto prices peaked before dropping in 2022, crashing on-chain activity, especially in DeFi. At spot rates, it is changing hands at $46, an almost 50% decline from $91 registered in Q2 of 2023. Even so, the token is up nearly 4X from its all-time low. Whales&#8217; action, nonetheless, could send ripples of uncertainty throughout the GMX and DeFi communities. Crypto traders actively keep track of whale activity. Usually, when they sell, as was the case today, it could sow fear, leading others to follow suit, heaping more pressure on prices. GMX Launches v2 Beta On August 6, GMX released the v2 version in beta on Arbitrum and Avalanche. The exchange said this version introduces several enhancements, including support for more assets, including XRP. With v2, users can also utilize diverse collateral types for trading positions while trading more quickly with reduced fees and lower slippage.  Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange With v2, the exchange adds, is the introduction of isolated pools for liquidity providers to customize their exposure to preferred tokens.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA), the blockchain platform renowned for its scalability and technological approach, has made significant strides in the crypto market, as highlighted by the recently released Messari report.  The report provides valuable insights into Cardano&#8217;s achievements in Q2 2023, solidifying its position as a prominent player within the industry.  With a strong focus on fostering a robust ecosystem and pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Cardano is poised to reshape the landscape of blockchain technology, according to Messari.  Cardano TVL Ranking Skyrockets, Climbs From 34th to 21st Per the report, Cardano experienced substantial growth in stablecoin value, with a 34.9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase and a significant 382.1% year-to-date (YTD) surge.  Indigo Protocol emerged as a frontrunner in stablecoin and synthetic asset issuance, solidifying its dominance in the space. Furthermore, the Total Value Locked (TVL) witnessed a shift towards newer projects, as protocols created in the past six months accounted for 47.4% of TVL dominance in Q2.  Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon The TVL in USD rose by 9.7% QoQ and 198.6% YTD. Cardano&#8217;s TVL ranking climbed from 34th to 21st across all chains in 2023. On the other hand, average daily decentralized application (dapp) transactions on Cardano surged by 49% QoQ, marking the third consecutive quarterly increase. Moreover, Minswap, an automated market maker (AMM), showcased the largest absolute growth in transaction volume.  However, several new dapps also contributed to the overall surge. Minswap&#8217;s popularity soared in Q2, surpassing the leading NFT marketplace jpg.store regarding dapp transactions.  This trend aligned with the sectoral shift, as DeFi activity gained momentum while NFT activity experienced a decline. The overall increase in dapp transactions reached a substantial 49.0% QoQ, averaging 57,900 daily transactions. Q2 NFT Metrics Reflect Market Correction According to Messari, NFT metrics experienced a decline in Q2. Average daily NFT transactions dropped by 35.7% QoQ to 2,900, while the total quarterly trading volume fell by 41.9% QoQ to $46.2 million.  This downward trend aligned with the broader market, as even blue-chip collection floor prices declined in 2023.  Notably, NFT sales volume remained concentrated primarily in jpg.store, which dominated the marketplace with a 98% market share.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano (ADA), the blockchain platform renowned for its scalability and technological approach, has made significant strides in the crypto market, as highlighted by the recently released Messari <a href="https://messari.io/report/cardano-ecosystem-analysis-q2-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a>. </p>
<p>The report provides valuable insights into Cardano&#8217;s achievements in Q2 2023, solidifying its position as a prominent player within the industry. </p>
<p>With a strong focus on fostering a robust ecosystem and pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Cardano is poised to reshape the landscape of blockchain technology, according to Messari. </p>
<h2>Cardano TVL Ranking Skyrockets, Climbs From 34th to 21st</h2>
<p>Per the report, Cardano experienced substantial growth in stablecoin value, with a 34.9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase and a significant 382.1% year-to-date (YTD) surge. </p>
<p>Indigo Protocol emerged as a frontrunner in stablecoin and synthetic asset issuance, solidifying its dominance in the space. Furthermore, the Total Value Locked (TVL) witnessed a shift towards newer projects, as protocols created in the past six months accounted for 47.4% of TVL dominance in Q2. </p>

<p>The TVL in USD rose by 9.7% QoQ and 198.6% YTD. Cardano&#8217;s TVL ranking climbed from 34th to 21st across all chains in 2023.</p>

<p>On the other hand, average daily decentralized application (dapp) transactions on Cardano surged by 49% QoQ, marking the third consecutive quarterly increase. Moreover, Minswap, an automated market maker (AMM), showcased the largest absolute growth in transaction volume. </p>
<p>However, several new dapps also contributed to the overall surge. Minswap&#8217;s popularity soared in Q2, surpassing the leading NFT marketplace jpg.store regarding dapp transactions. </p>
<p>This trend aligned with the sectoral shift, as DeFi activity gained momentum while NFT activity experienced a decline. The overall increase in dapp transactions reached a substantial 49.0% QoQ, averaging 57,900 daily transactions.</p>
<h2>Q2 NFT Metrics Reflect Market Correction</h2>
<p>According to Messari, NFT metrics experienced a decline in Q2. Average daily NFT transactions dropped by 35.7% QoQ to 2,900, while the total quarterly trading volume fell by 41.9% QoQ to $46.2 million. </p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-546947" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot_40.jpg?w=846&#038;resize=846%2C423" alt="Cardano " width="846" height="423" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot_40.jpg?w=846&#038;resize=846%2C423 846w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot_40.jpg?w=460 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot_40.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot_40.jpg?w=360 360w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot_40.jpg?w=750 750w" sizes="(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px" data-recalc-dims="1"/>
<p>This downward trend aligned with the broader market, as even blue-chip collection floor prices declined in 2023. </p>
<p>Notably, NFT sales volume remained concentrated primarily in jpg.store, which dominated the marketplace with a 98% market share. Nevertheless, unique buyers continued to drive NFT activity, while a relatively small number of sellers catered to this larger pool of buyers.</p>
<p>Messari further highlights that Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem showcased expansion in multiple sectors, particularly in DeFi. Protocols for swaps, stablecoins, synthetics, and unique Cardano-centric services like lending staking power surfaced alongside the incumbents. </p>

At that time, similar to today, BTC and the crypto market spend years in a “Crypto Winter” with declining prices. Once the sector rallied, many jumped in on the action swelling the trading volume to an all-time high. In that sense, Taleb seems to be hinting at a downside for the price of the cryptocurrency following a rise in price with low trading volume, which often leads to a decline.

					<description><![CDATA[Curve Finance (CRV), a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, announced significant progress in its recovery efforts following a recent hack that resulted in losing $73.5 million across several projects within its factory pools.  The attack on July 30 exploited a critical security flaw known as a &#8220;reentrancy vulnerability,&#8221; allowing malicious actors to drain funds from Curve&#8217;s smart contracts. Curve Finance Commits To Restitution Process For Hacked Funds In a significant effort, Curve Finance has successfully retrieved 70% of the funds affected by the hack. While this achievement marks an important milestone, an active investigation is underway to recover the remaining balance and hold the perpetrators accountable. Related Reading: Kraken Surges Ahead In Altcoin Liquidity To Overtake Coinbase In US: Kaiko Understanding the gravity of the situation, Curve Finance has also taken proactive measures to ensure a fair and transparent distribution of the recovered funds to affected users. The protocol is diligently working to measure the respective shares of each impacted account, aiming to facilitate an equitable restitution process that prioritizes user protection and trust restoration. Curve Finance&#8217;s recovery efforts are further bolstered by their recent announcement of a $1.85 million bounty. This generous reward will be granted to anyone who can provide accurate information leading to the identification and apprehension of the attackers holding the remaining funds.  By offering this substantial bounty, Curve Finance actively encourages community participation and collaboration to expedite the investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice. Curve’s Post-Hack Safety Report Following a thorough investigation, Curve Finance discovered that the exploit primarily targeted the aleth, peth, mseth, and crveth pools.  The vulnerability stemmed from a bug within the vyper 0.2.15-0.3.0 version, which the protocol promptly identified as the root cause of the breach. By swiftly pinpointing the issue, Curve Finance was able to take immediate action to mitigate any further risk to its users. Related Reading: Regulatory Pressure Mounts On Worldcoin, Can WLD Price Recover? It is important to note that all other pools on Curve Finance have been confirmed as safe and unaffected by the exploit, according to Curve&#8217;s update. This assurance gives users the confidence to continue utilizing the platform, knowing that their funds remain secure within these pools. Alongside the technical remediation, Curve Finance collaborates with security experts, auditors, and the broader DeFi community to conduct thorough audits and implement additional security measures.  This collaborative approach aims to reinforce the protocol&#8217;s resilience and prevent similar incidents in the future. Overall, Curve Finance&#8217;s recovery of 70% of the hacked funds, coupled with its ongoing investigation and bounty initiative, underlines the protocol&#8217;s commitment to user protection and the broader DeFi community.  According to Token Terminal data, Curve Finance&#8217;s circulating market cap currently stands at $518.76 million, reflecting a decrease of 22.29% over the analyzed period.  The fully diluted market cap, which represents the potential future market value of the project, is estimated at $1.97 billion. Curve Finance&#8217;s total value locked (TVL), a crucial indicator of the protocol&#8217;s popularity and user engagement, currently amounts to $2.44 billion. Despite a decline of 35.19% over the analyzed period, Curve Finance maintains a substantial TVL, highlighting its significance within the DeFi landscape.

					<description><![CDATA[Curve DAO (CRV) has continued to decline recently. Here&#8217;s what on-chain data says regarding if a rebound is probable for the coin anytime soon. What Curve DAO Metrics Hint At Regarding Futures Price Action In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has recently discussed how the underlying metrics related to CRV have looked. The first relevant metric here is the &#8220;Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us the percentage of the Curve DAO supply each investor group holds. In particular, the cohort of interest here holds between 10,000 and 100 million tokens of the asset. This is an extensive range covering the likes of the sharks and whales. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the holdings of this CRV group over the past year: Looks like the value of the metric has sharply gone up recently &#124; Source: Santiment As displayed in the above graph, the indicator&#8217;s value has shot up recently, implying that sizeable Curve DAO investors, such as the sharks and whales, have sharply expanded their reserves. About two weeks back, these holders had been carrying a combined 33% of the circulating supply, but today that value has risen to 41%. &#8220;This is a massive ascension and is now the most by far that these sharks and whales have held in well over a year,&#8221; notes Santiment. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Volume Remains Extremely High, More Gains Ahead? This accumulation from these key investors has come right after the big plunge that Curve DAO observed, suggesting that they find the current levels a worthy buying opportunity. Naturally, this is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. The next indicator of interest here is the &#8220;whale transaction count,&#8221; which keeps track of the total number of CRV transfers happening on the chain carrying a value of more than $100,000. The value of this metric seems to have been relatively low recently &#124; Source: Santiment When Curve Dao had observed its plunge earlier, the value of this indicator had registered a sharp spike. This means that the whales had been actively making moves back then. Since then, however, the metric&#8217;s value has returned to normal, suggesting that these humongous investors aren&#8217;t showing any extraordinary activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Surges, Recovery Being Driven By US Investors? As these investors had made many transfers earlier for selling purposes, the indicator calming down could imply that this cohort has stopped applying selling pressure. &#8220;With prices still significantly lower than two weeks ago, a follow-up whale transaction spike may be a foreshadow to a quick recovery,&#8221; explains the on-chain analytics firm.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Curve DAO (CRV) has continued to decline recently. Here&#8217;s what on-chain data says regarding if a rebound is probable for the coin anytime soon.</p>
<h2>What Curve DAO Metrics Hint At Regarding Futures Price Action</h2>
<p>In a new insight <a href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/is-curve-looking-for-a-price-swerve-7356?fpr=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has recently discussed how the underlying metrics related to CRV have looked. The first relevant metric here is the &#8220;Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us the percentage of the Curve DAO supply each investor group holds.</p>
<p>In particular, the cohort of interest here holds between 10,000 and 100 million tokens of the asset. This is an extensive range covering the likes of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sharks-and-whales-go-on-2-15-billion-buying-spree-is-it-time-to-sell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">sharks and whales</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a chart that shows the trend in the holdings of this CRV group over the past year:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/production-sanbase-images.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/da548853f10545ad6863701d2356687b522b02ae424972a6297dbad1a76ba1e0_1691703488450_Screenshot%202023-08-10%20142059.png?resize=3109%2C1660&#038;ssl=1" alt="Curve Sharks &amp; Whales" width="3109" height="1660"  data-recalc-dims="1"/></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the indicator&#8217;s value has shot up recently, implying that sizeable Curve DAO investors, such as the sharks and whales, have sharply expanded their reserves.</p>
<p>About two weeks back, these holders had been carrying a combined 33% of the circulating supply, but today that value has risen to 41%. &#8220;This is a massive ascension and is now the most by far that these sharks and whales have held in well over a year,&#8221; notes Santiment.</p>

<p>This accumulation from these key investors has come right after the big plunge that Curve DAO observed, suggesting that they find the current levels a worthy buying opportunity. Naturally, this is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>The next indicator of interest here is the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-breaks-95-as-whale-transactions-spike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">whale transaction count</a>,&#8221; which keeps track of the total number of CRV transfers happening on the chain carrying a value of more than $100,000.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/production-sanbase-images.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/d16669cd93362731bc9c78c82c1827479ac3655cf6fbf7efff396b0fb97e7524_1691703496964_Screenshot%202023-08-10%20141549.png?resize=3115%2C1665&#038;ssl=1" alt="Curve DAO Whale Transaction Count" width="3115" height="1665"  data-recalc-dims="1"/></p>

<p>When Curve Dao had observed its plunge earlier, the value of this indicator had registered a sharp spike. This means that the whales had been actively making moves back then.</p>
<p>Since then, however, the metric&#8217;s value has returned to normal, suggesting that these humongous investors aren&#8217;t showing any extraordinary activity.</p>

<p>As these investors had made many transfers earlier for selling purposes, the indicator calming down could imply that this cohort has stopped applying selling pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;With prices still significantly lower than two weeks ago, a follow-up whale transaction spike may be a foreshadow to a quick recovery,&#8221; explains the on-chain analytics firm.</p>
<p>CRV has been at relatively high levels recently in terms of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-development-activity-dropping-what-does-it-mean-for-ada-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">development activity</a> (that is, the amount of work that the Curve DAO developers have been putting into the public GitHub repository).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/production-sanbase-images.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/ad81d1bb19ddba69edd4613cbdbe398d762e226de02dc112d694c20f4194dcad_1691703505330_Screenshot%202023-08-10%20141651.png?resize=3108%2C1657&#038;ssl=1" alt="Curve DAO Development Activity" width="3108" height="1657"  data-recalc-dims="1"/></p>

<p>Generally, a high development activity implies that the coin is still being backed by its developers, which can be one of the signs to look out for to know if a project is still alive and kicking. Santiment said:</p>
<blockquote><p>By no means is 10-14 notable GitHub submissions per day breaking any records, but it is indicative of a team that is still looking to innovate, improve, and move past the recent FUD news that negatively impacted the crowd&#8217;s perceptions of it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>CRV Price</h2>
<p>Curve DAO is trading around $0.59 at the time of writing, down 3% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On August 10, the price of XRP inexplicably spiked for a brief moment on the Gemini exchange. For a moment, the price of XRP reached an astounding $50 per coin before quickly crashing back down to the same level on spot markets on other exchanges. Brief Price Surge On Gemini According to various posts on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), it would seem that Gemini experienced a technical issue that caused the XRP price displayed on their exchange to show an erroneous price of $50. During that time, however, XRP was trading around only $0.63.  Related Reading: Bittrex, SEC Reach Settlement In Securities Violation Case It would appear as if Gemini is currently experiencing a thin order book after recently relisting XRP on its spot markets. Users have posted screenshots on social media of the token&#8217;s price on the exchange rising above $1 several times. However, the exchange has since updated its chart to make it look like the cryptocurrency only spiked to $1.50. Gemini updates XRP chart to reflect $1.50 spike &#124; Source: Gemini The bump, which took a few seconds to correct, was likely a result of low liquidity. According to crypto trading expert Ali Martinez, the liquidity was so low that only a $37,000 order was enough to move XRP prices on the exchange by 2%. $XRP hit $50 on @Gemini, but now they have updated their charts to make it seems like #XRP hit $1.60. 😅 Still, the market depth on this #crypto exchange is very low.

Due to regulatory concerns, the token was initially delisted on various exchanges after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020.  However, US Judge Analisa Torress ruled in July that XRP sales to the general public are not in violation of federal laws, so many of these crypto exchanges have gone ahead to relist XRP on their platforms.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.6311, up by 33.09% in the past month. Despite the initial euphoria community members may have experienced due to the Gemini glitch, the Ripple ecosystem still has a long way to go before XRP can actually hit $50 on the open market.
