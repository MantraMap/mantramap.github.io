            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Please Read Disclaimer]</strong></p>
<p>The ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies welcomes a new entrant: <a href="https://apemax.io/?ref=cryptopotato_1" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ApeMax</a>, a playful meme coin ready to soar. Tapping into the rising trend of meme coins, characterized by their humorous and entertaining vibe, ApeMax is capturing the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. This press release delves into the alluring world of ApeMax and its potential parallels with renowned meme coins like DogeCoin and Shiba Inu.</p>
<h2>Introducing Max: The Cosmic Adventurer</h2>
<p>Max, the delightful space-traveling ape, symbolizes ApeMax’s lively spirit. Drawing inspiration from popular internet culture and jests, meme coins, including ApeMax, combine financial adventure with relatable fun, a mix that ensures their appeal endures.</p>
<h2>The Meme Coin Attraction</h2>
<p>Coins such as ApeMax, DogeCoin, and Shiba Inu have found a fervent fanbase. They stand apart from the conventional cryptos, offering a fun escape from the otherwise intense crypto atmosphere. Attracting a younger, diverse crowd, they encapsulate creativity, fun, and community camaraderie. However, their volatile nature necessitates a careful approach, emphasizing fun over financial aspirations.</p>
<h2>A Glimpse into the ApeMax Pre-Sale</h2>
<p>The ApeMax presale phase provides an attractive opportunity for crypto aficionados to acquire ApeMax coins at competitive prices. Besides the main tokens, the Early Birds Loot Boxes during the pre-sale phase offer up to 50% discounts, elevating the buying experience.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Meme coins, spearheaded by names like ApeMax, DogeCoin, and Shiba Inu, have enlivened the crypto domain. As the crypto realm embraces the zest and imagination these coins usher in, it&#8217;s essential to remember their essence: fun and community.</p>
<p>Before delving into crypto purchases, comprehensive research and unbiased expert advice are essential. Recognize the inherent risks and remember that ApeMax, due to regional regulations, is not available in countries like the USA, Canada, and sanctioned countries. Be sure to check the <a href="https://apemax.io/?ref=cryptopotato_1" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official ApeMax website</a> for the complete list of blocked countries before making a purchase.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[While most cryptocurrencies keep trading sideways, HBAR has gone on a tear with a double-digit price surge.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to remain stagnant in a tight range, but that could all change soon, according to one technical indicator.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also quite sluggish, with little-to-no actual movements from the larger caps. HBAR is the only exception.</p>
<h2>Is BTC Finally Breaking Out?</h2>
<p>The start of last week was a lot more volatile as the primary cryptocurrency dumped below $29,000 to register a weekly low before it exploded by $1,500 by Wednesday. As such, the asset managed to soar past $30,000 for the first time in about 10 days.</p>
<p>Yet, that trip was short-lived, and BTC returned quickly to $29,500. The US CPI numbers on Thursday didn&#8217;t change the landscape all that much. The next three days were quite <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/thorchains-rune-explodes-20-in-a-day-bitcoin-btc-stalls-at-29k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">uneventful</a> as well, with BTC remaining in a tight range between $29,100 and $29,500.</p>
<p>One of Glassnode&#8217;s lead on-chain analysts said on Twitter that this lack of actual price movements could be about to change soon. This is because the &#8220;spread between the Upper and Lower Bollinger Bands&#8221; stands at just 2.9%, and the previous examples in which the indicator was at such low levels led to a lot more volatility shortly after.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Only two instances have ever seen a smaller trading range / lower volatility:<br />

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>HBAR Goes Green</h2>
<p>Although more volatile by nature, the alternative coins have failed to produce any major price movements lately. The past 24 hours are no exception for most, as ETH, BNB, XRP, DOGE, ADA, SOL, TRX, MATIC, DOT, SHIB, LTC, and TONCOIN have either charted insignificant gains or have retraced slightly.</p>
<p>HBAR is the only notable gainer from the top 50 alts. The asset has soared by more than 16% and sits well above $0.06.</p>
<p>Frax Share, Pepe, Render, and Apecoin have also jumped in the past 24 hours, with gains of up to 6%.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the total crypto market cap has remained still at around $1.170 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The attack focused on the platform’s lending pools.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 13th of August, DeFi project Zunami Protocol was attacked by bad actors, resulting in an estimated loss of $2.1 million.</p>
<p>A decentralized revenue aggregator project allowing users to stake stablecoins for yield, the exploit of Zunami focused on its Curve pools, adding one more victim to the list of protocols affected by the recent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/here-is-how-much-curve-finance-has-recovered-from-its-70m-hack/" data-wpel-link="internal">attack</a> on Curve Finance.</p>
<h2>(Un)stablecoins</h2>
<p>The exploit was first detected by blockchain security firm PeckShield, who immediately notified Zunami.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hi <a href="https://twitter.com/ZunamiProtocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@zunamiprotocol</a>, we have detected an ongoing attack. Users are strongly suggested to take necessary actions.</p>
<p>Here is the encrypted hash: 2638ae2969ce932d61c3ca66f9b8a4a6c01c4d89bb2b34ddcf2c4145960f41c4. Actual hash will be released once the situation is stable.</p>
<p>— PeckShield Inc. (@peckshield) <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1690857760412610560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to PeckShield, the attack – which netted the bad actor $2.1 million and counting – was carried out via price manipulation made possible by <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1690877589005778945" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">donating</a> to the protocol.</p>
<p>A step-by-step post-mortem was also <a href="https://twitter.com/Ironblocks_/status/1690869728204533760" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">made</a> available by fellow blockchain security firm Ironblocks.</p>
<p>As usual, the attack started with a flash loan provided by Zunami, after which the perpetrator added liquidity and carried out some trades at an inflated price before returning the funds borrowed and cashing out a cool $2 million in profits.</p>
<p>The exploit drained the protocols’ zStables pools on Curve Finance, manipulating the price of both Zunami Ether (zETH) and Zunami USD (UZD). The price manipulation of the latter knocked the so-called stablecoin far off its peg.</p>
<p>Currently, 1 UZD is worth $0.0098, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zunami-usd" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to CoinGecko.</p>
<h2>Collateral Secure, Exploit Still Not Fixed</h2>
<p>Shortly after PeckShield alerted Zunami Protocol of the issue, the latter confirmed the attack. Furthermore, the team instructed platform users to avoid purchasing either of the affected tokens, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZunamiProtocol/status/1690863406079696896" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">warning</a> them that the exploit had not yet been fixed.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It appears that zStables have encountered an attack. The collateral remain secure, we delve into the ongoing investigation. Please do not buy zETH and UZD at the moment, their emission has been attacked.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The news was immediately lampooned by members of the crypto community, who pointed to the protocol’s claim of a “battle-tested” depeg prevention system.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">well that was a lie<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f923.png" alt="🤣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/DPLm0P0HtF" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/DPLm0P0HtF</a></p>
<p>— Degem Finder (@DegemFinder) <a href="https://twitter.com/DegemFinder/status/1690892018879500288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, the collateral backing UZD is allegedly safe, meaning that users should get their funds back. However, according to Zunami’s <a href="https://www.zunami.io/uzd" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">website</a>, one of the collateral holders is Curve, raising questions about the viability of those reserves.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The $UZD is backed by the LP of the Zunami Protocol DAO Strategy, which proxies funds in most major DeFi protocols that have been extensively audited, including Curve, Convex &amp; Stake DAO.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For now, no further information has been provided by Zunami devs on how user losses can be recouped.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, has explained how the court approached the Howey test in the SEC vs Ripple (XRP) case.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an Aug. 14 post on X, David Schwartz stated that the determination in the XRP case was based on whether a court is “confined to look at the formal terms of a single contract to determine if it is an investment.”</p>
<ul>
<li>In Schwartz’s opinion, the key takeaway from the XRP <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruling</a> is that when applying the Howey test to establish whether an asset is a security, regulators cannot limit themselves to a superficial examination of a contract’s content.</li>

<blockquote><p>The issue in Howey was whether the court was confined to looking at the formal terms of a single contract to determine if it was an investment contract. The holding is that you can&#8217;t *just* look at the contract, not that there doesn&#8217;t have to be a contract.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In other words, the Howey test doesn’t imply that the requirements for a contract are waived altogether but that a comprehensive analysis beyond just the contract’s formalities is needed to determine whether it is a security.</li>
<li>Schwartz’s statement comes in the wake of the SEC announcing that it will <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-lead-lawyer-slams-secs-appeal-request-reveals-important-date/" data-wpel-link="internal">appeal</a> XRP’s partial victory against it.</li>
<li>The legal battles have taken their toll on XRP’s price. Investor’s confidence has waned following the SEC’s notice of appeal, which has caused a build-up of selling pressure and a 33% <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-price-sinks-25-since-historic-sec-win-as-hype-slows-down/" data-wpel-link="internal">drop</a> in the value of XRP in the last weeks.</li>
<li>However, the token seems to have shaken off some of the market’s languor, with analysts observing a golden cross on XRP’s three-day chart for the first time since December 2020.</li>
<li>It is the third time in XRP’s history that the golden cross has appeared on its charts. On the other two occasions, it preceded impressive bull runs, including a 12,437% price hike that saw XRP reach an all-time high of $3.317.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Is LEASH in for a treat this week? Here's when a new utility will be revealed.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is known for its passionate community, explosive nature, as well as meme culture.</p>
<p>Recently, the lead developer &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; teased that there&#8217;s an upcoming announcement for holders of the ecosystem&#8217;s LEASH token.</p>
<h2>What is LEASH Coin?</h2>
<p>LEASH is also commonly referred to as the Doge Killer, and it&#8217;s one of the three cryptocurrencies that comprise the ecosystem of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-shiba-inu-shib/#:~:text=Source%3A%20ABK-,What%20is%20Shiba%20Inu%20(SHIB)%3F,surpassed%20%240.7%20in%20May%202021." data-wpel-link="internal">Shiba Inu</a> &#8211; the other two being SHIB and BONE.</p>
<p>The LEASH coin was originally set to be a rebasing cryptocurrency pegged to the price of its verbal nemesis &#8211; Dogecoin. However, later on, a decision has been taken for it not to rebase.</p>
<p>It has a total maximum cap of a little over 100K tokens, and it has very much the opposite appeal to SHIB. Exclusivity is the name of the game when it comes to LEASH holders. This is perhaps the reason why the cryptocurrency holds a much higher price per token, currently trading at around $567 per CoinGecko.</p>

<h2>Announcement Due This Week: Will Shiba Inu&#8217;s LEASH Explode?</h2>
<p>Shared recently on Discord was an announcement from the lead developer of the Shiba Inu ecosystem &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama. It reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear LEASH Holders,</p>
<p>As you know, EXCLUSIVITY is the key utility of Leash and I have an exclusive exclusive for you all TUESDAY 1 PM EST.</p>
<p>Then on Wednesday, a new utility for Leash will be unveiled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_266135" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266135" style="width: 533px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-Screenshot_shib.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266135" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-Screenshot_shib.jpg" alt="twitter-Screenshot_shib" width="533" height="377" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-Screenshot_shib.jpg 533w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-Screenshot_shib-300x212.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-Screenshot_shib-50x35.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266135" class="wp-caption-text">Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1690770758304161792" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">X</a></figcaption></figure></blockquote>
<p>The overall community&#8217;s response to the announcement has been somewhat mixed. While many users are eager and excited about it, a lot of others have been prompting the lead developer and his team to uphold some of their other roadmap updates, such as the Shibarium layer-2 solution.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase boss Brian Armstrong has acknowledged that there are issues with user experience on the Coinbase app.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Aug. 14 he commented on the effect of ‘Onchain Summer’ was having on the company’s user interface and experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One thing Onchain Summer is exposing is just how broken our UX is in the main Coinbase app for NFTs, Dapps, and L2s today. Sorry to say, but true.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Coinbase Broken UX</h2>
<p>He said that users need to have “first-class experiences,” adding that Onchain Summer is a “great impetus to have every employee feel that pain ourselves and fix it.”</p>
<p>Onchain Summer is the company’s celebration of art, culture, gaming, and community to promote its newly launched Base network.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">One thing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnchainSummer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#OnchainSummer</a> is exposing is just how broken our UX is in the main Coinbase app for NFTs, Dapps, and L2s today.

If we face truth, we can get motivated to improve it. These need to be first class experiences, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnchainSummer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#OnchainSummer</a> is a great impetus…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Armstrong said that the Coinbase Wallet was “farther ahead on this dimension,” but there is still lots of work to do there as well.</p>
<p>He asked for feedback from those with a “UX pain point,” but Coinbase is notoriously poor at responding to customer complaints.</p>
<p>Some reported problems with the wallet and Chrome extension, to which Armstrong replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Connecting mobile wallet to the chrome extension is still unreliable for some reason. This bug has been more persistent than I expected.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On Aug. 9, Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbases-base-notches-4th-rank-in-daily-tps-among-layer-2-solutions-data/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> “Base Day One,” launching the layer-2 network to the public. According to the firm, Base mainnet features more than 100 dApps and service providers in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>On Aug. 12, <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-are-whales-investing-in-on-coinbases-base-network-nansen-investigates/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> that early whales were already investing in Base by bridging assets to the network.</p>
<p>According to L2beat, Base total value locked is just under $200 million propelling it to the fifth largest layer-2 network. TVL has more than doubled so far this month but remains a long way behind industry leaders Arbitrum and Optimism.</p>
<h2>Coca-Cola Launches NFTs on Base</h2>
<p>The world’s largest soft drinks brand is delving deeper into the realms of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), launching a collection on the Coinbase Base network.</p>
<p>On Aug. 13, Coinbase announced the new CocaCola collection as part of its “Onchain Summer” event.</p>
<blockquote><p>“CocaCola is bringing their Global Masterpiece campaign onchain with iconic works from leading artists.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Masterpiece collection brings together “iconic artworks” along with new works from emerging talents, “all intertwined with the iconic Coca-Cola bottle,” the firm stated.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA["I remain extremely excited about Riot’s leading role in driving the cross-industry transformation of energy and money" via BTC mining, CEO Les stated.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The leading cryptocurrency mining company &#8211; Riot Platforms &#8211; produced 1,775 BTC during the second quarter of 2023, a 27% increase compared to that three-month period in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite not fully coping with the issues caused by the severe winter storm in Texas in 2022, the company reached an all-time high hash rate capacity of 10.7 EH/s. Seeing those facilities fully operational and signing the long-term purchase agreement with MicroBT Electronics Technology could boost its hash rate capacity to 20.1 EH/s by the end of 2024.</p>
<h2>Solid Quarter for Riot</h2>
<p>The firm <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/158/riot-platforms-reports-second-quarter-2023-financial" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">disclosed</a> a total revenue of $76.7 million in Q2 (compared to $72.9 million in the same period last year). It revealed that the better results are primarily driven by a 27% increase in Bitcoin production.</p>
<p>Besides mining 1,775 BTC, Riot Platforms decreased the average cost to mine a single bitcoin to $8,389. That expense equaled $11,316 in Q2, 2022.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Riot’s core business is Bitcoin mining, and the scale of our vertically integrated operations and financial strength allowed us to execute on our power strategy at unmatched scale this quarter, driving our average cost to mine to $8,389 per Bitcoin in the second quarter, compared to an average Bitcoin price of $28,024,&#8221; CEO Jason Les explained.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mining revenue ($49.7 million) and engineering revenue ($19.3 million) were also higher than the registered figures year-over-year.</p>
<p>Riot Platforms finished the quarter with $408.4 million in working capital, including $289.2 million in cash on hand and $221.4 million in unencumbered Bitcoin. It means that the entity held 7,264 BTC at the end of June, assuming that the price of the leading digital asset stood at $30,477 at that time.</p>
<p>While the stash might seem substantial, it is a no match to what its rival &#8211; Marathon Digital &#8211; has amassed over the years. It owns almost 13,000 BTC, making it one of the largest corporate holders of the primary cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>RIOT Goes Down</h2>
<p>Despite the positive Bitcoin mining results and the good overall numbers during Q2, Riot Platforms saw its shares plunging shortly after revealing the figures.</p>
<p>RIOT dropped by over 8% (on a daily basis earlier this week) and around 15% (for the past month), currently trading at approximately $15.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265710" style="width: 541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Riot.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-265710" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Riot.png" alt="RIOT Price" width="541" height="317" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Riot.png 541w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Riot-300x176.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Riot-50x29.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265710" class="wp-caption-text">RIOT Price, Source: Yahoo Finance</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, things do not appear that grim when observed from a six-month perspective since one stock was worth a mere $5.50 back then.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The option became possible after a partnership between the organization and the crypto payment gateway Triple-A.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The charity entity </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://redcross.sg/news-stories/stories/1292-coin-a-new-way-to-give.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that individuals willing to make such donations can set an amount in fiat, and the system will automatically convert the sum into crypto. Singapore Red Cross is currently able to receive some of the largest digital assets by market capitalization, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDT, and USDC.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We do not have any preferred cryptocurrency, and we accept any of the cryptocurrencies stated above,&#8221; it clarified.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The organization explained that this type of contribution is not tax-deductible at the moment. People who want to obtain such deductions should donate via credit card.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Singapore Red Cross said that each crypto handout will support its humanitarian efforts focused on improving the welfare of children, isolated seniors, persons with disabilities, and families from disadvantaged backgrounds.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Coin a new way to give today, your support will go a long way,&#8221; the entity emphasized.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The alleged scam had over 14,000 customers at one point.</p>
<ul>
<li>The complaint was <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8766-23" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> in the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Rene Larralde, Brian Early, Alisha Ann Kingrey, and Juan Pablo Valcarce.</li>
<li>The group of four, alongside their unincorporated entity called Fundsz, were charged with &#8220;fraudulent solicitation from clients to purportedly trade in cryptocurrencies and precious metals.&#8221;</li>
<li>The press release informed that the project ran from October 2020 until now and promised investors over 3% returns per week using a &#8220;proprietary algorithm&#8221; for trading and something the founders described as &#8220;secret sauce.&#8221;</li>
<li>Speaking of their historical performance, the four charged people claimed they had made &#8220;on-time and accurate payments&#8221; for seven years. Additionally, they said a one-time $2,500 investment in their project can be turned into $1 million within 48 months with no additional contributions.</li>
<li>The founders also said they run a parallel charity organization and use portions of the contributions to Fundsz to support several initiatives, including cleaning oceans and others related to health, education, and humanitarianism.</li>
<li>It seems Fundsz&#8217; tactics had worked as it had amassed over 14,000 customers at its peak. However, the CFTC argued that the charged individuals never actually traded any funds. All clients&#8217; gains are &#8220;illusory,&#8221; as the defendants &#8220;simply make up fictional weekly returns to report to customers.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“The CFTC continues to root out individuals who defraud customers in the cryptocurrency and precious metals markets. Though the products fraudsters purport to trade and their methods of attracting victims &#8211; in this case through social media &#8211; may have changed, the old adage ‘if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is’ remains as valid as ever,” said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.</p></blockquote>
