            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dog-themed meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) came out in 2020 and was initially priced at $0.000000001009. However, on May 10, 2021, at the height of the last great bull run to hit the crypto market, SHIB soared 457% in just 24 hours to reach $0.00003791.</p>
<p>It made even greater strides in October 2021, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845, translating into a $44 billion market cap.</p>

<p>That said, we decided to ask ChatGPT how high SHIB can go during the next crypto bull market.</p>
<h2>SHIB Before</h2>
<p>SHIB’s impressive performance in that period was largely due to several factors. Firstly, it benefited from viral social media buzz, drawing on its origin as a joke coin. Additionally, a robust, good-humored community formed around the cryptocurrency, establishing an identity that has ensured its longevity in the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, it gained mainstream recognition after receiving endorsements and support from sports, film, and music stars. Notable names such as socialite Paris Hilton, former Tampa Bay wide receiver Antonio Brown, and Backstreet Boys band member Nick Carter added to its visibility and credibility.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu’s current price is nearly 90% lower than its ATH, reflecting the ravages wrought on crypto prices by the 2022 bear market. However, with analysts predicting that crypto could be on the cusp of the next bull market, how high could Shiba Inu go?</p>
<h2>What About the Next Bull Market?</h2>
<p>Assessing the future price of crypto can be challenging due to its inherent volatility and unpredictability.</p>
<p>For starters, there are currently more than 1.2 million SHIB holders, which gives it a ready and dedicated support base. A bull market for cryptocurrencies can boost the value of Shiba Inu as more investors realize the potential of digital currencies.</p>
<p>Meme coins are also quite popular, and interest in them often <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-shib-rally-incoming-major-selling-pressure-flushed-developments-today/" data-wpel-link="internal">surges</a>, thanks to social media trends and the influence of celebrities.</p>
<p>Additionally, cryptocurrencies need more use cases and real-world value to thrive. SHIB stands out from other meme coins because it’s building a comprehensive ecosystem around itself, including its soon-to-be-launched <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-shibarium/" data-wpel-link="internal">Shibarium</a> Layer-2 solution.</p>
<p>Depending on how well Shibarium performs alongside other <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inus-leash-explodes-following-listing-on-major-exchange/" data-wpel-link="internal">additions</a> to the SHIB ecosystem, utility-driven demand for SHIB could increase the coin’s price exponentially.</p>
<p>However, lingering issues in the crypto industry, including a lack of regulatory clarity and the emergence of newer and potentially more popular meme coins, could also stunt the coin’s price.</p>
<p>Of course, none of the above is to be construed as any form of financial advice. Remember that the cryptocurrency market is subjected to high volatility, and there’s a high chance of losing your investment. Never risk more than you’re comfortable losing, and always do your research or consult a professional before making an investment.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[HBAR has dumped the most in the past 24 hours, losing over 15% of its value. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although bitcoin&#8217;s price also dipped in the past 24 hours toward $29,000, its dominance over the alts has actually jumped quite a lot.</p>
<p>This is because most alts are bleeding out now, with XRP, DOGE, SOL, UNI, and others, have slumped by up to 7%.</p>
<h2>BTC Dominance Rises</h2>
<p>Bitcoin shot up by over $1,500 a week ago and tapped a multi-week high at over $30,000. However, it couldn&#8217;t sustain its momentum and slipped by roughly a grand on the following day. Weirdly, it remained stagnant on Thursday after the US CPI numbers came out, unlike previous similar occasions.</p>
<p>The rest of the week was quite identical. BTC failed to move out of a tight range between $29,200 and $29,500, and expectedly, the weekend didn&#8217;t bring any increased volatility, either.</p>
<p>Monday started with a minor decline toward $29,100, followed by a price <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/these-altcoins-soar-while-bitcoin-pushes-above-29k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">jump</a> to $29,700 on Thursday. However, the bears stepped up on the gas and pushed BTC back down to $29,200 as of now. This came despite the news of the first spot Bitcoin ETF <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/first-spot-bitcoin-etf-goes-live-in-europe-with-interesting-twist/" data-wpel-link="internal">launching</a> in Europe.</p>
<p>Its market cap has slipped below $570 billion, but its dominance over the alts has increased to over 49%, adding almost 0.5% in a day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266777" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266777" style="width: 1835px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSD-5.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266777" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSD-5.png" alt="BTCUSD.

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Alts Go Red</h2>
<p>Ethereum is among the few alts that have declined by a small percentage in the past 24 hours. In fact, ETH is down just as much as BTC and still trades above $1,800. BNB and TRX have declined by 1-2%.</p>
<p>In contrast, Ripple, Dogecoin, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, Shiba Inu, Polygon, Litecoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche have all lost somewhere between 4% and 8% in a day.</p>
<p>HBAR has dumped the most from the larger-cap alts. The asset has seen 15% of its value gone in a day and is down to $0.06.</p>
<p>As such, the total crypto market cap has marked a $20 billion loss overnight. The metric is down to $1.150 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SEI is surging today, most likely because of the recent listing on Coinbase, but there's more.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently-launched layer 1 protocol, Sei network, saw its native cryptocurrency &#8211; the SEI token &#8211; listed on the major US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sei is a newly-launched blockchain making bold claims and promises of being &#8220;the fastest blockchain in the industry.&#8221;</li>
<li>The Sei token was introduced on the Binance Launchpool program at the beginning of August and started trading a few days ago.</li>
<li>Most recently, SEI was <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets/status/1691432501791555584" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">listed</a> on the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. Per the announcement:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase will add support for Sei (SEI) on the Sei network. Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost.</p>
<p>Trading is anticipated to begin later today, if liquidity conditions are met. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our SEI-USD trading pair will launch in phases. Support for SEI may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It also appears that the token is seeing increased traction in Korea. According to a recent <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/245617/sei-trading-spike-south-korea" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, BTSE CEO Jeff Mei said:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The chain&#8217;s degen-focused online community seems to have connected particularly with the South Korean retail market, with trading surging on local exchanges Bithumb and Upbit.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of teases throughout the past few weeks from Shiba Inu&#8217;s lead developer &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; on Twitter (now known as X) regarding a potential major announcement happening today.</p>
<p>Many are hoping for a reveal of the Shibarium network, but just as many seem to be skeptical and anticipating an underwhelming announcement.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_question_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266744" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_question_cover.jpg" alt="shibarium_question_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_question_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_question_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_question_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_question_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_question_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu With Hyped Announcement Today</h2>
<p>During the past few days, the team behind Shiba Inu has been teasing the community with what&#8217;s promised to be a major announcement during the Blockchain Futurist Conference &#8211; an event taking place in Toronto, Canada, on August 15-16th. Shiba Inu is the official title sponsor.</p>
<p>Some of the more devoted Shiba Inu followers are expecting that the announcement will be the much-anticipated Shibarium release.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266742" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266742" style="width: 532px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266742" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img1.jpg" alt="shib_img1" width="532" height="447" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img1.jpg 532w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img1-300x252.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img1-50x42.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266742" class="wp-caption-text">Source: X</figcaption></figure>
<p>A few hours ago, the official X account of Shiba Inu posted a video teaser where Kusama welcomes everyone to the keynote speech.</p>
<p>As <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shibarium-nearly-complete-shiba-inu-with-a-new-major-announcement/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> yesterday, Kusama stated that Shibarium is &#8220;nearly complete&#8221; in comments to a recent partnership with Alpha Transform Holdings.</p>
<h2>Skeptics Also Lurk</h2>
<p>While there are many people who are eagerly anticipating the announcement, some users have already expressed concerns that it won&#8217;t be anything of substance.</p>
<p>Joking with the lead developer was the founder of The Gem Pad, who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hope we don&#8217;t get an encyclopedia tomorrow, Shytoshi Kusama. We all just want Shibarium Mainnet launch.</p></blockquote>
<p>His comments come in light of the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inus-leash-token-plunges-on-underwhelming-announcement-but-theres-more/" data-wpel-link="internal">underwhelming announcement</a> that Shib&#8217;s team made yesterday in regard to LEASH holders.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that LEASH holders have been promised the reveal of a new utility for the token, which should take place today.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Shibarium - Shiba Inu's much-anticipated layer 2 blockchain is in the works. Here's everything you need to know about it.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of cryptocurrency is ever-evolving, with innovative projects and new platforms frequently emerging to redefine the digital finance landscape.</p>
<p>One such exciting initiative is Shibarium, a future development in the ecosystem of the Shiba Inu token. As a Layer 2 solution, Shibarium aims to address the pressing issues of scalability and transaction costs in the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>This article will delve into everything you need to know about Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s exciting initiative.</p>
<h2>What is Shiba Inu(SHIB)</h2>
<p>Launched during the DeFi Summer in August 2020, alongside the inaugural TikTok pump, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-shiba-inu-shib/" data-wpel-link="internal">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> stands out as the second most significant meme cryptocurrency in market capitalization. Its core values include decentralization, a &#8220;building for fun&#8221; philosophy, and a commitment to community-led development.</p>
<p>At the heart of Shiba Inu&#8217;s tokenomics lies the SHIB token, an ERC-20 digital currency built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Notably, Shiba Inu possesses the highest total supply among the leading altcoins, with the issuance of 1 quadrillion SHIB.</p>
<p>Despite its classification as a meme coin, the Shiba Inu project maintains a substantial ecosystem, featuring its proprietary DeFi protocol called ShibaSwap, and ventures into the realms of NFTs and the metaverse.</p>
<p>Participants within the Shiba Inu ecosystem who contribute liquidity have the opportunity to receive rewards through staking the project&#8217;s trio of native coins: SHIB, BONE, and LEASH (resulting in xSHIB, xBONE, and xLEASH yields). Furthermore, the development team has introduced a governance module. It continues to make strides toward the beta testnet launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 network designed to enhance the operational efficiency of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>

<h2>What is Shibarium?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.shibariumtech.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shibarium</a> is an upcoming Layer 2 blockchain developed by the Shiba Inu project. As a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-are-layer-2-scaling-solutions/#:~:text=Layer%202%20networks%20process%20transactions,load%20off%20the%20base%20network." data-wpel-link="internal">Layer 2 solution</a>, it is designed to interact seamlessly with the primary Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1), providing a more scalable and cost-effective transaction platform.</p>
<p>This new blockchain aims to address some of the fundamental issues that have plagued Ethereum, primarily expensive gas fees and slow transaction times.</p>
<p>By offering faster and cheaper transactions, Shibarium not only enhances the usability of the Shiba Inu token but also has the potential to play a crucial role in the broader adoption of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The details about its operation and other technical aspects are under wraps as it&#8217;s still in the development phase. The Shiba Inu community eagerly anticipates its arrival, viewing Shibarium as a significant step in the token&#8217;s evolution from a &#8216;meme coin&#8217; to a potent player in decentralized finance.</p>
<h2>Shibarium as a Layer 2 Solution</h2>
<p>Shibarium, as a Layer 2 solution, exemplifies an innovative approach to blockchain scalability and efficiency. Layer 2 solutions are protocols built on top of a base blockchain (Layer 1) to improve capacity and speed.</p>
<p>In the case of Shibarium, it is built upon the Ethereum blockchain. By handling transactions off the main Ethereum chain, Shibarium significantly reduces the burden on the network, resulting in faster transaction times and lower fees.</p>
<p>The Layer 2 solution could potentially revolutionize transactions within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, making it more accessible and appealing to users.</p>
<p>While the existing high gas prices and slow transactions on the Ethereum network have been a barrier for many, the introduction of Shibarium signifies a proactive step in overcoming such challenges. As such, it is crucial for the growth of the Shiba Inu token.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_work.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266736" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_work.jpg" alt="shibarium_work" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_work.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_work-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_work-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_work-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibarium_work-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>How Shibarium Works</h2>
<h3>Shibarium blockchain</h3>
<p>Shibarium is intended to offload a portion of computing activities off-chain, just as other notable Layer 2 solutions. This plan intends to lessen the load on Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet caused by transactions. The designated gas fee in the forthcoming blockchain will be paid in BONE, and twenty million BONE tokens will be set aside as an incentive for validators and delegators inside the Shibarium ecosystem.</p>
<p>Shibarium will work with Heimdall Validator and Bor block producer nodes, drawing comparisons to Polygon (MATIC). While Bor will be fully compatible with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM), Heimdall will be built on top of the Tendermint consensus engine.</p>
<p>Within the Shibarium network, users must lock 10,000 BONE tokens to qualify as validators. For those interested in supporting the network without engaging in node operation, the option to delegate their tokens will be available.</p>
<h3>Shibarium ecosystem dynamics</h3>
<p>Six different contributor categories have received invites to join Shibarium&#8217;s newly announced Join Shibarium platform. It encourages &#8220;web3/web4&#8221; application developers to create software on the Shibarium platform. Entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency space might move their initiatives to this forthcoming blockchain. Enrollment for validators and delegators is also ongoing at this time.</p>
<p>Additionally, businesses interested in implementing Shiba Inu for payments can start their applications through the Join Shibarium site, which is made possible by an active Layer 2 solution. Ecosystem managers and content producers can apply and take part in Shibarium&#8217;s marketing and development initiatives by submitting their applications.</p>
<h4>Shibarium tokens and DEXs</h4>
<p>In a blog post introduction, Shytoshi Kusama <a href="https://shytoshikusama.medium.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">hinted</a> at integrating Shibarium into Shiba Inu (SHIB) metaverse initiatives and the Shiba Eternity game. Other tokens in its ecosystem are Leash (LEASH) and BONE.</p>
<p>ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, enables users to trade tokens and engage in yield farming powered by the Bone token ($BONE). PawSwap and Marswap Staking introduce further trading opportunities through the $PAWSWAP and $MSWAP tokens. Additionally, Serp Finance brings a perpetual DEX experience with its $SERP token.</p>
<h4>Shibarium launchpads and dApps</h4>
<p>The ecosystem extends its support to new projects through launchpads. Dogpad, represented by the $DOGPAD token, and ShibPad, utilizing $SHIBP, serve as launch platforms, helping projects gain traction and visibility.</p>
<p>A diverse range of decentralized applications (dApps) also enrich the Shibarium ecosystem. Shib Chomp, driven by the $CHOMP token, offers secure storage solutions. Treat, powered by the stablecoin governance token $TREAT, enhances stability and governance. With the $PRO token, Prodigy introduces a sniper bot for efficient trading. Shibarium Name Service ($SNS) simplifies addresses similar to Ethereum Name Service (ENS).</p>
<h4>NFTs and meme coins</h4>
<p>NFTs and meme coins are integral parts of Shibarium&#8217;s ecosystem. Noteworthy NFT projects include Shiboshis, while meme coins like $BAD, $PYRITE, $KOYO, $HEEL, and more contribute to the ecosystem&#8217;s diversity.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s the Importance of Shibarium for Shiba Inu?</h2>
<p>The significance of Shibarium for Shiba Inu is multifaceted, encompassing several critical aspects poised to enhance the project&#8217;s capabilities and long-term potential:</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced transaction efficiency:</strong> Shibarium introduces a layer 2 solution to the Shiba Inu ecosystem, resulting in quicker transaction processing times. This advancement is anticipated to accommodate substantial growth and accelerate transaction speeds, although precise throughput data may require additional time to ascertain.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced transaction costs:</strong> Ethereum users have often grappled with exorbitant transaction fees, occasionally surpassing the transaction value. With Shibarium&#8217;s implementation, the layer 2 solution is expected to minimize gas fees, alleviating the burden of high transaction costs.</p>
<p><strong>Token utility enhancement:</strong> The vast supply of SHIB tokens, despite over 40% of them being burned, poses a substantial impediment to growth. Shibarium addresses this challenge by making BONE its native currency. Validators within the network will receive compensation in BONE for securing and validating transactions. Additionally, SHIB will be utilized within the new environment to control its excessively inflated quantity.</p>
<p><strong>DApp creation:</strong> Decentralized applications (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">dApps</a>) run on peer-to-peer networks, yet the original meme coin lacked the necessary resources to serve as a native coin for DApps. Shibarium aims to establish a robust ecosystem that leverages Ethereum and its layer 2 solution, providing developers with the technical resources needed to build DApps tailored to the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Shibarium’s Implications for SHIB, BONE, and TREAT</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, the introduction of Shibarium will represent an important turning point for the ecosystem of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) coin. The event is yet another significant trigger for SHIB&#8217;s global adoption. A noteworthy achievement within the tokenomics paradigm is highlighted by Shibarium&#8217;s use of Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) as the gas fee token.</p>
<p>Shibarium will launch TREAT in addition to SHIB and BONE as a new financial incentive tool. This token, which is still under development, is ready to contribute to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The creators of Shiba Inu stress that all the materials required for the beta testing phase of Shibarium will be offered free of charge. Any offers to buy testing tokens ought to be considered fraudulent.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Shibarium is more than just a technological development within the <a href="https://blog.shib.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shiba Inu ecosystem</a>. It is a living, evolving entity that grows and adapts to the needs of its community. At its core, it is a community-driven initiative that prioritizes user experience, focusing on providing optimized transaction speed, cost efficiency, and scalability.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The now-defunct cryptocurrency lending company Celsius Network reportedly received permission from US Judge Martin Glenn to send a restructured bankruptcy plan to creditors, seeking their approval.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If accepted, affected customers could retrieve up to 67% of their funds through a return of liquid digital currencies such as bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Plan Into Motion?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a recent Reuters </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/crypto-lender-celsius-sends-bankruptcy-plan-creditor-vote-2023-08-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">coverage</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Celsius can now introduce an advanced bankruptcy proposal to its creditors that could make them owners of a new entity. Affected clients will get the chance to take back some crypto deposits and obtain control of Fahrenheit Group (a consortium consisting of US Bitcoin Corp., the blockchain-based venture capital firm Arrington Capita, and other organizations).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Celsius determined that the amended plan will enable most clients with interest-bearing Earn accounts to retrieve up to 67% of their funds. The return will be funded via liquid cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH, equity shares in the new firm, and proceeds generated from the legal action against Alex Mashinsky (former CEO of the crypto lender). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fahrenheit is expected to purchase a minority stake in the upcoming business for $50 million and will list the entity&#8217;s stock on Nasdaq. This will allow Celsius clients to sell equity shares they will receive as part of the bankruptcy proposal.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new organization will pursue litigation against Mashinsky. US law enforcement agents arrested him last month over allegations that he conducted securities, commodities, and wire fraud and scammed users by misleading them about the firm&#8217;s actual business.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the report, some creditors are against the bankruptcy plan, but the official committee appointed to represent junior creditors is in favor and will advise customers to vote &#8220;yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Alleged Fraud Resulted in Multi-Billion Losses</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The once-prominent crypto lender suspended all withdrawals, swaps, and transfers last June, citing &#8220;extreme market conditions.&#8221; The company&#8217;s problems intensified a month later when it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/cel-dumped-50-after-celsius-filed-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for bankruptcy protection with the Southern District of New York. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the condition of the digital asset industry was indeed not quite favorable at the time, some regulators argued that there might be other contributing factors behind Celsius&#8217; collapse, such as fraudulent actions of its management team, led by Alex Mashinsky. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Singapore, Singapore, August 15th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>The latest Merkle tree asset proof data in August 2023 includes an update on ETH &amp; stETH and USDT &amp; stUSDT.</p>
<p>Users can view Huobi reserves in detail on the asset audit page of <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/finance/merkle/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Huobi&#8217;s official website</a>. The available information includes reserve ratio, Huobi wallet&#8217;s assets, and Huobi&#8217;s user assets. Huobi will regularly conduct Proof of Reserve audits to ensure users that their assets are safeguarded.</p>
<p class="ql-align-center"> <strong><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/H2ZFm9mHoplS-puwdR5UyzgPysFxbcKx6z5XmlBUuAL807N9Wu_1692117977XJmbi43F4Z.jpeg" /></strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-center">* The screenshot is taken from Huobi&#8217;s official website and users can view the reserves on this page.</p>
<p>The specific reserve ratios shown in this update are as follows: 102% for USDT (Huobi wallet balance: 662,404,586 USDT), 101% for BTC (Huobi wallet balance: 25,410 BTC), 104% for ETH (Huobi wallet balance: 139,523 ETH), 103% for HT (Huobi wallet balance: 191,815,856 HT), and 103% for TRX (Huobi wallet balance: 9,702,620,024 TRX). The data for USDT and ETH already includes stUSDT and stETH.</p>
<p>The Merkle Tree helps summarize and verify the existence and integrity of blockchain data in a timely manner. It typically contains the underlying (transaction) database of the block, the hash of the block header (the Merkle Root), and all branches along with the underlying block data to the root. The calculation of the Merkle Root for a blockchain generally involves grouping hash values of the data of that specific block and then inserting the newly generated hash into the Merkle Tree recursively until only the last root hash remains. After that, it is recorded as the Merkle Root of the block header.</p>
<p>Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a common audit method used to ensure that a crypto exchange holds sufficient on-chain funds to cover all assets held on it. This is how the Huobi Merkle Tree works: snapshots of all user balances are taken in order to generate a Merkle Tree. The Merkle Tree contains the encrypted data of assets held by all users in the exchange. The Merkle Root is acquired from the Merkle Tree and contains a single hash containing total balances in the snapshots. Then, the digital signatures of Huobi&#8217;s on-chain wallet addresses are verified to prove ownership over the addresses which obtain publically verifiable balances. Finally, the total balances held in on-chain wallet addresses are compared with the total balances provided by the Merkle Root to verify whether all assets are backed 1:1 by Huobi&#8217;s reserves.</p>
<p>At Huobi, the team believes that &#8220;in order to ensure data transparency and accuracy, the relevant reserves data on the asset audit page is currently updated once a month with the snapshot date generally on the first day of each month. The Merkle Tree data update is normally completed within the first week of each month. And in the future, Huobi will also optimize relevant technical modules and join hands with more technical service providers to achieve a more secure and transparent service. It is Huobi&#8217;s mission to follow the strategy of &#8216;global compliance&#8217; and bolster a healthy development of the crypto industry.&#8221;</p>
<h2>About Huobi</h2>
<p>About Huobi: Founded in 2013, Huobi has evolved from a crypto exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, wallets, research, investment, incubation and other areas.

Rockets refer to the USDT equivalent of your average assets on Huobi over a 30-day period. 1 USDT equals to 1 Rocket. The Rocket value represents an integer without decimal places.</p>
<p>The number of &#8220;Rockets&#8221; a user holds is determined by the balance of their assets. With an increased possession of &#8220;Rockets,&#8221; users can wield more influence in the PrimeVote event, major platform decisions, new token airdrops, and other scenarios where &#8220;Rockets&#8221; come into play. This grants them a stronger voice and a larger share of rewards. To increase their Rocket values, users can improve their asset balances by making deposits and purchasing quality assets like BTC, ETH, HT, etc. Moreover, using &#8220;Rockets&#8221; to vote will not cause users&#8217; asset balance to be locked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rockets&#8221; are users&#8217; tickets to take part in the PrimeVote events and also give participants a chance to mint limited edition NFTs in Huobi&#8217;s Mars Program that offers $6 million worth of space travel.</p>
<p>Based on Huobi&#8217;s official announcement, a total of 12 projects were shortlisted in the 7th round of the PrimeVote event. As of August 9, 202313:00 (UTC), EML and XDAO emerged as top performers in Group A while XFI and AD took the lead in Group B. These projects have advanced to the final voting stage. Following two rounds of preliminary and final voting, MinePlex (XFI) has stood out as the favored pick among the community by winning the championship of this event with a notable 208,172,999 &#8220;Rockets&#8221;. MinePlex (XFI) represents an innovative CrossFi initiative by integrating the stability and liquidity of traditional financial instruments with the security and transparency embedded in blockchain technology. To realize this vision, the team is crafting a distinct blockchain v1.0 featuring the LPoS consensus algorithm. The MinePlex 2.0 blockchain adopts the DPoS consensus protocol.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Milestones in the SEC lawsuit keep happening before big XRP price moves. The SEC's stance toward crypto may be unwittingly exposing crypto investors to more risk while hampering efficient markets.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP price had fallen nearly 5% on the 5-day chart Tuesday. Just five days earlier, the Securities and Exchange Commission appealed a recent U.S. court ruling that mostly favored Ripple Labs.</p>
<p>Ripple opened Wednesday morning trading at an average price around $0.61, after changing hands above $0.80 just last month. That was after SDNY judge Analisa Torres, ruled that XRP traded on crypto exchanges is not a security.</p>

<h2>XRP Price Reactions to SEC a Coincidence?</h2>
<p>This is at least the fourth time the XRPUSD markets have made big swings on crypto exchanges with lots of volatility after a new development in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. These developments are not directly related to the value XRP provides as a product.</p>
<p>When the commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">first filed</a> its suit against Ripple Labs in Dec 21, 2020, the price immediately plunged.</p>
<p>Then on Mar 22, 2021 when Judge Netburn ruled that XRP is a currency with utility value distinct from BTC and ETH, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XRP-USD/history?period1=1616371200&amp;period2=1616976000&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Ripple&#8217;s price rallied</a> from $0.52 to $0.55 during a week when BTC <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?period1=1616371200&amp;period2=1616976000&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">fell 2.8%</a>.</p>
<p>Altcoins were up that week, but the big blue chips were down on the charts. Ethereum <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/history?period1=1616371200&amp;period2=1616976000&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">fell over</a> the period as well. So it might have had something to do with the SEC case.</p>
<p>More recently this July, XRP spiked 72% after Judge Torres ruled mostly in Ripple&#8217;s favor. And now the price is back own again after the SEC&#8217;s appeal. It could be fairly argued the SEC is manipulating XRP more than <a href="https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/SEC%20vs%20Ripple%207-13-23.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">any efforts</a> made by Ripple Labs.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Ambiguity Hurts Small Investors</h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s mission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/mission" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">is to</a> protect investors and ensure fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Unfortunately, the approach it has taken under Gensler&#8217;s leadership has sown more fear, uncertainty, and doubt in markets. It has created more volatility and surprises in markets.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that this hurts the least sophisticated investors the most, while the largest concerns have the resources and wherewithal to remain apprised of the ongoing legal proceedings regarding this asset.</p>
<p>When will the SEC start protecting retail investors by giving the federal policy process time to work instead of using the shoehorn for its mighty heel?</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple is to file an important document with the Court in the coming days.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market is trading mostly in red today, and XRP is no exception.</p>
<p>The price is down about 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at around $0.60, hinging on a major support level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ripple&#8217;s XRP might see increased volatility throughout the next few days. The price is currently trading at 3% in the negative, but that may as well be a result of the broader market shakedown.</li>
<li>As <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-lead-lawyer-slams-secs-appeal-request-reveals-important-date/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed an interlocutory brief, formalizing its intention to appeal the ruling of Judge Analisa Torres.</li>
<li>Judge Torres ruled that secondary sales of XRP do not constitute an investment contract &#8211; a major point in the SEC&#8217;s stance, which undermines its position to a certain extent.</li>
<li>Commenting on the move last week was Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, who said:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The SEC does not have the &#8220;right&#8221; to appeal just yet, which is why they are asking permission to file an &#8220;interlocutory&#8221; appeal. Ripple will file its response with the Court next week. Stay tuned.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To date, the company hasn&#8217;t filed its response and it&#8217;s interesting to see if it will move the market when it does.</li>
</ul>
