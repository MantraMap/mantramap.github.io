<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>TeraWulf is set to increase its self-mining hashrate by 58% with the purchase of 18,500 Antminer S19j XP machines.</em></li>



<li><em>The acquisition, worth $53.4 million, will boost the company&#8217;s mining capacity at its Lake Mariner facility in New York.</em></li>



<li><em>The deployment of the new machines will contribute to TeraWulf&#8217;s goal of reaching a total self-mining hashrate of 7.9 EH/s by the end of the year.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin mining company TeraWulf is set to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/18/2706407/0/en/TeraWulf-Announces-7-9-EH-s-Expansion-Plan-and-Associated-Purchase-of-18-500-S19j-XP-Bitcoin-Miners-from-BITMAIN.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significantly boost</a> its mining capacity with the acquisition of 18,500 Antminer S19j XP Bitcoin mining machines from <a href="https://coincu.com/180230-beijing-fines-bitmain-for-3-55-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitmain</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>The purchase, totaling $75 million, will increase TeraWulf&#8217;s self-mining hashrate by 58% to reach 7.9 EH/s by the end of the year. The new mining machines will be deployed at the company&#8217;s Lake Mariner facility in New York, where the construction of Building 3 is currently underway. This expansion will provide an additional 43 MW of capacity to accommodate the increased mining operations.</p>



<p>The Antminer S19j XP machines, the next-generation units offered by Bitmain, boast a power efficiency rating of 21.5 joules per terahash (J/TH) and a Bitcoin mining hashrate of 151 terahash per second (TH/s) each. In total, the 18,500 machines will contribute a combined hashrate of 2.8 exahashes per second (EH/s). The mining machines are scheduled to be shipped in equal monthly batches starting in October and continuing through November and December.</p>

<p>Nazar Khan, Co-founder and COO of TeraWulf highlighted the company&#8217;s commitment to efficiency, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;At TeraWulf, we continue to believe that all hash is not created equal. Our planned expansion with S19j XPs will further establish TeraWulf as one of the most efficient mining fleets in the sector with a fleet efficiency of 25.7 J/TH.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Khan emphasized the company&#8217;s low-cost and sustainable mining practices, which include an average cost of power of 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average availability of over 98%.</p>



<p>TeraWulf has already paid the deposit for the new mining machines, and they will be delivered in equal batches over the next few months. The company aims to position itself for increased profit margins ahead of the next halving event. By leveraging the high performance and low energy consumption of the S19j XP miners, the company seeks to optimize its mining operations while maintaining a focus on sustainability.</p>



<p>Xmei Lin, Head of Sales at Bitmain, expressed pride in partnering with <a href="https://coincu.com/164212-terawulf-restructures-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TeraWulf</a> for this significant order of S19j XPs. Lin emphasized the efficiency and energy-saving capabilities of Bitmain&#8217;s latest-generation miners, which align well with TeraWulf&#8217;s sustainable and cost-effective mining business model.</p>



<p>TeraWulf plans to file a detailed report with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its agreement with Bitmain, providing further information about the partnership and the acquisition of the S19j XP mining machines.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Telegram sees over 2.5 million new daily users and surpasses 800 million monthly active users.</em></li>



<li><em>Telegram issues $270 million worth of bonds for continued growth, with CEO Pavel Durov personally investing.</em></li>



<li><em>Durov confirms ownership of Toncoin and previous investment in Bitcoin, showing dedication to the crypto space.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Telegram founder Pavel Durov took to his personal Telegram channel on July 18 to reveal some significant milestones and financial updates regarding the popular messaging app. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1201.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="499" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1201-1024x499.png" alt="Telegram Founder Reveals New Investments In Toncoin, TON Increases Over 5%" class="wp-image-203706" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1201-1024x499.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1201-300x146.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1201-768x374.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1201-750x366.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1201-1140x556.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1201.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Telegram Founder Reveals New Investments In Toncoin, TON Increases Over 5% 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Durov <a href="https://t.me/durov/215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that more than 2.5 million new users are registering for <a href="https://coincu.com/183210-telegram-users-exchange-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Telegram</a> each day, contributing to the platform&#8217;s impressive growth. Earlier this year, the app surpassed 800 million monthly active users, a testament to its increasing popularity.</p>



<p>While Durov expressed gratitude for this massive growth, he acknowledged the associated higher expenses on storage and traffic required to serve such a vast user base. However, he reassured users that Telegram is highly efficient in managing expenses and had a successful start with monetization efforts in the previous year. Although Telegram is not yet profitable, Durov emphasized that it is closer to profitability in absolute numbers compared to its competitors like Twitter and Snap.</p>



<p>To fund the app&#8217;s continued growth until it reaches the break-even point, the company issued approximately $270 million worth of Telegram bonds this week, building upon its existing bonds.</p>

<p>Durov also confirmed that he owns Toncoin, the cryptocurrency adopted by Telegram. Durov personally invested in the company by purchasing a quarter of these new bonds, demonstrating his commitment to growth. He highlighted that this investment is in addition to the significant amount he has already spent over the last decade to keep the app operational. Following his statement, the price of Toncoin experienced an over 5% <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/toncoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase</a> from $1.34 to $1.34.</p>



<p>Addressing suggestions that he could have made personal acquisitions such as a house or a jet, Durov emphasized his dedication to his work and the platform. He stated his preference for staying focused on his mission without &#8220;owning&#8221; material possessions aside from Telegram, some Bitcoin, and Toncoin.</p>

<p>Durov had previously disclosed his ownership of Bitcoin, having purchased 2,000 Bitcoins for approximately $1.5 million a decade ago. Considering the current prices, this investment would now be valued at around $60 million.</p>



<p>While the article primarily focuses on Pavel Durov&#8217;s announcements and his personal investments, it is important to note that TON (The Open Network), an initial project by the team, aimed to create a decentralized computer network based on blockchain technology. Although the app withdrew from the TON project in 2020 due to legal disputes, the TON technology and vision continue to influence the development of blockchain and decentralized networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Dune introduces new features aimed at enhancing collaboration and data accessibility.</em></li>



<li><em>The features include Folders for organizing team content, Data Uploads to integrate off-chain data, Dashboard and Query Scheduler for up-to-date data delivery, and Query API Endpoints for programmatically managing queries.</em></li>



<li><em>Its goal is to revolutionize how professional teams work with crypto data, streamlining collaboration, automating tasks, and maximizing insights. Additional teams-focused features and support resources are planned for the future.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dune, a crypto data platform, has <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAnalytics/status/1681287918868987905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the launch of several new features aimed at improving collaboration and user experience. </strong></h5>



<p>These features include Folders, Data Uploads, Dashboard and Query Scheduler, and Query API Endpoints, all designed to streamline data workstreams and foster seamless collaboration among teams.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1200.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1200.png" alt="Dune Unleashes New Features For Enhanced Collaboration And Data Accessibility" class="wp-image-203702" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1200.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1200-300x188.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1200-768x480.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1200-750x469.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Dune Unleashes New Features For Enhanced Collaboration And Data Accessibility 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>One of the key additions is the Folders feature, which allows teams to organize their queries and dashboards in a structured manner. Previously, content was presented as a flat list, posing challenges for teams with extensive content repositories. Folders are private and can only be accessed by team members, ensuring privacy for collaboration while still allowing external visitors to access a team&#8217;s public content. The number of folders available varies based on the plan, with Plus teams having the ability to create up to ten folders and Premium teams up to fifty.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197-1024x576.png" alt="Dune Unleashes New Features For Enhanced Collaboration And Data Accessibility" class="wp-image-203699" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1197.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Dune Unleashes New Features For Enhanced Collaboration And Data Accessibility 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Data Uploads feature enables users to integrate off-chain data with Dune&#8217;s existing data catalog. By sending static files like CSVs to Dune, users can create queryable tables and enhance their data analysis. This integration opens up new possibilities for analysts to add rich context to their crypto data analytics and analyze insights within the broader macro trends and events. It brings forth a new wave of data innovation and expands the capabilities of Dune&#8217;s community of creators.</p>



<p>The Dashboard and Query Scheduler empowers users to schedule queries and dashboards to run periodically, providing them with the most up-to-date data as per their business needs. This flexibility allows users to save time by automating regular query updates on dashboards, enabling more sophisticated analysis. Users can estimate the credits consumed with each refresh and have control over the frequency of data updates.</p>



<p>For Plus and Premium teams, the Query API Endpoints feature enables the creation, reading, updating, and archiving of queries programmatically outside of the Dune IDE.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The debate over approving a new Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US continues, with proponents arguing it would attract over $50 billion in demand.</em></li>



<li><em>Skeptics question the necessity of a US spot ETF, as investors have already had access to exchange-traded Bitcoin products for years.</em></li>



<li><em>The outcome of the discussion could shape the mainstream adoption of BTC and impact the future of the crypto industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/bitcoin-btc-etf-hype-over-blackrock-fidelity-threatens-a-letdown#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the discussion around the approval of a new Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has intensified, with proponents and skeptics presenting contrasting arguments.</strong></h5>

<p>Advocates of a US spot ETF believe it would attract a significant influx of investors, potentially generating over $50 billion in demand. This optimism was reignited by recent applications from <a href="https://coincu.com/197722-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-bid-could-ignite-15t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>, leading to a 20% rally in Bitcoin since mid-June.</p>



<p>On the other side of the debate, skeptics argue that a US spot fund may not be a game-changer. They point out that investors who wanted exposure to exchange-traded Bitcoin products with functionalities similar to spot trackers have already had access to them for over two years, albeit imperfectly. The initial excitement surrounding the debut of the first US Bitcoin futures-backed ETFs in October 2021 quickly fizzled out, with limited subsequent inflows.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/202307-jpmorgan-chase-loses-1-1-billion-in-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JPMorgan</a> has weighed in, stating that the approval of a US spot Bitcoin ETF would not have a transformative impact on the sector. They draw on the experiences of Canada and Europe, where such products have existed for years without significant investor interest or inflows. Bloomberg Intelligence offers a different perspective, highlighting that demand in the US, with its larger ETF market and wider usage, could be stronger compared to Canada and Europe.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1195-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1195-1024x576.png" alt="Bitcoin ETF May Not Bring The New Hype As The Sector Expects" class="wp-image-203693" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1195-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1195-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1195-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1195-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1195-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1195.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin ETF May Not Bring The New Hype As The Sector Expects 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence estimate that if crypto exchange-traded products accounted for 1% of all Canadian ETF assets, a similar trend in the US would suggest a potential asset value of approximately $54 billion. This context is significant considering the $137 billion currently held in US commodity ETFs.</p>



<p>The anticipation for a US spot Bitcoin ETF has generated substantial excitement. Supporters argue that its approval would not only make Bitcoin investment more accessible but also demonstrate the industry&#8217;s integration into the mainstream. Even former crypto skeptic Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has <a href="https://coincu.com/202966-blackrock-ceo-makes-bold-prediction-for-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> Bitcoin&#8217;s potential as a diversification tool.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin has been hovering around $29,880, just above a one-month low. Economic data confirming the continued growth of the US economy and the near certainty of another Federal Reserve rate hike next week have impacted market sentiment.</p>

<p>What little uncertainty there was about the outcome of the Fed&#8217;s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting next week has been largely removed, with traders now pricing in a 97.3% likelihood of another 25 basis point rate rise, according to the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CME FedWatch Tool</a>.</p>



<p>Although the debate continues, the final decision on approving a US spot Bitcoin ETF lies with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The outcome will shape the future landscape of Bitcoin investment and potentially have broader implications for the crypto industry&#8217;s mainstream adoption.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/vc-firm-coinfund-raises-158-million-to-back-crypto-startups#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, Web3 investment firm CoinFund has successfully raised $158 million for its fourth seed fund, surpassing its initial target of $125 million.</strong></h5>

<p>CoinFund CEO Jake Brukhman revealed that the firm received more interest than expected, leading to a higher fundraising amount. The investment focus will be on early-stage crypto startups operating at the intersection of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>While global venture capital investments in crypto startups have experienced a decline for five consecutive quarters, CoinFund&#8217;s substantial raise demonstrates that some venture capitalists remain optimistic about the potential of blockchain technology. The company&#8217;s ability to raise $550 million over the past year and a half, despite industry challenges, highlights its resilience and investor confidence.</p>



<p>The latest seed fund builds on CoinFund&#8217;s previous successful investments in companies like <a href="https://coincu.com/202245-dapper-labs-laid-off-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dapper Labs</a>, the creator of the <a href="https://coincu.com/184094-nba-top-shot-apple-store-google-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA Top Shot</a> non-fungible token (NFT) collection, and Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure provider. The company has already made investments in Giza, a startup aiming to integrate artificial intelligence into smart contracts, and Superstate Inc., which plans to combine decentralized finance with mutual funds.</p>



<p>With the raised funds, CoinFund will specifically target crypto and AI startups. While some areas of the crypto market, such as NFTs, have experienced a slowdown, the company sees potential in the convergence of crypto and AI. The firm recognizes the regulatory uncertainties surrounding crypto tokens and their classification as securities. However, as a registered investment advisor, it is well-positioned to navigate the regulatory landscape and make security investments as necessary.</p>

<p>Approximately 90% of CoinFund&#8217;s deals involve tokens, and the firm remains optimistic about the industry&#8217;s potential to merge with traditional finance in a regulated manner. The company aims to bridge the gap between the crypto space and traditional finance rather than creating a parallel universe.</p>



<p>The successful raise of $158 million signifies continued investor interest in early-stage crypto startups, and its strategic focus on the intersection of crypto and AI positions them to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the evolving digital landscape.</p>



<p>Binance Labs and CoinFund have co-led a $10 million fundraising round for Neutron, a cross-chain smart contract platform focusing on interchain security in the Cosmos ecosystem, as Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/197135-binance-labs-and-coinfund-fuel-cosmos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</p>

<p>This marks a remarkable 34.5% increase since the launch of StarkNet&#8217;s mainnet v0.12.0 on July 12. In addition, StarkNet has achieved a record-breaking daily average Transactions Per Second (TPS) of 3.29. The introduction of v0.12.0 has also led to substantial reductions in latency and transaction time, improving the overall efficiency of the network.</p>



<p>The latest version represents a significant step forward in the development of Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum.

<p>As reported by CoinGecko, in the second quarter of 2023, <a href="https://coincu.com/201909-senior-security-engineer-charged-with-9m/">decentralized exchanges</a> (DEX) saw a decline in spot trading volumes, which totaled $155 billion, down by 30.8% compared to the first quarter. Despite this decline, Uniswap maintained its position as the largest DEX, holding a dominant market share of 70% in May.</p>



<p>The Q2 report reflects the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, with shifts in trading volumes and market share among both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Regulatory pressures and changing market conditions played a significant role in shaping the landscape during this period.</p>



<p>As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to observe how market dynamics and regulatory developments impact trading volumes and the dominance of key players in the cryptocurrency exchange sector.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67570049/1/hood-v-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> in the United States District Court of Nevada on July 8, accuses CEO Fred Thiel and other top executives of breaching fiduciary duties, engaging in unjust enrichment, and wasting corporate assets.</p>



<p>The shareholder complaint outlines five claims against Thiel and nine other Marathon executives, including violations of the US Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, and corporate asset mismanagement. The plaintiffs seek retribution for alleged wrongful acts that led to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint against the company. However, they have left the determination of specific compensation amounts to the court.</p>



<p>Beyond seeking restitution, the shareholders also aim to address governance issues within Marathon Digital. Their proposals include strengthening Board supervision, nominating shareholder candidates for the Board, and reforming the process for electing directors.</p>



<p>The legal team representing the shareholders asserts that Marathon&#8217;s management has downplayed challenges, inflated the company&#8217;s valuation, received excessive compensation, engaged in insider sales, and obtained unwarranted bonuses based on misleading statements.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/192527-marathon-digital-purchases-shares-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Digital</a> has previously come under <a href="https://coincu.com/186635-marathon-digital-holdings-new-subpoena-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC scrutiny</a>. In May, the company received a subpoena related to transactions with related parties during the establishment of a mining facility in Montana. The SEC had previously ordered Marathon to provide documents and communications concerning the same facility.</p>

<p>Despite these legal hurdles, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel expressed optimism in May about the company&#8217;s strategy to reduce its net loss. The goal was to decrease the net loss from $12.9 million ($0.12 per share) in Q1 2022 to $7.2 million ($0.05 per share) in the current year.</p>



<p>To tackle its debt, Marathon made significant progress by paying off a term loan with <a href="https://coincu.com/149594-silvergate-requested-by-us-senators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silvergate Bank</a> in March. This move enabled the release of 3,132 Bitcoins held as collateral, effectively eliminating $50 million in debt and reducing annual borrowing costs by $5 million.</p>



<p>Marathon&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings have been on the rise, <a href="https://coincu.com/200620-marathon-digital-holdings-sells-700-btc-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">totaling</a> 12,538 BTC as of July 1. Despite a decrease in production and transaction fees, the company managed to produce 979 Bitcoins in June, emphasizing energy efficiency through the use of S19 XPs.</p>



<p>In addition to legal challenges and operational updates, Marathon Digital <a href="https://coincu.com/195572-marathon-digital-issued-a-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a warning about fraudulent activities. The company clarified that it does not provide accounts for individual investors to participate in cryptocurrency mining, nor does it accept funds from such investors. Marathon is aware of counterfeit websites, applications, and individuals impersonating company personnel. They are also vigilant about counterfeit stock certificates being sold in other languages, particularly in Russia and potentially other international markets.</p>

<p>Marathon Digital Holdings faces a complex period due to legal disputes with shareholders, regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, and the prevalence of fraudulent activities. These factors will significantly impact the company&#8217;s future trajectory as it navigates the competitive landscape of the cryptocurrency mining industry.</p>
