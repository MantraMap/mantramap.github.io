			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent Messari report reveals Ripple&rsquo;s XRP surged by over 55% in Q1 2023, outperforming the overall cryptocurrency market. </p>
<p>According to a report by Messari, Ripple&rsquo;s XRP outpaced the overall crypto market in Q1 2023, having grown by over 55% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Messari revealed XRP&rsquo;s market capitalization increased from $17.4 billion on January 1 to an impressive $27.4 billion on March 31, representing a Q1 surge of 59.9%. While XRP&rsquo;s market cap grew by 59.9%, its price surged by 55% during the first quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall cryptocurrency market only observed an increase of 46% during the same period.</p>
<p>XRP started the year at $0.35 but gained immensely during a market-wide rally to reach a high of $0.43 on January 23. The asset&rsquo;s price, however, faced resistance at this price and ended January with an increase of 19.71%.</p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s native token, however, declined in February to a price of $0.36 but closed the month off at $0.37. XRP witnessed a decline of 7.27% during February.</p>
XRP Moved in March
<p>XRP moved with strong bullish momentum during March, registering an overnight growth of 20% on March 22. Ripple&rsquo;s XRP was on its way to hitting its very bullish target of $0.50 but ultimately fell short, reaching a high of $0.49.</p>
<p>The asset gained on the back of the US banking crisis and anticipation of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The price further grew as speculation circulated that Ripple&rsquo;s case with the SEC would soon come to an end.</p>
<p>XRP was on track to end March with a bang when it soared to a 10-month high of $0.58 on March 29, having witnessed a solo run of 56% in just two weeks. The asset fought off a few bearish attacks to close March at $0.54. March&rsquo;s rally saw XRP gain 43%, ending the first quarter with a price increase of 55%. Against the backdrop of its stunning Q1 growth, Ripple reported that it sold over $361 million worth of XRP tokens during the first three months of 2023.</p>
<p>Q2 has not proved too profitable for XRP yet, which, at the time of writing, exchanged hands at $0.46.</p>
Things Are Looking Up for Ripple
<p>Ripple had a victory this week in its ongoing legal battle against the SEC. A court denied the SEC&rsquo;s request to seal documents related to former SEC official William Hinman&rsquo;s statements about Ether. Hinman, the former director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Corporate Finance, delivered a prudent speech in 2018, suggesting that Ether was not a security.</p>
<p>Hinman&rsquo;s statements are significant to the case as they provide a precedent for a digital asset like XRP.</p>
<p>Ripple further announced it made a $250 million acquisition of Metaco &ndash; a well-known crypto custodian. Seen as a positive sign for the future of both Ripple and Metaco, the move sees Ripple take on sole responsibility at Metaco while still allowing current CEO Adrien Traccani to manage operations independently. Traccani has been instrumental in getting Metaco where it is now.</p>
<p>Customers would benefit significantly from this deal, says Monica Long, the President of Ripple:</p>

<p>Adding these capabilities to Ripple&rsquo;s already growing product solutions means we can continue to support customers as they look to embrace the true potential of crypto and blockchain in real-world applications.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/05/uwerxwerx-and-arbitrumarb-are-two-cryptocurrencies-that-could-kickstart-a-bull-run</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bull markets are the most exciting times in the market, and precedent shows that a single cryptocurrency is capable of starting a bull market. The last 2021 bull market was a run that started with Dogecoin(DOGE), and the market never looked back until it touched the $3 trillion market cap. Some mini-runs we&rsquo;ve seen during this bear market have also been inspired by top-gaining cryptocurrencies for the short term.</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) is an honorable mention regarding market excitement, especially following the token airdrop, which caused a small price run-up for other cryptocurrencies. However, there&rsquo;s an even better play in the market at the moment, and you better get in early on Uwerx.</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) Causing Market Excitement</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) is one of the earliest Ethereum layer-2 solutions in the crypto market, launched in August 2021. So when the network announced last year that it would run an airdrop, there was increased activity on the network with users trying to secure airdrop allocations.</p>
<p>The airdrop eventually came in March 2023 and was allocated to early users on the network. The minimum 625 ARB allocation was worth well over $800 at launch, and the maximum allocation of 10,200 ARB was enough to cause market excitement. The market saw high trading volume in the days that followed, and today, Arbitrum turnovers higher daily volume than networks like Avalanche(AVAX), Shiba Inu(SHIB), Tron(TRX), Polkadot(DOT), and even Polygon(MATIC).</p>
<p>However, this traction does not compare to the new excitement Uwerx is creating.</p>
<p>Can Uwerx(WERX) Kickstart A Bull Run?</p>
<p>Uwerx is bringing some new excitement to the market with its presale token backed with great utility. One of the major signs of a bull market is we begin to see money from other industries come into crypto. In this case, Uwerx is merging the global gig economy with the crypto market. But what exactly does Uwerx do?</p>
<p>Uwerx is an emerging blockchain-based freelance platform that aims to use the resources available on blockchain to create a better platform for independent workers. Uwerx&rsquo;s new platform will feature many unique features, but more importantly, it prioritizes giving back more value to its users.</p>
<p>Contrary to predominant freelance platforms, Uwerx will likewise operate a decentralized platform to connect independent workers to jobs, clients, and businesses. Uwerx will include features including transparent pricing, incentivization, personalized matching, and several built-in tools to foster effective work contracts for freelancers. The native token WERX will serve as a massive store of value for the platform and will be the primary currency of the platform. However, Uwerx will also allow users to process payments with other cryptocurrencies, solving one of the biggest payment limitations in the industry.</p>
<p>Uwerx is primed for a run after presale, and early buyers on presale get in at a very low price. At a $0.0225 presale price, early buyers have a potential 10,000% profit to look forward to. In the worst-case scenario, the final presale price is around $0.095 - $0.115, which is some decent 10x profit for early buyers even before launch; don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Amid whispers and speculation, the cryptocurrency world is abuzz with rumours of an impending revolution as Tradecurve's (TCRV) presale quietly emerges as a potential game-changer, silently toppling the giants of the industry such as XRP (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its innovative approach, Tradecurve (TCRV) is positioning itself as a force to be reckoned with, stirring excitement among investors and enthusiasts alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article will uncover the newest developments in XRP (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT) and analyse why Tradecurve (TCRV) is the ultimate pick for crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>XRP (XRP) Shows Strong Performance with 1.48% Rise: Revisits $0.46 Threshold</p>
<p>In the realm of digital assets, XRP (XRP) displayed an upward trajectory on Wednesday, registering a noteworthy ascent of 1.48%. Building upon a previous gain of 3.37% the day before, XRP (XRP) concluded the trading session at $0.44825. A remarkable event unfolded as XRP (XRP) revisited the $0.46 mark, marking its return after a hiatus of ten sessions.</p>
<p>The day commenced on an optimistic note as XRP surged to an early morning peak of $0.46138. Demonstrating resilience, XRP (XRP) successfully breached both the First Major Resistance Level (R1) at $0.4500 and the Second Major Resistance Level (R2) at $0.4583. However, a subsequent reversal compelled XRP (XRP) to dip to an early afternoon nadir of $0.43765. Skillfully evading the potential downturn indicated by the First Major Support Level (S1) at $0.4261, XRP (XRP) swiftly rebounded, concluding the day at $0.44825.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) Faces Steep Decline, Approaches Critical Support Level of $5.30</p>
<p>Since its peak at around $7.8 per coin earlier this year, Polkadot (DOT) has experienced a rapid decline, finding itself in a downward spiral. Currently, the native DOT token teeters perilously close to a crucial support level, around $5.30, as renewed selling pressure continues to mount. The predictable nature of this sell-off can be attributed to Polkadot's (DOT) operation within an intensely competitive domain of the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>A standout characteristic of Polkadot (DOT) lies in its unique ability to foster interoperability among diverse blockchains. This revolutionary feature facilitates seamless communication, data sharing, and the execution of smart contracts.</p>
<p>A remarkable bridge is created by employing a relay chain, which bridges the gap between disparate blockchains, enabling them to collaborate and coexist harmoniously. By transcending the boundaries of individual blockchains, Polkadot (DOT) paves the way for a new era of interconnected decentralised systems.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Presale Alert: Tradecurve (TCRV) Introduces Game-Changing Trading Platform at $0.01</p>
<p>Tradecurve is set to revolutionise the trading landscape by offering a cutting-edge platform that provides users complete anonymity while trading. With the launch on the horizon, Tradecurve (TCRV) is currently in stage 2 of the presale, generating excitement among potential investors. The initial token price is set at $0.01, presenting a promising opportunity for early participants.</p>
<p>Tradecurve will introduce automated trading and leverage the power of artificial intelligence, granting users access to a diverse array of algorithmic and AI-based trading systems. By incorporating these advanced technologies, Tradecurve (TCRV) aims to extend financial inclusion to millions of individuals, making trading applications accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) also addresses security concerns by implementing enhanced security measures, ensuring the protection of user assets, and significantly reducing trading costs. Moreover, Tradecurve (TCRV) offers a comprehensive range of trading tools and educational resources to empower users with knowledge and insights for successful trading strategies.</p>
<p>With a unique blend of centralised and decentralised exchange features, Tradecurve (TCRV) aims to create a seamless trading experience that combines the best elements of both approaches, fostering a dynamic and efficient trading environment for all users.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office has slapped a $4.3 million fine on the crypto exchange Coin Cafe due to its allegedly outrageous fee structure.&nbsp;</p>
NY AG Fines Coin Cafe
<p>The New York-based popular cryptocurrency platform has been allegedly charging its users exorbitant fees for using the platform. As a result, it has been ordered to hand over a total of $4.3 million in retribution and fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, noted that</p>

<p>&ldquo;The company was charging investors exorbitant and undisclosed fees to use its wallet storage, despite marketing its wallet storage as &lsquo;free&rsquo; on its website.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the exchange has also been accused of not disclosing the fee structure and draining out entire customer funds.&nbsp;</p>
Fee Restructuring Drains Customer Funds
<p>The matter was first uncovered when multiple customers raised concerns about depleting funds from their Coin Cafe accounts. These allegations against the firm led to an investigation into the company&rsquo;s business practices and fee transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that the firm had initially onboarded clients advertising its crypto wallet as a free product. However, since September 2022, the company changed its fee structure multiple times and surreptitiously added fees without informing customers, which resulted in charges of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in October 2022, Coin Cafe implemented a policy where users who did not engage in cryptocurrency transactions within a 30-day period were subject to a charge of either 7.99% or $99 per month, whichever amount was higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Attorney General&rsquo;s office claimed that the exchange misled its customers and violated consumer protection regulations by failing to disclose these additional charges.&nbsp;</p>
The Settlement Agreement&nbsp;
<p>As a consequence of the investigation, Coin Cafe has had to surrender $4.3 million, which includes restitution of $508,000 to 340 individuals and an additional penalty to the state of New York. Additionally, as part of the settlement agreement, Coin Cafe is obliged to provide refunds to U.S.-based investors who request reimbursement within the upcoming year. By May 23, Coin Cafe must send email notifications to all U.S.-based customers, informing them of their eligibility for a refund.</p>
<p>Finally, The cryptocurrency exchange has also committed to implementing comprehensive changes to its fee structure and ensuring transparency in its operations going forward.</p>
Need For Transparency?&nbsp;
<p>The Attorney General has claimed that the incident highlights the need for increased regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency sector, especially regarding fee structures and consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the company had successfully obtained the state&rsquo;s BitLicense in 2023, it had not officially registered with the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office, which is a requirement for companies dealing with crypto trading in the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, the fact that the company continued to overcharge customers even after obtaining the BitLicense indicates that unfair practices can be conducted right under the nose of the regulatory bodies.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Revolut, Britain's most valuable fintech company, could face disappointment as the Bank of England plans to reject its application for a banking licence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority, responsible for licensing, has informed the government of its intention to issue a statutory warning notice to Revolut, citing concerns over the company's balance sheet. Revolut contends that auditors' concerns were related to revenues, not the balance sheet.</p>
<p>According to a report in the UK Telegraph, the warning notice has not been served yet and urgent talks are underway behind the scenes in an effort to salvage the licence application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revolut, an app offering many financial services, has expanded globally, making it one of the world's most valuable fintech firms and Britain's most valuable tech start-up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite already holding a Lithuanian banking licence, securing approval from the Bank of England has been seen as a crucial stepping stone for Revolut to expand into other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Revolut had expressed confidence in obtaining a UK licence, but recent challenges have cast doubt on its prospects. The company's auditors, BDO, raised concerns about the &ldquo;completeness and occurrence&rdquo; of revenues amounting to &pound;477 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CEO Nik Storonsky voiced frustration with British regulators, citing long wait times for communication and an overly bureaucratic regulatory environment, suggesting that the company may be more inclined to go public in the US rather than the UK.</p>
Opinion
<p>The on-going saga of Revolut and of several other crypto-related companies wishing to receive licences in the UK appears to have no end. The UK is an incredibly conservative nation with traditional banking etched into its genes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very well for the government, or at least parts of it, to say that the UK wants to become a global hub for crypto. Many pro-crypto utterances and promises appear to be made in the political and international spheres, but the UK will have to contend with its deeply embedded banking industry, which has much power and influence over regulators and in the country&rsquo;s parliament.</p>
<p>The US also has massive influence in the UK, and its very harsh treatment of crypto is likely to be accompanied by much lobbying of the British government for it to go back on many of the pro-crypto promises it has made so far.</p>
<p>However, with Brexit forcing the UK to look for new markets, it still has a great opportunity to land a big chunk of crypto business and become the premier safe harbour for digital assets in Europe. The internal battle over crypto legitimacy in the UK will be very interesting to witness.</p>]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hashkey Group, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency investment landscape, is embarking on an ambitious funding drive for a valuation of $1 billion.&nbsp;</p>
Hashkey attempts to secure large funding
<p>According to Bloomberg, sources familiar with the matter have disclosed that Hashkey is currently engaged in preliminary discussions to secure a substantial funding round ranging from $100 million to $200 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the deal is steadily progressing, the specific details, including size and valuation, are yet to be finalised and remain subject to potential adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a diversified portfolio spanning venture funding, asset management, and trading, Hashkey is among the many local firms striving to expand their customer base within Hong Kong's rapidly liberalising environment.&nbsp;</p>
Hong Kong - a new financial hub
<p>The government of Hong Kong has been diligently fostering the development of the digital asset sector as part of a broader endeavour to restore the city's reputation as a pioneering financial hub. As part of these efforts, the city is poised to enable retail trading of major cryptocurrencies on licensed exchanges like Hashkey, ultimately rejuvenating the local economy and reversing the previous talent exodus triggered by Covid-related restrictions.</p>
<p>At present, Hashkey and BC Technology Group Co.'s OSL bourse are the sole licensed operators in the field. However, prominent exchanges such as OKX and Bitget have expressed their intent to seek licensure under Hong Kong's new regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s new found commitment to crypto businesses running out of the islands perhaps stems from the Chinese government&rsquo;s rethinking of its strategy towards crypto. It might appear that China will use Hong Kong as a ring fenced testing ground for cryptocurrency technology, while keeping crypto out of the Chinese mainland, at least for now.</p>
<p>From next month, Hong Kong will initiate its new licensing regime which will allow retail investors to trade certain major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an apparent hardening of its stance against crypto, Pakistan&rsquo;s government has stated that it would ban cryptocurrency services operational in the country and would never legalize crypto trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banning crypto was one of the requirements put forward by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).&nbsp;</p>
A Fresh Ban&nbsp;
<p>The announcement was made by Aisha Ghaus Pasha, the Minister of State for Finance and Revenue, during a session of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue on the 16th of May. The minister added that banning cryptocurrencies and crypto services operating in the country was one of the conditions set by the Financial Action Task Force. The task force had only recently removed Pakistan from its gray list. FATF&rsquo;s gray list consists of countries that the body considers lacking when it comes to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. However, these countries are viewed as working to ensure compliance and remedy their issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several other officials, such as State Bank of Pakistan Director Sohain Jawad, extended their support to the decision. According to reports, the State Bank of Pakistan and the Technology Ministry were working together to draft the ban legislation. While the Financial Action Task Force cannot impose any sanctions, its findings could influence government and corporate policies globally. In 2022, the State Bank of Pakistan announced that it planned to ban crypto. This was the first clear position the bank had taken on the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other banks have started reaching out to customers, informing them that cryptocurrency trading is illegal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As per regulatory instructions from the State Bank of Pakistan(SBP), any remittance of foreign exchange directly/indirectly outside Pakistan to overseas foreign exchange trading, margin trading, and CFD trading apps/websites/platforms through any payment channel is not allowed/permitted by SBP, and such payments are inherently risky and illegal.&rdquo;</p>

Crypto Community Voices Disapproval&nbsp;
<p>The Pakistani economy is facing an unprecedented crisis, with the government engaged in tense negotiations to secure a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As a result, FATF compliance when it comes to crypto becomes something of a necessity. However, the crypto community in the country criticized the move to announce a crypto ban. One handle stated that the government officials were destroying the country in the name of the FATF and the International Monetary Fund. Another user summed up his disapproval, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray that government focuses on the right area, which leads to scams and the apps which trap people, instead of banning crypto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another user going by the name of Crypto Arena added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People are making handsome income with crypto trading, and Govt wants to take this last hope from the Poor People of Pakistan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ban comes at a time of political turmoil as well, with former Prime Minister Imran Khan locked in a tense standoff with police in Lahore.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Adoption As Hedge Remains High&nbsp;
<p>Pakistani newspaper Dawn had reported that despite banks formally warning customers against using their debit and credit cards for crypto trading, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular in the country. According to Zeeshan Ahmed, the country general manager at Rain Financial, the annual volume of cryptocurrency trading has only gone up, rising to $25 billion from $18 billion just a year ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political turmoil and economic uncertainty has seen many Pakistanis convert their salaries into stablecoins to utilize as a hedge. Pakistan&rsquo;s Rupee has slid to an all-time low of 300 against the USD. Chairman of KTrade Securities and CEO of BlockTech Pakistan, Ali Farid Khwaja, stated that the population is worried about a sovereign default since the government has failed to secure support from the International Monetary Fund.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect that many people are buying USDT on crypto platforms as a way to get exposure to the US dollar. Even Bitcoin has performed well against the Pakistani Rupee. During the crypto run, reportedly more than 20 million Pakistanis had opened accounts on crypto platforms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s currency has fallen over 55% against the dollar over the past year, and stablecoins have emerged as a convenient way to access the US dollar for a majority of the population.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sister entity Alameda Research have sued their former executives Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh.</p>
<p>The new management at FTX alleges that its former executives mismanaged funds and failed to conduct proper due diligence before acquiring Embed.</p>
FTX Moves To Claw Back Funds
<p>The move is part of a series of lawsuits filed by FTX&rsquo;s new leadership as they look to recover around $240 million connected to FTX&rsquo;s acquisition of stock trading platform Embed Financial Technologies. Embed closed weeks before FTX filed for bankruptcy. The move is viewed as the first formal action by current FTX CEO John Ray against the company&rsquo;s former management and executives. The plaintiffs in the suits filed include FTX, its sister hedge fund Alameda Research, and West Realm Shires (WRS) Inc. The latter is the corporate entity under which FTX US operated as a cryptocurrency trading company.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, aiming to retrieve the funds spent during the acquisition.</p>
Details Of The Lawsuit
<p>According to documents filed with the court, FTX, Alameda Research, and West Realm Shires have accused former management of taking advantage of lax controls and a lack of recordkeeping and inflating the value of Embed. The papers further state that the management went on to purchase the platform for far more than it was worth. Furthermore, the lawsuit states that the defendants, addressed as &ldquo;FTX Insiders&rdquo; in the lawsuit, failed to conduct any sort of due diligence on Embed, instead prioritizing speed over all else in the transaction.</p>
<p>As a result, they ended up accepting all the terms set by Embed Founder and CEO Michael Giles during the negotiations. The lawsuit further added that Giles walked away from the negotiations after securing a deal worth around $157 million and an &ldquo;extravagant and unwarranted retention bonus&rdquo; as an incentive to wrap up the deal as quickly as possible. Negotiations with Giles began at the end of March 2022, with both parties signing a &ldquo;Memorandum of Terms&rdquo; by mid-April 2022. This gave the platform an enterprise value of $220 million, with a $75 million retention bonus to employees. This figure included the $55 million paid to Giles.</p>
<p>The deal was finalized a few weeks before FTX went bankrupt, with the group of FTX Insiders spending $248 million to acquire the company. The lawsuits allege that while the deal was concluded in six months, all essential terms were agreed upon in just a couple of weeks. The suit also pointed to the fact that the then-president of FTX had encountered several bugs in the Embed platform before concluding the deal, with even Giles admitting that the platform was facing multiple issues every day. The lawsuit further added that even Embed insiders were surprised that FTX was paying such a large amount for the company after just one meeting with Giles.</p>
FTX Hopes To Recover $250 Million
<p>The plaintiffs also accused Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh of causing the entity to issue Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs). These could be converted into common stocks in the event of the entity filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. FTX is hoping to revoke the SAFEs and recover all the funds that the company spent during the Embed acquisition. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have also asked the court to issue directives to the defendants to bear all legal costs related to the lawsuit.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sister entity Alameda Research have sued their former executives Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh.</p>
<p>The new management at FTX alleges that its former executives mismanaged funds and failed to conduct proper due diligence before acquiring Embed.</p>
FTX Moves To Claw Back Funds
<p>The move is part of a series of lawsuits filed by FTX&rsquo;s new leadership as they look to recover around $240 million connected to FTX&rsquo;s acquisition of stock trading platform Embed Financial Technologies. Embed closed weeks before FTX filed for bankruptcy. The move is viewed as the first formal action by current FTX CEO John Ray against the company&rsquo;s former management and executives. The plaintiffs in the suits filed include FTX, its sister hedge fund Alameda Research, and West Realm Shires (WRS) Inc. The latter is the corporate entity under which FTX US operated as a cryptocurrency trading company.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, aiming to retrieve the funds spent during the acquisition.</p>
Details Of The Lawsuit
<p>According to documents filed with the court, FTX, Alameda Research, and West Realm Shires have accused former management of taking advantage of lax controls and a lack of recordkeeping and inflating the value of Embed. The papers further state that the management went on to purchase the platform for far more than it was worth. Furthermore, the lawsuit states that the defendants, addressed as &ldquo;FTX Insiders&rdquo; in the lawsuit, failed to conduct any sort of due diligence on Embed, instead prioritizing speed over all else in the transaction.</p>
<p>As a result, they ended up accepting all the terms set by Embed Founder and CEO Michael Giles during the negotiations. The lawsuit further added that Giles walked away from the negotiations after securing a deal worth around $157 million and an &ldquo;extravagant and unwarranted retention bonus&rdquo; as an incentive to wrap up the deal as quickly as possible. Negotiations with Giles began at the end of March 2022, with both parties signing a &ldquo;Memorandum of Terms&rdquo; by mid-April 2022. This gave the platform an enterprise value of $220 million, with a $75 million retention bonus to employees. This figure included the $55 million paid to Giles.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Horizon Blockchain Games and Polygon Labs have announced a strategic partnership designed to revolutionize web3 infrastructure with an integration of Sequence, Horizon's comprehensive web3 developer platform, into Polygon Supernets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The collaboration is aimed at promoting scalability, security, and improved user experience within the platform. The introduction of Horizon's Sequence product into Polygon Supernets is poised to respond to and take care of the specific requirements and needs on an enterprise level, alongside providing tooling for decentralized application developers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sequence operates a web3 wallet and infrastructure stack, encouraging accelerated development on Polygon Supernets. The alliance offers credits to incentivize projects, which includes a toolkit composed of the Sequence Wallet, Token &amp; NFT APIs, Indexer, Relayer, Node Gateway, Marketplaces, and SDKs for projects aligning with Polygon Supernets, Polygon zkEVM, and Polygon PoS.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The partnership builds upon previous successes of Horizon and Polygon Labs collaborations. Past notable collaborations include SuperGaming&rsquo;s Tower Conquest, Cool Cats, BoomLand, Magic Eden, Sunflower Land, among others. Through this strategic alliance, developers and brands are being presented with a wide array of web3 tools with Sequence's all-in-one stack, aiming to augment the web3 development experience within the Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Adding to the portfolio of successful collaborations, Horizon and Polygon have already seen success with their web3 trading card game, Skyweaver. Developed on Polygon PoS for its scalability, environmental sustainability, and transaction speed, it was designed to provide an intuitive experience for its players, many of whom were new to web3. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Horizon is a long-standing collaborator in the Polygon ecosystem, and integrating their Sequence Wallet and developer stack into Polygon Supernets marks another significant stride in building web3 infrastructure on Polygon," shares Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon Labs.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Supernets</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Supernets, currently at its test version v0.9, represents a crucial development phase for the Polygon community. This version is a significant step towards the finasl release v1.0, reflecting the maturation of the product suite. It's important to bear in mind that this is a test release and may come with certain limitations, including breaking changes and lack of backward compatibility. While users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the new features, they should approach this version strictly as a test iteration.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Some of the key features in v0.9 are expanded allowlists and transaction blocklists, staking and token separation support, NFT bridge support, and enhanced transaction fee management. These additions bring the "Super networks" vision of Polygon Supernets a step closer to realization, introducing new core contracts and consensus client primitives. The MVP stage of the protocol now boasts expanded bridge transaction allowances, the introduction of MATIC staking, and support for different ERC tokens, among others.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Given the inherent risks associated with a test release, the Polygon team has undertaken a comprehensive source code audit to ensure the product's reliability and security. However, the final release version will undoubtedly carry more stability and an array of new features, bringing us one step closer to a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Notably, Horizon and Polygon Labs are also offering more support routes for brands and developers to penetrate the Web3 ecosystem. The provision of credits for projects developed on Polygon Supernets with Sequence further helps out aspiring developers who may just be starting out in the ecosystem. Horizon's all-in-one Sequence stack simplifies web3 development and content creation while enhancing user experience, making web3 technology more accessible.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On a wider scale, Polygon Labs, renowned for developing Ethereum scaling solutions for the Polygon protocols, has achieved notable milestones since its inception. As a testament to its impact, it has seen over 261 million unique addresses, 1.4 million smart contracts created, and 2.7 billion total transactions. Major web3 projects and corporations, such as Aave, Uniswap, Robinhood, and Stripe, have found a home in the existing Polygon network. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Cloud, the crypto exchange's cloud services arm, recently announced a partnership with Chainlink Network to expand its presence in the decentralized sphere.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As part of the collaboration, Coinbase Cloud will serve as a node operator, contributing its extensive experience and infrastructure to the Chainlink Network.

<p class="md-end-block md-p">To date, the Chainlink Network has been a key enabler of a significant amount of economic activity, with over $7T in transaction value facilitated and more than 7.4 billion data points delivered on-chain. The services offered by Chainlink are broad-ranging and include Price Feeds, VRF, Proof of Reserve, Automation, Functions, and CCIP. By deciding to join as a node operator, Coinbase Cloud is poised to contribute towards maintaining the security and reliability of these services provided by Chainlink.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Cloud is a secure and robust blockchain infrastructure platform that empowers developers with the necessary tools and services to create, deploy, and scale their blockchain applications. The platform offers a vast range of features. It provides staking services for individual investors, enterprises, and institutions, facilitating users to earn rewards for offering security and services to Proof of Stake networks. The platform's Wallet as a Service (WaaS) is a turnkey solution for building and managing secure crypto wallets, featuring essential components like key management, hot/cold storage, and multi-factor authentication. Developers also have access to the Coinbase Pay SDK, simplifying the integration of crypto payments into their applications and supporting a broad array of cryptocurrencies and payment methods.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Cloud also offers a scalable Node solution for running nodes on various blockchain networks, a crucial element for participation in these networks. It also includes Coinbase Commerce, a payment solution facilitating businesses to accept crypto payments, characterized by easy setup, fraud and chargeback protection, and reporting features. On the infrastructure side, Coinbase also operates Base, a comprehensive developer platform, grants developers access to Coinbase's APIs, documentation, and support, making it an invaluable resource for both seasoned developers and those just starting out with Coinbase Cloud. Backed by Coinbase's extensive expertise and experience in the blockchain sector, Coinbase Cloud serves as a robust platform for developing and deploying secure and dependable blockchain applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The crypto exchange's cloud services division will move to launch a Chainlink node to leverage its robust multi-region, multi-cloud infrastructure. It brings to the table its substantial background in managing blockchain data for high-throughput networks, including Aptos, Solana, Ethereum, Algorand, and Flow. This also means that such a collaboration will benefit from Coinbase Cloud's enterprise-grade security, which will help maintain the quality and reliability of the data provided.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Kai Zhao, Group Product Manager at Coinbase Cloud, shares:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"[through the process of] building decentralized Oracles, we are helping to create a more decentralized and trustworthy future for blockchain technology. We believe onchain is the next online, and we look forward to working with Chainlink to further this future."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Echoing the enthusiasm, William Reilly, Global Head of CeFi, Sales &amp; Strategy at Chainlink Labs, notes that Coinbase Cloud's "extensive experience, robust infrastructure, and commitment to security" are compelling factors that "make [Coinbase Cloud] an invaluable addition to the Chainlink ecosystem."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This partnership represents a substantial development in the Web3 and blockchain industry. With Coinbase Cloud's extensive infrastructure and Chainlink's oracle solution coming together, the provision of high-quality data for Web3 applications is set to improve. This move can be seen as part of a broader trend towards promoting further decentralization and enhancing the integrity of the blockchain industry. The two firms previously collaborated to work on an integration for off-chain feeds.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Cloud is a secure and robust blockchain infrastructure platform that empowers developers with the necessary tools and services to create, deploy, and scale their blockchain applications. The platform offers a vast range of features. It provides staking services for individual investors, enterprises, and institutions, facilitating users to earn rewards for offering security and services to Proof of Stake networks.

On the infrastructure side, Coinbase also operates Base, a comprehensive developer platform, grants developers access to Coinbase's APIs, documentation, and support, making it an invaluable resource for both seasoned developers and those just starting out with Coinbase Cloud. Backed by Coinbase's extensive expertise and experience in the blockchain sector, Coinbase Cloud serves as a robust platform for developing and deploying secure and dependable blockchain applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The crypto exchange's cloud services division will move to launch a Chainlink node to leverage its robust multi-region, multi-cloud infrastructure. It brings to the table its substantial background in managing blockchain data for high-throughput networks, including Aptos, Solana, Ethereum, Algorand, and Flow. This also means that such a collaboration will benefit from Coinbase Cloud's enterprise-grade security, which will help maintain the quality and reliability of the data provided.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Kai Zhao, Group Product Manager at Coinbase Cloud, shares:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"[through the process of] building decentralized Oracles, we are helping to create a more decentralized and trustworthy future for blockchain technology. We believe onchain is the next online, and we look forward to working with Chainlink to further this future."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Echoing the enthusiasm, William Reilly, Global Head of CeFi, Sales &amp; Strategy at Chainlink Labs, notes that Coinbase Cloud's "extensive experience, robust infrastructure, and commitment to security" are compelling factors that "make [Coinbase Cloud] an invaluable addition to the Chainlink ecosystem."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This partnership represents a substantial development in the Web3 and blockchain industry. With Coinbase Cloud's extensive infrastructure and Chainlink's oracle solution coming together, the provision of high-quality data for Web3 applications is set to improve. This move can be seen as part of a broader trend towards promoting further decentralization and enhancing the integrity of the blockchain industry. The two firms previously collaborated to work on an integration for off-chain feeds.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, staking has emerged as a compelling way to receive more tokens while securing the blockchain network. DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), Binance Coin (BNB), and Polkadot (DOT) are among the tokens that offer staking programs with enticing benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By actively participating in these programs, users have the opportunity to earn commissions on token purchases in MIYAGI, enjoy a 3.5% APY with BNB, and delve into the dynamic Polkadot staking system. These opportunities provide a pathway for users to engage with the crypto ecosystem and capitalize on the potential rewards of staking.</p>
<p>The New Presale Meme Coin Fostering Growth Through Referrals!</p>
<p>The DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI) team has recently unveiled their plans for an upcoming Token Referral Program&mdash;a new initiative aimed at rewarding community members for their active involvement. This captivating program allows users to connect their wallets and generate unique referral codes, which they can then share with friends, family, and digital acquaintances.</p>
<p>By using these codes, individuals can earn a generous 10% commission on every purchase of MIYAGI tokens, effectively acknowledging their contributions. This straightforward opportunity not only allows users to bolster their MIYAGI holdings but also plays a role in driving the overall success of the token's ecosystem.</p>
<p>BNB Offers Stakers a 3.5% APY!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supporting the Binance blockchain network with their staked BNB, users not only play a crucial role in fortifying the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network's security but also enjoy the benefits of a 3.5% APY. By loaning their tokens to the exchange, users enable the network to validate transactions tirelessly, fuel decentralized governance, and enhance overall robustness.</p>
<p>In return for their trust, stakers are handsomely rewarded with tokens, serving as an enticing incentive to keep their tokens staked for the long haul. The beauty of staking BNB lies in the myriad variations and possibilities it offers, each presenting a unique twist to this clever game.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discovering the Dynamic Realm of Polkadot</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT), a sophisticated NPoS blockchain, relies on these validators to verify transactions and safeguard its network. With a more distributed and decentralized network, the chances of successful attacks by hackers are greatly reduced!</p>
<p>DOT holders have a variety of ways to engage with the Polkadot staking system. Whether you join a nomination pool to share rewards and penalties, become a nominator to handpick reliable validators, or even run your own nomination pool with competent validators, the options are plenty. And if you simply want to stake your cryptocurrency and join in on the action, that's an option too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staking in the world of cryptocurrencies offers a great opportunity to unlock rewards and enhance holdings. DogeMiyagi, Binance Coin, and Polkadot stand out as tokens that provide enticing staking programs with unique benefits. By actively participating in these programs, users can earn an incredible selection of high-value commissions. These avenues not only allow users to capitalize on the potential rewards but also contribute to the growth and success of the respective ecosystems.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you a cat lover and a crypto enthusiast? Look no further than Big Eyes Coin (BIG) - the first and only cat-themed meme coin in the market, launched by the BIG team in late 2022. With its unique feline-inspired design and innovative features, Big Eyes Coin offers a perfect investment opportunity for those looking to join the cat crew and potentially earn a significant amount of money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Purrfect Opportunity for Cat Lovers</p>
<p>With big sparkling eyes, Big Eyes Coin hit the crypto presale market on 20th August 2022. The excitement surrounding its native currency, BIG, has been palpable in the crypto world for the past 8 months. To date, Big Eyes Coin has completed 12 stages of presale and raised more than $35.5 million. In the current 13th stage, a BIG token costs $0.00053, which is a remarkable increase of over 400% from its initial stage.</p>
<p>But the excitement doesn't stop there. The Big Eyes Coin team has recently issued Loot Boxes at varying affordable prices. These boxes contain BIG tokens worth up to $1 million and unique NFT cards that can be minted and traded. The distinctive feature of these loot boxes is that they are designed in a way not to cause any financial loss to the investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Big Eyes Coin presale is quickly approaching its end on June 3rd, the team has announced a 300% bonus to investors who use the END300 code, further enhancing the deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roadmap to Success&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, the project team made a BIG announcement revealing the launch date of the BIG tokens. According to that, the BIG tokens will be launched on the Uniswap crypto exchange platform on June 15. Additionally, the BIG team has plans to list the tokens on 13 other exchanges to increase the accessibility and visibility of the BIG tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Casino With 4000+ Games&nbsp;</p>
<p>To drive up excitement before the launch on June 15, the BIG team has announced the launch of a casino with more than 4,000 games. The Casino will become fully operational on 29th August and feature exclusive Play to Earn (P2E) games. Participation in the gaming and betting services will be limited to BIG token holders, which is expected to drive demand for and increase the value of the BIG Eyes Coin post-launch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Big Eyes Coin team plans to expand its presence beyond cryptocurrencies by developing innovative and exclusive NFTs. The BIG team has outlined plans for the creation of Spurr Store, which will enable users to buy and sell digital assets, helping to make Big Eyes Coin a top virtual marketplace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Success Mantra&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of Big Eyes Coin can be attributed to the unwavering support of its community, which has been a top priority for the team from the beginning of the project.&nbsp; By involving the community in the development and promotion of the project, the team has been able to create a strong and loyal following. To achieve this, Big Eyes Coin has hosted 17 games and gifted valuable prizes to its community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has also pledged 5% of its total supply to save the oceans and has already donated nearly $16,000 to charities, demonstrating its social responsibility. Last but not least, to retain this hard-earned loyal community, the Big Eyes Coin team is using a no-fee, no-tax policy policy approach.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are looking for a business opportunity where you can invest less and earn a significant amount of money, then Big Eyes Coin is an ideal option for you.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto markets operate remarkably differently from mainstream financial markets. On the one hand, coins like Bitcoin have serious underpinning in seeking to decentralize the global financial system and whatnot. On the other hand, memecoins operate as literal jokes that utilize internet meme popularity. Well, at least that was the case for the first one to break out, DogeCoin. </p>
<p>Due to Dogecoin's success, many memecoins have emerged with varying degrees of success. DigiToads (TOADS) and Pepe token are new entrants to the scene, fast getting on the radar of crypto enthusiasts. The fact that there are now multiple memecoin options also speaks volumes about the dynamism of this industry. </p>
<p>DigiToads and PEPE Are Dominating</p>
<p>These memecoins are different standard-bearers of this subsector. DigiToads seeks to add utility to the memecoin scene by operating as a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming token. The game revolves around a nature-themed metaverse swamp that is full of adventure. DigiToads has only recently launched its token sale and has already raised over $3.2 million.</p>
<p>A metaverse gaming ecosystem adds more dynamism to the concept of a memecoin. In line with the name, the game is based on toad avatars as they seek to battle for their precious swamp habitat. The project also has NFT collectibles to tap into another popular aspect of crypto gaming. These in-game collectibles increase engagement and can be collected as players navigate the game and nurture their toads.</p>
<p>The Pepe the Frog meme is one of the most famous memes online, especially in right wing circles. It features a picture of a frog that is sometimes skeptical or nonchalant, with different meme inscriptions on the image. Well, there is now a Pepecoin inspired by this famous token, and it is quickly gaining traction in cryptocurrency circles. </p>
<p>DigiToads is keen on building its utility aspect as compared to other memecoins. There is much to work with in the gaming sector, where the blockchain has yet to achieve its potential fully. By combining the hype of a memecoin and the enduring popularity of a quality game, its creators are looking to build a more stable platform.</p>
<p>The fact that these projects, based on funny-looking amphibians, are now some of the most popular memecoins speaks to the dynamism of this sector. Memecoin popularity is based on the notoriety of memes in popular culture. It is noteworthy that DigiToads is trying to implement a virtual metaverse gaming ecosystem over and above its memecoin essence. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>DOGE Rose But TOADS Has More Upsides</p>
<p>Memecoins take inspiration from internet memes and the viral humor they carry. Amid Bitcoin's rise as a scarce transformative asset with solid principles, Dogecoin was more of a parody coin whose creators had little intention of having it as a major cryptocurrency. A decade later, Dogecoin and other meme coins are an established component of the crypto sector, with several coins with a combined market capitalization of hundreds of billions of dollars. </p>
<p>The astronomical rise of Dogecoin came after a seemingly humorous tweet by Elon Musk in 2019 and several times in the next few years. Musk already had tens of millions of followers on Twitter with significant name recognition on Twitter. He would use phrases like 'one word: Doge' or post the Dogecoin logo, a Shiba Inu dog, as an unstoppable sandstorm. Without a doubt, Elon's promotional activity has been a focal point in Dogecoin's popularity. </p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts carried the joke, and Dogecoin soon became one of the most popular cryptocurrencies out there. The coin appreciated more than 1000% in the middle of a crypto rally of 2020-2021 before tapering off. Shiba Inu coin piggybacked on the popularity of Dogecoin, and the two have since become the notable memecoins of this crypto era. Shiba </p>
<p>Nowadays, a memecoin refers to coins that fall under the broad umbrella of projects with a humorous or fun tinge. Many projects with the memecoin label have serious development teams behind them. &nbsp;DigiToads is an example of this approach by building on what DogeCoin and SHIB achieved but with the advantage of utility. DOGE may still be the biggest stablecoin, but TOADS could have more upside, given its actual use cases. </p>
<p>TOADS: The Upcoming Meme King? </p>
<p>The role of memecoins in the cryptocurrency industry is mixed. Some look at them as a hilarious spin on established crypto names like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For memecoin traders, they represent legitimate investment opportunities. Famous personalities like Elon Musk can instantly change the price of a memecoin with a tweet. </p>
<p>Some memecoins have tried to strike a balance between the two polar ends of crypto development. That's where the likes of TOADS come in. TOADS is a memecoin but provides the utility of a P2E gaming token with a vibrant gaming ecosystem in tow. The beauty of this industry is that it has something for just about everyone. </p>

<p class="s7">Unus Sed Leo (LEO): embrace stability and slight profit potential in the crypto market</p>
<p>Unus Sed Leo (LEO) is making waves in the cryptocurrency market due to its low volatility and strong position against price manipulation. The Risk/Reward Gauge of Unus Sed Leo (LEO) indicates that the token has a relatively stable price, providing investors with a sense of security. Looking ahead, Unus Sed Leo (LEO) price is well-positioned with support near $3.48 and resistance set at $3.51. </p>
<p>This means that the token has room to grow before facing any significant selling pressure. Investors looking for stability, profit potential and a promising investment in the crypto market should consider adding Sparklo to their portfolio.

The price of Stellar (XLM) surged toward the long-standing resistance level at an average of $0.105, raising hopes for a major breakout. </p>
<p>However, Stellar (XLM) faced strong opposition, leading to a bearish engulfing candlestick formation. This recent rejection has temporarily halted the ascent of the Stellar (XLM) price. As a lot of charts are showing bearish signs for Stellar (XLM), now is a good time to stay away from Stellar (XTM) as it shows bearish signs. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the FDIC, blamed Signature Bank&rsquo;s involvement in the crypto industry for its ultimate collapse. </p>
<p>In a recent speech before the House Committee on Financial Services, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chairman blamed Signature Bank&rsquo;s reliance on uninsured deposits from the crypto industry and its exposure to the events that took place in 2022 for its demise.</p>
<p>Martin Gruenberg acknowledged the FDIC&rsquo;s bank supervision could have been more substantial. He conceded the agency did not act fast enough to prevent crisis from spreading through Signature&rsquo;s operations.</p>
<p>Chairman Gruenberg added that Signature&rsquo;s lack of risk management procedures and poor governance put the bank in a position where it could not manage liquidity in a crisis, making it unable to meet large withdrawal requests. Withdrawals were triggered by fears about Signature Bank&rsquo;s solvency and involvement in the volatile crypto sector.</p>
<p>Some bank executives tried to blame rising interest rates as the reason for its collapse, but Gruenberg argued that no bank could survive a run of such speed and magnitude.</p>
Signature&rsquo;s Closure Unrelated to Crypto: NYDFS
<p>In March, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced that its decision to shut down the bank was not influenced by its involvement in the crypto industry. Signature worked extensively with several crypto firms, with an estimated 30% of its deposits originating from the industry.</p>
<p>Signature came under scrutiny during the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX when it emerged the exchange held accounts with the bank. At the time, Signature said these accounts represented less than 0.1% of its overall deposits, adding that it planned to reduce around $10 billion in deposits emanating from digital asset clients.</p>
<p>The bank said by reducing its ties with digital asset clients; it would bring its crypto-related deposits down to between 15-20% of its total.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The third iteration of the Voyager bankruptcy plan has finally been approved by the court. According to the terms, affected customers can expect to recover up to 35% of their claims.</p>
Voyager Liquidating To Refund Customers
<p>In a significant development for users affected by the Voyager Digital Ltd. bankruptcy case, the court has approved a plan that allows customers to recoup a substantial portion of their frozen funds. According to the latest reports, users may be able to recover up to 35.7% of their initial claims, providing some much-needed relief for those impacted by the unfortunate situation.</p>
<p>This marks a positive turning point for Voyager Digital, a crypto brokerage platform that experienced financial difficulties leading to the freezing of customer accounts.&nbsp;</p>
Attempt No.1: The FTX Debacle
<p>The defunct company has had two failed attempts in the past to refund its customers. Back in September 2022, FTX had placed a winning bid of $1.4 billion on the bankrupt company&rsquo;s assets. However, with FTX also going under soon, the deal fell through. Reportedly, if the deal had been fully realized and FTX had not collapsed, creditors would have been able to reclaim 72% of their account values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crypto exchange even went as far as to sue Voyager for $445.8 million in January 2023, alleging that loan repayments made by Voyager in 2022 are subject to clawback due to their timing, occurring right before FTX's bankruptcy.</p>
Attempt No.2: Binance Backs Out
<p>The second chance at redemption came Voyager&rsquo;s way with Binance.US and a $1 billion acquisition deal. However, there was significant legal pushback on this plan from the bankruptcy court, and after a lot of back and forth, the deal finally fell through in late April, resulting in Voyager looking into liquidation options.&nbsp;</p>
Attempt No.3: Finally Approved
<p>The bankrupt crypto brokerage firm finally got lucky on its third try when Judge Michael Wiles of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved its bankruptcy plan to liquidate on May 17.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the terms of the plan, Voyager will begin repaying customers' frozen accounts in the near future. The approved proposal ensures that 35.7% of the initial claims will be distributed to the affected users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voyager has stated that as of May 8, it held $1.33 billion in recoverable assets, with $629.8 million being immediately available for recovery while facing claims totaling $1.8 billion. There is also a possibility that the firm may recover its funds frozen in the also-bankrupt crypto hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web3, the next epoch of the internet, is built upon revolutionary technology called blockchain.
