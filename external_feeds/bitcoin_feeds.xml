He stressed that there is nothing more destructive to wealth than inflation, emphasizing that the Fed &#8220;must keep their feet to the floorboard to prevent a re-occurrence of inflationary pressures.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Brandt’s Advice for the Federal Reserve</h2>
<p>Veteran trader Peter Brandt has urged the Federal Reserve to remain hawkish and increase interest rates by another 100 basis points. Brandt has been a futures and FX career trader since 1975. He is a chartist and the author of the Factor Report. He trades a variety of markets, including Dow futures, bonds, corn, crude oil, European wheat, Osaka Dow, U.S. dollar, and sugar.</p>
<p>“The U.S. Fed was negligent for not aggressively raising rates in early 2021,&#8221; he tweeted Thursday. &#8220;Traders knew this, but the Ph.D.s had their heads up their butts.&#8221; He added: &#8220;But now, I congratulate the Fed as it wants to remain hawkish. The market is concerned about unemployment and possible recession. Those are the least of our worries.”</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;higher unemployment is the least of our worries,&#8221; Brandt opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is NOTHING more destructive to wealth than inflation. The Fed must keep their feet to the floorboard to prevent a re-occurrence of inflationary pressures. While the Fed was asleep at the switch in 2021, increasing rates another 100 basis points would do wonders to protect the nation&#8217;s wealth.</p></blockquote>

<p>In March, Brandt tweeted that people who criticized the Federal Reserve for risking a recession because of rate hikes “know not of what they speak.” He believes that a recession would be beneficial in the long term, claiming that “Only those who have lived with rampant inflation (including U.S. in 1970s) can truly understand the destructive impact on wealth of inflation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emphasizing that “The Fed should be slammed” for not raising interest rates by 300 basis points in early 2022, he stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The damage to personal wealth because of inflation is far more dangerous than a recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">paused</a> raising interest rates during its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in June after 10 consecutive rate increases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">more rate hikes</a> this year but at a &#8220;moderate pace.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Fed Chairman Powell on Rate Hikes</h2>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed the Fed’s hawkish stance on Wednesday during a central banker panel hosted by the European Central Bank in Sintra, Portugal. With the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting slated for July 25-26, Powell emphasized that the Fed is not done curbing inflation and hinted at the possibility of consecutive interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">paused</a> raising interest rates in June after 10 consecutive rate hikes.</p>
<p>“If you look at the data over the last quarter, what you see is stronger than expected growth, a tighter than expected labor market, and higher than expected inflation,” Powell detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>　That tells us that although policy is restrictive, it may not be restrictive enough and it has not been restrictive for long enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>Powell noted that Fed officials have not decided on the timing and magnitude of additional interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, he shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>　I wouldn’t take moving at consecutive meetings off the table at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>During an event held by Spain&#8217;s central bank in Madrid on Thursday, the Fed chair clarified: “We expect the moderate pace of interest rate decisions to continue.”</p>
<p>Last week, Powell said: &#8220;Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">has a long way to go</a>.&#8221; He further stated that a minimum of two more interest-rate hikes this year are likely necessary to steer inflation towards the Fed&#8217;s 2% target. The Fed chairman also rejected the possibility of a rate cut in the near future, <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-us-dollar-decline-will-be-far-greater-than-yellen-warns-fed-chair-powell-clearly-worried-about-financial-crisis/">stating</a> that while “it will be appropriate to cut rates at a time when inflation is coming down really significantly, we’re talking about a couple of years out.”</p>

Income derived from long-term investments in digital assets will also be relieved from healthcare taxes, the parliamentarians decided.</strong></p>
<h2>Investors in Slovakia to Pay 7% Tax on Income From Crypto Held More Than a Year</h2>
<p>Members of the National Council of Slovakia, the country’s unicameral legislature, have approved an amendment that will reduce the taxation of cryptocurrencies, local media <a href="https://e.dennikn.sk/minuta/3447018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. Income from crypto assets sold more than a year after their purchase will be taxed at 7%.</p>
<p>Thus, the tax rate for long-term crypto holdings will be lower than the regular income tax rates. Slovaks pay personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Slovakia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income tax</a> according to a progressive scale and the rate can be either 19% or 25%, for income exceeding a certain threshold.</p>
<p>The legislative proposal was submitted by the liberal Freedom and Solidarity party, the Democrats and the conservative Ordinary People and Independent Personalities party and backed by the We Are Family and Voice factions.</p>

<p>According to the updated law, gains from crypto investments will also be exempt from health taxes. Slovakia’s Ministry of Finance has estimated that the financial impact from the amendment will be around €30 million (almost $33 million) a year.</p>
<p>The tax exemptions come after earlier this month Slovak lawmakers sought to protect cash payments amid fears that the digital version of Europe’s common fiat currency, the euro, may eventually become the only means of payment across the eurozone.</p>
<p>The right to pay with cash for goods and services was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/right-to-pay-with-cash-enshrined-in-constitution-of-slovakia-amid-digital-euro-fears/">enshrined</a> in the country’s constitution through an amendment proposed by the right-wing and Euroskeptic We Are Family party. The latest legal changes will also exempt from taxation crypto payments for up to €2,400 ($2,600).</p>

<h2>Fednow System Launch Ignites CBDC Speculation</h2>
<p>The highly anticipated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/not-related-to-a-digital-currency-us-central-bank-addresses-concerns-over-fednow-payment-network/">Fednow system</a> is set to launch on July 1. Developed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, this payment system aims to provide &#x201C;24x7x365 settlement service&#x201D; and facilitate instantaneous payments. Extensive <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_faq.htm">information</a> on this subject has been released by the Fed, with significant involvement from the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Reserve&#x2019;s board members have conducted an evaluation and determined that the central bank is &#x201C;well positioned&#x201D; to tackle the nationwide implementation of instant payment infrastructure. It is worth noting that although Fednow offers immediate settlements, it does not adopt the blockchain-based approach.</p>

<p>The Fednow system utilizes <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/questions/does-fednow-use-blockchain">ISO 20022</a>, a worldwide standard for electronic message exchange between financial institutions established in 2004. ISO 20022 is widely employed by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/swift-is-experimenting-with-decentralized-technologies-to-allow-cbdc-interconnection/">SWIFT</a>, numerous financial organizations, and financial services. Its predecessor was ISO 15022. The ISO 20022 system adopted by the Fednow project functions as a shared financial language, enabling different banks, financial institutions, and systems to comprehend and exchange settlement information. It should be noted that the ISO 20022 system does not maintain a ledger for recording these settlements. Instead, relevant information is recorded and stored in databases or systems specific to the financial institution or organization involved.</p>

<p>Amidst conjecture and speculation, there are discussions about the potential evolution of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the Fednow system. However, in its current state, the infrastructure of Fednow is essentially comparable to the conventional payment rails utilized by existing financial incumbents. Is it possible for a CBDC to supplant it? Certainly, any system, including the Fednow and its underlying infrastructure, could be replaced by a different type of system in the future. At present, the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s Boston and New York branches have set in motion two distinct prototypes for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) &#x2014; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/atomic-settlement-new-york-fed-completes-first-phase-of-digital-dollar-experiment-called-project-cedar/">Project Cedar</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-bank-of-boston-mit-central-bank-digital-currency-research-open-source-code/">Project Hamilton</a>.</p>

<h2>Fednow and Ripple&#x2019;s Role Discussed as Fed Discloses &#x2018;Features and Enhancements Will Be Added in Future&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The list of prominent financial players embracing the Fednow system includes ACI Worldwide, Finzly, Jack Henry & Associates, Bryant Bank, Hawaiiusa Federal Credit Union, BMO Harris Bank, BNY Mellon, Bridge Community Bank, Citizens National Bank, Citi, Finastra, First Bank, Atlantic Community Bankers&#x2019; Bank, Capital One Financial, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and many others. Nearly 60 firms have received certification to utilize the Fednow instant payments system. All these firms are seamlessly connected to the extensive network of 4,844 insured commercial banks in the United States and can access the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s overnight banking rates.</p>

<p>Although the current implementation of the Fednow system does not utilize blockchain technology, there is speculation regarding the potential integration of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> or a stablecoin in the future. Some enthusiasts have drawn attention to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/apocalypse-fednow">remarks</a> on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) during his testimony before Congress on June 21. Powell stated, &#x201C;We would not support a central bank digital currency for individuals. If we did have a CBDC, it would be intermediated by banks.&#x201D; Supporters of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/w_thejazz/status/1674505875606896640?s=20">believe</a> that Ripple Labs or <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> itself <a href="https://twitter.com/xrpmickle/status/1674507141468549121?s=20">may be involved</a> in some capacity, while others go as far as to suggest potential long-term impacts on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s value.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the &#x201C;Economic Report of the President&#x201D; from the White House <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-administrations-economic-report-deems-crypto-assets-mostly-speculative-investment-vehicles/">emphasizes</a> that the Fednow system has &#x201C;the potential to realize many of the benefits that crypto asset developers have promised.&#x201D; In mid-March, the Fed explained that changes could be added to the Fednow system at any time. &#x201C;More features and enhancements will be added in future releases to continue supporting safety, resiliency and innovation in the industry as the Fednow network expands in the coming years,&#x201D; the U.S. central bank <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230315a.htm">disclosed</a>.</p>

<h2>Biden Wants to Eliminate Tax Loopholes for Crypto Traders</h2>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden talked about taxation for crypto traders during his economic policy speech dubbed &#8220;Bidenomics&#8221; in Chicago on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Does anyone here think the federal tax system is fair? Raise your hand,” Biden said, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>No matter how much money you make. We’re going to make it fair by eliminating loopholes for crypto traders, hedge fund managers.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We’re going to get billionaires to pay up a little bit, at least a minimum tax … No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher, a firefighter, or a cop,” he emphasized. “That’s the next phase of this fight: making the tax code fair for everyone, making the wealthy and the super-wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share, without raising taxes at all on the middle class.”</p>

<p>Many crypto proponents took to social media to comment on Biden&#8217;s speech. Gabor Gurbacs, advisor at investment management firm Vaneck, <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1674477262370926592">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reminder: The U.S. added $9 trillion in debt in the past ~3 years. The U.S. doesn&#8217;t have a revenue problem. It has a government spending problem. Not sure what President Biden is saying about eliminating tax loopholes for crypto traders. There are few to none.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ryan Selkis, founder &amp; CEO of crypto analytics firm Messari, <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1674513425626546179">wrote</a>: &#8220;At 80 years old, President Biden is one of the few people in D.C. who’s lived long enough to read through our 70,000-page tax code. But he’s also losing his marbles and seems confused: there are no &#8216;crypto trader&#8217; tax loopholes, and his policies are destroying capital gains anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although several major cryptocurrencies lost value in response to this news, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a> remains up by over 20% in just one day and more than 100% in a week. Two-week statistics reveal a 182% increase for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, while it is up 158% over the past month.</p>

<p>This recent upswing in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s value has prompted miners to direct significantly more hashrate toward the network. As of June 30, 2023, data reveals that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s hashrate stands at around <a href="https://archive.ph/2FYeO">5.6 exahash per second</a> (EH/s).</p>
<p>This is a substantial leap from May 11, 2023&#x2019;s rate of approximately 1.55 EH/s, which then saw a major spike on June 21st. Presently, on Friday, about 22 mining pools contribute hashpower to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, with Viabtc leading the charge with 603 petahash per second (PH/s).</p>

<p>Following Viabtc&#x2019;s contribution are Antpool, Zsolobid, F2pool, Pool Moscow, Trust Pool, and Poolin in descending order. Present statistics from Coin Dance reveal that as of June 30th, mining on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain yields a profit <a href="https://archive.ph/bjZoI">2.7% higher</a> than that of its SHA256 counterpart <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-595699 size-full" title="Bitcoin Cash Hashrate Gains Momentum: Miners Flock to BCH as Profitability Surges " src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Cash Hashrate Gains Momentum: Miners Flock to BCH as Profitability Surges " width="1280" height="300" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind-300x70.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind-1024x240.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind-768x180.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Although <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s current hashrate is remarkably higher than it was a few weeks ago, it still falls short of the all-time high of 14.36 EH/s recorded at block height 622,407 on February 15, 2020. So far, the upward trend suggests that both the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s USD value and overall hashpower have endured, but only more time will confirm if this outcome will sustain.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will Bitcoin Cash&#x2019;s mining profitability and increased hashrate propel the blockchain&#x2019;s activity to new heights? Share your thoughts and predictions in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

<h2>SEC Reportedly Finds Flaw in the Latest Slew of Spot Bitcoin ETF Applications</h2>
<p>Following Blackrock&#8217;s submission of an application for a spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), numerous companies swiftly followed suit and filed their own registrations for similar products. Despite the SEC&#8217;s approval of bitcoin futures ETFs, including a newly authorized leveraged option, the regulatory body has thus far refrained from granting approval to spot bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>According to insiders <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/sec-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-390336e8">cited</a> by Vicky Ge Huang of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the latest registrations submitted including Blackrock’s ETF are reported to fall short of meeting the SEC&#8217;s rigorous standards.</p>
<p>The SEC has reportedly revealed that the submitted applications for the ETFs are deemed inadequate, the WSJ report discloses. Allegedly, the SEC has communicated this to both Nasdaq and Cboe, the two firms responsible for filing the ETF registrations on behalf of Fidelity and Blackrock.</p>
<p>While a spokeswoman from Cboe informed the WSJ that they intend to revise and resubmit the registration to meet the SEC&#8217;s requirements, Nasdaq declined to comment, as disclosed by the reporter on Friday. As per the sources cited in Ge Huang&#8217;s report, “the filings aren’t sufficiently clear and comprehensive.”</p>
<p>An array of firms, including Blackrock, Bitwise, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-funds-joins-race-for-sec-approval-as-it-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Valkyrie</a>, Invesco, Fidelity, Ark Investment, and Wisdomtree, have already submitted their filings, signaling the growing interest in spot bitcoin ETFs.</p>

<p>Additionally, Grayscale Investments, the largest manager of digital currency assets worldwide, has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-investments-investors-help-convince-sec-approve-bitcoin-spot-etf/">striving to transform</a> the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected Grayscale&#8217;s application, prompting the firm to take <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-files-lawsuit-against-sec-over-spot-bitcoin-etf-rejection/">legal action</a> against the regulatory body.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s decision-making process sheds light on their concerns regarding market manipulation. When the SEC denied the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust last year, they <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2022/34-94080.pdf">cited the inability</a> to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts” or “protect investors” as the primary reasons for the denial.</p>

The move came prior to the latest consumer sentiment report from the U.S, which rose to a reading of 64.4. Bitcoin cash climbed to its highest point since April 2022. </strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>) rose above $100.00 for the first time since April, as traders seemingly remained bullish on the token following its recent listing on EDX markets.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD hit an intraday peak of $102.38 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which came following a low of $84.25 the day before.</p>
<p>As a result of the rally, litecoin peaked at its strongest point since April 18, when price reached a top at $103.41.</p>

<p>Today&#x2019;s move came as bulls were able to break out of a recent resistance level of $98.00, with the relative strength index (RSI) doing similar.</p>
<p>Litecoin&#x2019;s price strength surged past a ceiling at the 62.00 mark, on its way to a current reading of 65.43.</p>
<p>Should momentum continue, bulls will likely ease pressure closer to an upcoming level of 68.00.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>)</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>) made significant gains for a second straight session, this time rising by over 20% to end the week.</p>
<p>Following a low of $241.21 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>/USD raced to an intraday high at $312.77 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of this latest rally, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> moved to its strongest point since April 18 last year, when price peaked at $345.00.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the latest rally has sent the RSI to a current reading of 86.97, which is significantly overbought.</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) moving average has also made a relatively high leap away from its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>This could signal a potential top, which could be tempting for bears waiting for the perfect time to reenter the market.</p>

Among the entities he mentioned were the U.S. departments of Education, Commerce and Energy, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</strong></p>
<h2>If Elected, DeSantis Administration Would Abolish the Departments of Commerce and Energy, Education, and the IRS</h2>
<p>During an interview with Fox News television host Martha MacCallum on Wednesday, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-joins-us-presidential-race-promises-to-protect-bitcoin/">Ron DeSantis</a>, the Republican governor of Florida and a candidate in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, shared his idea to streamline the federal government by eliminating certain agencies. DeSantis expressed his firm support for reducing the overall size of government and expressed his intention to dismantle a select few departments if elected president.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would do Education, we would do Commerce, we&#8217;d do Energy, and we would do IRS,” DeSantis <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/desantis-outlines-drug-smuggling-policy-cut-through-wall-end-up-stone-cold-dead">told</a> MacCallum. “If Congress will work with me on doing that, we&#8217;ll be able to reduce the size and scope of government.” The Republican presidential candidate added:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Congress won&#8217;t go that far, I&#8217;m going to use those agencies to push back against woke ideology and against the leftism that we see creeping into all institutions of American life.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeSantis is not alone in his pledge to dismantle specific federal departments as a presidential candidate. A similar stance was taken by former Republican presidential contender Ron Paul during his 2012 campaign. Paul made a bold promise to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/44942719">abolish five cabinet-level agencies</a> should he win the election. The agencies he specifically targeted were Education, Interior, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to get back to growth again you have to get rid of all the mistakes, all of the malinvestments, all of the debt,&#8221; Paul said at the time. &#8220;You can&#8217;t keep dumping the debt onto people.&#8221;</p>

<p>This also isn&#8217;t the first instance where DeSantis has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/2024-us-presidential-candidate-ron-desantis-says-irs-is-corrupt-insisting-america-needs-something-totally-different/">expressed his views</a> on revamping or dismantling the IRS. In a conversation with Dana Loesch in late May, he voiced his support for a single-rate tax proposal or a flat tax system. &#8220;I&#8217;ve endorsed all of the single-rate proposals,&#8221; DeSantis emphasized during his discussion with Loesch. &#8220;I truly believe they would bring significant improvements compared to the existing system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Building on his stance, DeSantis didn&#8217;t mince words when he asserted that he perceives the IRS as a “corrupt” entity, highlighting that this cabinet-level agency is far from being an ally to the ordinary citizen or taxpayer. During his conversation with MacCallum on Wednesday, he voiced his belief in the necessity of a profound reconstitution of the government. Reflecting on the unfulfilled promise of draining the swamp back in 2016, DeSantis offered a more potent metaphor, suggesting the urgent need to shatter the very foundations of the swamp itself.</p>
<p>He emphasized, &#8220;We need to fundamentally re-constitutionalize the government. We talked about draining the swamp in 2016; that didn’t happen. I think the better analogy is breaking the swamp.”</p>
