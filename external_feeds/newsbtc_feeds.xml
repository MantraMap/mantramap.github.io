					<description><![CDATA[Just this January 14th, LUNC just went through its network upgrade that was supported by Binance. The upgrade was due to several developments on-chain. According to its January 1st blog post, it was because the system of LUNC remints tokens that were burnt for a development fund.  Along with this, the ecosystem would also have an increase in gas fees for better validators and staking rewards in the platform. This would mean that the ecosystem would continuously burn and make LUNC a deflationary currency.  Related Reading: XRP Bulls Aim For $1 As Crypto Advances With 12% Weekly Pump What It Means For LUNC Luna Classic becoming deflationary would have an effect on the token. But this wouldn’t be enough for the token to have a big move in the short and mid-term. Based on the blog post, this burn rate of the ecosystem would increase as remints would be eliminated.  The proposal also increases the gas fees in the ecosystem, making the usage of the community fund more efficient. Although this may seem bad, Terra Luna Classic’s gas fees are still comparably low compared to Terra 2.0. Image: CryptoSlate The proposal was well received by the community. This could be a catalyst for a consistent move upwards as LUNC rides the altcoin rally.  LUNC is the native cryptocurrency of the old Terra network. It was launched in 2018 under the name LUNA, but was renamed LUNC following the Terra disaster. Long Term, The Key For Gains Short term, the token is set to break its current upward trend. Volatility is expected to enter the market in the next few days &#8211; but then that is not surprising &#8211; as the market prices in the burnt tokens. It is likely, however, that the token would have a respite in the coming days as deflationary forces act upon the token.  As the time of writing, the token’s price is at $0.00017586, a percent discount from yesterday’s price movement, but LUNC also exhibited sizable gains in the weekly and bi-weekly time frame. The token is also currently facing strong resistance at $0.00018073.  LUNC total market cap at $993 million on the daily chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Hedera Soars 23% As HBAR Blooms All-Green On The Charts All Week In the short-mid term, the token would revert back to its support at $0.00015726 in the next couple of days or weeks. If the token experiences a pull back in price, the token should have enough momentum to retest the $0.00018073 resistance level.  If the token breaches the $0.00018073 resistance level, it could regain and consolidate above it in the coming weeks to retest $0.0001866 with confidence. Investors and trader should brace themselves for a bumpy few days as the token experiences volatility.  Long-term, holding LUNC is the best move for investors and traders as the market rides on Bitcoin’s resistance break at $21,000.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has done well in the last week with multiple rallies that have brought the digital asset’s price back to early November 2022 levels. However, while investor sentiment looks to have significantly recovered, not everyone is expecting BTC to continue to do well. The Coinmarketcap Price Estimates feature reveals that a large number of investors are expecting the price of the cryptocurrency to fall over the next two weeks. 12% Decline For Bitcoin The Coinmarketcap Price Estimates feature allows users to input their forecasts for the price of any digital asset and then produces an average price based on everyone’s predictions. This can help to give a good feel of the community and how they are looking for an asset. Related Reading: Liquidations Cross $200 Million Following Bitcoin’s Rise Above $19,000 For bitcoin, it seems not a lot of investors expect the pioneer cryptocurrency to continue on this recovery trend. With over 19,000 price estimates submitted, the median came out to an expected 12% decrease in bitcoin’s price in the coming two weeks. Such a decline would actually see the price of BTC fall as low as $18,634, losing more than $2,500 of its current value.  This bearish sentiment does not stop at the end of the month of January but carries into the following months. The median estimated price for the month of February was $18,981, which is an over 10% decline from the current price, and the outlook for March was almost identical in this regard. The expected declines stretch out over the next six months with price medians getting progressively lower. Estimates came out to a between 14-18% decline for the month of April, June, and July, respectively. Bearish outlook for BTC in the next six months &#124; Source: Coinmarketcap Will BTC Succumb To Bearish Pressure? Over the last week, the bitcoin price has been able to clear multiple important levels. These include the 50 and 100-day moving averages, solidifying the bullish trend in the short term. However, while the digital asset is still bullish for the short term, there could be more bad news over the long term. Related Reading: XRP Tops List Of Gainers As Whale Interest Spikes One important technical level that BTC is yet to clear is the 200-day moving average. This is perhaps one of the most important indicators if the digital asset is to continue its upward rally into the next few months. It is currently sitting at $22,738, which means another 5% move upward from its current price could bring BTC toe to toe with this indicator. If bitcoin clears this, selling pressure will likely decline as more investors try to get into the asset. This would lead to a test of the $22,400 resistance level, one that would be easily beaten as long as there is no slowdown in decline. In the end, bitcoin’s performance over the long term will depend on its ability to move enough to beat the 200-day MA.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Bitcoin has done well in the last week with multiple rallies that have brought the digital asset’s price back to early November 2022 levels. However, while investor sentiment looks to have significantly recovered, not everyone is expecting BTC to continue to do well. The Coinmarketcap Price Estimates feature reveals that a large number of investors are expecting the price of the cryptocurrency to fall over the next two weeks.</p>
<h2 class="p2">12% Decline For Bitcoin</h2>
<p class="p2">The Coinmarketcap Price Estimates feature allows users to input their forecasts for the price of any digital asset and then produces an average price based on everyone’s predictions. This can help to give a good feel of the community and how they are looking for an asset.</p>

<p class="p2">For bitcoin, it seems not a lot of investors expect the pioneer cryptocurrency to continue on this recovery trend. With <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/price-estimates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">over 19,000 price estimates submitted</a>, the median came out to an expected 12% decrease in bitcoin’s price in the coming two weeks. Such a decline would actually see the price of BTC fall as low as $18,634, losing more than $2,500 of its current value. </p>
<p class="p2">This bearish sentiment does not stop at the end of the month of January but carries into the following months. The median estimated price for the month of February was $18,981, which is an over 10% decline from the current price, and the outlook for March was almost identical in this regard.</p>
<p class="p2">The expected declines stretch out over the next six months with price medians getting progressively lower. Estimates came out to a between 14-18% decline for the month of April, June, and July, respectively.</p>

<h2 class="p2">Will BTC Succumb To Bearish Pressure?</h2>
<p class="p2">Over the last week, the bitcoin price has been able to clear multiple important levels. These include the 50 and 100-day moving averages, solidifying the bullish trend in the short term. However, while the digital asset is still bullish for the short term, there could be more bad news over the long term.</p>

<p class="p2">One important technical level that BTC is yet to clear is the 200-day moving average. This is perhaps one of the most important indicators if the digital asset is to continue its upward rally into the next few months. It is currently sitting at $22,738, which means another 5% move upward from its current price could bring BTC toe to toe with this indicator.</p>
<p class="p2">If bitcoin clears this, selling pressure will likely decline as more investors try to get into the asset. This would lead to a test of the $22,400 resistance level, one that would be easily beaten as long as there is no slowdown in decline. In the end, bitcoin’s performance over the long term will depend on its ability to move enough to beat the 200-day MA.</p>
<p class="p2">BTC&#8217;s price is now trailing above $21,100 after failing to beat the $21,500 resistance level.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is showing signs of getting overheated on daily timeframes using the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The tool, typically used to spot overbought conditions, is at one of its highest levels ever historically. However, an elevated RSI reading in BTCUSD is deceiving, leading to some of the most dramatic moves ever on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price chart. Here is a closer look at what happens when Bitcoin price action gets this hot. Bitcoin RSI Reaches Highest Level Since Early 2021 After breaching above $20,000, onlookers are wondering if a possible bottom is in for Bitcoin, but remain skeptical after such a long, arduous downtrend. Bears have good reason to expect a pullback: Bitcoin has become extremely overbought according to the Relative Strength Index. In fact, the top cryptocurrency is more overbought than at any other point during the entire bear trend.

In the past, the RSI has only reached such an elevated level – a reading of 90 or above – during the most intense bullish movements of recent years. Elevated RSI tends to only happen during bull markets &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why Crypto Could Be Ready To Rip Higher Once Again Bearish investors and traders might be quick to claim that this time is different, considering the Fed raising interest rates, the backdrop of war and recession, and more. But bulls have much more data on their side, and momentum at their backs. In fact, bulls have the entire history of BTCUSD price action to prove that the Relative Strength Index reaching such highs have led to the greatest sustained gains in crypto. Bull markets are characterized by recurring phases of extreme RSI readings. Bull markets also end at such extremes, but typically only after at least a series of three waves. Bear market peaks, throughout the entire lifetime of BTCUSD price action, always fail to reach such highly elevated RSI. The Relative Strength Index was created by developed by J. Welles Wilder – who also developed the Parabolic SAR, Average Directional Index, and Average True. The technical tool measures the speed of the change of price movements. Related Reading: “Parabolic” Signal That Triggered Past Bitcoin Bull Runs Reappears Although readings above 70 and below 30 typically represent overbought or oversold conditions, a reading of 90 only occurs with an extremely fast and strong move.

Is that exactly what we&#8217;ve seen in Bitcoin recently? And will the number one cryptocurrency by market cap rip higher, or ultimately see a rejection here due to such overbought conditions?

					<description><![CDATA[Arbitrum and Optimism raked millions in profit despite the extended bear market that hammered decentralized finance (DeFi) activities and Ethereum (ETH) valuation in 2022. Arbitrum And Optimism Win Big Per on-chain data shared on Twitter, Arbitrum, and Optimism, general-purpose Ethereum layer-2 platforms, made 2,906 ETH and 2,086ETH, respectively. In USD terms, it translates to around $4.6 million and $3.3 million for each protocol.

Since launching, the network has become a hub of activity, spearheading exciting innovations in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse, and gaming.  Related Reading: Ethereum-Based Frax Finance (FXS) Is Up 64%, Is There Still Opportunity? Trackers in mid-January 2023 state that the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum stands at $26.88 billion, representing more than half of the assets locked across DeFi. The drop in TVL mirrors the fall in ETH prices in 2022. In essence, Ethereum dominates with DeFi activity over the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), trailing at less than a quarter of the TVL of the leading platform, at $4.65 billion. Despite this dominance, Ethereum&#8217;s scaling problem directly impacts Gas fees. As demand picks up, Gas fees fluctuate, leading to as much as $50 on this blockchain to post a simple transaction. Deploying smart contracts cost much more, sometimes upwards of $80, when the network is congested. As an illustration, the average transaction fees on Ethereum stood at $0.63 on January 17. However, on May 1, 2022, this figure stood at over $23. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer-2 Platform, ZKSync, Releases New SDK in Swift Ethereum layer-2 protocols are part of the scaling attempts made by developers to relieve the mainnet. By routing transactions off-chain, layer-2 solutions can help scale Ethereum but, most importantly, reduce Gas fees by several magnitudes.  In Ethereum&#8217;s layer-2 realm, Arbitrum and Optimism dominate. According to L2Beat statistics, Arbitrum and Optimism had TVLs of $2.52 billion and $1.45 billion, with a market share of 52% and roughly 30%, respectively.  Riding on Network Effects Although associated fees in Arbitrum, Optimism, and all other layer-2 networks are negligibly low, these protocols can profit based on activity. For every transfer or smart contract execution of Arbitrum and Optimism, there is an associated fee.  Arbitrum and Optimism charge $0.11 and $0.23 for simple transfers, payable in ETH. If a smart contract is deployed, the fees rise to $0.30 and $0.35. They make more fees as more users deploy smart contracts or initiate transfers. Accumulating these amounts over months translate to a tidy profit for the protocol operator.  In 2022, Ethereum layer-2 TVL fell roughly 40% from $7.45 billion to $3.3 billion in July 2022. Outflows were lower compared to layer-1 DeFi. As the market recovers, layer-2 operators may likely post higher revenue as users move assets to dApps launched on these scalable and low-fee protocols.

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows most of Bitcoin&#8217;s recent gains since November 27 have been observed during Asian trading hours, according to a report. Bitcoin Saw The Most Returns During Asian Trading Hours As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, Asian trading hours saw positive cumulative BTC returns of around 16% between November 27 and January 15. The report defines the three principal trading hours: between 0 to 8 Central European Time (CET) for Asian hours, 8-16 CET for European, and 16-24 for the US.

					<description><![CDATA[The global cryptocurrency market cap is currently down by 1.61%, but LINK holds its gains on the weekly chart. With institutional investors and whales engaged in trading activities, the crypto market is experiencing a revival.  Chainlink has enjoyed a resurgence this week with an increase in its price and trading volume. The network has also recorded a massive increase in trading volume today at 30.64%. The coin is now ranked number 21 on the list of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum-Based Frax Finance (FXS) Is Up 64%, Is There Still Opportunity? What Is Behind The Rally? The Chainlink network has added some notable projects to its catalog. The total value of transactions, its oracle service, exceeded $6.9 trillion. Also, the network provided users with data feeds that extend across new blockchains and layer 2. Another innovation driving the price is the Chainlink proof of reserve. The collapse of FTX created distrust in the industry. This distrust prompted the increased demand for Proof of Reserves. Chainlink&#8217;s Proof of Reserve has become popular among stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide their customers with transparency. The adoption has also aided the LINK price increase. Also, the launch of Web3 solution Chainlink Economics 2.0 has created a framework for the network&#8217;s core interests; Chainlink BUILD, SCALE, and Staking. Chainlink’s BUILD and SCALE enable users to build Web3 dApps. Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink&#8217;s co-founder, stated that the crisis in traditional finance creates opportunities for blockchain technology to fortify crypto as an alternative financial system. Chainlink Price Prediction Chainlink LINK has enjoyed a positive rally in the past week. The asset is currently trading at $6.50 as it approaches the $7 mark. The support levels are $6.27, $6.44, and $6.64, while the resistance levels are $7.01, $7.18, and $7.37. LINK is close to its first resistance level, but the uptrend might pull back as the bearish candles begin to form on the chart. The asset is currently above its 50-day Simple Moving average and approaching its 200-day SMA. This suggests bullish momentum for LINK in the short term. However, expect a pullback before it continues its surge.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 65.73 is slightly into the buy zone but not in the overbought region. It reflects the current market condition as the bears struggle to push down the asset&#8217;s price. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is above its signal line and shows divergence, which is a bullish signal.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana has been one of the top performers in the cryptocurrency market, with gains of over 89% in 30 days, 131% in 14 days, and 63% in 7 days. In the face of claims that the SOL network is failing, the token&#8217;s price needs a slight upward boost to gain back the support of investors. After dropping to a low of $8.01 in December, its price has increased dramatically in recent weeks and is now trading above the $20.00 level.  Solana Surge After Months When Solana&#8217;s native token SOL hit a 52-week low of $8.14 on December 29, the cryptocurrency was on the edge of collapse before the end of 2022. However, the market has since turned around and is currently in its favor. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues To Shine With 43% Gains In Last Week The release of the first meme coin, BONK, on the blockchain in late December also contributed to the Solana price increase. The meme coin&#8217;s market cap skyrocketed to $200 million as word spread but faded to $55 million at press time. But SOL has not slowed down. SOL has to close higher than the 200-day simple moving average of $27.59 and exponential moving average of $30.25 to confirm this trend change. However, this close could signal continued positive momentum and set the stage for higher prices. Although the RSI has moved into the bullish momentum at 73, the MACD is still well above its optimum values. So, it lends credence to the idea that another surge is possible. The on-balance volume (OBV) has also increased dramatically since the January rally began, reaching a high not seen since July-August 2022. The OBV going up before a breakout is standard, but all other indicators must still hold steady. According to CoinMarketCap, the market valuation for SOL was $8.62 billion as of 18 January, when it was trading at $23.25 on a 24-hour volume of $902 million. The price of SOL has risen by more than 200% from its low point on December 18.  Solana Catching The Positive Trend To establish this trend change, SOL has to close above the $27.59 and $30.25 200-day Simple and Exponential Moving Averages. However, with such a close, positive momentum appears bullish, which might lead to more price appreciation. According to Coincodex&#8217;s technical analysis, the price of SOL will drop during the next few days, hitting $18.29 on February 1st. It would represent a 20% reduction from current levels.

This could help to confirm the asset&#8217;s bullish trend. 1/ A new report by @ElectricCapital shows that Solana is the fastest growing developer ecosystem, surpassing 2,000 total developers in 2022.

					<description><![CDATA[Based on a discovery from a new stablecoin test of Cardano, Rick McCracken has predicted a close launch date for Djed mainnet. Rick McCracken, the owner of the ADA staking pool, DIGI, and also a Cardano supporter, did not hesitate to make his findings and prediction known via his Twitter handle. Recall there was an announcement earlier on Djed’s official Twitter handle on January 14, affirming that the stablecoin’s launch this month remains on track. Furthermore, as per COTI Network’s announcement on January 5, the soon-to-launch stablecoin bagged a new partnership with Yepple Incorporated.

It would also promote the integration of the payment for NFT transactions using Djed. Djed To Go Live Along With New Stablecoin Payment App, DjedPay Djed is Cardano’s first ADA-backed stablecoin powered by COTI Network. It is an over-centralized stablecoin with a collateral rate between 400-800%, according to the description on adapulse.io. According to the CEO of the COTI Network, Shahaf Bar-Geffen, in addition to ADA backing, Djed will also have another token to protect it against exposure to ADA&#8217;s volatility. SHEN would act as the stablecoin’s reserve currency, maintaining its price stability to ensure the 400-800% collateral guarantee against price fluctuations. The stablecoin’s testnet version was initially launched in December 2022. Djed&#8217;s official website revealed that its value is currently 2.94 ADA, with a supply of 676,496 tokens. McCracken&#8217;s prediction of the mainnet launch goes in line with the developers&#8217; initial announcement. According to them, Djed would go live on the mainnet later in January. McCracken also revealed the new Djed stablecoin is now worth $1.019 on the test network. In addition to the mainnet launch, a payment platform for Djed called DjedPay would launch at the same time. According to the official Twitter announcement, DjedPay is a platform that would offer Djed-powered payments by traders and organizations. However, COTI is still trying to secure more partnerships to scale the stablecoins algorithmic adoption. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains? Meanwhile, news of this development, among others, pushed ADA prices over the past few days. According to data from TradingView, ADA has added over 38% in the last 14 days and 11.1% in the past seven days. The cryptocurrency trades at $0.035235, with a 24-hour price gain of 1.3%. Cardano Releases New ADA Wallet Update In another development, the ADA community recently saw a new upgrade in Cardano’s Daedalus wallet, Daedalus 5.2.0. Input Output Global (IOG), the company behind Cardano, announced the launch of Daedalus 5.2.0 via a tweet on January 16. Daedalus wallet is the official desktop wallet for ADA developed by IOG. The new wallet version is compatible with Cardano node version 1.35.4 and wallet version 2022.12.14. The release of Daedalus 5.2.0 automatically updates the ProjectCatalyst API URL to a new URL. Also, the upgrade included Bryon Wallet tracking capability and aggregates of similar RAM sizes to allow for swift data analysis. Furthermore, Cardano’s Bryon era (the first phase on the Cardano Roadmap) received a delivery of the Daedalus wallet and Yoroi wallet. Yoroi is a light wallet designed by Emurgo, IOG’s sister company, that offers users access to ADA quick day-to-day transactions on their mobile phones.
