<p>BTC/USD Bears Slowed by 30142:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 9 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to suffer from bearish sentiment early in the Asian session as the pair failed to sustain a break of the 30407 level, representing the 38.2% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 31525.10 to 29715.87.&nbsp; Selling activity reversed around the 30148.60 area, representing a test of the 23.6% retracement of the same depreciating range.&nbsp; Earlier selling pressure recently intensified around the 31142.38 area and this increases the risk of another test of the 29427 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below that area, the 28604.83 level represents the 50% retracement of that appreciating range.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
