<p>Hot on the heels of a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-makes-a-comeback-as-holders-bet-on-huge-upsurge-amid-ripples-groundbreaking-win-in-sec-lawsuit/">partial victory </a>in its fight with the SEC last week, Ripple is setting its sights on obtaining regulatory greenlight in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>



<p>Ripple has already sent applications for registration as a crypto asset firm with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and for a payment institution license in Ireland.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-eyes-uk-ireland-expansion"><strong>Ripple Eyes UK, Ireland Expansion</strong></h2>



<p>American fintech firm Ripple continues its global expansion, initiating the process to secure approval in the UK and Ireland after the legal win in the XRP lawsuit.</p>



<p>Sendi Young, Ripple’s European Managing Director, <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/ripple-sendi-young-aims-for-uk-fca-nod-after-us-court-win/">told </a><em>DL News</em> that the company had “very recently” applied for crypto asset firm registration with the U.K.&#8217;s FCA, along with a payment institution license in Ireland.</p>



<p>The company’s move to strengthen its foothold in the UK and European markets was motivated by the “huge win” in its battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A federal judge of the vaunted United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had reviewed the SEC’s drawn-out suit against Ripple and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">determined </a>last week that institutional sales of the XRP token violated federal securities laws, but sales on exchanges and programmatic sales did not.</p>



<p>Young emphasized that Ripple’s approach and growth objectives remain unchanged despite this recent courtroom triumph. The firm has plans to invest heavily in the UK and Ireland, promoting exponential growth.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency companies have been choosing to enter the EU owing to its huge advances in regulating the space. The bloc&#8217;s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law, which creates a licensing regime that will let firms operate in all of its 27 jurisdictions was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/industry-leaders-upbeat-as-eu-parliament-passes-much-anticipated-mica-regulation/">passed </a>in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most recently, the U.K. has made significant steps to distinguish crypto assets from gambling, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/40999/documents/199652/default/">clarifying </a>that it views the industry through the lens of financial services, not gambling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP To Revisit $10 Soon?</strong></h2>



<p>Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP posted an incredible gain of over 70% on the same day as the landmark ruling.</p>



<p>According to well-known crypto strategist CredibleCrypto, there is no reason to be bearish on the fourth-largest cryptocurrency as long as its price remains above the $0.50 region.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As simple as it gets.

</div></figure>



<p>XRP is up 0.1% in the past day, currently changing hands at $0.79, per CoinGecko. The coin enjoyed another price bump this week after a judge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/judge-suggests-its-time-for-sec-to-settle-with-ripple-following-historic-xrp-win/">directed </a>the SEC and Ripple to agree on dates for a possible settlement conference.</p>



<p>Given the bullish regulatory developments, technical advancement, and the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-unseats-bitcoin-as-the-most-traded-crypto-asset-demonstrating-high-confidence/">popularity of the token among retail traders</a>, it is likely XRP could climb to the elusive $10 mark in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Scams and crimes related to cryptocurrencies have seen a significant drop of 65% in the first half of 2023, according to the recently released Crypto Crime Report by Chainalysis. The study highlights a decline in overall illicit revenue in various categories, including scams and darknet markets. In a recent interview with CNBC Crypto World, Jacqueline Burns Koven, the head of cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis, breaks down the data and provides insights into the reasons behind this decline.</p>



<p>Scams, which topped the list of crypto-based crimes, have decreased despite the increase in crypto prices. This may seem counterintuitive, as one would expect higher scam revenue with the growing interest in the crypto space. However, Burns Koven explains that investment scams might become more attractive in the future. She also points out that impersonation scams, particularly those involving authority figures and influencers, have not been significantly affected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-romance-scams-an-ongoing-concern"><strong>Romance Scams – An Ongoing Concern</strong></h2>



<p>The report highlights romance scams as an ongoing concern, as they continue to receive substantial scam payments irrespective of cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Burns Koven emphasizes the need to monitor and address this specific type of scam.</p>



<p>She said, <em>“Romance scams are agnostic to price fluctuations in cryptocurrency and on a per-victim basis are receiving more total scam payments than other types of scams.”</em></p>



<p>Asked about the decline in scams, Burns Koven attributes it to the disappearance of two major scams from the previous year, possibly due to law enforcement activities and pressure.</p>



<p>Noting that while this trend was positive, she said: <em>“This is a fragile trend and we are on the lookout for what the next big scam might be so that we can highlight it to investigators from the private and public sector and try to prevent their customers from sending funds to these scams.”</em></p>



<p>While overall crypto crime has decreased, ransomware attacks have witnessed a surge. The report reveals that ransomware attackers have extorted over $449 million in the first half of 2023, potentially making this year their second most profitable year. Burns Koven points out that this increase can be attributed, at least in part, to the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Russian-based operators have shifted their focus from potential military activities to ransomware attacks.</p>



<p>Another newly uncovered ransomware attack is Clop ransomware, according to Burns Koven, this has exploited a zero-day vulnerability to target numerous victims. Ransom demands have reached eight figures, indicating the growing financial impact of these attacks. The report predicts that if the current pace continues, ransomware attackers could take more than $898 million from victims in 2023, trailing only the figures from 2021.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention Remains Key</strong></h2>



<p>To prevent ransomware attacks, Burns Koven suggests a combination of factors, including law enforcement actions, sanctions, insurance policies that promote stringent security measures, and the availability of decryptors.</p>



<p>She added: <em>“So we&#8217;ve seen private sector companies, as well as law enforcement, come out with decrypters that they&#8217;ve been able to supply to victims so that they wouldn&#8217;t need to actually pay the ransom to get their data back.”</em></p>



<p>Apart from the rise in ransomware attacks, the report highlights the surprising decline in scam revenue, which fell by $3 billion compared to the previous year despite increasing cryptocurrency prices. Burns Koven acknowledges the positive development but stresses the need for continued efforts in education, public advocacy, and victim reporting to identify, track, and mitigate these issues.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Burns Koven advises vigilance since threat actors and scammers constantly adapt to new circumstances. Ransomware attackers, in particular, have been refining their techniques to overcome improved defenses by victims. With rising cryptocurrency prices, scammers will likely devise new tactics to target different victims within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The findings of the Crypto Crime Report for the first half of 2023 signify a positive trend but do not guarantee a sustained decline. Continued efforts from law enforcement, public advocacy, victim reporting, and education will be necessary to mitigate the evolving threat landscape in the crypto space.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom’s HM Treasury has <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/40999/documents/199652/default/">dismissed </a>a House of Commons Treasury Committee recommendation to regulate the crypto industry like gambling, noting that it “firmly disagrees” with the committee’s view.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-british-government-disagrees-with-lawmakers-call"><strong>British Government Disagrees With Lawmakers’ Call</strong></h2>



<p>The British Finance Ministry has thwarted the idea of classing crypto trading as gambling.</p>



<p>Andrew Griffith, U.K. Economic Secretary to the Treasury, told parliament’s Treasury Committee on July 20 that the finance ministry “firmly disagrees” with its recent recommendations to regulate retail trading and investment activity in cryptocurrencies as gambling.</p>



<p>The law change was presented in May 2023 by a panel of British lawmakers. In its proposal, the committee argued that crypto assets had &#8220;no intrinsic value&#8221; and warned against regulating them as financial assets, as it could create a &#8220;halo effect&#8221; that tricks consumers into thinking that investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether is safe.</p>



<p>According to Griffith, such an approach would put the country at odds with globally agreed standards and could push crypto asset activity overseas. Additionally, regulating crypto like gambling would not address some risks, such as market manipulation or unacceptable disclosures associated with trading them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regulating Crypto As A Financial Service</strong></h2>



<p>The government response noted that it is already working on regulating the crypto market, and proposed legislation was introduced to parliament and debated in June.</p>



<p>The statement from the U.K. government further indicated that regulating crypto as financial assets is more suitable for addressing the risks of unbacked cryptocurrencies and creating the conditions necessary for safe innovation.</p>



<p>The rejection comes after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak; last month announced plans to make the country a global Web3 hub. Sunak is intent on providing regulatory clarity concerning how crypto-focused businesses should register and operate within the UK. &#8220;We must embrace new innovations like web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the economy,&#8221; Sunak posited at the time.</p>

<p>Kuwait’s government has hardened its stance against cryptocurrencies, prohibiting the use of digital assets for payments or investments in a bid to clamp down on money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-payments-investments-and-mining-banned-in-kuwait"><strong>Crypto Payments, Investments, And Mining Banned In Kuwait</strong></h2>



<p>Kuwait has made virtually all operations involving cryptocurrencies illegal.</p>



<p>Kuwait’s Capital Markets Authority <a href="https://www.cma.gov.kw/en/web/cma/cma-board-releases/resolutions-and-regulations/-/cmaboardreleases/detail/1384960">issued </a>a circular on the oversight and issuance of virtual assets in the country on July 18. In the said circular, the regulator forbids carrying out transactions that involve using cryptocurrencies as payment tools. Kuwait has also imposed an “absolute ban” on domestic digital asset mining operations and investments and denied recognition of crypto as a decentralized currency.</p>



<p>Moreover, the CMA bans local regulators from giving any licenses permitting companies to offer crypto-related services as a commercial business. The restrictions seek to comply with the Financial Action Task Force&#8217;s (FATF) global recommendations for crypto assets and emerged after an examination into the industry by the National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, according to the regulator.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, securities and other financial instruments regulated by the Central Bank of Kuwait and the Capital Markets Authority are excluded from the ban, the circular indicates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regulator </strong><strong>Warns of Cryptocurrency’s Risks, Cites Unregulated Status</strong></h2>



<p>The Kuwait regulator claims that cryptocurrencies “don’t carry a legal status and are not issued or supported.” CMA further asserted that crypto “is not linked to any asset or issuer, and the prices of these assets are always driven by speculation that exposes them to a sharp decline.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Bitcoin not backed by a central authority, the regulator has urged consumers to exercise caution and remain aware of the risks of the digital currency.</p>



<p>Local reports <a href="https://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/kuwait-implements-ban-on-virtual-currency-transactions/">reveal </a>that the CMA’s crypto prohibitions are part of a new cross-sectoral cryptocurrency ban involving a slew of supervisory powers in Kuwait. The Central Bank of Kuwait, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Insurance Regulatory Unit have all reportedly issued similar circulars.</p>

<p>The upcoming Polygon 2.0 upgrade, designed to position the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/polygon">Polygon</a> network as a “Value Layer of the Internet”, will also introduce a new governance framework to the network and its community members.</p>



<p>Polygon Labs, the software solutions company behind Polygon, took to Twitter to update community members on the new development. In a series of tweets, Polygon Labs explained the framework&#8217;s structure, noting that the new framework will focus on the three main governance aspects. The framework will be built in collaboration with the Polygon community to prioritise decentralisation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ The final announcement of Polygon 2.0 proposes a new governance framework, built in collaboration with the community.<br><br>The framework focuses on three main governance aspects — the three pillars of future development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem. <a href="https://t.co/tWQ2dvuLDO">pic.twitter.com/tWQ2dvuLDO</a></p>&mdash; Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1681667365161795586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As Polygon 2.0 attempts to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-unveils-game-changing-transformation-of-matic-into-versatile-pol-token/">reimagine the entire Polygon network</a>, changing the ecosystem&#8217;s governance model is also necessary, Polygon Labs explains in a recent blog post. The three governance pillars of the new structure include Protocol governance, System smart contacts governance and Community treasure governance.</p>



<p>Protocol governance is a Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework that provides an open coordination platform for developing Polygon protocols. It imitates the frameworks utilized by IETF, Python, Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>The framework is already live and fully functional on the Polygon network and is being utilized by internal and external actors to propose upgrades.</p>



<p>On Polygon 2.0, the PIP framework will expand and cover the Polygon permissionless stack. This will go on to provide a formal research pattern for the community and propose upgrades that could eventually become a part of the network’s protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the System smart contacts governance pillar seeks to facilitate the upgrade of protocol components implemented as smart contracts. Although the PIP framework can enable these protocols, the structure of Ethereum smart contracts requires additional governance of the upgrade process. </p>



<p><em>“To ensure the ongoing upgradeability of the aforementioned protocol components, we’re proposing the introduction of the Ecosystem Council, a community-governed body responsible for upgrading system smart contracts.” The blog post stated.</em></p>



<p>Polygon recognizes that its network and the broader Web3 industry are still in the beginning stages of development and adoption. As such, sustaining growth on the network and in the industry will require continuous long-term support. This is where the Community treasury comes in. The treasury, a self-sustainable ecosystem fund, was proposed in a tokenomics whitepaper. The funding will be used to support programs for emerging ecosystem projects and initiatives while also being utilized for public goods.</p>

<p>Last week’s highly publicized decision in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against Ripple, touted by many as a significant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">victory against the SEC</a> and Chairman Gary Gensler, may not be the end of the story. </p>



<p>Former SEC attorney, John Reed Stark, cautions against premature celebrations, pointing out the decision&#8217;s shaky ground and the likelihood of an appeal that could result in a reversal. Stark&#8217;s perspective challenges the prevailing narrative surrounding the ruling.</p>



<p>The court ruling on the Ripple case categorizes the company&#8217;s offering of securities into three distinct categories: institutional sales, programmatic sales, and other sales. The court&#8217;s ruling on each category is critical in determining the legal implications for Ripple and its investors.</p>



<p>Regarding institutional sales, the court deemed Ripple&#8217;s sale of XRP to sophisticated individuals and entities a violation of securities laws. The court ruled that XRP was a security during these transactions, entitling investors to rescission and imposing penalties on Ripple.</p>



<p>In addition, the court dismissed Ripple&#8217;s attempt to reimagine the conventional Howey test by introducing a new test known as the &#8220;Essential Ingredients Test.&#8221; Additionally, it rejected Ripple&#8217;s claim that, according to the Howey framework, an &#8220;investment of money&#8221; differs from &#8220;merely payment of money.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the case of programmatic sales, where XRP was sold to the public on digital asset exchanges, the court ruled that XRP ceased to be a security once it was sold anonymously to exchanges. The court concluded that the sources of programmatic buyers&#8217; profit expectations were independent of Ripple&#8217;s efforts.</p>



<p>According to Stark, this presumption ignores the possibility that many programmatic buyers purchased XRP, expecting to profit from Ripple&#8217;s endeavours, undermining investor protection principles.</p>



<p>The last category, &#8220;Other Distributions,&#8221; involved written contracts with Ripple, where $609 million in non-cash consideration was recorded in Ripple&#8217;s audited financial statements. These distributions included compensation for employees and support for Ripple&#8217;s Xpring initiative.</p>



<p>Stark expresses his concerns regarding the Ripple decision, highlighting several troubling aspects. Firstly, the decision grants full SEC protection and remedies to institutional investors while leaving retail investors without any SEC protection, a seemingly backward approach, according to Stark.</p>



<p>Secondly, he argues that the ruling implies that securities regulations do not apply if tokens are sold through exchanges, based on the presumption that exchange customers are ignorant of the token issuer&#8217;s identity. However, Stark finds this argument contradicts established principles of securities law.</p>



<p>Stark argues that even if retail investors are uninformed or refuse to conduct research, their investments should still be considered securities. Retail investors speculatively buy tokens, banking on the &#8220;Greater Fool Theory.&#8221; Stark argues that the court&#8217;s decision seems to transform tokens from securities when sold to institutional investors into &#8220;not securities&#8221; when sold on exchanges, an inconsistent stance with basic investing principles.</p>



<p>He finds the court&#8217;s distinction between tokens awarded to employees and third parties also problematic. Stark points out that these distributions should be considered compensation, similar to restricted stock units or stock options, and therefore subject to securities laws.</p>



<p>Additionally, the ruling seems to go against SEC precedent regarding the volume of consideration required to bring on registration requirements. Stark references past SEC cases involving &#8220;free stock&#8221; offerings, where a nominal review was sufficient to require registration. The court&#8217;s refusal to consider the employee and third-party distributions as securities due to a lack of consideration contradicts this precedent.</p>



<p>Stark said, <em>“The trial order in the Ripple case is a partial summary judgment from a single district court judge. While important and certainly worthy of study, the decision is not binding precedent on other courts.”</em></p>



<p>Appeals and future cases could yield different interpretations and outcomes, highlighting the complexity of crypto-related legal matters.</p>



<p>Stark predicts that <em>“the SEC will likely appeal the Ripple decision to the 2nd Circuit, where the District Court&#8217;s rulings on ‘programmatic’ and ‘other sales’ may be overturned.”</em> Otherwise, the ruling could set a precedent that exempts specific tokens from securities regulations based on investor sophistication and ignorance.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/u-s-banks-could-be-exploring-xrp-for-cross-border-payments-following-ripples-legal-victory/">Ripple decision</a> raises issues surrounding investor protection, the distinction between institutional and retail investors, and the classification of tokens as securities. The future of the case remains uncertain, and the broader implications of this ruling could shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency offerings.</p>

<p>A recent survey by the online cryptocurrency portal CryptoVantage focused on American attitudes toward cryptocurrencies and produced some intriguing findings. According to the study, 78% of respondents think <a href="https://zycrypto.com/nydig-predicts-spot-bitcoin-etfs-could-unlock-30-billion-in-fresh-demand/">Bitcoin</a> will surpass its previous record high, but only 23% think it will peak in the upcoming year, and 47% think it will happen over the next five years. Only 8% of people believe Bitcoin will never hit its all-time high again.</p>



<p>Interestingly, 21% of respondents think Dogecoin (DOGE) has the highest chance of ever outpacing Bitcoin in market value, while 46% of Americans think Ethereum (ETH) has the best chance.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Q2 2023 Signals Report&#8221; from Fidelity Digital Assets, which was released on July 18, 2023, also contained some intriguing data on the development and prospects for Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>According to the research, Bitcoin and Ether have a solid growth path ahead. With a gain of about 85% year-to-date (YTD), Bitcoin has maintained significant price levels as on-chain indicators stabilize post-speculative activity. With a YTD increase of almost 62%, Ether displays potentially positive price signals and growing on-chain metrics.</p>



<p>There has been a net decrease in the supply of more than 700,000 Ether since the eagerly anticipated &#8220;Merge&#8221; in September 2022, suggesting less issuance. The growing number of Ethereum addresses performing their first transaction indicates a healthy network adoption.</p>



<p>Additionally, there were 15% more active Ethereum validators in the second quarter, indicating a rise in network security awareness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-growth-beyond-2023"><strong>Growth Beyond 2023</strong></h2>



<p>However, a lot is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem regarding new developments, and the community is eagerly anticipating significant changes predicted to increase platform usage and user interest. Two crucial actions that will soon be implemented and are projected to improve the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-ico-whale-reawakens-after-8-years-of-dormancy-moves-116-million/">Ethereum ecosystem</a> considerably are the adoption of EIP4844 and the launch of the base mainnet.</p>



<p>The much-anticipated improvement EIP4844, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year, seeks to significantly lower costs related to rollups. To boost Ethereum&#8217;s transaction throughput while retaining its security, rollups are a layer 2 scaling solution. This change will probably improve user experience and entice more developers to the platform by lowering rollup expenses.</p>



<p>With the potential to bring millions of additional users to the ecosystem, launching the basic mainnet is another crucial milestone for Ethereum. The mainnet&#8217;s extension will enable easier onboarding and participation in the Ethereum network as the popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain applications soars. This improved accessibility may lead to a major rise in the acceptance and usage of Ethereum.</p>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s rollup solutions are undergoing general enhancements in addition to these essential ones, which will help users and developers. These improvements are anticipated to improve the platform&#8217;s layer 2 solutions&#8217; general performance, effectiveness, and usability, encouraging more usage and innovation within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Ethereum community is anticipating the vibrant growth of new applications on rollups, layer 2s, and layer 3. Through these developments, novel DeFi platforms, autonomous worlds, and the tokenization of physical assets are all predicted to emerge. It is anticipated that the Ethereum ecosystem will experience a surge of innovative and disruptive applications as developers explore the potential of these new capabilities.</p>

<p>Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could attract $30 billion in fresh demand for the flagship cryptocurrency, a new prediction says.</p>



<p>In a recent research report, the Global Head of Research at Crypto investment firm NYDIG, Greg Cipolaro, delivered a bold vision of how the arrival of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be a game changer for the world’s oldest and largest crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-will-open-door-to-30-billion-inflows"><strong>A Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Open Door To $30 Billion Inflows</strong></h2>



<p>$10 billion in new demand could suddenly unlock for the Bitcoin market if a spot ETF is approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to NYDIG.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock&#8217;s filing</a> for a spot crypto ETF last month sparked a new wave of optimism in the crypto space, which prompted other large Wall Street institutions, including ARK Invest, Valkyrie, and Fidelity to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">file </a>their applications for a physically settled Bitcoin ETF. </p>



<p>The SEC has capsized all previous applicants looking to offer spot investment vehicles with direct exposure to BTC but started<a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-the-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-debuts-grayscale-ceo-sees-an-ethereum-etf-rolling-out/"> greenlighting ETFs linked to BTC futures</a> in 2021. In June, the SEC gave its regulatory blessing to a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF, one of the first of its kind in the U.S.</p>



<p>While a spot ETF has not yet hit the market in the U.S., NYDIG estimates that a total of $28.8 billion in Bitcoin assets under management already exists across the globe. Of these, $27.6 billion has been allocated to spot-like investment products.</p>



<p>NYDIG’s Greg Cipolaro notes that a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC’s approval would be a safer bet for investors and act as a reliable choice of investment especially because of BlackRock and iShares brand recognition.</p>



<p>Cipolaro then went on to present an interesting analogy between Bitcoin and gold — two assets that are oftentimes compared to each other. Gold ETFs around the world reportedly hold roughly $210 billion in AUM, NYIG notes. Remarkably, a bigger portion of Bitcoin’s supply (4.9%) is held in various fund formats compared to gold (1.6%). When considering private investments, the ratio is more favorable for Bitcoin compared to the yellow metal, which entails coins and bars.</p>



<p>NYDIG further uses a volatility equivalent basis to estimate potential demand for a spot Bitcoin ETF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bitcoin is about 3.6x more volatile than gold, meaning that on a volatility equivalent basis, investors would require 3.6x less bitcoin than gold on a dollar basis to get as much risk exposure. Still, that would result in nearly $30B of incremental demand for a bitcoin ETF,” Cipolaro writes.</p>



<p>So, as the trend goes, Bitcoin is looking optimistic in both value and regulation as institutional trust returns to the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While NYDIG thinks having spot Bitcoin ETFs in the market could herald a new stage of institutional investors getting involved with the cryptocurrency, not everyone is convinced such a product would be of great benefit to the nascent industry. JPMorgan <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs-wont-be-a-game-changer-for-crypto-industry-jpmorgan-strategists-opine/">said </a>earlier this month that Bitcoin spot ETFs have not seen any substantial success in overseas markets like Canada and Europe, where they have existed for years. As such, there is no reason for them to gain much traction in the U.S. if they do receive the SEC’s seal of approval.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/ripple">Ripple</a>, blockchain and crypto technologies are attracting the interest of global financial executives as they present a potential solution to modernize the underlying infrastructure of international payments. A recent report by Ripple Labs reveals that 44% of survey respondents expect payments to be the biggest driver of crypto adoption, with cross-border payments being a top use case for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/xrp">XRP</a>.</p>



<p>Traditional payments, especially cross-border ones, often rely on legacy rails that can take days to settle transactions.</p>



<p>“In contrast, blockchain and digital asset technologies provide a seamless global infrastructure in which payments can be sent and received anytime, anywhere, instantly with lower fees and 360 visibility”, the <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/how-finance-leaders-believe-crypto-is-reshaping-payments">report</a> by Ripple states.</p>



<p>Digital-first finance is expanding rapidly; by 2025, it&#8217;s estimated that over 65% of Americans will use mobile banking, and by 2024, internet banking in Asia will have about 1 billion users. Despite these digital banking services&#8217; user-friendly interfaces, the underlying technology is still out-of-date.</p>



<p>Beneath the modern apps lie an old-fashioned payment rail system built before the internet and mobile phones. The complexity of legacy systems and the need for intermediaries introduce delays and inefficiencies, hindering real-time transactions. Moving funds internationally is even more cumbersome due to regulatory requirements, currency exchanges, time zones, and limited hours of operation, resulting in slow and expensive processes.</p>



<p>According to the Ripple report, cross-border payments are vital to the global economy, underpinning international trade, supply chains, corporate treasury flows, and funding non-governmental organizations. However, the frictions in the current system inflate the time and costs for these transactions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-payments-fuel-shift-in-finance"><strong>Crypto Payments Fuel Shift in Finance</strong></h2>



<p>Fortunately, cross-border payments have emerged as a robust use case for crypto and blockchain technology because they facilitate interoperability between tokens or chains. Crypto-enabled payments allow for the quick movement of digital assets between chains, liquidating them into fiat currencies for faster, affordable, and transparent transactions.</p>



<p>And the market is by no means small, as global payments powered by crypto assets like XRP are projected to reach $250 trillion by 2027. The advantages of using crypto for cross-border payments are evident, with over half of global payments and treasury professionals seeing faster payments and cost savings as critical reasons for adoption.</p>



<p>More than 80% of top financial executives worldwide predict that their companies will embrace cryptocurrencies over the next three years. Blockchain technology is paving the way for seamless global payments by solving the drawbacks of conventional payment systems, enabling instantaneous transactions for people, companies, and banks anywhere.</p>



<p>Financial institutions, regulators, and companies are collaborating to unleash the potential of blockchain to create a new and effective payment environment as the world proceeds toward this seismic upheaval in finance.</p>

<p>After Judge Torres handed down her <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">verdict in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit</a> last Thursday, a lot has been said about what the ruling actually means. The reactions have been very mixed, perhaps rightfully so, reflecting the case&#8217;s complexity and importance.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to put a positive spin on the outcome by claiming victory. The SEC stated it was <em>“pleased that the court has found that XRP tokens were offered and sold by Ripple as investment contracts in certain circumstances, in violation of securities laws.”</em></p>



<p>However, rather than a win for the SEC or Ripple, the decision was a split one, with each of the parties having a win. In a nutshell, the judge delivered a divided verdict, partially ruling on both parties&#8217; motions for summary judgment, which had asked the court to decide without consulting a jury of peers.</p>



<p>Some crypto community members have questioned the judgment, with former SEC lawyer John Reed Stark voicing his concerns about the ruling and advising against hasty celebrations among the cryptocurrency community. He claimed that the court had turned investor protection on its head.</p>



<p>However, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal commented, <em>“Don’t be misled that Judge Torres ruled that sometimes XRP is a security and sometimes it isn’t. That’s exactly the opposite of what she ruled: XRP itself is NEVER a security.”</em></p>



<p>Judge Torres found that <em>“XRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a ‘contract, transaction [,] or scheme’ that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.”</em></p>



<p>According to the judge, XRP programmatic sales are not unregistered securities offerings. The judge made it clear that because it was unrelated to the case, the decision did not examine whether XRP&#8217;s secondary market sales constituted offers and sales of investment contracts. Rather, the judge ruled that institutional XRP sales were unlawful because they were unregistered securities transactions.</p>



<p>When buying XRP from Ripple, institutions received investment papers and signed contracts on paper. Despite being required by law, Ripple never reported the sales. Consequently, the court ruled against Ripple here.</p>



<p>However, programmatic sales and other XRP distribution methods were recognized as legitimate. The judge ruled that no one had paid money to obtain these distributions; thus, there were no unregistered investment contracts. Programmatic sales involved anonymous bid/ask exchanges carried out by algorithms, with buyers being unaware of the identity of the sellers.</p>



<p>This is probably seen as the biggest win for XRP retail investors and the 75000 holders represented by lawyer John E. Deaton as Amicus or friends to the court.</p>



<p>Judge Torres referred to the Amicus and their Affidavits in her ruling, citing that it was impossible to know why people had bought XRP on exchanges, which means the decision could have been easily very different if not for the 75000 Amicus’.</p>



<p>In the end, while individual defendants wait for their trials to determine whether the two Ripple executives aided and abetted Ripple concerning Institutional sales, the question is: Will Judge Torres&#8217; summary ruling be appealed? Either party may appeal the decision; however, such a request is known as an interlocutory appeal, and only very seldom are they granted, according to a lawyer and a close observer of the case, Jeremy Hogan.</p>



<p>The likelihood of appeals occurring after the trial is higher, according to Hogan, and as appeals naturally take a long time to resolve, the judgment will likely stand through and into 2025, which is a considerable amount of time and may give the US Congress time to carve out more transparent regulations.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a year since Elon Musk&#8217;s electric car company Tesla <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-above-22k-even-as-elon-musks-tesla-dumps-75-of-its-btc-holdings/">sold 75% of its Bitcoin stash</a>. However, Tesla remains one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. The company&#8217;s BTC holdings remain unchanged for the straight quarter in Q2 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tesla-s-diamond-hands"><strong>Tesla’s Diamond Hands</strong></h2>



<p>In its <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/TSLA-Q2-2023-Update.pdf">latest earnings report</a> released Wednesday, Tesla revealed it had neither sold nor bought any Bitcoin in the second quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>The value of its Bitcoin cache at the end of the quarter stood at $184 million, the same as it has been for the past three quarters. The valuation of the stockpile remained flat even as BTC rose to about $30,500 at the end of Q2 from $27,900 three months earlier, as existing accounting laws don&#8217;t permit such gains to be booked.</p>



<p>Tesla had not sold any more Bitcoin since July last year when it infamously offloaded $936 million worth of BTC, with Musk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwpYe1Empwo&amp;ab_channel=Tesla">pointing to </a>uncertainty surrounding lockdowns in China and the need to maximize the company&#8217;s cash to justify the sale.</p>



<p>The sell-off in July 2022 left the electric car manufacturer with approximately 10,725 Bitcoins on its balance sheet. Despite all the turmoil and uncertainty in the markets, Tesla has continued to hold on to its remaining BTC, leaving crypto fans wondering whether the Musk-helmed company plans to buy more bitcoin soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tesla And Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>In February 2021, Tesla <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-takes-crypto-enthusiasm-to-a-whole-new-level-as-tesla-invests-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin/">invested an astounding $1.5 billion in Bitcoin</a>, making it one of the biggest corporate holders of the premier crypto — second only to Michael Saylor&#8217;s MicroStrategy. At the time, Bitcoin traded at around $45,000 per coin, and Tesla had also started accepting Bitcoin payments. By November of the same year, Bitcoin posted its lifetime high of $69,044.</p>



<p>However, the love affair between Tesla and Bitcoin ended in May 2021 after the company <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-pokes-massive-hole-in-the-bitcoin-market-after-halting-bitcoin-payments-at-tesla/">suspended </a>BTC as a payment option, with Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">citing </a>concerns &#8220;about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions.&#8221;</p>



<p>This year, Bitcoin has noticeably outperformed most traditional stocks and bonds and has recouped the losses incurred from the cryptocurrency contagions induced by FTX and Terra-Luna catastrophe.</p>



<p>Besides Bitcoin, Tesla is also believed to hold Dogecoin, as it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-set-to-break-new-grounds-as-elon-musk-announces-tesla-will-accept-doge-for-merchandise/">accepts </a>the canine-themed crypto as payment for merchandise, and Musk is a<a href="https://zycrypto.com/keen-on-dogecoin-beating-bitcoin-hands-down-elon-musk-backs-new-doge-upgrade/"> self-avowed evangelist</a>.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs’ <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-good-bad-and-the-complicated-from-the-sec-vs-ripple-verdict-as-bulls-envision-10-xrp-price/">split victory</a> over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) elicited waves of optimism for Coinbase in its case against the regulator. However, analysts have warned that the exchange still faces an uphill climb.</p>



<p>Berenberg Capital Markets noted in a new report that the SEC still has a strong case against Coinbase regarding the status of several offerings. According to the report, the allegations of Coinbase offering unregistered securities to the public hold substance as evidence in the exchange’s recent move.</p>



<p>Barely a day after the court ruled that XRP did not amount to a security, Coinbase moved to suspend the operations of its staking service in four U.S. states. Coinbase stated in its announcement that pausing its staking service is not an admission of guilt but is designed to allow the legal proceedings to run their full course.</p>



<p>However, Berenberg warned that halting the staking service “serves as a reminder to investors that Coinbase is far from being in the clear” The analysts cited a statement from Coinbase that although no customer has lost assets through staking, there are several risks associated with the offering.</p>



<p>Experts have pointed out that the SEC will be pinning the bulk of its argument on Coinbase’s submission that staking poses a measure of risk to investors.</p>



<p>Back in March, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">issued</a> a Wells notice to Coinbase confirming the start of enforcement action against the U.S.-based exchange. The SEC is accusing the exchange of running an unregistered securities exchange and offering the public unregistered securities through Coinbase Earn, its staking service.</p>



<p>Despite Berenberg’s warning, a number of Wall Street Banks have hailed XRP’s ruling as a net positive for Coinbase, expecting the exchange to include it in its defense.</p>



<p><em>“We view the ruling as incrementally positive for Coinbase, given the interpretation that in some cases a token may not be a security,”</em> said U.K.-based Barclays Bank. <em>“This may also provide incremental clarity for future token issuances.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-faults-the-sec"><strong>Coinbase faults the SEC</strong></h2>



<p>While both parties head to court, Coinbase has made some scathing allegations against the SEC, eliminating a settlement option.</p>



<p>Coinbase refuted all allegations of breaching securities laws, saying that it had sought the SEC’s feedback on its crypto rules but received “none” from the commission.</p>



<p><em>“We also reiterated that we stand by our listings process &#8211; we don’t list securities today &#8211; and repeatedly invited the SEC to raise any questions about any asset at all on our platform,” </em><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/we-asked-the-sec-for-reasonable-crypto-rules-for-americans-we-got-legal">said</a> Coinbase. <em>“We met with the SEC more than 30 times over nine months, but we were doing all of the talking.”</em></p>

<p>Stock market operator Nasdaq has ended its plans to provide its highly-anticipated crypto custody service, citing the ongoing regulatory conditions in the United States as the key reason for their decision. The service was scheduled to go live in the second quarter of this year. The sudden reversal of the custody plans marks a notable setback to the institutional adoption of crypto in the U.S.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nasdaq-halts-plan-for-institutional-crypto-custody-service"><strong>Nasdaq Halts Plan For Institutional Crypto Custody Service</strong></h2>



<p>CEO Adena Friedman announced that Nasdaq has dropped its plans for a Bitcoin custody service during the company’s Q2 results call.</p>



<p><em>“This quarter, considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the United States, we have made the decision to halt our launch of the U.S. digital assets custodian business and our related efforts to pursue relevant license,” Friedman indicated.</em></p>



<p>The Nasdaq boss stressed that the firm would “remain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem.” Friedman highlighted intentions to pursue collaborations with potential ETF issuers:</p>



<p>“We continue to build and deliver technology capabilities that position Nasdaq as a leading digital assets software solutions provider to the broader global industry.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Bane For Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>News <a href="https://zycrypto.com/nasdaq-scales-up-crypto-ambitions-by-introducing-custody-service-for-institutional-players/">emerged </a>last year that Nasdaq was intending to roll out a crypto custody service in a bid to capture institutional investor interest. However, regulators in the U.S. have embarked on their most harrowing crackdown on crypto yet — initiating lawsuits against a number of high-profile companies.</p>



<p>The exchange operator had been awaiting permission from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) by the end of June to start offering custodial services to customers. Nasdaq was targeting a launch by the end of this month.</p>



<p>But the company has decided to rethink its involvement in the crypto custody business and its efforts to seek the requisite licenses for the service amid the regulatory uncertainty and heightened scrutiny of crypto-related offerings.</p>



<p>This surprising turnabout is a big blow to greater institutional adoption as concerns of a possible exodus of crypto firms to more friendly jurisdictions arise. Sadly, the U.S. is becoming a hostile place for the crypto industry to do business. The actions of the SEC and its chair Gary Gensler against the world&#8217;s foremost exchanges, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>, have the crypto sector reeling.</p>



<p>Even so, there does seem to be institutional demand in the industry: BlackRock — and a slew of other prominent asset management firms — have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">submitted </a>applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETF products. In fact, Nasdaq has partnered with BlackRock— the world’s largest asset manager — for the application, which is presently being <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">examined </a>by the SEC.</p>

<p>In a landmark ruling, Judge Analisa Torres of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sided with Fintech company Ripple and decided that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">XRP was not necessarily a security</a>. Ripple, the company behind the cryptocurrency, now expects U.S. banks and financial institutions to use XRP for cross-border payments.</p>



<p>In an interview with CNBC, Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the company anticipates starting discussions with American financial institutions about adopting its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. According to the San Francisco firm, XRP enables ODL to provide near-instantaneous money movement across borders.</p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chair Chris Larsen, in December 2020, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">alleging the illegal sale of $1.3 billion worth of XRP</a>. Contrary to several of the SEC&#8217;s allegations against Ripple, the New York judge recently ruled that XRP was not, in essence, a security.</p>



<p>Stuart Alderoty was optimistic about the ruling prompting American banks to return to Ripple and utilize its ODL product, further stating, “I think we’re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business, real-world problems in terms of moving value across borders without incurring obscene fees.”</p>



<p>Ripple uses ODL, which utilizes XRP as an intermediary currency, enabling instant liquidity sourcing and real-time fund transfers. ODL is used by various businesses, including payment service providers, fintech companies involved in business-to-business transactions, and organizations seeking to transfer internal treasury payments to foreign accounts.</p>

<p>Interestingly while both Ripple and the SEC claim victory in the case, Judge Torres did make a split decision, granting that XRP itself was not a security. She also acknowledged that certain token sales qualified as securities transactions to institutional investors. The judge stated that approximately $728.9 million of such XRP sales did meet the criteria of securities, citing the ‘presence of a common enterprise and an expectation of profit’.</p>



<p>With Ripple&#8217;s core business operating outside the United States, most of its customers and revenue originate internationally. Although Ripple, which has approximately 900 employees globally, maintains a significant presence in the United States, Alderoty explained that since Ripple&#8217;s primary customer base is outside the United States, this aspect of the ruling would not immediately impact the company&#8217;s existing operations.</p>
