Bitcoin price just experienced one of its fastest and sharpest corrections in over a year, dropping 10% in a matter of minutes. The mass liquidations and panic from the selloff caused BTCUSD daily charts to reach the most oversold level since the COVID crash in early 2020. BTC Panic-Selling Reaches Extremes Not Seen Since COVID Crash As much as people try to fight it, investing and trading is an emotion-driven process. Few emotions cause humans to take action more urgently than those associated with fear and panic. This is precisely why selloffs tend to be sharper and scarier than bull markets. “Bulls take the stairs, bears ride the elevator” is just one adage that symbolizes this noted market behavior.

This instance was the last time the Relative Strength Index technical indicator on the daily timeframe became this oversold. After Bitcoin’s recently drop this week, the daily RSI is back at a similar extreme for the first time in more than three years. What isn’t clear quite yet, is if the extreme represents another ideal buying opportunity, or if this is the onset of a deeper decline. The RSI has reached the deepest reading in years &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Daily RSI Plunges To Most Oversold Level Since 2020 The Relative Strength Index is a momentum indicator that tells investors and traders when an asset is overbought and oversold on a relative basis. When the tool reaches extremes above 70 or below 30, it can present an opportunity to buy or sell. The RSI is now lower than the LUNA or FTX collapse, or at any point since March 2020. During especially strong moves, however, the RSI can remain elevated for extended phases despite reaching such overheated readings. Such was the case in December 2018, the previous instance of the daily Bitcoin RSI reaching such a low.

A 40% correction in Bitcoin would take prices back to the November 2022 bottom. If Bitcoin instead rebounds and reacts more akin to 2020, new all-time highs could be just months away. If not, a deeper reset is possible. #Bitcoin daily RSI is now the most oversold in all of 2023 Act accordingly pic.twitter.com/GpKFAvsonc &#8212; Tony &#34;The Bull&#34; (@tonythebullBTC) August 17, 2023 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.
