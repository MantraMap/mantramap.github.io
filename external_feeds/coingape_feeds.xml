During this downfall, the price was constantly wobbling between two parallel trendlines indicating the formation <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">falling channel pattern</a>. In theory, even though this pattern carries an established downtrend, the trades can find an excellent long-entry opportunity upon breaking the pattern resistance trendline. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Near protocol coin breakout from the resistance trendline set the price for an early 18% rise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily RSI shows a sharp breakout from the midline, indicating the intense buying pressure in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the NEAR price is $322.5 Million, indicating a 327% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/j/jDoEXybk.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-ethereum-price-prediction-as-the-crypto-market-struggle-in-uncertainty/">uncertainty in the crypto market</a>, the falling Near protocol coin price turned sideways above the $1.23 support. Within the past three weeks, the price rebounded twice from this support indicating the buyers are actively defending this level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 1st, the NEAR price took its second reversal from the $1.23 support as the majority cryptocurrency witnessed a new year rally. The coin price has risen for four consecutive days and registered a 26% gain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, today’s price jump contributed the most to the aforementioned growth and gave a massive breakout from the pattern’s resistance trendline. In addition, the rising volume action showcases the buyer&#8217;s strong interest in chasing higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price sustains above the breached trendline, the buyers may drive the prices 18% higher to hit the $1.83 mark. However, an ideal target for this technical setup would be the higher swing high of this pattern, which for the NEAR price is $6.12.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the coin price plunge below the trendline again, the bullish ones will get invalidated.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength indicator:</strong> contrary to the falling price, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> rising high indicate the market participants are in favor of a bullish recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the rising price breaks above the 20-day EMA, indicating an early sign of trend reversal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near Protocol coin intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $1.5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $1.83 and $2.3</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $1.48 and $1.23</span></li>

<h2>Polygon-based Savage Partners With Samsung</h2>
<p>Savage claims that its Smart TV app is able to assist in the seamless integration of an IRL display. In addition to this, the app is protected by rights-managed contracts that are integrated into the metadata, and as a result, it has the potential to reach more than 25 million households.</p>
<p>In addition to that, it gives customers the ability to access high-quality uploads from any marketplace. As stated in the most recent post made by Savage, the maximum size of these uploads is 8K.

<h2>Polygon&#8217;s Growing Applications</h2>
<p>Polygon has retained its commitment to fostering the growth of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi applications</a>. With a strong acceptance rate, Polygon now houses over 53,000 decentralized projects as of the time of this publication.

<p>Additionally, in November, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/meta/">Meta</a> released a toolset that allows Instagram users to mint and sell <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFTs</a> through the Polygon platform.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In terms of value, the cryptocurrency market as a whole, including Cardano (ADA), had a turbulent year in 2022.

However, in the past twenty-four hours, the trade volume for ADA has reached around $250 million, while the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/">Cardano (ADA)</a> price has increased by almost 7% in a day. This is mostly attributable to the purchase of enormous quantities of ADA by whales as well as the project attracting the majority of development activity last year.</p>
<h2>Cardano (ADA) Price Soars</h2>
<p>The price of Cardano&#8217;s native token, ADA, has finally risen from a two-year low of $0.24, where it arrived after a prolonged four-week slide. ADA recovered a little over a third of its value in January of the new year after losing more than 25% of its value at the start of December 2022.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134210" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04221926/chrome_9ZChLnyPKl.png" alt="" width="909" height="488" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that the expansion of the Cardano DeFi ecosystem was responsible for some of the positive movements in the price of ADA. According to data provided by DeFiLlama, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/tvl-total-value-locked/#:~:text=Total%20Value%20Locked%20aka%20TVL,TVL%20is%20marketcap%20for%20cryptocurrencies.">Total Value Locked (TVL)</a> has increased from its previous low point of $48.95 million on January 1 to its current level of $52.53 million.</p>
<h2>Massive Whale Activity</h2>
<p>The participation of larger ADA investors could be another factor contributing to the price increase. According to the statistics provided by WhaleStats, large BSC whales also have a significant interest in purchasing Cardano (ADA) tokens.</p>
<p>The 4,000 largest BSC whale purchases in the previous 24 hours have been attributed to ADA purchases, and therefore ranks within the top 10 list of mass whale activities. In addition, the top BSC whales have a combined total of 19.9 million ADA in their <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">wallets</a>, which is equivalent to $5.19 million at the current market price and accounts for 0.68% of the total supply.</p>

<h2>Cardano With Most Dev Activity</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/top-10-blockchains-devactivity-2022-7157">report</a> that was published by Santiment, a behavior analysis platform, Cardano ranked as the most active protocol in terms of the development activity. This was followed by <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/polkadot/">Polkadot (DOT)</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cosmos/">Cosmos (ATOM)</a>, which were ranked as the second and third most active protocols, respectively.</p>

<p>Given that the development activity rates in Cardano&#8217;s public GitHub repositories in November were 18% higher than those of the next-ranked asset, which recorded 572.67 produced events, the most recent data are a confirmation of its prior performance.</p>
<p>As things stand, the Cardano (ADA) price is currently being traded at $0.28. This represents an increase of 0.2% in the past 1 hour, in contrast to a whopping 7.3% during the last 24 hours as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

This consolidation phase in the crypto market shaped the bitcoin price into a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double-bottom pattern</a>. This pattern displays itself as the letter W and is one of the most common technical chart patterns observed in market bottoms. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area between the $16300 and $16920 mark can be considered a no-trading zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the high possibility, a bullish breakout from $16920 will replenish the trapped bullish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $16.2 Billion, indicating a 22.9% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/fJj7x2m5.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-to-tank-to-10k-in-first-quarter-says-vaneck/">Bitcoin price</a> action forming a W letter projects that the coin has rebounded twice from the same horizontal support level ($16300) and keeps the neckline resistance($16920). Amid the recovery sentiment in the crypto market that has arisen since the beginning of 2023, the Bitcoin price rebounded from the $16300 support and rose 3.65%, and hit the $16920 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bullish recovery backed by rising volume indicates a sustained recovery in prices. By the press time, the Bitcoin price trades at $16855 and still struggles to break the neckline resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, until the BTC price wavers between the mentioned level, the potential traders should avoid entering the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a daily candle closing above $16920 will trigger the bullish pattern and intensify the underlying bullish momentum. The post-breakout rally may drive the coin price 2.6% higher and surpass another resistance barrier of $17360.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> while the Bitcoin price is still moving sideways, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a>, which determines the strength in recent price action, is moving upwards. Thus, this positive divergence indicates a higher possibility for a $16920 breakout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band indicator:</strong> the recent recovery has pushed the coin price above the indicator’s midline, indicating bullish sentiment among the coin traders. However, the upper band of the indicator resides near $16920, increasing the resistance power if the level.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $16855</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $16930 and $17360</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $16330 and $15600</span></li>

The top cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has been stagnant around the current level owing to market uncertainties. In November 2022, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a> faced a major blow with the liquidation crisis around FTX and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>. It remains to be seen how the macroeconomic outlook would affect crypto prices.</p>

<h2>FOMC Minutes Impact On BTC</h2>
<p>The crypto trading community pinned its hopes on a positive push for BTC price. More importantly, the outcome for BTC would depend on the Fed&#8217;s comments on stopping the interest rate hike at some point this year. The central bank had in its December policy meeting indicated that interest rates would continue to rise in 2023. This announcement led to a price drop in cryptocurrencies. The US Fed&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced an <a href="https://coingape.com/fed-rate-hike-crypto-prices/">interest rate hike by 0.50%</a> in December meeting, leading to a decline in stock prices.</p>
<p>In what appears to be in anticipation of some positive macro news, BTC price is on an upward curve in the last few hours. As of writing, BTC price stands at $16,867, up 1.30% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. Also, the trading volume for BTC rose by around 24% in the last 24 hours. Compared with the price a week ago, the cryptocurrency gained reasonably in value.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is yet to break the key resistance at $16,900, in the last few weeks. This crucial resistance could be a point of target for traders if there is any positive indication from the FOMC minutes.</p>

This comes after Gemini’s co-founder <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cameron-winklevoss/">Cameron Winklevoss</a> penned an open letter highlighting the delay in resuming withdrawals for his Gemini exchange, which has a partnership with the company&#8217;s subsidiary DCG.</p>
<h2>Genesis To Take More Time</h2>
<p>Following the failure of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> exchange in November, Genesis secured $900 million in customer cash belonging to clients of the retail <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> Gemini. At the beginning of December, Genesis stated that a resolution of some kind would likely be a matter of &#8220;weeks&#8221; rather than days, despite rumors that an immediate solution or even a bankruptcy file was on the horizon.</p>

<p>In a letter that was addressed to the brokerage&#8217;s clients on Wednesday, Derar Islim was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>While we are committed to moving as quickly as possible, this is a very complex process that will take some additional time,</p></blockquote>
<p>Genesis further stated that the firm is continuing its work with advisors while maintaining its key focus on seeking a remedy for the borrowing &amp; lending business.</p>
<h2>Genesis &amp; DCG&#8217;s Dire Attempts</h2>
<p>In another letter that was sent out to investors on November 23, Genesis stated that it had begun discussions with potential investors as well as their largest creditors and borrowers, including <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dcg/">DCG</a> (Digital Currency Group), to agree on a solution that shores up their lending business&#8217; overall liquidity and also addresses clients&#8217; needs.</p>
<p>On Monday, Winklevoss started a Twitter spat by publishing an <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-gemini-cofounder-blames-dcgs-barry-silbert-over-genesis-funds/">open letter to Barry Silbert</a>, the founder &amp; CEO of DCG. The letter claimed that Silbert&#8217;s DCG &amp; its lending arm Genesis were dragging their feet on a deal to return the frozen $900 million that they owe to Gemini&#8217;s Earn program users.</p>

This comes after the exchange was found to allow users to register accounts without doing necessary background checks, in violation of anti-money laundering regulations.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Fined For $100 Mn</h2>
<p>In addition to this, the U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> also needs to invest $50 million to strengthen its compliance program, which is intended to deter drug dealers, child pornographers, and other potential lawbreakers from opening accounts. Coinbase will be required to comply with the terms of the settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services, which was announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Solana (SOL) Price Spikes As Dogecoin Killer BONK Gains Hype" href="https://coingape.com/solana-sol-price-spikes-as-dogecoin-killer-bonk-gains-hype/" rel="bookmark">Solana (SOL) Price Spikes As Dogecoin Killer BONK Gains Hype</a></em></p>
<p>The compliance issues at Coinbase were discovered for the first time in 2020 during a customary assessment, which took place after the exchange had successfully obtained an operating license in the state of New York in 2017. The authorities discovered issues with the anti-money laundering measures of the exchange that dated all the way back to 2018.</p>
<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s Compliance Issues</h2>
<p>Coinbase initially consented to engage the services of an outside consultant in order to assist it in reorganizing its day-to-day operations in order to fulfill the requirements imposed by anti-money laundering laws; which stipulate that the company must know the identities of its customers and keep track of their activities to look for any suspicious activity. However, that did not resolve the issues plaguing the corporation, and in 2021, officials initiated a more formal investigation.</p>
<p>Adrienne A. Harris, New York State’s superintendent of financial services, claimed that Coinbase’s compliance department had failed to keep up with the firm&#8217;s rapid growth &amp; was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>We found failures that really warranted putting in place an independent monitor rather than wait for a settlement. It is why our framework holds crypto companies to the same standard as for banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The once-booming industry of trading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> around the world has taken another blow. Several cryptocurrency companies have declared bankruptcy in the previous 12 months, the most prominent of which being <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, the world&#8217;s second-largest crypto exchange before it shut down in November. The founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, along with several other high-ranking FTX employees, is now being charged with federal crimes.</p>

This consolation phase lasted for around two weeks and limited the ETH growth to a narrow range. However, the crypto market has turned positive since the beginning of 2023 and has created a sense of recovery among the majority of cryptocurrencies. As a result, the Ethereum price rose for four consecutive days and is 5.8% up since last week.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1230 resistance breakout sets Ethereum price for an 8.2% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A falling parallel channel pattern drives the ongoing downtrend in ETH</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.3 Billion, indicating a 76% gain</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With <a href="https://coingape.com/popular-analyst-bullish-ethereum-price-2023/">today’s massive bullish candle</a>, the ETH price broke the $1230 resistance to replenish the trapped bullish momentum. The volume activity rose during the breakout, which also bolsters the buyer&#8217;s commitment to the price rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if this altcoin manages to sustain above the $1230 flipped support, the price may rise more than 8.2% to hit the resistance trendline of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">falling channel pattern</a>. This pattern displays itself as carrying a downtrend between two parallel walking trendlines.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even though this pattern showcases a steady downtrend, In theory, it eventually provides a massive price rally upon the breakout of its resistance trendline. Thus, the ETH price bullish breakout from the resistance trendline will signal the start of a fresh recovery rally. </span></p></blockquote>

On chain data suggests that the current BTC exchange inflows is having a historically low patch, going by the numbers in last two weeks. However, if the BTC inflows edge higher and break the trend, it means the wait continues. Essentially, a spell of high BTC exchange inflows could mean the Bitcoin local bottom is not priced in yet. It should also be kept in mind that the current <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">market cycle</a> broke many patterns like this and hence made it unpredictable at times.</p>

<h2>Record Low BTC Total Inflows</h2>
<p>The total Bitcoin exchange inflows generally suggests how the local bottom is placed in the current scenario. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63b4dc21c8ccf515a9ad6be3-Lowest-14-days-average-Exchange-Inflows-since-2015-suggest-volatility-to-increas" rel="nofollow">Crypto Quant</a> data, the current BTC inflow figures at the lowest since as many as 7 years. However, the general perception is that the low average might not last longer. This is considering the current market scenario around liquidity with Genesis Trading as well as the macroeconomic outlook for near future.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Currently we are under 26k (looking at 14 days simple moving average (SMA)) daily BTC total inflows, which is the lowest since mid-2015.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>BTC In Bottom Territory</h2>
<p>Also, a look at the current BTC Market Value (MV) to RV (Realized Value) ration indicates that the cryptocurrency is in a potential bottom territory. Since as many as three weeks, the top cryptocurrency failed to break the $17,000 level. The price movement has largely been sideways, paving an almost flat line for more than a week in December 2022. As of writing, BTC price stands at $16,832, up 0.65% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

The meme coin that helped boost Solana price last week, announced that it has burned five billion coins, maintaining its hype in the market.</p>
<h2>Bonk Burns Half Trillion Supply</h2>
<p>According to its official Twitter handle, Bonk has burned off nearly half a trillion of its entire token supply worth $1.2 million at its current price. The token is bulldozing through other coins in terms of market capitalization as well. Though currently ranked nearly around 2500, the coin has recorded double digits gains almost every day in the last five days. Solana’s native token SOL found itself in deep trouble after top NFT projects, <a href="https://coingape.com/solana-downfall-ahead-degods-y00ts-daily-vol-spikes-over-bridging-update/">DeGods and y00ts</a>, announced to migrate to Polygon and Ethereum, causing panic and doubt over its reputation.</p>

<h2>Solana Dog Coin Could Soon See A Massive Sell Off</h2>
<p>The token that is currently being hyped out of proportion in the market is not completely risk free. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://dune.com/Kagami/my-bonk-dashboard" rel="nofollow">Dune Dashboard</a> shows that the top 20 holders of BONK account for about 50% of the total coins’ supply, which should raise an alarm among its retail investors. Earlier, Justin Sun also announced in a Tweet that his crypto exchange Huobi is going to <a href="https://coingape.com/another-top-exchange-lists-solanas-bonk-dries-up-shib-and-doge-volume/">list the memecoin</a>. Bybit also announced to list the cryptocurrency, giving it more legitimacy and providing more exposure to this obscure memecoin. At the time of writing, BONK is up over 90% in the last 24 hrs trading at $0.000002124.</p>

Craige Wright has made another claim over the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-craig-wright-calls-xrp-useless-pump-dump-scheme-ripple-cto-hits-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">utility of XRP and Ripple</a> after calling them a Ponzi Scheme. However, Ripple&#8217;s CTO replied over the questionable claims.</p>
<h2>Does Ripple hold no evidence?</h2>
<p>Self proclaimed <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/bitcoin-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> creator in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Dr_CSWright/status/1610580200965685248" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter thread</a> wrote “No &#8211; more equivocation from ripple”. He pointed out the claim made by the blockchain product of Banks using their product. If Ripple asserts that they have a solution that already is in use then you should put a piece of evidence out first.</p>
<p>Craig Wright states that at no point has Ripple demonstrated any evidence to support itself. Self proclaimed Bitcoin creator claimed that he spoke to the Chairman of SBI. He further claimed that the bank doesn’t use Ripple but rather holds XRP they were gifted. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>As per Wright, the company has assets on its book while it holds no interest in using Ripple nor does it has any interest in selling XRP.</p>
<h2>Are people rejecting Ripple&#8217;s system?</h2>
<p>He challenged the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-xrp-price-is-not-rallying-ripple-cto-clarifies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple CTO</a> to demonstrate a single real contract used by any real client. He asked him to do it if it wasn’t for the fact that it is all fraudulent. While Wright claimed that Ripple CTO is telling the market that he has an elf riding a unicorn but he can’t discuss this just because of NDA.</p>
<p>Due to these reasons, the deflection by Ripple is expected. Self proclaimed Bitcoin creator claims that Ripple has a system that isn’t being used. People are constantly rejecting it even when the company is paying them to use it.</p>

The decision to immediately list the BONK token came amid the massive demand for the meme cryptocurrency by the crypto community. The demand has dried trading volume from rival dog coins <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shiba-inu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB) and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin</a> (DOGE).</p>
<h2>Bybit Announces Immediate Listing of BONK Token</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Bybit in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Bybit_Official/status/1610578940413747204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on January 4 announced the listing of Solana&#8217;s meme token BONK without any prior announcement on its website.</p>
<p>Bybit said BONK is available to trade on Bybit&#8217;s Spot market from January 4 at 11 AM UTC. Moreover, the meme cryptocurrency is also available to trade on Bybit Spot Grid Bots. It is termed as the first Solana dog coin for the people and by the people.</p>
<p>After listing on Bybit, the trading volume jumped to a high of $112 billion. The BONK token was listed at $0.0000010 and currently trades at 0.0000023, up over 130% in just a few hours.</p>
<p>Meme token BONK relies on the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/airdrop-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">airdrop</a> to Solana <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a>, anti-<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alameda Research</a> sentiment, and the revival of Solana DEX culture to improve the community. The broader sentiment driving the BONK rally is a comparison to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which recorded massive rallies during the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bull market</a>.</p>
<p>People believe the BONK price will also give better profit in the future. Some states that developers also promised many integrations and possibly the possibility of future voting among BONK holders, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/staking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staking</a>, raffles, and trading contests will also be done in the near future.</p>

<h2>Solana Price Skyrockets Over 15% in 24 Hours</h2>
<p>Solana price currently trades at $13.66, up over 15% in the last 24 hours. Solana’s 24-hour low and high are $11.72 and $14.10, respectively.

<p>Bitcoin mining companies had a really tough year as the extreme market conditions influenced the price of Bitcoin. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">crypto market</a> saw major crashes like collapse of Terra Sisters, Implosion of the Three Arrow Hedge Fund and the FTX fiasco. The rising interest rates form <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">the FED</a> to control inflation led to outflow of investors.</p>
<p>The price of Bitcoin dropped to its lowest since November 2021 when it was at its peak. Thus, in return the profit from mining decreased for the miners. 2023 is also not going to be an easy year as the IMF expects one-third of the global economy to be in recession.</p>
<p>In the past year major mining companies like Core Scientific traded down by 99% whereas Bitfarms by 91%. Riot Blockchain witnessed 85% downfall.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining: The problem being faced in mining till now</h2>
<p>Some miners, mine Bitcoins, sell it in the market and in exchange get money. They use this money to pay for the operation and expenses of their firm.</p>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/us-federal-watchdogs-issue-joint-warning-on-crypto-activities/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">US Federal Watchdogs Issue Joint Warning on Crypto Activities</a></p>
<p>Whereas, some of the bitcoin miners do keep the mined Bitcoin to sell it at the time when the price of Bitcoin jumps up highly. In simple words, the Bitcoin mining company mines Bitcoin, doesn’t sell the Bitcoin in the market. Instead, they take money from the debt or equity markets and pay for the expenses of running the mining company. The expenses of any mining company is majorly the price of electricity required to run the huge machines that mine Bitcoins.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-accepts-bitcoin-as-payment-top-10-trending-companies-list/">Who Accepts Bitcoin as a Payment?</a> </strong></p>
<p>Because bitcoin was becoming more expensive, a large number of people were trying to invest in it in order to avoid missing out. Due to the low cost of capital, there were many people looking to invest in Bitcoin in order to increase their yield. And throughout the past few years, these things have held true. The fact that bitcoin mining companies, who are in the business of mining bitcoin, weren&#8217;t clearly making money from mining bitcoin instead, they were profiting from the bitcoin mining industry.</p>
<p>However the price fell drastically in 2022. This idea of holding bitcoins can be extremely harmful when the price of bitcoin is falling, the cost of funding is rising, and bitcoin mining is becoming more competitive.</p>
<p>All of those events took place in 2022, thus enter the news of Core Scientific&#8217;s bankruptcy, Argo&#8217;s capital injection and extensive restructuring, as well as the CEO of Bitfarms&#8217; resignation.</p>

<h2>The future in Bitcoin mining</h2>
<p>Investors in the public markets place value on both a cash flow&#8217;s predictability and its potential for appreciation. The latter is abundant in public mining companies, but the former is badly lacking. Treasury management strategies that are effective should foresee and address the unequal profitability brought on by the markets that control the mining sector.<br />
This tactic would make it easier for a mining company to manage market stress but would prevent it from hoarding as much bitcoin as possible to sell at a premium during a bull market. Furthermore, miners are in the mining industry, not the business of timing markets.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The mining companies doesn’t see the current price of bitcoin or the current electricity cost. It keeps on functioning for days and thus, holding all bitcoins might not always land them up in a gratifying situation.</p>
<p>The companies and the miners need to consider the situation of 2022, if they survive the storm that the market is facing right now. A change in the policies of holding bitcoins might be of great help in future to avoid unpredictable situations.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">According to The New York Post, the decline in his net worth has been attributed to a 66% drop in Tesla shares over the past year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134164" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04172237/Tesla.jpg" alt="Tesla" width="1083" height="473" /></p>
<p style="color: #252525">The steep drop in the prices of Tesla&#8217;s shares is linked to Elon Musk&#8217;s diversion from the firm owing to the Twitter saga, as well as supply-chain constraints in China exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Elon Musk&#8217;s Wealth Decline</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#678b860f3d78">Forbes&#8217; real-time billionaires list</a>, Elon Musk&#8217;s current net worth is $136.9 billion and ranks second. He owns around 25% of Tesla through stock and options, but has pledged more than half of his shares as security for loans.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">After Musk declared a 9.1% ownership stake and threatened a hostile takeover, Twitter&#8217;s board decided to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion in April 2022.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Later, Musk tried to back out, but Twitter sued him. The acquisition was finalised in October 2022. Musk currently owns about 74% of the company.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">On November 4, 2021, Elon&#8217;s fortune peaked at $340 billion, and he remained the world&#8217;s richest person until this month, when he was surpassed by Bernard Arnault, the French entrepreneur behind luxury goods giant LVMH.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">Musk has no substantial assets left following a 65% drop in Tesla shares in 2022 and a $44 billion acquisition of Twitter.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Following these revelations, Tesla has announced a price reduction in several of its models, including a $7,500 discount on the Model 3 and Model Y.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Musk, on the other hand, has rejected Tesla&#8217;s concerns and has regularly turned to Twitter to blame the Federal Reserve for increasing interest rates.</p>

Amid price drop and macroeconomic headwinds, the XRP whales continue to accumulate more of the sixth ranked cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, small and retail traders seem to be slowly losing interest in the project. This could also mean that the traders are trying to protect their investments until the SEC case judgement arrives.</p>

<h2>XRP Near Market Bottom</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the current XRP price is at the bottom of an almost triangular formation. When looked at the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price since March 2020, XRP was on an upward curve until the bull run in the middle of 2021. Since then, constant fluctuations brought the price all the way down to the 2020 price level. This is increasingly leading to the belief that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price is close to the crypto <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">market</a> bottom.</p>
<p>In this context, the whales are continuing their XRP buying spree. Importantly, historical data shows that these whales are capable of impacting the coin&#8217;s price. On the other side, data on XRP trading on Binance shows that the traders are experiencing a bearish environment currently. Whereas, the retail traders are currently bearing an average loss of -7%, based on the calculation of Market Value by Realised Value (MVRV) ratio.
