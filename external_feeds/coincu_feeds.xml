<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>On May 31, Optimism (OP) will hold a token-unlocking session worth $258 million.</em></li>



<li><em>The unlock phase takes place before June 6, when the project will conduct a significant upgrade of Bedrock, the foundation to improve many technical aspects and optimize transaction fees for this layer-2.</em></li>



<li><em>Additionally, $101 million worth of 1inch tokens and $64.7 million worth of Sui tokens will be unlocked this week.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to data from Unlock Tokens, on May 31 of this week, 3.6% of Optimism tokens worth $258 million will be unlocked.</strong></h5>

<p>This month there is one last major unlock on May 31 from the layer-2 Optimism project, with 154 million OP tokens &#8211; worth $248 million at current exchange rates. This amount of tokens is equivalent to 3.6% of the total OP supply.</p>



<p>The amount of unlocked tokens will be allocated to the primary investor group and the development team, with the total OP supply will continue to increase steadily in the allocations from now on for these two groups.</p>



<p>Until June 6, Optimism will conduct an extremely important upgrade that is the foundation to improve many technical aspects and optimize transaction fees for this layer-2. Bedrock will also pave the way for another layer-2 solution that uses Optimism&#8217;s technology, Base, for mainnet deployment.</p>



<p>One of the main advantages of the Bedrock upgrade is the expected reduction in transaction fees. OP Labs, the developer of the protocol for Optimism, estimates that transaction fees will drop by an impressive 47%.</p>



<p>After a sideways period, the OP price recorded a 3% increase along with the positive news from<a href="https://news.coincu.com/190540-bitcoin-soars-28k-us-debt-ceiling-lift-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bitcoin</a> today after the threat of US debt default waning. OP is currently trading at $1.66.</p>

<p>The United States government is set to raise the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025, in a temporary measure to avoid a possible default. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy expressed confidence that their debt-ceiling deal will pass Congress, calling it a bipartisan compromise. </p>



<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-28/biden-mccarthy-signal-confidence-that-debt-limit-deal-will-pass" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-28/biden-mccarthy-signal-confidence-that-debt-limit-deal-will-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that the bill will suspend the debt ceiling and cap federal spending for the next two years. The deal between the two political parties is expected to face opposition from liberals and conservatives. Negotiators from both parties are expected to brief their members on the deal in separate calls. The agreement will likely be pushed through Congress before the US government runs out of borrowing capacity in about a week.</p>



<p>The bill creates an $886 billion cap on security spending and a $704 billion cap on non-security domestic spending for fiscal 2024. Those would rise to $895 billion and $711 billion in fiscal 2025. The bill includes dozens of other claw-backs of federal spending, including Covid-related programs, migrant and refugee assistance, and childcare and housing aid. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1550.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="620" height="349" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1550.png" alt="The US Government Raises Debt Ceiling Until 2025, Cap On Federal Spending For Two Years" class="wp-image-190568" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1550.png 620w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1550-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" title="The US Government Raises Debt Ceiling Until 2025, Cap On Federal Spending For Two Years 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Representative Garret Graves, one of the Republican negotiators, said the deal would also streamline permitting for energy projects. However, a complete overhaul of the 54-year-old National Environmental Policy Act would be dealt with separately.</p>



<p>The debt deal specifically expedites the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia that&#8217;s been stalled over permitting fights. While the agreement would not affect the Biden administration&#8217;s student-loan forgiveness plan, it would end the pandemic-era moratorium on repayments. The pause will be lifted within 60 days of the bill being signed. There&#8217;s little margin for error or delay, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Friday that the debt limit must be extended by June 5 to avoid default.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Since its creation, Bitcoin mining difficulty has risen from one to 49.55 trillion hashes that a miner would potentially need to create in order to locate the winning one. This indicates that mining a Bitcoin block now is 49.55 trillion times more difficult than it was in 2009.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1546.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="640" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1546.png" alt="Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Reached New High Level" class="wp-image-190559" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1546.png 960w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1546-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1546-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1546-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Reached New High Level 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s difficulty is at an all-time high at the time of writing, which means that miners are earning less in rewards per unit of hash power than ever before.</p>



<p>Bitcoin mining difficulty seems to be at the 50 trillion mark in the coming days. Despite the fact that mining Bitcoin has gotten more difficult, the hashrate has remained consistent at 357.15 exahash per second (EH/s) during the previous 2,016 blocks.</p>

<p>Miners are interested in forecasting Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate growth and difficulty trends for business planning, in addition to the price of BTC.</p>



<p>The acceleration in block intervals or periods above the ten-minute average signals that another difficulty increase is on the way next week. Now, predictions <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">show</a> a possible rise on May 31, ranging from 1.1% to 2.51%. If this happens, Bitcoin mining difficulty will be at 50.79 trillion, marking the first time in Bitcoin&#8217;s history that it has surpassed the 50 trillion level.</p>



<p>According to JPMorgan experts, at the present price of gold, which is just under $2000 per ounce, BTC would be trading for roughly $45,000 since the two assets tend to move in tandem and are exchanged at around $45,000. Investors examine their options.</p>



<p>The United States seems to be on the verge of a catastrophic debt default after the White House and House Republicans reached a preliminary agreement on May 27. In anticipation of the agreement on May 26, the US equity markets rose, and the bullish attitude has rubbed off on the cryptocurrency industry, which is striving to rebound. BTC, supported by this good news, is currently trading at around $28,000.</p>

<p>Unciphered, a company that provides services to recover previously inaccessible digital assets, released a video on how to access the secret key on Trezor T. This has brought to light the security concerns around hardware wallets and has caused many to question the safety of their digital assets. In response to this, both Trezor and Ledger have been making efforts to increase transparency and security.</p>



<p>Ledger originally released plans for a feature called Recover, which would allow the company to access users&#8217; seed phrases. This caused an uproar in the crypto community as it involved exporting users&#8217; secret keys to three different parties and providing users&#8217; identification to one of those parties. Many Ledger owners were unaware that it was possible to export the secret key, and this realization has led to concerns about the security of hardware wallets.</p>

<p>Trezor, on the other hand, claims to be fully open-source and has a bug bounty program, which allows security researchers to audit the company&#8217;s hardware wallet independently. This is echoed by the company&#8217;s CEO Matej Zak, who said that the crypto community had spoken loudly and clearly on their insistence for the uncompromised security of hardware wallets.</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, both firms have had their share of problems. Unciphered&#8217;s video on how to access the secret key on Trezor T has raised concerns, and Kraken had already released a way to hack both the Trezor T and Trezor One in 2020. Additionally, former CEO and co-founder of Ledger, Éric Larchevêque, alleged on Reddit that firmware could be developed for Trezor, which would result in exporting the secret key.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin (BTC) price quickly jumped past the $28,000 mark after the US agreed to raise the debt ceiling.</em></li>



<li><em>The new deal has more than 95% of Republicans in the House excited about the deal.</em></li>



<li><em>The appearance of weekly reversal candles could be a signal that the BTC price will retest the $30,000 &#8211; $31,000 area.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s weekly situation update showed positive signs, with the price surpassing the $28,000 threshold after the agreement to raise the debt ceiling was announced and voted on.</strong></h5>



<p>After seeing the positive news from the US debt ceiling lifting and, like the market comments from the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190000-bitcoin-recovers-debt-ceiling-positive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous article</a>, BTC recovered when it touched the support area at $25,800 and retested the $27,000 and $28,200 areas.</p>

<p>Currently, in the H4 time frame, the price is close to the strong resistance area combined with the indicators that are located in the overbought area. BTC may correct slightly here. However, on the weekly time frames, the price has appeared strong reversal confirmation candles and is likely to retest the $30,000 &#8211; $31,000 area.</p>

<p>On May 28, according to local time, US President Biden said in a speech that he had reached a final agreement with House Speaker McCarthy on raising the debt ceiling and called on Congress to approve the agreement as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Biden said that reaching a debt ceiling agreement was an important step forward: &#8220;This agreement averted the worst of the crisis&#8221; and &#8220;eliminated the risk of catastrophic default.&#8221; He strongly urged the House of Representatives and the Senate to pass the agreement.</p>



<p>The proposed deal <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20230529/BILLS-118hrPIH-fiscalresponsibility.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has now been published</a> on the House of Commons website. It projects that non-defense government spending will stay the same for two years and then increase by 1% by 2025.</p>



<p>There will be no major changes to Medicaid health coverage, and the proposed deal fully funds medical care for veterans.</p>



<p>Energy licensing legislation would be streamlined to speed approval times for new projects &#8211; a reform Republicans are pushing. Unused Covid relief funds will be withdrawn in the deal, another Republican request.</p>

<p>Several age changes are proposed for a government program that provides food assistance to people with low or no income.</p>



<p>McCarthy said Sunday that more than 95% of Republicans in the House are excited about the deal. A US default would boost the US economy and disrupt global markets.</p>

<p>Temasek, a Singapore state-owned investment company, recently made headlines when it announced that the team responsible for investing in FTX would take collective responsibility for the investment decision and cut their salaries. This comes after Temasek took a $275 million impairment on FTX to zero. However, the firm also led another US$200 million B+ round of financing in Amber, another crypto company on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>



<p>According to Temasek, the company seeks to deliver sustainable returns over the long term. Investing in new sectors and emerging technologies is key to understanding how these areas may impact their existing portfolio&#8217;s business and financial models and whether they would be drivers of future value in an ever-changing world. This is why they invest in early-stage companies.</p>

<p>However, with FTX, prosecutors alleged that there was fraudulent conduct intentionally hidden from investors, including Temasek. Despite this, Temasek stated that there was no misconduct by the investment team in reaching their investment recommendation.</p>



<p>An independent team conducted an internal review of the investment, and the findings were directly presented to the Board Risk &amp; Sustainability Committee and to the board. Nevertheless, Temasek is disappointed with its investment&#8217;s outcome and its negative impact on its reputation. The investment team and senior management, who are ultimately responsible for investment decisions made, took collective accountability and had their compensation reduced.</p>

<p>Floki Coin is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has recently gained attention in China. On the Chinese state TV station CCTV-5, it was featured during the 2023 World Table Tennis Championships broadcast. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The coin appeared on the billboard as a partner with a link to the official website, leading to a rise of more than 10%. The meme coin is trading at around 0.000035 at the time of writing, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/floki-inu/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/floki-inu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap </a>data. The team said the cryptocurrency received an influx of Chinese traffic due to the CCTV-5 feature. This is promising news for FLOKI, as it positions itself for Hong Kong and China opening up to crypto.</p>

<p>FLOKI is strategically planning to capture the attention of Chinese crypto users through its China Plan. The plan highlights its strategy for China and includes a Chinese website, whitepaper, and partnership with Btok, China&#8217;s most extensive crypto social network. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The partnership with Btok will last until the end of the year and introduce the meme coin to over 10 million Chinese crypto users. Additionally, a Chinese version of FLOKI&#8217;s PlayToEarn metaverse game, Valhalla, will launch later this year.</p>



<p>While FLOKI is a global cryptocurrency, the team&#8217;s ultimate goal is to be the most known and used crypto. They recognize the importance of China and Hong Kong in achieving this goal, and the recent exposure to CCTV-5 is a promising step in the right direction. The team is confident that their strategic positioning and partnerships in China will lead to increased adoption and usage of cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>This extravagant purchase is not the first time the couple has invested in Melbourne&#8217;s trophy homes. In March last year, they purchased a two-story, five-bedroom Italianate mansion, Verona, on 1412 square meters for $18.25 million. With the addition of Avon Court, their combined landholding now totals an impressive 5663 square meters.</p>

<p>The Avon Court mansion is a landmark four-level, lift-connected Victorian mansion with nine bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a gymnasium, a steam room, two swimming pools, a playground, a mini soccer field, a 10-car basement garage, and six kitchens. The sprawling estate is located in the blue-chip Shakespeare Grove area of Hawthorn, one of Melbourne&#8217;s most exclusive postcodes.</p>

<p>It is not the first time a crypto polymath has coveted a large slice of Melbourne&#8217;s most exclusive postcodes. Ed Craven, the founder of a crypto casino, made headlines with his $80 million <a href="https://www.afr.com/property/residential/80m-toorak-buy-sets-melbourne-record-for-26-year-old-20220815-p5ba0s" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.afr.com/property/residential/80m-toorak-buy-sets-melbourne-record-for-26-year-old-20220815-p5ba0s" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase </a>of a 7187 square-meter derelict mansion on Toorak&#8217;s St Georges Road. The Avon Court purchase represents a significant upsize from the couple&#8217;s neighboring property.</p>



<p>The property was sold through Kay &amp; Burton&#8217;s Grant Samuel, alongside co-agent Chen Sun of Ascend. Both agents declined to comment on the recent sale or buyers, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Michael Egorov is based in Switzerland, so whether the couple intends to connect the properties and create a sprawling Australian base or upgrade over the fence is still being determined.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Individuals and large institutions alike participate in the crypto market. In the financial world, wealthy individuals are commonly referred to as &#8220;sharks&#8221; or &#8220;whales.&#8221; Because of the existence of these whales, the crypto market grows dynamic and draws more investors.</strong></h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In recent years, cryptocurrencies have prompted much controversy. Most of this has centered on either their worth or their regulation. Nonetheless, crypto market manipulation must be investigated, particularly the behavior of crypto exchanges.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1525.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="572" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1525.png" alt="What Is Crypto Market Manipulation, And Its Dangerous For Investors?" class="wp-image-190499" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1525.png 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1525-300x286.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="What Is Crypto Market Manipulation, And Its Dangerous For Investors? 42"></a></figure></div>


<p>The late 2022 crash of FTX has brought crypto and market abuse to the forefront. It was the world&#8217;s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume at one time during its three-year existence. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and CEO of FTX, is now charged with conspiracy to conduct commodities fraud and securities fraud, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States and commit campaign financing crimes. Bankman-Fried is accused of defrauding investors out of $1.8 billion, according to the indictment. Since November of last year, FTX has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.</p>



<p>Because of the large-scale and high-profile nature of FTX&#8217;s collapse, many people are wondering how crypto exchanges work and the potential of market manipulation &#8211; the effort to intentionally influence the price of an asset and/or the behavior of markets. Market manipulation is not limited to cryptocurrency exchanges. It is an illicit technique that has been practiced for generations. Yet, Deloitte said in its 2021 study &#8220;Market Manipulation in Digital Assets&#8221; that cryptocurrency&#8217;s market capitalization had reached $1 trillion two years ago. It cautions that market manipulation might affect up to 90% of transactions.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re apprehensive about paying for things with cryptocurrency owing to price volatility, it&#8217;s worth understanding that a significant portion of that volatility isn&#8217;t just the herd stampeding in one way or the other.</p>



<p>There are various reasons why many cryptocurrencies&#8217; values might increase or fall suddenly, such as a successful step in development, a large new use case, or simply indicators that it&#8217;s being embraced by people, and there are many ways they can be manipulated in the volatile company.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is crypto market manipulation?</h2>



<p>Crypto market manipulation refers to a purposeful effort to impact the value of assets and disrupt a crypto market trend.</p>



<p>Pump and dumps, wash trading, spoofing, stop hunting, and just circulating false information are all examples of cryptocurrency market manipulation (which can be fairly easy to do in crypto).</p>



<p>Then there are crypto-specific methods, such as buy and sell barriers built by &#8220;whales,&#8221; or owners of large blocks of cryptocurrency. This isn&#8217;t only for bitcoin. Ethereum&#8217;s ether, like many other so-called &#8220;altcoins,&#8221; suffers from the same issue, however, in recent years, Ether, which has a market valuation around 45% of that of bitcoin, has been largely separated into its own category.</p>



<p>Market manipulation is simpler in several ways with alt-coins. Apart from a few dozen of the largest coins, they frequently get less pricing attention, and the quantities involved in market manipulation are not as large.</p>



<p>Yet, much like bitcoin, crypto market manipulation has numerous distinct features that make it simpler to perpetrate and more difficult to detect than in the stock and commodities markets.</p>



<p>To begin, since cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous — not entirely anonymous because all transactions are visible on a publicly available blockchain — the identity of a manipulative trader is disguised behind the key codes required to conduct a crypto transaction.</p>



<p>Yet, it is not impossible. Blockchain data organizations with substantial experience dealing with law enforcement, such as Chainalysis and Ciphertrace, claim that the public nature of blockchain makes tracing criminals simpler than traditional off-chain investigations.</p>



<p>Second, there are numerous crypto &#8220;whales&#8221; who purchased or mined massive amounts of cryptocurrencies when it was worth pennies or a few dollars. The same is true for ether and almost other alt-coins: people were able to acquire a lot for very little and now have the potential to change markets.</p>



<p>Third, while the vast majority of trading on the major cryptocurrencies currently takes place on large, well-known, and well-regulated exchanges, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of small exchanges on which smaller alt-coins, as well as bitcoin and ether, are traded, many of which are of dubious honesty and have limited liquidity.</p>



<p>Fourth, the volatility of the crypto market implies that tokens see rapid price increases. It&#8217;s very uncommon for crypto to climb or decrease by 10% in a single day, a few hours, or even a few minutes. That may happen at any time of day or night since crypto is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>



<p>In cryptocurrency market manipulation, unscrupulous actors create illusions in order to inflate or deflate market values in order to benefit. They might, for example, circulate fake news, send out a series of pressing tweets, construct bogus orders, provide misleading market signals, talk critically about an asset to instill panic among traders, and so on. As a result, you must be aware of and battle manipulative techniques, which you will uncover as you go.</p>



<p>Crypto market manipulation has harmed both crypto investors and the crypto market as a whole. That makes the market needlessly volatile and dangerous for investors, which has caused many traders and investors to lose faith in cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Harms of crypto market manipulation</h2>



<p>Crypto market manipulation raises volatility in the cryptocurrency market, giving the impression that it is chaotic and dangerous to novice investors. If there are still murky areas in the crypto market, authorities and governments will continue to investigate the embryonic industry. The limited volume of some currencies makes them simple to manipulate, and huge surges followed by sharp drops are all too typical, particularly on smaller crypto exchanges. Whales don&#8217;t always need to acquire or sell an asset. They may make a cryptic tweet that causes an asset to soar or, worse, plummet.</p>



<p>Data may be disseminated and synchronized using the distributed ledger technology (DLT) used in crypto trading. It does not, however, prohibit market manipulation. In the crypto company, there are a number of reputable and well-regulated exchanges. Yet, many tiny exchanges are less well-known and less regulated. Many people want to use cryptocurrencies as a cover for criminal activity.</p>



<p>One method that cryptocurrency might be utilized to earn unlawful profits is through crypto market manipulation. Such manipulation may be accomplished in a variety of ways. Some utilize techniques employed in more conventional asset markets, while others are specific to crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Methods of price manipulation in the crypto market</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pump and dump</strong></h3>



<p>This is the artificial inflating of an asset&#8217;s price, which has been practiced for many years on numerous markets. It entails a succession of crypto sales and purchases to provide the appearance that the asset&#8217;s value is growing. Those behind this then sell the asset when their manipulated price rise attracts purchasers who have been deceived into thinking that the cryptocurrency in question will continue to rise in value.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Whale wall spoofing and stop hunting</strong></h3>



<p>While Bitcoin was new, the technique of spoofing whale walls was common. It is currently most often seen on less well-regulated marketplaces. It entails a person or group placing a big order in order to build phony buy or sell barriers in the order books, which might fool other parties into panic selling (because they feel a certain asset is losing value) or rushing to purchase (as they believe huge demand for an asset is pushing its value up). A whale, for example, may place massive sell orders, tricking investors into panic selling. Stop hunting occurs when a whale pushes the price to where established stop-loss orders, which are intended to limit an investor&#8217;s loss if the value of an asset falls, are activated. The consequent market instability allows assets to be purchased at a reduced cost.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1528.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="834" height="521" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1528.png" alt="What Is Crypto Market Manipulation, And Its Dangerous For Investors?" class="wp-image-190502" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1528.png 834w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1528-300x187.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1528-768x480.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1528-750x469.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" title="What Is Crypto Market Manipulation, And Its Dangerous For Investors? 45"></a></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wash trading</strong></h3>



<p>This is akin to whale wall spoofing in that inaccurate information is supplied into the market to cause quick purchasing and selling of an asset, causing the price to be distorted to an unnaturally high level. This might increase the number of users and, as a result, the commission earned by tiny exchanges.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>False information dissemination</strong></h3>



<p>Fake information is often distributed to traders or investors on forums in an effort to cause a market move that those doing the spreading want.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How to protect your asset?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Multiple consultations and research</strong></h3>



<p>Before trading, do research by validating prices from many credible sources. You may compare asset prices and data for relative relatedness by using several crypto exchanges. Cross-checking a price on one exchange against another, for example, may disclose the genuine price and assist you avoid a rug pull or pump and dump.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Adjust investment strategy</strong></h3>



<p>Concentrate on long-term objectives rather than short-term changes. You may invest in Bitcoin in part, but you should also diversify into other assets to reduce risk. You must also examine the dangers of Bitcoin investing and deploy funds accordingly to mitigate them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Psychological control</strong></h3>



<p>Emotional pressures such as fear, worry, or greed are common throughout the investing process. Nonetheless, in order to achieve investing success, it is critical to have a level head and avoid making investment choices based on emotions.</p>



<p>Rather than depending on emotions, make financial judgments based on rigorous study and market data. Plan and adhere to your investing plan, and don&#8217;t modify your investment strategy based on short-term market volatility.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use trusted exchanges and coins</strong></h3>



<p>Be careful you trade on reliable exchanges with a solid reputation. Market manipulation is common with new exchanges and currencies with little trading activity. This is not to claim that attackers cannot influence market prices on exchanges with high transaction volumes; they just have a smaller margin of error when compared to younger exchanges.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seek advice from experienced guru</strong></h3>



<p>Skilled individuals can assist you in gaining a better grasp of the market and providing useful forecasts and financial recommendations. But, before making any financial choices, you should ensure that they are trustworthy and use caution in accepting their advice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Price manipulation does not cause all unexpected and large market price movements. In general, the market is volatile, and a lot occurs every minute. Therefore always trade with a sound trading strategy and use multiple risk management tactics.</p>



<p>The advancements in cryptocurrency enforcement so far reflect the necessity to address the sharp behaviors and resultant instability in the crypto markets. These developments have not progressed as quickly as happenings in the markets to which they are related. They do, however, constitute a continuing effort to both minimize the possibilities for crypto-related market manipulation and hold its offenders accountable.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency industry is still in its infancy and is mostly uncontrolled. As a consequence, when new cryptocurrencies are created, they are often driven by market enthusiasm, but some creators also experiment with various ethical and immoral tactics to promote their coins.</p>



<p>Prioritize and adhere to your research and trading tactics while attempting to trade and invest in cryptocurrency; do not follow market noise. It is better to remain out of the market than to attempt to regularly trade a hyped and loud market.</p>
