As the crypto world continues to evolve with increased volatility, unique patterns emerge, attracting the interest of investors and analysts alike. One such way has been observed in the recent trading activity of Compound (COMP), the governance token tied to the Compound protocol. The asset experienced a significant surge, registering a nearly 10% growth within the past day. Over the last 7 days, COMP has been in an uptrend, and the 10% single-day rise forms part of a larger appreciation pattern. This escalation is noteworthy as the token&#8217;s price soared over 50% within just a week. Whale Activity Fuels Price Momentum Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain earlier today shed some light on the reason behind the recent COMP price surge. The firm disclosed on Twitter that a possible whale or institutional investor appears to have made substantial COMP transactions.

The whale/institution withdrew another 120K $COMP ($5.53M) from #Binance just now. So the rise in the price of $COMP may have something to do with this whale/institution.https://t.co/6LfmjMxaRZ pic.twitter.com/Deh4v260qt — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 29, 2023 Such considerable transfers often signify bullish behavior and could contribute to the increase in COMP&#8217;s price, given their potential influence on the token&#8217;s supply and demand dynamics.
