<li>Litecoin started a strong increase above $80 against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>LTC price is now trading below $80 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $86.50 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair remains supported for more gains unless there is a clear move below $80.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is correcting gains from $92 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-rally-could-extend-above-22k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. LTC price could continue to move up if it remains well supported above the $80 level.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, there was a decent increase in bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-rally-pauses-but-not-likely-over/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-uptrend-in-place-above-0-40/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ripple</a>, and litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC formed a base above the $80 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $85 and $88 resistance levels. The price even climbed above the $90 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). However, the bears were active near the $92 zone. A high was formed near $91.14 and the price started a downside correction.</p>
<p>There was a move below the $85 level. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $72.45 swing low to $91.14 high. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $86.50 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>The price is now trading below $80 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). An immediate support is near the $81.80 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $72.45 swing low to $91.14 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $80 zone. A downside break below the $80 support might start a strong decline. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $84 and $85 levels. A clear move above the $85 level could pump the price towards the $92 level. The next major resistance sits near the $100 level.</p>
<div id="attachment_76587" style="width: 1950px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/01/Litecoin-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-76587" class="size-full wp-image-76587" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/01/Litecoin-1.png" alt="Litecoin (LTC) Price" width="1950" height="1109" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-76587" class="wp-caption-text">Litecoin (LTC) Price</p></div>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, litecoin price is clearly trading below $80 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Overall, the price remains supported for more gains unless there is a clear move below $80.</p>
<h2>Technical indicators</h2>
<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD for LTC/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LTC/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Key Support Levels – $80 and $75</p>
<p>Key Resistance Levels – $85 and $92.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the FTX collapse, which happened because the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange used customer money to cover its risks, cryptocurrency exchanges came up with proof-of-reserves to clarify transactions.</p>
<p>Without clear rules, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently pushed for a practice that gives exchanges a way to show users that they are more honest. A <a href="https://www.okx.com/proof-of-reserves" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Proof of Reserves (PoR) audit </a>verifies that a custodian has the client funds it claims to have. The auditor takes a snapshot of all accounts and arranges together a Merkle tree to protect users&#8217; privacy. Once the snapshot has been taken, the auditor will have a <a href="https://www.okx.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/10660988139661" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Merkle root</a>, a cryptographic fingerprint specific to the sum of these accounts as of the snapshot&#8217;s creation time.</p>
<p>The auditor then compiles the digital signatures generated by the cryptocurrency exchange as evidence of who has the on-chain addresses that have balances that can be validated publicly. The final step of the audit is to verify whether or not these amounts are greater than or equal to the customer balances displayed in the Merkle tree. In that case, the client&#8217;s assets are held with a full reserve.</p>
<p>Binance Holdings Ltd. and <a href="https://www.okx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OKX </a>are just two examples of cryptocurrency exchanges that have turned to third-party auditors in recent months for a proof of reserves report, an increasingly popular form of attestation that can demonstrate the company&#8217;s solvency and ability to meet its debt obligations. Since most exchanges are privately owned, they don&#8217;t have to follow the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about filing financial reports and having them audited.</p>
<p>The collapse of FTX, which had loaned billions of dollars from its clients to an affiliate, Alameda Research, and then blocked its consumers from accessing their funds, has prompted widespread worries about the financial stability of crypto platforms. Additionally, FTX went the extra mile by having its books audited by Armanino LLP and Prager Metis CPAs LLC for the previous two years, which is not something businesses in the industry typically do.</p>
<h4><strong>Is proof of reserves the solution to crypto&#8217;s trust problem?</strong></h4>
<p>Although third-party verification is a step toward greater transparency in crypto exchanges, some academics have pointed out important things that could be improved. When platforms disclose snapshots of their reserves to investors, they often conceal whether or not the platforms have pledged users&#8217; assets for loans or adjusted their assessments of assets or liabilities in the interim. The exchange may also determine the frequency of these attestations.</p>
<p>Suppose a company uses third-party verification and doesn&#8217;t give auditors information about its assets or liabilities that aren&#8217;t recorded on the blockchain. In that case, there may need for more transparency about the company&#8217;s non-digital assets.</p>
<p>These flaws highlight the limitations of on-chain platform solutions, which risk losing touch with the real world if they do not consider it. POR is insufficient to provide reliable proof against fraud or to protect against hacking.</p>
<p>An emphasis on ex-ante responsibility has resulted in more significant calls for financial regulation and control of the crypto business in the wake of FTX&#8217;s devastating death spiral. Lexology has published a paper analyzing current blockchain case law, noting that it may be difficult for the crypto business to avoid off-chain regulation. Legal mediation through the courts, backed by state authority and using existing legal concepts like fiduciary obligations and constructive trusts, will remain desirable as an ex-post method of achieving accountability for people who have suffered losses.</p>
<p>There is mounting pressure on U.S. authorities to ensure crypto businesses comply with investor protection rules. Under Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has promised to crack down on the cryptocurrency industry. The agency has also asked for more exchanges to register but has not mentioned how platforms use proof of reserves.</p>
<p>In the coming months, cryptocurrency companies will depend more and more on proof of reserves to keep their clients&#8217; trust. However, various adjustments might be implemented to promote openness and confidence. Investors must have access to financial information regarding an exchange. This provides information about the business&#8217;s structure and income generation. As well as information about its staff and shareholders.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency sector might greatly benefit from custodians implementing proof-of-reserves criteria, provided they communicate the dangers of this sort of self-regulation to their customers. Suppose the industry is thriving in instituting universal accountability rules,  in that case, it may avoid the setbacks that frequently accompany the collapse of centralized platforms like Mt. Gox, Cryptopia, QuadrigaCX, and FTX.</p>
<p>Users in a system where stablecoin issuers and exchanges must regularly verify their reserves would gravitate toward solutions that provide the highest level of asset safety. Therefore, more capital from institutional and individual investors would flow into the cryptocurrency market if the environment were safer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Krugman – a Nobel Prize-winning economist – <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-laureate-paul-krugman-compares-134003901.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">recently published a piece saying</a> that Tesla stock is a lot like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. He also commented that the CEO of Tesla – Elon Musk, who is a big crypto fan and has since gone on to purchase Twitter – couldn’t be trusted to “feed his cat.”</p>
<h2>Paul Krugman Isn&#8217;t Crazy About Either Musk or BTC</h2>
<p>The bitcoin-Tesla comparisons came given that both assets have plunged heavily following solid jumps in late 2021. Bitcoin, during that time, rose to a whopping $68,000 per unit, and Tesla stock also hit a new all-time high. However, since then, Tesla has fallen by more than 73 percent, and bitcoin’s dips have also seen it lose about 70 percent of its value. In that sense, they appear to be one and the same.</p>
<p>In his piece, Krugman said that Tesla cannot compare to other big-time tech stocks such as Apple and Microsoft. He said that it doesn’t have the same network effects as those stocks as many people are turning to these latter companies for everyday use. Microsoft, for example, provides people with tools such as Word and Excel, which are pretty much used daily amongst people with 9-5 jobs.</p>
<p>Apple also provides people with their smartphones and other devices that have since become staples of everyday life. Try imaging your life without a smartphone… Not easy to picture, is it?</p>
<p>By contrast, Krugman says that at end of the day, Tesla is just another car company, and that while it has made waves in the electric and environmentally friendly auto sectors, it’s still facing heavy competition from firms such as Ford and General Motors, which have since pushed past many of their rivals to become major electric and natural gas-fueled car companies.</p>
<p>He predicts that Tesla could potentially be outdone by both these firms and similar ones in the future. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s hard to see what would give Tesla a long-term lock on the electric vehicle business.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said that much of the hype surrounding Tesla and the subsequent stock hikes it’s experienced have to do with the idea that Elon Musk is somehow a “cool guy.” He says this is a reputation that is not necessarily rightfully deserved, and that this reputation will fade over time as it’s allegedly been doing over the past few weeks.</p>
<h2>He Couldn&#8217;t Feed My Cat!</h2>
<p>Krugman was critical of Musk’s behavior at Twitter, claiming it was chaotic and that he was leading the social media giant down the wrong path. Musk initially <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-billionaires-think-elon-musk-will-do-well-with-twitter/" data-wpel-link="internal">completed his Twitter</a> purchase last October and has since released many leading executives of the firm. Krugman says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given what we&#8217;ve seen of Musk&#8217;s behavior, I wouldn&#8217;t trust him to feed my cat, let alone run a major corporation.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MicroStrategy – the famed software giant turned institutional bitcoin bull – has done something many of us thought it incapable of doing: it’s <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/microstrategy-sells-off-bitcoin-first-162620178.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">selling some of its bitcoin</a>.</p>
<h2>MicroStrategy Sells, Then Buys, BTC</h2>
<p>MicroStrategy announced it had sold some of its BTC reserves on December 22, 2022. The company says it did so for tax purposes, but that it’s also going to use some of the proceeds to purchase additional bitcoin, suggesting that while executives are arguably trying to play everything a little straighter, they still haven’t fully grasped the lessons of the past.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy sold about 704 bitcoin units, which at the time, went for about $11.8 million. This is a huge dip in profit for the firm considering how much those units were likely purchased for. The company has been buying bitcoin for over two years, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-is-already-paying-off-big-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">beginning first in August</a> of 2020. It arguably started a trend, as at that time, institutions investing in crypto just wasn’t something that really happened, and if it did, it was extremely rare.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy was the first major institution to invest in bitcoin. From there, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/square-just-bought-a-whole-lot-of-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">companies like Square</a> also took part in crypto investing. At the time of that initial purchase, MicroStrategy bought bitcoin for around $10,000 per unit, which back at the time, was considered a major number. Nobody could have anticipated that just over a year later, the currency would nearly increase its size by about six times.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy initially contended with a $2K profit gain for each unit, as the price of bitcoin instantly went from $10K to $12,000 before the month was out. Given that the company had bought over $250 million worth of the asset, it was assumed that things were moving in the right direction, though next month turned out to be particularly bearish for bitcoin, and the currency dropped in price.</p>
<p>Many other companies likely would have written their losses off and stepped away, though MicroStrategy stayed in the game. It continued <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/microstrategy-just-bought-a-whole-lot-more-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">to invest hundreds of millions</a> of dollars into BTC, and by the time BTC reached $68,000 the following November, MicroStrategy had billions of dollars in bitcoin to its name, making it one of the most successful crypto investors in history.</p>
<p>But with so many losses recorded for 2022, it’s unfortunate that those billions in profit have since turned into billions in debt. The bitcoin decision became disastrous, and Michael Saylor – the 30+ year CEO of the company – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/michael-saylor-btc-bull-and-microstrategy-chief-executive-steps-down/" data-wpel-link="internal">resigned from his position</a>, choosing instead to serve as the executive chairman.</p>
<h2>Trying to Grease the Tax Wheels?</h2>
<p>Regarding its recent selling and purchasing decision, MicroStrategy said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>MicroStrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drama surrounding the fall of famed crypto exchange FTX just keeps getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<h2>FTX Will Be With Us a Long Time</h2>
<p>It has been <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/us-prosecutors-probing-possible-theft-150531504.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">announced that several prosecutors</a> are looking into the disappearance of approximately <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/half-a-billion-dollars-goes-missing-from-ftx-exchange/" data-wpel-link="internal">$370 million in crypto</a> funds that vanished from the exchange just hours after its head executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The prosecutors investigating have been hired by the Department of Justice (DOJ), which has frozen several remaining account funds to ensure they are not taken or dabbled with while the bankruptcy case proceeds or while SBF awaits his upcoming trial in California.</p>
<p>Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic announced two months ago that the funds stolen off FTX were later exchanged for ether on decentralized exchanges. Other portions went through mixers to hide the currencies’ origins and to prevent prying eyes from getting involved. In addition, the company’s new CEO John Ray III has stated that those involved with the company knew about unauthorized access taking place about 24 hours prior to the company’s bankruptcy filings, which occurred on November 11 of 2022.</p>
<p>FTX will likely go down as one of the most embarrassing blunders to ever occur within the confines of the crypto space. The exchange rose to prominence in under three years, first coming to fruition in 2019. The company was considered one of the top five crypto exchanges in the world, and Sam Bankman-Fried was lauded as a genius by many. His net worth, prior to the trading platform’s collapse, was listed at several billion dollars.</p>
<p>However, in mid-November of last year, SBF <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">began complaining of a liquidity crunch</a> on social media and made the claim that his enterprise was in fast need of cash. He initially approached his largest rival Binance about having the larger firm buy out his firm, and for a while, it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">looked like things were</a> heading in that direction.</p>
<h2>Binance Cannot Help</h2>
<p>However, Binance eventually backed away from the deal, claiming that the problems FTX was facing were too <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">big for it to handle</a>. With too little money on hand, FTX had no <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">choice but to file bankruptcy</a>, and SBF resigned from his post as the company’s head honcho. He was later arrested and served time in a Bahamian jail before <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/business/sbf-extradition-bahamas/index.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">being extradited back</a> to the U.S. He is currently living at his parents’ house in the Golden State while awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The probe involving the stolen funds is separate from the charges that SBF is currently facing. It is alleged by some that the theft may have been an inside job, though significant evidence has not been uncovered to support this claim. Whoever is convicted of the theft would likely be charged with computer fraud, which presently comes with a maximum sentence of about ten years.</p>

<p><em>Bitcoin price is rising above $20,000 against the US Dollar. BTC might extend gains if there is a clear move above the $21,500 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a fresh increase from the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-climbs-and-aims-steady-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$18,750 support zone</a>. A base was formed and the price climbed higher above the $19,500 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The bulls pushed the price above the $20,000 resistance and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The upward move was such that the price climbed towards the $21,500 resistance zone. A high is formed near $21,595 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>

<p>An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $21,500 level. The next major resistance might near the $22,000 zone. The first major resistance is near the $22,500 level. A clear move above the $22,500 level might send the price towards $24,000, above which the price might rise towards the $25,000 level.</p>
<p>Any more gains might push the price towards the $26,200 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might decline below the $21,000 level. The first major support is near $20,900 or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $18,714 swing low to $21,595 high.</p>

<p>In the stated case, the price could decline towards the $19,450 level. Any more losses might send the price towards the $18,000 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Yen is the CEO and co-founder of Proton, a privacy-centered organization that seeks to provide a whole new (autonomous) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2022/12/27/andy-yen-ceo-of-proton-on-the-tech-giants-that-dominate-the-internet-the-webs-future-and-bitcoin/?sh=2ba9e2d34075" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">version of the Internet</a>.</p>
<h2>Yen Wants to See Change in the Crypto Space</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, he gave his thoughts on <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>, crypto, and what traders can expect in terms of legislation and what the space will hold.</p>
<p>In the past, Yen has gone on record about being a bitcoin and crypto supporter. Right now, bitcoin is only accepted as a form of payment amongst limited agencies and enterprises, and given the circumstances surrounding bitcoin, Yen himself is not entirely sure about what will happen. He’s not sure if he’ll continue to hold it or not, nor is he sure if Proton will accept payments via the Bitcoin Lightning Network. In the interview, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, so you know, it&#8217;s kind of an interesting topic given the meltdown in the financial markets. Proton has always kept some of our reserves in bitcoin, and this is something that&#8217;s already known out in the world. There’s an internal debate; I don&#8217;t have the answer to that yet. I&#8217;m not sure if we continue to hold bitcoin or not hold bitcoin. Again, I&#8217;m not, let&#8217;s say a bitcoin industry insider, but I&#8217;m happy to share some of my perspectives. I think there&#8217;s just too much fraud and abuse and other objectionable things, incredulous things, especially when you look at things like NFTs and some of the other things that happened at the tail end of let&#8217;s say, the recent bubble, right? There&#8217;s just too much fraud and too much icky stuff in the space.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Regulation Could Possibly Work</h2>
<p>He continued with his thoughts on regulation and appears to be in favor of it. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, this might not be a popular opinion, but I do believe the crypto community is well served by taking a stronger stance on regulation, and I don&#8217;t mean by having lawmakers come in and set rules and laws on what you can and cannot do because they don&#8217;t understand the space, but I think a lot of players within the space. We ought to have some moderation and maybe you know, self-regulation, if that&#8217;s even possible, right? I think it&#8217;s important to do that or else we have a continuous cycle of spikes and crashes and spikes and crashes, and that&#8217;s not good in the long term. People are not going to have faith and confidence and trust in an asset class if it’s frequently having 80 percent crash cycles. We need the crash cycles to be less and less severe over time, and that&#8217;s just not happening. This crash cycle is just as bad as the last one, and that shows me that we haven&#8217;t really learned our lesson here, so maybe a controversial view, but that&#8217;s my personal view on this.</p></blockquote>
