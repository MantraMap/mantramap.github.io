Phil Creagh, an Auckland lawyer who acted as Bitcache’s director until Sept. 2020, is reported to have applied for the startup’s liquidation on May 24. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcache&#8217;s Unpaid Legal Fees</h2>
<p>A New Zealand-based crypto startup previously promoted by prominent crypto advocate and entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, has been reportedly liquidated over unpaid legal fees. According to a <a href="https://www.newsroom.co.nz/kim-dotcoms-crypto-business-liquidated?">report</a> by Newsroom, owners of the startup known as Bitcache have not contested the decision to liquidate.</p>
<p>The liquidation of the startup, which Kim Dotcom lauded as a platform that would revolutionize the way online content creators get paid, came more than six years after it was launched. Phil Creagh, an Auckland lawyer who acted as Bitcache’s director until Sept. 2020, is reported to have applied for the startup’s liquidation on May 24.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Commenting on the decision to liquidate Bitcache before it achieved any of its objectives, Creagh said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s pretty straightforward, there are fees owed and not paid. The company has not taken any steps so far to avoid being placed in liquidation. We’ll put it in liquidation and see what, if anything, can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lawyer added that his firm Anderson Creagh Lai stopped representing the Kim Dotcom-backed startup some time ago.</p>
<p>According to the Newsroom report, Bitcache initially hit a major obstacle in early 2017 when the platform&#8217;s planned launch was interrupted by what Dotcom referred to as a &#8220;hiccup.&#8221; Since then, attempts to launch the platform have all failed. The report added that Bitcache, which reportedly last filed a return to the Companies Office in 2021, is now likely to be removed from the Companies Register.</p>

The economist said partially paying government workers with gold coins can &#8220;help curtail the black market dominance&#8221; in the country&#8217;s currency market. </strong></p>
<h2>Dollar Shortages and Rising Inflation</h2>
<p>A Zimbabwean economist, George Nhepera, has urged authorities in the Southern African nation to consider paying a portion of government workers’ salaries with gold coins. According to the economist, paying part of the workers’ salaries with gold coins can &#8220;help curtail the black market dominance&#8221; in the country&#8217;s currency market.</p>
<p>Nhepera’s call for measures to cushion government workers with gold coins follows the local currency’s sharp depreciation in June. The currency&#8217;s plunge on the parallel market is reported to have sparked a wave of steep price hikes which eroded the purchasing power of salaries denominated in local currency.</p>
<p>While workers have in some cases demanded to be paid in U.S. dollars, Zimbabwean authorities insist that the country does not have enough greenbacks and therefore this may not be a sustainable option. The government&#8217;s reluctance to pay workers with U.S. dollars coupled with rising inflation has now prompted experts like Nhepera to suggest alternatives that the Zimbabwean government can choose.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Analyst: Calls for Gold Coin Denominated Salaries Must Be Rejected</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/consider-paying-civil-servants-in-gold-coins/">remarks</a> published by the Chronicle, Nhepera, who is also the Lupane State University business clinic development manager, said the government should think of using recently launched financial instruments.</p>
<p>&#8220;To this end, they should be promoted in terms of their use for both people-to-people transactions and people-to-business and business-to-business. Once this has been achieved with full market confidence, surely our government can take a giant step to include a portion, say 50% of the civil servant salaries and benefits be paid in these innovative instruments,&#8221; the economist said.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-zimbabwes-central-bank-set-to-launch-p2p-platform-for-facilitating-gold-backed-digital-currency-transactions/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the gold coins were launched by the Zimbabwean central bank as part of measures that were aimed at diminishing local residents’ demand for U.S. dollars. The gold coins were also expected to act as &#8220;an alternative retail investment product for value preservation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the same Chronicle report, Morris Mpala, an economic analyst, is quoted arguing against Nhepera’s suggestion. According to Mpala, paying part of government employees’ salaries with gold coins &#8220;defeats the purpose of encouraging the use of local currency to the populace.&#8221; The economic analyst added that while the idea might seem noble, from the standpoint of &#8220;liquidity management&#8221; this should not be encouraged.</p>

The cryptocurrency balance of an Ethereum wallet has also been declared as part of $1 billion in income received from various sources.</strong></p>
<h2>Donald Trump Details Income From NFTs, Speaking Fees, Hotel Sale</h2>
<p>The 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, has provided more information about his financial state, detailing income earned from speaking fees, the sale of his Washington, D.C. hotel and digital collectibles, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>In a revised disclosure, filed with the Office of Government Ethics, he reveals the exact sums for more than $1 billion in income received from these and other sources that he had previously declared only in broad terms to the Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p>In the earlier disclosure submitted in April, Trump, now running for a second, non-consecutive term in the 2024 election, was allowed to indicate broad ranges for some types of income like dividends, capital gains, interest, rent, and royalties. Other types of income, such as salaries and speaking fees, he is expected to disclose in exact amounts, the report noted.</p>

<p>The presidential hopeful gave more details on the company that receives licensing fees for using Trump’s image on a collection of NFTs, CIC Digital LLC, in the latest disclosure. The latter owns a U.S. bank account with less than $1,000 but also an Ethereum wallet holding between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of crypto.</p>
<p>The former head of state announced his <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump Digital Trading Cards</a> in December, when the first badge was sold within hours of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trump-launches-nft-card-collection-sweepstake-winners-could-dine-or-golf-with-the-45th-president/">launch</a>. The tokens listed on the NFT marketplace Opensea depict him as numerous characters, from golfer to Superman.</p>
<p>The NFT market was affected by negative developments in the crypto space in the past year. In June, the monthly global sales volumes were down 38% compared to a year earlier, according to blockchain data provider Cryptoslam. However, the Trump Cards registered a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trump-cards-jump-amid-indictment-strong-quarter-for-nft-market/">spike in sales</a> after the former president was indicted earlier this year.</p>

The move comes as more and more countries worldwide are seeking to de-dollarize.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia and 10 Southeast Asian Nations Explore National Currency Usage in Trade</h2>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov revealed his country&#8217;s efforts to settle trade with 10 Southeast Asian countries in national currencies in an interview with Indonesian national newspaper Kompas. The interview was published in English on Wednesday, with the aid of Microsoft Azure Open AI and Google Translation AI. ASEAN members comprise Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Lavrov explained that Russia does not see the current international situation as a &#8220;new cold war.&#8221; He emphasized that the country is focused on the development of a multipolar world order, noting that the West, led by the U.S., is actively trying to slow down and reverse this process. “Their goal is not to strengthen global security and engage in mutual development, but only to maintain their hegemony in world affairs and further carry out neo-colonial agendas. In short, nothing has changed, as usual, they solve their problems at the expense of others,” he opined.</p>
<p>“Western egocentrism that disregards the interests of Global South and East countries actually contributes to the search for alternative cooperation formats in all fields. Due to the confiscation of Russia&#8217;s foreign reserves in the U.S. and Europe, there is a growing understanding in the global community that no one is immune from the confiscation of tangible assets stored in Western jurisdiction,” Lavrov detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only limited to Russia, several other countries are consistently reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar, starting to switch to the use of alternative payment and calculation systems through national currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>“At the same time, the effectiveness of interstate association, in which Western countries do not participate, is increasing,&#8221; the top Russian official described, giving the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as examples. The BRICS countries comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The Russian diplomat emphasized Russia&#8217;s &#8220;constructive cooperation in the UN and other multilateral platforms on various urgent international issues,&#8221; adding that Russia is working closely with Indonesia this year as the chair of ASEAN.</p>

<p>Lavrov said that he plans to attend an upcoming ASEAN ministerial-level meeting in Jakarta. “We are giving special attention to the development of a strategic partnership with the association,” he stressed. “We have a history of relationships for more than three decades.”</p>
<p>The Russian official detailed that Russia is focusing its efforts on reinforcing the architecture established around ASEAN to foster stability and cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The practical cooperation interests between Russia and ASEAN countries, including Indonesia, will be answered with the launch of consultations on the use of national currencies in mutual settlements.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 10 ASEAN member states have also intensified their own de-dollarization efforts. In May, they <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">agreed</a> to &#8220;encourage the use of local currencies for economic and financial transactions among ASEAN member states.&#8221; Indonesia&#8217;s central bank governor said in April that his country is following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-is-following-brics-de-dollarization-lead-says-central-bank-governor/">BRICS&#8217; de-dollarization lead</a> to shift away from the U.S. dollar. The country recently introduced a new <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-introducing-new-national-payment-system-to-protect-against-geopolitical-consequences/">national payment system</a> to further its de-dollarization efforts and protect against &#8220;possible geopolitical consequences.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Lawyer on Ruling of SEC v Ripple Case</h2>
<p>Lawyer Bryan Jacoutot shared his analysis of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">ruling</a> in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple case on Twitter Thursday. Jacoutot is an attorney at Election Law Group and Taylor English Duma. In addition to specializing in general litigation and election law, he is actively building out Taylor English Duma&#x2019;s Bitcoin practice group. He began:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#x2019;ve reviewed the district court ruling on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> and it rests on very shaky ground. Expect an appeal.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that the court did rule that Ripple&#x2019;s sale of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> to institutional investors amounted to an unlawful security sale. Noting that Ripple received nearly a billion dollars from these <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> sales, the lawyer predicted that the crypto firm &#x201C;will presumably be required to return/disgorge,&#x201D; as well as pay penalties and fines.</p>
<p>In addition, he noted: &#x201C;The court also found that, in the context of the &#x2018;programmatic sale&#x2019; of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> to random people, that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> DID NOT constitute an investment contract under Howey. And thus <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">it was not a security</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Stating that &#x201C;the court&#x2019;s reasoning is weak,&#x201D; Jacoutot opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The court (IMO, incorrectly) relied on the fact buyers didn&#x2019;t know if the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> came from Ripple. But that doesn&#x2019;t matter under Howey, only whether they expected profit based on the efforts of Ripple, which I think one could clearly say buyers expected (how else does <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> moon?).</p></blockquote>

<h2>Implication of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> Ruling for Ethereum</h2>
<p>Drawing attention to Ethereum, the lawyer cautioned that the outcome of the SEC v. Ripple case &#x201C;does NOT clear the path for Ethereum Foundation even if it is upheld &#x2026; because of important distinctions in the methods used by Ripple to sell the &#x2018;pre-mine.'&#x201D; He highlighted the court&#x2019;s ruling regarding institutional buyers acquiring unregistered securities, emphasizing: &#x201D;The pre-sale of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> was ALOT like that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jacoutot explained that firstly, &#x201C;Everyone knew they were buying from Ethereum Foundation (which the Ripple Court found significant).&#x201D; Secondly, &#x201C;The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> purchased during the pre-sale was subject to lockup period, which was significant in finding the institutional investors bought <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> as a security.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In conclusion, while emphasizing that he does not want to diminish the win for Ripple and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> supporters, the lawyer warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>It may be a short-lived victory. I think the judge got the law wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;But even if she didn&#x2019;t, many projects (including Ethereum) remain exposed. And the court left open many other vexing securities questions,&#x201D; he concluded.</p>

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong quickly addressed the issue, asking other users if they have encountered the same problem with Bank of America.</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase&#x2019;s CEO Raises Concerns Over Account Closures at Bank of America</h2>
<p>Bank of America (BOFA) came under scrutiny on Wednesday when Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts, revealed on Twitter that the bank unexpectedly closed his bank account, which he had been using for 15 years, without giving a reason. He strongly suspects that the closure was due to him using the bank account for bitcoin transactions through Coinbase. &#x201C;This is a war on bitcoin & crypto,&#x201D; he tweeted.</p>
<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to the tweet, asking if other Bank of America customers have encountered similar issues. &#x201C;If so, not ok,&#x201D; the Coinbase boss tweeted. He subsequently conducted a <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1679314875619897345">Twitter poll</a>, inquiring whether Bank of America had closed the accounts of any other individuals due to their transactions with his crypto exchange. The poll closed with 16,701 votes, 8.9% of which said yes while 19.3% said no.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-597746 aligncenter" title="Bank of America Faces Scrutiny After Coinbase User Alleges That the Bank Closed His Account Over Bitcoin Transactions" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bank-of-america-brian-armstrong.jpg" alt="Bank of America Faces Scrutiny After Coinbase User Alleges That the Bank Closed His Account Over Bitcoin Transactions" width="806" height="483" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bank-of-america-brian-armstrong-300x180.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bank-of-america-brian-armstrong-768x460.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bank-of-america-brian-armstrong.jpg 806w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px"></p>

<p>Many people shared their personal experiences in reply to Armstrong&#x2019;s poll, with some stating that they hadn&#x2019;t encountered any issues. However, a notable portion revealed that their accounts had been closed or suspended by the bank following their Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>One Twitter user wrote: &#x201C;BOFA and Chase probably see <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> as an existential threat so they want to shadow ban/block the onramp and offramps to exchanges.&#x201D; Another wrote: &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve never closed my account over Coinbase transactions, but in the past (especially the year leading up to Covid), they would frequently call me, tell me my account activity looked suspicious, and inquire as to what the nature of my business with Coinbase was.&#x201D; A different user detailed: &#x201C;Both 5th/3rd Bank and Capital One have rejected deposits or sales with Coinbase. I eventually was able to arrange for ongoing deposits but they do not make it easy. They were &#x2018;protecting&#x2019; me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/">took action against Bank of America</a> for &#x201C;illegally charging junk fees, withholding credit card rewards, and opening fake accounts.&#x201D; The bank is ordered to pay more than $100 million to harmed consumers and $150 million in penalties to the two agencies.</p>

Ritchie Torres has called for an investigation into the special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) license given by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to Prometheum, a cryptocurrency exchange platform. In two letters sent to U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro and SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffries, Torres calls for investigation of the &#8220;backroom deals&#8221; allegedly brokered between the SEC and Prometheum.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres Requests Investigation Into Prometheum&#8217;s License</h2>
<p>Ritchie Torres, a U.S. representative for New York, is <a href="https://twitter.com/RepRitchie/status/1679534903661301761?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requesting</a> an official investigation on the licenses the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave to Prometheum, a digital assets trading platform that Torres states &#8220;does not trade digital assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>On July 13, Torres sent two letters to U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro and SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey to request an independent review of the failure of the SEC to provide a workable path for crypto exchanges to register, and also on the alleged &#8220;backroom deals&#8221; that the agency brokered with Prometheum.</p>
<p>Rep. Torres slammed Prometheum, referring to it as a Potemkin platform used by the commission as a &#8220;talking point for crypto critics&#8221; instead of a trading platform for crypto customers.</p>

<h2>SEC Chair Gary Gensler Accused of Politicizing Agency Processes</h2>
<p>In the letters, Torres refers to SEC Chair Gary Gensler by name, stating that granting a license to Prometheum is his latest attempt to &#8220;politicize the registration process to an extent seldom seen in the SEC&#8217;s history.&#8221; Prometheum came into the spotlight in June when its co-CEO Aaron Kaplan testified at a congressional hearing that there was a path for registering a digital assets exchange with the commission and that crypto companies were &#8220;simply not willing to comply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, revealed that Prometheum executives had links with federal agencies and financial companies such as the SEC, FINRA, NYSE, and CBOE, giving origin to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prometheum-testimony-raises-doubts-crypto-community-questions-credibility-amid-regulatory-clarity-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculations</a> about the approval of its special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) license.</p>
<p>Torres criticized the SEC&#8217;s behavior in the digital assets arena, declaring that the regulator was like an &#8220;overzealous traffic agent who arbitrarily tickets drivers for speeding while keeping everyone endlessly guessing about the speeding limit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regulation by enforcement is no way to regulate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 10, U.S. Senator Thomas Tuberville and a group of senators sent a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-expresses-concern-over-prometheum-co-ceos-congressional-testimony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> to SEC Chair Gary Gensler and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to alert them about the ties that Prometheum could have with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) linked companies and its possible false testimony given to the Congress.</p>

<h2>Fraud Charges Lead to $40 Million Bail Bond for Former Celsius CEO Mashinsky</h2>
<p>Alexander Mashinsky, founder and former CEO of Celsius, was arrested and charged with fraud Thursday in New York. Mashinsky&#8217;s legal team said he vehemently denies the allegations and described the charges as unfounded. &#8220;[Mashinsky] vehemently denies the allegations brought today,” attorney Jonathan Ohring <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/07/13/cryptocurrency-celsius-mashinsky-arrest/a95c9ece-218f-11ee-8994-4b2d0b694a34_story.html">said</a> in an email to The Washington Post.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">U.S. Attorney Damian Williams on today&#39;s indictment against Alexander Mashinsky and Roni Cohen-Pavon: “Exactly one year ago today, Celsius Network, a crypto platform that, at its height, managed approximately $25 billion in customer assets, filed for bankruptcy protection 1/6</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Mashinsky&#8217;s <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.601957/gov.uscourts.nysd.601957.5.0.pdf">bail</a> was set at $40 million, and he is restricted from leaving the Southern District of New York, according to his bail agreement. Mashinsky lives in Manhattan with his wife, who co-signed his bail agreement along with an unknown co-signer. In addition to travel restrictions, the Celsius founder is prohibited from opening a bank account or trading crypto assets.</p>
<p>His bond was secured by funds in his bank account and his Manhattan residence. Mashinsky&#8217;s arrest occurred before the CFTC, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-sues-bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius-alleges-misrepresentation-of-customer-count-and-risky-practices/">SEC</a>, and FTC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftc-slaps-crypto-lender-celsius-with-4-7b-fine-for-deceiving-consumers-and-mismanaging-deposits/">filed</a> charges against Celsius, its related companies and three former executives, including Mashinsky.</p>
<p>The indictment against the former CEO of Celsius <a href="https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1679530873400565760?s=20">alleges</a> that from 2018 to 2022, Mashinsky and Celsius misled investors. It accuses Mashinsky of manipulating the market of the Celsius Network&#8217;s CEL token and committing fraud.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s charges against Celsius and Mashinsky assert investors were sold unregistered securities through fraudulent, unregistered offerings. Ohring, Mashinsky&#8217;s lawyer, called the accusations &#8220;baseless&#8221; and emphasized Mashinsky&#8217;s eagerness to defend himself in court.</p>

The majority of this growth transpired after the decisive Ripple Labs case verdict, resulting in bitcoin&#x2019;s dominance dipping from 50% to its present level of 48.6%.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Ripple Labs Case Verdict Triggers $60 Billion Crypto Market Expansion</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The partial summary judgment within the Ripple lawsuit propelled the digital asset <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> to a 60%+ increase within a single day. Consequently, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s substantial gains triggered a surge in numerous altcoins&#x2019; values. For example, Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>) saw an increase of over 40%, while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> leaped more than 20% in the past day. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230712140022/https://coinmarketcap.com/">Archived data</a> retrieved from coinmarketcap.com (CMC) on July 12, 2023, exhibited Bitcoin&#x2019;s dominance at 50% in relation to the $1.19 trillion crypto economy.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dominance has diminished to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">48.6%</a> due to significant returns in the altcoin arena overshadowing its market presence. Just two days ago, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> ranked as the sixth largest market capitalization among multiple crypto assets; however, it now boasts the fourth-largest position.
