Commenting on the de-dollarization trend and the possible U.S. default, he emphasized that without the USD, “financial markets will be disrupted by the lack of any safe, liquid asset.”</strong></p>
<h2>Economist Paul Krugman on De-Dollarization and USD Alternatives</h2>
<p>Paul Krugman, who won the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity, shared his opinion Sunday about a possible U.S. default and the U.S. dollar losing its status as the world’s reserve currency.</p>
<p>He explained in a tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>The risk from a debt default is *not* that some other currency will take over the key role now played by dollar securities. It is that *no* currency will be available to play that role — that financial markets will be disrupted by the lack of any safe, liquid asset.</p></blockquote>
<p>Krugman is not worried about the U.S. dollar losing its world&#8217;s reserve currency status. In an opinion piece published by the New York Times earlier this month, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/opinion/us-dollar-reserve-currency.html">argued</a> that the USD&#8217;s dominance is not in danger. He believes that &#8220;reports of the dollar’s coming demise are also probably greatly exaggerated.&#8221; The economist further asserted that the Chinese yuan &#8220;isn&#8217;t a viable dollar rivel&#8221; due to the Chinese government&#8217;s capital controls.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize-winning economist opined: &#8220;Even if some governments express a desire to see payments conducted in other currencies, it’s not at all clear they can make that happen, since we’re mostly talking about private-sector decisions. And even if they can make partial de-dollarization stick, all the other advantages of the dollar as a banking and borrowing currency will remain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some people disagreed with Krugman&#8217;s assessment regarding the U.S. dollar. Economist Michael Hudson called Krugman&#8217;s New York Times article &#8220;<a href="https://scheerpost.com/2023/05/19/ny-times-is-wrong-on-dedollarization-economist-michael-hudson-debunks-paul-krugmans-dollar-defense/">deliberate ignorance</a>.&#8221; He stressed: &#8220;You have to really have tunnel vision and not understand the most basic economic history to make the misrepresentations that Krugman said.&#8221; He explained: &#8220;The trick that Krugman uses, and he’s being deliberately deceptive here, he talks about the current account deficit. The current account is not the balance of payments &#8230; Krugman deliberately leaves out the fact that America makes an enormous amount of money on capital account.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding worldwide de-dollarization efforts, Hudson said: &#8220;Krugman is saying that other people have no reason at all for what they’re doing. And when they move out of the dollar, there’s no reason for them to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A growing number of nations are transitioning away from the U.S. dollar and opting to utilize their respective national currencies instead. Recently, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">10 Southeast Asian nations</a> agreed to encourage the use of national currencies to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar and Western payment systems. The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have also been pushing for de-dollarization. The economic group is working on a common currency, which is expected to be discussed by the BRICS leaders at their upcoming summit.</p>

Meanwhile, global investment bank Goldman Sachs has estimated that the “real deadline” for a possible U.S. default is “more like” June 8-9.</strong></p>
<h2>Yellen and Goldman Sachs on U.S. Default, Debt Ceiling</h2>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated her concerns about a possible U.S. default on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; Sunday. Responding to a question about the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">June 1 deadline</a> for a possible U.S. default, she said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I indicated in my last letter to Congress that we expect to be unable to pay all of our bills in early June and possibly as soon as June 1. And I will continue to update Congress, but I certainly haven&#8217;t changed my assessment. So I think that&#8217;s a hard deadline.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the U.S. government is expecting some tax payments on June 15 which would provide some revenue. When asked about the likelihood the U.S. could get to June 15 “to avoid breaching the debt ceiling,” Yellen said: &#8220;There&#8217;s always uncertainty about tax receipts and spending. And so it&#8217;s hard to be absolutely certain about this, but my assessment is that the odds of reaching June 15th, while being able to pay all of our bills, is quite low.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on &#8220;extraordinary measures&#8221; that President Joe Biden could take to resolve the debt ceiling issue in Congress, Yellen said: &#8220;There has been much discussion of the 14th Amendment. And, as President Biden said &#8230; it doesn&#8217;t seem like something that could be appropriately used in these circumstances, given the legal uncertainty around it, and given the tight timeframe we&#8217;re on. So my devout hope is that Congress will raise the debt ceiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yellen noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>My assumption is that if the debt ceiling isn&#8217;t raised, there will be hard choices to make about what bills go unpaid.</p></blockquote>

<p>Global investment bank Goldman Sachs, however, predicts that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations approximately one week after June 1. Alec Phillips, Goldman Sachs&#8217; chief political economist, told Bloomberg TV on Friday: &#8220;The reality is that Congress has to do this at some point very soon, and they should just go ahead and do it &#8230; So waiting for the last minute isn&#8217;t necessarily the right move, even though we think that maybe they could go a little bit longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs economist shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our guess right now is that the real deadline is probably more like June 8th, 9th, that&#8217;s when they&#8217;re at sort of greatest risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently said that there is a significant risk of the U.S. defaulting in the<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-faces-significant-risk-of-default-in-june-congressional-budget-office-warns/"> first two weeks of June</a>.</p>
<p>Many people have warned that the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations will have catastrophic consequences, including a <a class="sc-bMGbkn bIDoDD" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/harvard-economics-professor-us-default-could-spark-global-financial-crisis/">global financial crisis</a>. Top executives of 146 major companies in the U.S. have urged Biden and congressional leaders to act swiftly to prevent a U.S. default, warning of “<a class="sc-bMGbkn bIDoDD" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/146-top-executives-urge-biden-to-prevent-us-default-warns-of-disastrous-consequences/">disastrous consequences</a>.” Moreover, some believe that a U.S. default would risk the dollar’s <a class="sc-bMGbkn bIDoDD" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lawmaker-warns-us-default-risks-dollars-reserve-currency-status-exploitation-by-china-and-russia/">reserve currency status</a>.</p>

As of now, data indicates that the most recent block verified on the network was over 16 hours ago.</strong></p>
<h2>Dash Network Upgrade Fails, Resulting in Block Production Halt, Cause Is Currently Unknown</h2>
<p>On Monday, May 22, 2023, block production came to a halt, prompting Dash Core Group CTO Samuel Westrich to take to Twitter at 1:12 a.m. Eastern (ET) to address the issue. In his tweet, Westrich <a href="https://twitter.com/SamWestrich/status/1660513873546596354?s=20">revealed</a> that the Dash Core upgrade to version 19 had encountered a snag, causing the chain to stall and block production to cease.</p>
<p>“The chain is stalled and currently not producing blocks. We have everyone investigating the issue. I will continue with updates on Twitter as we have more information,” he wrote.</p>
<p>As of 4:30 p.m. (ET) on Monday, block production remains at a standstill. There are also indications that the upgrade may have caused a fork, resulting in two separate chains. For example, the blockchain explorer at dash.org <a href="https://explorer.dash.org/insight/">reports</a> that the last block mined was block height 1,874,879, which was mined by Viabtc. However, Blockchair&#8217;s explorer shows that <a href="https://blockchair.com/dash/block/1874880">block 1,874,880</a> was mined by Binance&#8217;s mining pool, suggesting that the chain may have bifurcated.</p>

<p>News of the block production glitch <a href="https://twitter.com/pledditor/status/1660608295038484481?s=12&amp;t=87SbzbLjBV4hhLlQ0Y48LA">quickly spread</a> across <a href="https://twitter.com/wublockchain/status/1660595924962533376?s=12&amp;t=87SbzbLjBV4hhLlQ0Y48LA">social media platforms</a> like Twitter. Just days before on May 15, the official Dashpay Twitter account had urged all users of the Dash network to &#8220;update their software to accommodate the upcoming hard fork.&#8221; Close to five hours ago, the Dash Core developer by the name of Pasta said that the release of <a href="https://github.com/dashpay/dash/releases/tag/v19.1.0">version 19.1.0</a> would address the issues at hand.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dash is down for more than 15 hours now due to a faulty hard-forking upgrade <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/56wUvwsQJn">https://t.co/56wUvwsQJn</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“This release should resolve the chain stall once a sufficient number of masternodes and miners have upgraded,” Pasta <a href="https://twitter.com/DashBoost_Pasta/status/1660700545139482624?s=20">wrote</a>. “Please be aware of the known issues listed in the release announcement. A reindex may be needed.” The tweet written by Pasta was published at 1:33 p.m. ET on Monday. A Twitter user by the name of Dash Memes responded to Pasta to thank the developers for the new release.</p>
<p>“Thank you for hard work pushing this out. I hope serious effort is put into the post-mortem to evaluate how this came to pass and what can be done to eliminate this risk for ever happening again,” the Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Dash_Memes/status/1660701083830763530?s=20">replied</a>. “Dash&#8217;s reputation has been seriously damaged today, the fix needs to be structural.”</p>

Written by Andy Verity, the book exposes how various central banks and politicians exerted pressure on banks during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). This coordinated effort sheds light on the extent of the scandal and the alleged involvement of powerful institutions in manipulating the rates.</strong></p>
<h2>Verity&#8217;s &#8216;Rigged&#8217; Uncovers Shocking Details About Rate-Rigging Scandals</h2>
<p>The Times dropped a financial bombshell on May 22, 2023, with an <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heat-that-led-to-libor-fix-came-from-the-top-f3k0bsgf8">exclusive extract</a> from Andy Verity&#8217;s latest book, &#8220;Rigged.&#8221; The article details how central banks and governments exerted pressure on banks <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fire.12240">to manipulate</a> key interest rates during the 2008 financial crisis. Shockingly, this information was not utilized when the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office cracked down on nearly 40 traders and brokers involved in the Libor and Euribor scandals, as <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/lie-bor-gate-20-rate-rigging-during-lehman-crisis-was-allegedly-central-bank-led">reported</a> by Zerohedge.</p>
<p>Zerohedge sheds more light on the revelations from Andy Verity&#8217;s book, &#8220;Rigged,&#8221; which the BBC also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65635243">reported</a> on in their article titled &#8220;Interest rate &#8216;rigging&#8217; evidence &#8216;covered up&#8217; by banks.&#8221; According to Verity&#8217;s book, during the Lehman crisis of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), “markets around the world were in a full-blown panic, with share prices plummeting.” In response, Verity claims that “central banks decided to act together to get real borrowing rates down.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/understanding-libor-scandal">The Libor</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1331677X.2020.1844029">Euribor scandals</a> were among the most <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID4177171_code2963863.pdf?abstractid=3449381">significant financial frauds</a> to emerge from the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). The scandals involved the manipulation of two key interest rate benchmarks: the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor). The scandal first came to light in 2012, and the Euribor scandal unfolded around the same time. It is believed that the motive behind the rate rigging was to make certain banks appear more financially stable than they actually were.</p>

<p>The BBC report revealed shocking allegations that the U.K. Treasury Committee of MPs chairman, Andrew Tyrie, believes Parliament &#8220;appears to have been misled.&#8221; Tyrie added that &#8220;the evidence that Mr. Verity has unearthed strongly suggests that the committee&#8217;s inquiry into the Libor scandal was not told the whole truth.&#8221; According to Verity&#8217;s book, &#8220;Rigged,&#8221; the scandal was not a secret to everyone, as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was allegedly informed of the rates scandals in November 2010.</p>
<p>The extract from Verity&#8217;s book exposes the ostensible involvement of several central bank entities, including the European Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Bank of England, Banque de France, Banco de Espana, and Banca d&#8217;Italia, in the Libor and Euribor benchmark events. The Times reached out to some of the entities mentioned in the book, but a few declined to comment on the matter.</p>

Or will they never be held responsible for the accusations? Share your thoughts about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Bitcoin Wallet From 2010 Comes Out of Hibernation on Bitcoin Pizza Day</h2>
<p>On Monday, May 22, 2023, bitcoin supporters are observing the landmark event when software programmer Laszlo Hanyecz <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0">traded 10,000 BTC</a> for two Papa John&#x2019;s supreme pizzas. Valued at $266 million at current exchange rates, Hanyecz has repeatedly stated that he has no regrets about the decision.</p>

<p>Coinciding with the 13th-anniversary celebrations of Bitcoin Pizza Day, a long-time bitcoin holder <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1B67KGYNMxPB6cznHTTzgGprmw7kBxTRB1">opted to spend</a> 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from an address established on July 12, 2010. The original acquisition transaction took place just 51 days after Hanyecz utilized his 10,000 Bitcoins and the coins are now worth $1.33 million based on current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchange rates.</p>
<p>Throughout this year, there have been numerous instances of block reward expenditures from 2011 or inactive bitcoin addresses from later years; however, only four transactions involving block rewards from 2010 have occurred in 2023 thus far. The block subsidy spent by the address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/search?q=1B67KGYNMxPB6cznHTTzgGprmw7kBxTRB1">1B67K</a>&#x201D; also includes 50 bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), which remains untouched today with a value of $5,736.</p>
<p>The transfer was found to lack privacy by Blockchair&#x2019;s privacy tool, <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/privacy-o-meter/7e8676bdfddf795b2a055b90fd1c1243f912499cb497ceb3a461a080cbc13388">revealing</a> &#x201C;critical&#x201D; issues that could lead to address tracking. A &#x201C;critical&#x201D; rating indicates that Blockchair identified aspects that significantly compromise the privacy of those involved &#x2014; for example, matched addresses were detected in the 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transaction made on Monday.</p>

<p>Btcparser.com <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1B67KGYNMxPB6cznHTTzgGprmw7kBxTRB1">spotted the transaction</a> from 2010 on its chain parsing platform and there&#x2019;s been three other exchanges from the same year: one occurring on <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1QC2eAKL4dmvvaNUwCcxobKhewRubj4rWt">March 20, 2023</a>, another taking place on <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=13UXyHZsVRLeu28VEmdRF3pduSAxzcHL9k">February 1, 2023,</a> and another that happened on <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/16M6tUcPmpVkZ92Lr9mGRuiEiubJgRav9N">April 22, 2023</a>. Prior to the February instance, a previous transfer involving a 2010 block subsidy took place on <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1CMisng6B8LJuBfAMMzfbx6Z8h1NZZdYod">December 30, 2022</a>. Data from late 2022 and early 2023 reveal that transactions from 2010 have become increasingly scarce.</p>

In an interview published on May 18, Rule emphasized that people&#8217;s anxiety about the purchasing power of conventional savings methods has always been the main factor driving gold prices. According to Rule, this trend is likely to continue, and he predicts that demand for gold will increase by fourfold in the near future.</strong></p>
<h2>Rick Rule Forecasts Fourfold Increase in Gold Demand Amidst Global Economic Uncertainty</h2>
<p>Amidst a turbulent global economy, both <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gold-silver-and-crypto-prices-surge-after-federal-reserves-quarter-point-increase/">precious metals</a> and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">cryptocurrencies</a> have seen a surge in value in 2023. On May 3, 2023, gold&#8217;s price per ounce came awfully close to surpassing its all-time high, reaching $2,056 per ounce. However, the precious metal&#8217;s value has since taken a hit, plummeting to a low of $1,954 per ounce on May 18. As of today, May 22, 2023, gold&#8217;s price per ounce is hovering at <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/">$1,973</a>, marking a 1.6% decrease over the past 30 days.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/NI5KvAuNBbU">recent interview</a> with Kitco News host Ernest Hoffman, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealRickRule">Rick Rule</a>, the former CEO of Sprott Holdings and founder of Rule Investment Media, shared his thoughts on gold&#8217;s recent surge value. According to Rule, this is just the beginning. He believes that people&#8217;s fear of losing purchasing power has always been the primary factor driving gold&#8217;s value. “What&#8217;s always driven the gold price, more than anything else, is people&#8217;s concern about the maintenance of their purchasing power in more conventional savings instruments,” Rule explained to Hoffman. Rule added:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is nothing that should worry savers more than interest rates which are insufficient to keep pace with inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, Rule urged people to consider the potential for gold prices to soar even higher. He noted that precious metals-related investments currently make up less than half of one percent of all savings in investment asset classes in the United States, whereas the four-decade average market share is two percent.</p>

<p>During the interview with Hoffman, Rule also emphasized that the current economic climate, characterized by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-chair-powell-hints-at-possible-pause-in-interest-rate-hikes/">interest rate fluctuations</a>, quantitative easing (QE), and other financial mismanagement by policymakers, will only increase demand for gold. Rule said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If that&#8217;s correct, demand for precious metals-related assets will increase fourfold, which is precisely what I think is going to happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rule&#8217;s perspective is not unique among investors who believe that gold is poised for a meteoric rise. UBS, a prominent investment bank, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ubs-offers-3-reasons-to-buy-gold-now-forecasts-all-time-high-this-year/">predicts</a> that gold will reach an all-time high this year, while a recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gallup-poll-americans-preference-for-real-estate-crypto-plunges-fondness-for-gold-skyrockets/">Gallup Poll</a> of Americans revealed a surge in interest in gold investments for long-term savings. Additionally, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-banks-gold-purchases-make-record-breaking-start-in-q1-2023-228-4-tonnes-added-to-world-reserves/">first-quarter statistics</a> indicate that central banks worldwide have been purchasing gold at a &#8220;record-breaking&#8221; pace in 2023.</p>

The venture, which oversees substantial bitcoin mining rigs across nine data centers in diverse countries, has been offering reliable and effortless mining infrastructure to users for stable bitcoin profits through its native token and revolutionary NFTs. By prioritizing transparency, GoMining has launched an updated website and mobile app that offers comprehensive details on their products, all with the aim of transforming the entire blockchain industry.</span></p>
<p><b>Two Years of Effortless Bitcoin Mining</b></p>
<p><a href="https://is.gd/K5KJGa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a leading bitcoin mining project with over six years&#x2019; experience in the industry, is marking its second anniversary by rebranding its infrastructure. The project, which is run by a team of experts with extensive knowledge of mining, owns and operates large bitcoin mining rigs across nine data centers located in countries such as Kazakhstan, Norway, and the UAE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For two years now, GoMining has been providing a reliable and hassle-free mining infrastructure that has brought satisfaction and stable bitcoin profits to its customers through two core products: a native token featuring decentralized staking, and aesthetically pleasing bitcoin-mining NFTs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining (previously known as GMT) has undergone a renaming process to create a more recognizable brand umbrella for all of its projects. According to company CEO Mark Zalan, the new name better reflects the essence of its token and NFT products and helps to avoid confusion with other ventures. &#x201C;We firmly believe that the blockchain community worldwide needs more clarity and transparency. It has been a core value in all of my previous experiences, and I&#x2019;m dedicated to maintaining the highest level of openness for GoMining. We understand that our users and stakeholders expect and deserve clear and honest communication, and we&#x2019;re committed to meeting that expectation,&#x201D; says Zalan. &#x201C;We created a brand that is scalable and adaptable to future expansion and developments by the project,&#x201D; he adds. As per Zalan, leveraging many years of experience in the crypto mining industry has enabled GoMining to develop a vast level of expertise and knowledge of the market, allowing it to provide clients with high-quality services at the lowest costs possible. &#x201C;We have a proven track record of providing top-notch services to our clients and we&#x2019;ll continue to use our experience to build trust among our users,&#x2019;&#x2019; he says.</span></p>
<p><b>What&#x2019;s New?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per Zalan, the primary goal is to emphasize the importance of transparency in their infrastructure. To achieve this, they have launched an updated version of their website and mobile app that provides detailed information on their team&#x2019;s background, data centers, and products.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying NFTs on the marketplace is quick and easy, with just one click using popular payment options like Apple Pay or Google Pay. Once the transaction is completed, the NFTs are automatically sent to your virtual wallet. Customers can also select their preferred payment method based on the available options in their region or country.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-82.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230519%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230519T090906Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=12405410c09d5e0abf23200b0eb9e7706e110312da79153b1134542e0b55b65a"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-589058" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-82-768x512.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-82-300x200.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-82-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-82-768x512.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-82.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining has taken user convenience to the next level by providing a staking reward calculator that automatically calculates profitability based on the amount of funds and the type of staking. This eliminates the need for users to manually calculate their rewards, making it easier than ever to participate in staking programs.</span></p>
<p><b>GoMining Token</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining Token, the core offering of the project, provides users with two different decentralized staking options: fixed and flexible staking. These staking options offer several reward choices to users, either in Bitcoin or GoMining tokens.</span></p>
<p><b>Fixed Staking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can freeze their tokens for 3 months at 20% APR and earn rewards in native tokens. They can withdraw or relock their blocked tokens. Fixed staking is the most predictable product for both the company and holders. GMT Token accruals ensure obligation fulfillment even under unfavorable circumstances.</span></p>
<p><b>Flexible Staking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users&#x2019; tokens are blocked for 3 months, and they receive daily bitcoin rewards at a floating percentage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily profit in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is generated for users throughout the entire staking period after their initial investment. Flexible staking interest rates are subject to various factors, including market conditions for cryptocurrencies, mining equipment market conditions, mining complexity, and the price of Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to begin staking, users are required to open and close their own position on the GoMining Staking page to earn staking rewards. Flexible staking carries considerable risks, but it also presents the opportunity for significant rewards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By staking tokens, holders have the opportunity to both secure and lock their assets. The distribution of staking rewards is guaranteed by the smart contract code of GoMining Staking. The company uses staked tokens as collateral to purchase new equipment, generate mining yields, and pay staking rewards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining tokens are not only tradable on various exchanges, but also serve as a payment method for purchasing NFTs, game mechanics, and goods on online stores.</span></p>
<p><b>NFT</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining has launched an innovative NFT project called &#x201C;NFT by GoMining&#x201D; that features unique images of mining rigs supported by computing power, setting it apart from other NFT collections. One of the project&#x2019;s most distinctive features is the opportunity it offers users to mine Bitcoin, which provides a significant advantage over traditional mining methods.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-83.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230519%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230519T091129Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=dec9911824e4df96d09146d654e79134c929ae4ac0a2c948843b1e819a43db45"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-589059" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-83-768x512.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-83-300x200.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-83-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-83-768x512.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unnamed-83.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This NFT project additionally eliminates the usual hassles associated with mining, such as the need to buy expensive equipment and pay for high electricity bills, allowing users to enjoy a headache-free mining experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining&#x2019;s infrastructure provides users with two distinct ways to earn rewards. </span></p>
<p><b>Solo Mining </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users receive a stable daily mining reward by holding GoMining NFT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using solo mining mode, users can earn daily mining rewards by holding onto GoMining NFT. additionally have the opportunity to build their own mining farm, starting with just one mining device and gradually scaling up to more advanced equipment such as storage shelves, immersion baths, containers, and even large data centers. As they progress, users can transition from being a novice miner to the head of a successful mining empire.</span></p>
<p><b>Pool Mining</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pool mining is an exciting feature offered by GoMining that allows users to join a unique game based on real pool mining. This game enables users to mine in pools, create communities, and receive additional perks with mining reward multipliers of up to 256x. The game provides a platform for users to come together and collaborate, increasing their chances of earning rewards while having fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By participating in pool mining, users can create a community with other players, and the combined mining power of the community will generate more Bitcoin than if they were mining individually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the pool mining feature offered by GoMining provides users with a unique and exciting way to participate in bitcoin mining, while also creating a community and earning rewards.</span></p>

The move comes despite current sentiment of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. Cardano was also higher, snapping a losing streak in the process. </strong></p>
<h2>TRON (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>)</h2>
<p>Tron (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>) rose close to an eleven-month high to start the week, following a recent four-day bull run.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>/USD rose to a peak of $0.07841 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.07271.</p>
<p>As a result of Monday&#x2019;s move, TRON climbed to its strongest point since June 10 last year.</p>

<p>One of the catalysts of the surge appears to be a breakout which transpired on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>The index moved beyond the ceiling of 69.00, and as of writing, is tracking at 77.17.</p>
<p>Now in overbought territory, there could be some profit taking, however a target of $0.080 still remains a possibility.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Whilst <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a> has now risen for a fourth day, cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) ended a four-session losing streak on Monday.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.3573 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD rose by as much as 2% today, hitting a high of $0.3732.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s rebound in price came as bulls seemingly rejected a breakout of a floor at the $0.3570 mark.</p>

<p>This came as the RSI also held firm at a key point of support, with price strength moving away from the 40.00 mark.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at 44.29, with a ceiling at 49.00 a possible target for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> bulls.</p>
<p>If this zone is reached, there is a relatively good chance cardano will be trading above $0.3800.</p>

A large number of major cryptocurrency exchanges have seen a significant outflow of bitcoin, according to data.</strong></p>
<h2>Exchanges Experience Crypto Exodus Despite Steady Market</h2>
<p>As of May 21, 2023, centralized crypto exchanges held $57.29 billion worth of bitcoin, equivalent to 10.99% of the leading cryptocurrency&#x2019;s market capitalization. However, since the collapse of FTX on November 5, 2022, a significant amount of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has been withdrawn from exchanges. Prior to this event, Cryptoquant data shows centralized trading platforms held <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/">2.5 million bitcoin</a>. In the past month alone, 43,301 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, valued at over $1.16 billion, have left these platforms.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://archive.ph/g2Xiy#selection-519.0-519.3">data</a> recorded by coinglass.com, Binance currently holds the largest bitcoin reserve, with a balance of 555,435 on Sunday evening. However, over the past 30 days, the exchange has experienced an outflow of approximately 10,102 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Coinbase comes in second place with 486,630 bitcoin in reserves, and saw a modest increase of around 316 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in the past month. Bitfinex, the third largest exchange in terms of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holdings, also experienced a slight increase of around 339 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> during the same period.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s worth mentioning that Binance and Bitfinex hold the <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/bitcoin/richlist/">top two spots</a> for the largest bitcoin wallets, according to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s rich list metrics. The rich list data reveals that the top ten wallet holders control 5.37% of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s supply, with two of them being Binance-controlled wallets. In the past 30 days, Okx has seen 2,842 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> leave its platform, and Gemini&#x2019;s bitcoin reserve stash has lost 1,958 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Kraken also experienced an outflow of 823 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in the past month.</p>

<p>In addition to bitcoin, Cryptoquant data shows centralized crypto trading platforms have also experienced a significant outflow of ethereum leaving their exchanges over the past month. Just 30 days ago, exchanges held 16.60 million ether, but today that number has decreased to around 16.26 million. This means that approximately 340,000 ether, valued at $613.71 million, has left exchanges in the last month alone. When combined with the outflow of bitcoin, $1.77 billion of the top two digital assets has left these platforms.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) started the week in consolidation, as markets remain hopeful of a deal to increase the debt ceiling in the United States.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,549.73, which comes less than 24 hours after a high at $26,986.08.</p>
<p>Overall, Monday&#x2019;s move is the third straight day in which <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has traded below the $27,000 mark.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has now found a firm floor at $26,300, with prices hovering slightly above that point.</p>
<p>In order for a significant move to take place, a ceiling of 44.00, or support at 39.00, on the relative strength index (RSI), will need to be broken.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.18.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) rose slightly higher on Monday, as it once again bounced from a key support point.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,793.22 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD climbed to a peak of $1,820.25 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The drop saw ethereum near its recent price floor at the $1,790 mark, however bulls used this as a sign to reenter the market.</p>

<p>Still, earlier gains have somewhat dropped, with the index currently tracking close to a ceiling of 46.00.</p>
<p>In order for momentum to fully turn bullish, this resistance will need to be broken, which is unlikely to happen until a debt ceiling deal is reached.</p>
