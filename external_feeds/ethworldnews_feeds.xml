<ul><li>Bybit is set to impose mandatory KYC rules on its customers starting May 8, 2023. </li><li>The crypto exchange will restrict certain trading activities for users to refuse to comply with the new rules. </li><li>KYC checks were introduced by the exchange in December last year for select services including P2P trading. </li></ul>



<p>Crypto exchange Bybit has announced that it will enforce mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) rules on its platform starting May 8. 2023. The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fast-crypto-registration-french-amf-mica/">crypto</a> exchange&#8217;s new KYC norms are set to come into effect just days after it opened its new global headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. </p>



<h2><strong>Bybit Will Limit Access For Non Compliant Users</strong></h2>



<p>According to an update on Bybit’s <a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/help-center/s/article/Individual-KYC-FAQ" rel="nofollow noopener">official website</a>, the new KYC rules will be applicable in two levels. Individual KYC of at least level 1 will be mandatory for users to access all products and services on the platform from May 8 onwards. Users who opt out of the KYC verification post the deadline will only be allowed to close existing open positions or orders, return loans, or withdraw. Any new trading activities for these users will be restricted. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bybit ensures that your personal information will be encrypted and protected for privacy and security, and will be used for the sole purpose of verifying your identity to better serve you. It is neither shared nor repurposed for any marketing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>The verification process will take between 15 minutes to 48 hours. Non-VIP users who complete the level 1 KYC requirements will see their daily withdrawal limit from 20,000 USDT to 1 million USDT. Completing the level 2 KYC requirements will increase it to 2 million USDT. The withdrawal limit for the “Supreme VIP” clients will increase to a whopping 12 million USDT.</p>



<p> According to Bybit, the new rules are necessary to maintain the exchange’s security and to prevent illegal activities. The latest norms are set to kick in more than four months after the platform last updated its KYC requirements. In December 2022, the exchange rolled out verification checks for several products, including peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, NFT trading, and fiat deposits on the platform. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Terra Classic cryptocurrency created by Do Kwon does not classify as a security, a South Korean District Court ruled in February after a similar ruling back in November last year.</li><li>South Korean prosecutors requested a judgment from the country&#8217;s supreme court after the latest ruling.</li><li>Both Kwon&#8217;s attorneys and a South Korean court have not contested whether LUNA Classic counts as a security, per reports.</li><li>The U.S. SEC said LUNC was a security in a fraud lawsuit against Do Kwon in February week before his arrest by Montenegrin police.</li></ul>



<p>The Terra Classic cryptocurrency created by Do Kwon does not classify as a security, a South Korean District Court ruled in February after a similar ruling back in November last year.</p>



<p>According to South Korean news house <a href="https://m.ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&amp;entry_id=450928" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://m.ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&amp;entry_id=450928" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ilyo Shinmun</a>, the Seoul Southern District Court ruled twice on the matter. Once on November 15, and again on February 16. Both instances were reported for the first time today, the reason being unclear. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Based on the data submitted by the prosecution, it is difficult to say that Luna falls under the financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act.</p><cite>&#8211; Seoul Southern District Court.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Prosecutors in South Korea are now seeking a judgment from the country&#8217;s Supreme Court on whether the renamed LUNA CLASSIC or LUNC is a security under the Capital Markets Act.</p>



<p>Authorities are unable to seize assets controlled by Daniel Shin following the ruling. Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, was the focus of an asset manhunt where prosecutors hoped to seize <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-co-founder-home-raided/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-co-founder-home-raided/" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 million for Shin&#8217;s alleged part in Terra&#8217;s $40 billion crash</a>. </p>



<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s LUNC A Security Or Not, Authorities Debate</h2>



<p>South Korean authorities seemingly consider establishing Terra Classic&#8217;s security status as a front boiler topic in the case against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-fortune-not-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-fortune-not-in-south-korea/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do Kwon</a>. Kwon&#8217;s lawyers have also contested claims that LUNC is a security, albeit arguing that they are not to disarm authorities intending to sue Kwon for securities fraud. </p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also called Do Kwon&#8217;s Terra Classic a security in a fraud lawsuit <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-sec-sues-do-kwon-terraform-labs-fraud/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-sec-sues-do-kwon-terraform-labs-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> against Kwon in February. According to the SEC, LUNC and its sister token TerraUSD (UST), Kwon&#8217;s algorithmic stablecoin, qualify as securities as investors held expectations of profit from secondary-party efforts. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The French Financial Markets Authority could fast-track crypto registration for companies like Binance that already run regulated digital asset businesses in France.</li><li>Regulators in France are considering the sped-up regime as the EU&#8217;s landmark MiCA bill was overwhelmingly backed by legislators, beckoning a new crypto regulatory era across European states.</li><li>The French AMF also noted that lawmakers would continue to assess rules for DeFi and NFTs as these two ecosystems do not fall under MiCA&#8217;s purview.</li></ul>



<p>Regulators from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) are moving to <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/fr/actualites-publications/actualites/marches-de-crypto-actifs-le-reglement-mica-adopte-par-le-parlement-europeen" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.amf-france.org/fr/actualites-publications/actualites/marches-de-crypto-actifs-le-reglement-mica-adopte-par-le-parlement-europeen" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fast-track</a> crypto registration for approved digital asset businesses in the country. The AMF&#8217;s decision comes after lawmakers from the European Union voted in favor of the Markets in Crypto Assets Bill or MiCA which will dwarf existing crypto regulations across EU states like France. </p>



<p>MiCA&#8217;s bloc-wide rules require crypto businesses and wallet providers to register for a license under strict regulations. Stablecoin operators must also hold sufficient reserves for the coins they issue. The bill <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-wins-vote-crypto-licensing-europe/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-wins-vote-crypto-licensing-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garnered</a> massive support from lawmakers, winning votes 13-1 during a parliamentary session on Thursday. MiCA takes effect from 2023, 12-18 months after the bill is passed and Published in the bloc&#8217;s Official journal. </p>



<p>The AMF said there&#8217;s “consideration of a possible fast-track modular licensing&#8221; for crypto businesses like Binance that already received approval from France&#8217;s financial watchdog. For companies like this, MiCA allows an extra registration period of 18 months for businesses to align their operations with stricter customers and financial protection policies. </p>



<p>&#8220;These players can, during this period, continue to offer their services solely to the French public&#8221;, said the AMF. </p>



<h2>French Regulator Hints DeFi Rules After FTX Crash And MiCA Vote</h2>



<p>The French AMF suggested that rules for decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens as MiCA purview does not cover these two crypto vertices. France already tightened local crypto regulations after FTX, the crypto exchange founded by the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried, left millions of users in limbo after crashing last year. </p>



<p>During its latest announcement, the AMF said EU lawmakers would continue to <a href="https://t.co/ZEoAosRGRk" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://t.co/ZEoAosRGRk" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">assess</a> rules for DeFi and NFTs if necessary. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Kucoin&#8217;s Twitter account was compromised for nearly an hour on early Monday, the crypto exchange told users in a thread. </li><li>Multiple users lost 22,628 USDT over 22 transactions after interacting with fraudulent tweets from the platform&#8217;s account. </li><li>The exchange assured users that funds remain SAFU and provided a support ticket to help affected users in recovery. </li></ul>



<p>The Twitter account of crypto exchange Kucoin was <a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1650336619730436099?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1650336619730436099?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">breached</a>, leading to multiple losses for users in just a few minutes. </p>



<p>Kucoin, a digital asset trading exchange, lost control of its Twitter account on Monday, April 24  for around 45 minutes. This breach is reported to have caused losses for multiple users up to 22,638 in USDT, crypto&#8217;s largest stablecoin by market cap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ The <a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@kucoincom</a> handle was compromised for about 45 mins from 00:00 Apr 24 (UTC+2). A fake activity was posted and unfortunately led to asset losses for several users. KuCoin will fully reimburse all verified asset losses caused by the social media breach and the fake activity.</p>&mdash; KUCOIN (@kucoincom) <a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1650336619730436099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The exchange identified 22 transactions from users who interacted with fraudulent tweets. &#8220;we are currently examining and blocking suspicious addresses&#8221; Kucoin said, promising to prevent any further damage and protect customer assets. The platform also promised full reimbursement to affected users.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>3/ Until 02:00 Apr 24 (UTC+2), we have identified 22 transactions including ETH/BTC associated with the fake activity, with a total value of 22,628 USDT. To prevent more users from being harmed, we are currently examining and blocking suspicious addresses.</p></blockquote>



<p>Kucoin claims it is conducting an in-depth investigation of the incident with Twitter to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Assets on the exchange remain secure and SAFU despite the exploit via Twitter, the crypto exchange stressed in today&#8217;s thread. </p>



<h2>Cyber Criminal Target Crypto Exchanges</h2>



<p>Today&#8217;s attack is the latest exploit on crypto exchanges so far in 2023. A hacker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitrue-hackers-steal-23-million-eth/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitrue-hackers-steal-23-million-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drained</a> $23 million in ETH, SHIB, MATIC, and other cryptos from crypto exchange Bitrue, forcing the platform to suspend withdrawals until April 18 to restore full security. </p>



<p>Before that, South Korean digital asset trading venue Gdac suffered an attack on its hot wallet. The attackers <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hackers-13-million-crypto-exchange-gdac/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hackers-13-million-crypto-exchange-gdac/" rel="noreferrer noopener">looted $13 million in crypto assets</a>. </p>



<h2>Crypto Crackdown On Kucoin</h2>



<p>Kucoin, like other crypto businesses in the U.S., is no stranger to the regulatory spotlight. Just last month, the exchange was sued by New York State Attorney General Letitia James. AG James claims the exchange is an unregistered commodities and securities dealer. </p>



<p>In the suit brought against the Seychelles-based firm on Thursday, AG James alleged that the exchange facilitated crypto transactions that violated commodities and securities laws within New York. The regulator also accused Kucoin of operating without a commodity and securities license. </p>

<ul><li>Celsius’ upcoming auction has attracted crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini as new bidders.&nbsp;</li><li>The consortia of investors are set to bid on the bankrupt crypto lender’s assets this week.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinbase has declined to comment on its participation in the bidding process.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The upcoming auction of Celsius Network will see multiple crypto heavyweights participate in the bidding process. Three consortiums of investors featuring crypto exchanges Coinbase and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform/">Gemini</a> have signed up to bid on the bankrupt crypto lender’s assets later this week.</p>



<h2><strong>Celsius’ New Bidders May Choose Not To Liquidate Its Assets</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-23/failed-crypto-lender-celsius-auction-attracts-arrington-gemini#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the two new consortiums have joined NovaWulf Digital Management to bid on Celsius. Fahrenheit LLC is the first consortium, which includes Michael Arrington’s Arrington Capital, Coinbase, Algorand’s former CEO Steven Kokinos, and investment banker Ravi Kaza. The second consortium, Blockchain Recovery Investment Committee, is backed by ETF manager Van Eck, Global X Digital, and the Winklevoss-owned Gemini Trust.</p>



<p>Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the law firm representing the bankrupt crypto lender, stated in a recent <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174904222380000000030.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a> that the live auction would commence on April 25 at 2 pm in its New York office. Michael Arrington took to Twitter recently to share his vision for Celsius, should his consortium win with the highest bid in the auction slated for April 25, 2023. The TechCrunch founder stated that he intends to get the defunct crypto lender back up and running. Rather than liquidating its assets, Arrington’s group would explore Bitcoin mining, institutional lending, and a venture capital portfolio, among other things. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our bid (is) not structured as a simple asset purchase. We are proposing that the assets be placed into a new company and is run with the sole goal of growing those assets to make stakeholders whole.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Experts believe that Fahrenheit has a better chance of emerging as the winner in the auction, given its backing by veteran crypto entities. Celsius’ solicitation of other bids emerged last month when it informed the bankruptcy judge about its intention to seek a better offer for its assets, despite having one in hand from NovaWulf. At the time, the crypto lender claimed it would offer NovaWulf up to $20 million in break-up fees if it decides to proceed with another bid.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Do Kwon’s lawyers have questioned the U.S. SEC’s jurisdiction over crypto assets.&nbsp;</li><li>The lawyers have requested the court to dismiss the securities fraud allegations made by the regulator.&nbsp;</li><li>U.S. law enforcement has sought Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro.&nbsp;</li><li>The Terraform Labs co-founder was recently indicted for the forgery of legal documents.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Do Kwon is taking on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by bringing the agency’s jurisdiction over crypto assets into question. Lawyers representing the disgraced Terraform Labs executive have claimed that the lawsuit filed by the securities regulator in the United States is unfounded due to the nature of the crypto assets in question.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Do Kwon’s Lawyers Request Judge To Dismiss SEC’s Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-22/do-kwon-says-sec-is-out-of-bounds-in-pursuing-crypto-fraud-suit#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Do Kwon’s defense team has argued that the crypto asset at the center of the SEC’s lawsuit, the TerraUSD stablecoin, is a currency and not a security. The lawyers cited U.S. law while pointing out that regulators are prohibited from “using federal securities law to assert jurisdiction over the digital assets in this case.”. To that end, the lawyers have requested a Manhattan judge to dismiss the lawsuit filed against the Terraform Labs co-founder by the securities regulator. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The SEC’s improper assertion of power here by trying to shoehorn all cryptocurrencies into its definition of a security fails.” </p><cite>Court filing by Do Kwon’s lawyers.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The filing by Do Kwon’s lawyers highlighted the fact that the U.S. Congress, the executive branch, and the SEC have not been able to clarify as to what constitutes “security”. They argued that the securities fraud lawsuit filed by the securities regulator fails to take into account that TerraUSD’s status as a security hasn’t been proven yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>U.S. law enforcement agencies have sought the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro, where he was arrested last month for trying to board an international flight using fake documents. Earlier this week Kwon was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-indicted-montenegro-for-forgery/">indicted</a> by local prosecutors in the State of Podgorica for forging legal documents, including his passport. The Terra co-founder may be handed a sentence of up to five years. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-files-pre-registration-osc-canada/">Gemini</a> is following in the footsteps of rival crypto exchange Coinbase and setting up an offshore crypto platform. The American exchange announced earlier today that it plans to launch Gemini Foundation, a crypto derivatives platform based outside the United States. The move comes after rumors about Coinbase setting up a similar platform in Bermuda amid intensifying regulatory crackdown by regulators in the United States. </p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Steps Up Global Expansion Efforts</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-foundation-a-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> from the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange, the first offering of the Gemini Foundation will be a BTC perpetual contract denominated in the GUSD stablecoin. The crypto derivatives platform will subsequently launch an ETH/GUSD perpetual contract. The derivatives offerings will reportedly expand in the coming months. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Gemini Foundation will allow eligible customers to leverage their crypto assets to achieve long or short crypto exposure in order to manage risk, generate returns, and gain directional exposure.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The platform’s offerings will not be limited to derivatives. Customers from over thirty countries will be able to trade spot products as well. These countries include Singapore, Hong Kong, India, El Salvador, Thailand, Bermuda, Brazil, and South Korea, among several others. The platform will not be available to customers in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funding the account will require customers to convert their USD and USD Coin to GUSD on a 1:1 basis. Perpetual funding payments will have to be made exclusively in GUSD. Traders on the platform will be allowed to trade using a maximum leverage of 100x, with 20x being the default. News of the new platform comes just hours after Gemini <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-expand-global-engineering-and-operations-teams-with-new-india-office" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that it would be opening its second-largest engineering hub in India as part of its global expansion. The exchange also appointed its Chief Technology Officer, Pravjit Tiwana, as the Chief Executive Officer of the Asia Pacific Region (APAC). </p>

<ul><li>Open Exchange recently published a list of investors that supposedly participated in their funding round.&nbsp;</li><li>Most of the listed investors have stated that they did not participate in OPNX’s funding round.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto platform has criticized the concerned investors and accused them of misrepresenting their involvement.</li><li>The exchange’s primary token $FLEX has lost more than 23% of its value following the controversy.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Open Exchange (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-crypto-exchange-3ac-coinflex-live/">OPNX</a>), founded by infamous crypto personalities Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, has run into trouble with a group of investors that the crypto platform claims were a part of its funding round. The investors have denied funding the exchange, leading to a controversial exchange of statements between the parties involved. Open Exchange was launched in February this year by Zhu and Davies, the men behind the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). </p>



<h2><strong>OPNX Criticizes Investors For Denying Association, Calls It An Ugly Move</strong></h2>



<p>OPNX took to <a href="https://twitter.com/OPNX_Official/status/1649426185015685126" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to reveal the investors who had backed the crypto exchange. The list of supposed investors included AppWorks, Susquehanna (SIG), DRW, MIAX Group, Merchant Bank International, Token Bay Capital, Nascent, and Tuwaiq Limited. Open Exchange’s CEO Leslie Lamb could be seen thanking the investors for backing the exchange. According to the Twitter thread, the investors not only contributed capital but also provided feedback on product offerings, tokenomics, legal framework, etc. </p>



<p>Of the investors that OPNX claimed participated in its funding round, almost half have denied giving any funds to the crypto exchange. Venture Capital firm Nascent responded to Open Exchange’s tweet and clarified that it did not participate in the platform’s fundraising round. A spokesperson for DRW told <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/21/drw-says-its-not-an-opnx-investor-denying-opnxs-tweet-implying-otherwise/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinDesk </a>in a statement, “DRW is not an investor in OPNX nor are any of its affiliates investors in OPNX.” This was followed by a similar statement from Susquehanna (SIG) which read, “We have not provided any funding to OPNX and have no intentions to do so.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just to clarify, Nascent did not participate in an OPNX fundraising round, we invested in FLEX tokens in early 2021.</p>&mdash; Nascent (@nascentxyz) <a href="https://twitter.com/nascentxyz/status/1649464652102004737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>OPNX responded to the denials from its supposed investors by accusing them of seeking profits while simultaneously denying association with the exchange due to fear of backlash on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We believe in full disclosure of our institutional backers and key strategic partners. Should any party waver in their dedication to transparency and industry advancement, we express our disappointment at their misrepresentation and prefer not to have them as investors in future.&#8221;</p><cite>Open Exchange&#8217;s response to investors</cite></blockquote>



<p>The controversy surrounding Open Exchange and its investors has led to a significant decline in the price of $FLEX, the native token of CoinFlex that will also serve as the primary token of Su Zhu’s crypto venture. FLEX’s price sank more than 23% shortly after the investors denied affiliation with OPNX. The token is currently trading at $1.06.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/coinbases-layer-2-blockchain-base-plans-for-2023-mainnet-launch/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF_UUQ8GWq6CyAnnFbvOk5rmyaHZ6dVOmk7-BDo8NbX6yc7ETqQi_Mry_q5sSSayPbfwGIc3LfNkb7hKirM1wrs4s5wFvmWpNUhs2wa2-1au0-DNSdNercJjnm5mPsoe9vv_4bFcu4RZYLqFS4z87v2q9kHEXlBVnUWX9LLmeKO7" rel="nofollow noopener">TechCrunch</a>, Base’s lead Jesse Pollak revealed that the Layer 2 blockchain is aiming for its mainnet launch in 2023. Pollak, who also serves as the Head of Protocols for Coinbase, added that the short-term vision for Base is to debut it on the mainnet and decentralize it. The long-term vision is to attract a million builders to the network to build easy-to-use products that will then attract a billion users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It’s coming soon, we’re working hard on it. It’s our number one priority alongside decentralization goals and the rest of the year is really about making sure we get there as quickly as possible.” </p><cite>Jesse Pollak, Base Lead &amp; Coinbase Head of Protocols</cite></blockquote>



<p>Jesse Pollak also disclosed that Base is planning to become decentralized from Coinbase within “months or years” and not a decade. Coinbase Chief Brian Armstrong reportedly said to Pollak, “We can’t not decentralize this. We have to live up to that value and to that ethos.”</p>



<p>Since going live in testnet earlier this year, Base has attracted several builders and crypto projects. Uniswap and Aave are reportedly among the protocols that are being recruited to the Layer 2 network. DeFi crypto exchange <a href="https://gov.gmx.io/t/deploy-gmx-on-coinbase-s-level-2-base/1862" rel="nofollow noopener">GMX</a> is also considering deploying on Base. Other crypto entities that have committed to building on Base include Chainlink, Etherscan, Magic Eden, Nansen, Wormhole, Dune, and Animoca Brands</p>

<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has once again run into trouble with the law, this time in the South American nation of Brazil. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-refused-justin-suns-huobi-stake/">Binance</a> is reportedly being investigated in Brazil by the Federal Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the Federal Police of Brazil for allegedly offering securities to its clients by helping them evade a stop order on crypto futures. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance Allegedly Offered Derivatives Despite A Stop Order</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent report by Brazil’s <a href="https://valor.globo.com/financas/criptomoedas/noticia/2023/04/18/ministrio-pblico-e-polcia-federal-investigam-suposto-crime-financeiro-da-binance.ghtml" rel="nofollow noopener">Valor Econômico</a>, the public prosecutor’s office and the federal police are investigating Binance for alleged financial crimes related to the products being offered. The investigation was initiated after Brazil’s Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (Securities and Exchange Commission) informed the Attorney General of the State of São Paulo that the crypto exchange may have continued to offer crypto derivatives to Brazilian clients despite a stop order that was issued in 2020. </p>



<p>The Brazilian regulator reportedly provided screenshots to the federal police which showed Binance’s support personnel guiding its customers to change the website’s language in order to be able to access the futures trading platform. Futures are deemed securities in Brazil irrespective of the nature of the underlying assets.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>(Binance) reiterates that it does not offer derivatives in Brazil, that it operates in compliance with the local regulatory scenario and maintains a permanent dialogue with the authorities for the development of the crypto and blockchain segment in Brazil and in the world.” </p><cite>Binance’s statement to Valor Econômico</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 2020, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission initiated administrative proceedings against Binance over the crypto derivatives offered on its trading platform. According to the regulator, the crypto exchange’s website had extensive content in Portuguese, which marketed crypto futures that could be traded with up to 125 times leverage after opening an account “in less than 30 seconds”. The website reportedly had no mention of the restrictions on such offerings for clients resigning in Brazil.</p>
