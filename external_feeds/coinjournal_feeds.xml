<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s dip below $30,000 and subsequent retest of resistance above$29k highlights the past week&rsquo;s top coins outlook.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is below its 50 and 200 MA but analysts are bullish on SHIB given overall sentiment and network growth.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Aptos (APT) price has formed a massive bull flag pattern that could see APT explode to new highs in 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market continues to see significant volatility as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/"><u>prices</u></a> of various tokens fluctuate near key levels. <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin (BTC)</u></a> price fell to around $27,200 this past week and saw the global cryptocurrency market cap drop from above $1.34 trillion to $1.25 trillion amid broader sell-off pressure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">BTC price is however back above $29,000 and has retested resistance near the psychological $30k level this weekend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, several altcoins that have recently seen dramatic declines look positioned for fresh moves, with cryptocurrency bulls buoyed by fresh turmoil in the banking sector with troubles for US bank First Republic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&rsquo;s the price prediction for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/"><u>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</u></a> and Aptos (APT).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Inu price is down nearly 10% in the past two weeks, having traded lower from highs above $0.000011 recently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SHIB currently trades below its 50 MA and 200 MA, while the daily RSI is below 40 to suggest bears might have a slight advantage. &nbsp;</p>

<p></p></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">But the 16th ranked cryptocurrency, which remains one of the top memecoins with a market of $6.1 billion, has a growing community buoyed by the success of the testnet for layer 2 protocol Shibarium.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">On-chain data shows the protocol has enabled over 194,000 transactions and seen over 100,000 wallet interactions.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">If an upside flip in the price amid new <a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/buy/"><u>buy Shiba Inu</u></a> pressure, the main short term target will be the $0.000035 level. The 2021 all-time high provides another key level and a move to $0.01 could be the Holy Grail of the upcoming bull cycle.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Aptos (APT) price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/aptos/"><u>Aptos (APT)</u></a> is a new layer 1 blockchain network that&rsquo;s benefitted from massive investment by venture capitals. The Aptos mainnet went live recently and the demand for the native APT token saw the price rally to the YTD peak of $19.92 in January.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 700px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/03/30/1682880773725-8c3e544a-a17f-4a66-884a-624c418a5f7a.png" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="270"><span class="fr-inner"></span></p>

<p></p></span>
<p></p></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Currently trading around $10 has the APT/USD pair roughly 46% off the January highs. However, analysts remain bullish on the Aptos price.</p>

If a breakout follows, a move to $20 in the short term could be one of the main targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this <a href="https://coinjournal.net/aptos/price-prediction/"><u>Aptos price prediction</u></a> for the medium term sees a potential burst to a new all-time high.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Litecoin price traded above $90 on Sunday, with LTC hitting intraday highs of $91.60.</li>
<li dir="ltr">While price has rejected twice above $100, the area remains a key target for bulls as Bitcoin retests the $30k level.</li>
<li dir="ltr">If it breaks above the hurdle, fresh momentum heading into the Litecoin halving in August could catapult LTC price towards its all-time peak.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/"><u>Litecoin (LTC)</u></a> is trading around the $90 level after bulls battled to regain some control following the sharp sell-off to lows of $84 this past week. The weakness in the price of LTC came after another dip in March that saw the price rejected at year-to-date highs of $106 in February.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decline occurred at a key horizontal resistance area at the $100 zone, which remains the main hurdle as Litecoin enters the last few months before its halving in August.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Litecoin price: are bulls taking control?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The LTC price rejection in the past weeks at $100 meant a double top pattern appeared, which signals bearish strength and highlights the potential for downward continuation. As it happened, LTC price broke below an ascending trendline support after hitting $103 on 18 April and a significant drop a few days later had LTC/USD hugging lows of $84.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But despite the previous gains being wiped out by the decline, LTC is currently trying to maintain the $90 area after a critical daily close above it. &nbsp;Bulls will need to confirm they are getting in control by pushing higher even as a potential rising channel appears on the daily chart.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A look at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows the momentum indicator is just below the 50 line. However, the indicator is looking to cross above the signal line to suggest further possible accumulation of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/altcoin/"><u>altcoin</u></a>.</p>

<p></p></span>
<h2 class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Litecoin price prediction ahead of halving</h2>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">With approximately 100 days left before halving, the Litecoin price prediction for 2023 is bullish. The network has continued to see greater miner confidence, with the total hashrate for the blockchain recently hitting 760 terahashes per second(TH/s).</p>
<p dir="ltr">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">If the expected halving rally kicks in amid a broader market uptick, the two main targets above $100 will lie around $180 and then $300. The all-time high for LTC is around $410 reached in May 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flipside, a bearish reversal could see the long term resistance-turned support area of $65 come into play. Below that, the main buffer for Litecoin price remains the multi-year base around $40.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Casper Network price rose over 60% in April, hitting a high of $0.060.</li>
<li dir="ltr">CSPR traded at around $0.059 at the time of writing, about 6% up in the past 24 hours.</li>
<li dir="ltr">While CSPR price is above key support level, here&rsquo;s the price outlook for Casper Network going into May.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Casper Network price rose more than 60% in April as the value of the native CSPR rallied to above $0.060. The cryptocurrency&rsquo;s <a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/">price</a> currently sits around $0.059, up 6% in the past 24 hours and nearly 16% higher in the past seven days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, while the Casper token is one of the standout performers of the last month, it remains off its peak of $1.33 by some huge distance. According to data from CoinGecko, CSPR reached its all-time low of $0.022 in June 2022, meaning traders who took positions at these levels are 164% up on their investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CSPR at current levels is -95% from the all-time high reached in May 2021.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Casper Network (CSPR)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Casper Network, a layer 1 blockchain network targeted for enterprise adoption of the blockchain technology. CSPR is the governance token of the Casper blockchain, whose mainnet launched in 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a native token, CSPR has multiple roles in the Casper ecosystem, including network fees, staking rewards and payments as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Casper Network has seen multiple projects built on top of its proof-of-stake blockchain. One of the projects on the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/smart-contracts/">smart contracts</a> platform is layer 2 protocol Metis that migrated from <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> to Casper. Metis looks to boost development of Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another project is patent encryption platform IPwe, which targets the creation of a decentralised database system for patent management and licensing. There&rsquo;s also ACDX, a digital assets exchange for structured products and derivatives trading.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Casper price prediction: What next for CSPR?</h2>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 615px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/03/30/1682877625460-9b438569-3f9f-43ea-b473-997e6a8b9401.png" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="242"><span class="fr-inner"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">CSPR price 4-hour chart. Source:<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/tc90nz2D/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>TradingView</u></a></p>
<p></p></span>
<p></p></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Casper&rsquo;s price could continue to rise into May and potentially break above $0.1. This outlook will materialise if CSPR price consolidates above $0.065, building new momentum for a breakout above $0.080.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Above the $0.10 level, significant resistance will be around $0.13, with a bullish <a href="https://coinjournal.net/casper/price-prediction/"><u>Casper price prediction</u></a> of $0.20 in May.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the downside, CSPR&rsquo;s outperformance over the past month could see traders eye profit taking deals. Such a scenario will definitely dent the bullish momentum and result in downward action, with a potential slump to $0.025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/"><u>Cryptocurrency prices</u></a> had a mixed performance last week as investors focused &nbsp;on the impending collapse of First Republic Bank (FRC). After falling to a low of $27,100, the coin jumped to about $30,000, where it has been in the past few days. Here is a crypto price prediction for some of the top coins like Chainlink (LINK), Filecoin (FIL), and Pepe.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chainlink price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On the daily chart, we see that the LINK has been in a consolidation phase in the past few days. The coin remains slightly below the important resistance point at $9.510, the highest point on November 8, August 13, and June 9.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is also below the key resistance level at $8.82, the highest point on April 19. The coin is also trading slightly below the 25-day moving average. Therefore, there is a likelihood that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/chainlink/"><u>Chainlink</u></a> will have a bearish breakout as sellers target the green ascending trendline at $6. A break above the key resistance at $8 will see it jump to $9.51.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Filecoin price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/filecoin"><u>Filecoin</u></a> price has been in a tight range in the past few days. The coin is trading at $5.9, where it has been recently. It has moved above the ascending trendline shown in green. FIL has moved slightly below the important resistance point at $6.60, the highest level on November 5 last year. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved slightly below the neutral point at 50.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, the Filecoin price will likely remain in this range in the next few days. More downside will be confirmed if the price moves below the ascending trendline. If this happens, the next key level to watch will be at $4.0.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The hourly chart shows that the Pepe crypto price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few days. It has dropped to a low of $0.00000013 to about $0.00000061. This means that the token has jumped by over 300% from the lowest level this year. It has moved above all moving averages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, it seems like the Pepe token is having a bullish momentum. If this happens, the next key level to watch will be at $0.00000070. A move below the support level at $0.00000044 will invalidate the bullish view.</p>

<li>Bitcoin moves the cryptocurrency market&nbsp;</li>
<li>Its dependency on the US dollar increased&nbsp;</li>
<li>Bitcoin holders better believe that the US dollar is in a bearish market</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Investing in the cryptocurrency market is not for everyone. Volatility, for example, is much higher than in other markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, for no apparent reason, the prices of various cryptocurrencies bounce or decline aggressively, leading to speculation that the market is rigged. Lack of regulation might explain the moves, but surely investors wonder what moves the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one and the only answer is Bitcoin. Its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization nears 50%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, if Bitcoin&rsquo;s price is rising, Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies can&rsquo;t decline. And the other way around is true &ndash; if Bitcoin enters a bearish market, the other cryptocurrencies will follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, the right question is not what moves the cryptocurrency market but what moves Bitcoin?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately, Bitcoin moves following developments in the traditional currency market. More precisely, it follows the dollar.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/03/29/1682768996887-a97c4883-bc7f-40ce-9f4d-0ae1f1c58447.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="484"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>Bitcoin follows the dollar&rsquo;s strength or weakness</h2>
<p>The chart above shows Bitcoin&rsquo;s performance from late 2021 to the present. Above, in orange, is the dollar index (DXY).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It shows clearly that during the bear market of 2022, Bitcoin declined while the dollar strengthened. EUR/USD dropped below parity in 2022, trading as low as 0.96 at one point. The euro is the main component of the DXY, and thus the EUR/USD currency pair is the relevant one to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin dropped, too, trading well below $20k.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then, in October 2022, the dollar bottomed. EUR/USD bounced above parity and rallied into the year&rsquo;s end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took Bitcoin until the end of the year to catch up with the dollar&rsquo;s weakness. Eventually, it bounced too, rallying in 2023 and gaining over 75% in four months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up, Bitcoin holders better believe that the US dollar will weaken lies ahead. Otherwise, it is difficult to hold Bitcoin if the dollar enters a bull market.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Bitcoin makes up about 48% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization</li>
<li>The share rises to 75% if we include Ethereum and Tether</li>
<li>Other cryptocurrencies&rsquo; share declined despite the latest cryptocurrency market rally</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market bounced in 2023 and rallied right from the start of the trading year. As a result, Bitcoin is up +77.60% YTD, a remarkable performance in just four months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other cryptocurrencies took the lead from Bitcoin. As such, the entire market bounced, as reflected by the total crypto market capitalization. By the end of 2022, it dropped to $755 billion following a bearish market but now reached $1.16 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means that investors regain confidence in the crypto space after the FTX scandal and other frauds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But besides Bitcoin, what other cryptocurrencies are favored by investors? Two stand out of the crowd: Ethereum and Tether.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/03/29/1682767942719-a3e76de2-ff54-4531-9ba6-ee408d22cdb1.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="547"></p>
<h2>Ethereum and Tether keep pace with Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The chart above shows the total crypto market capitalization dominance in percentages. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin leads with 48.58%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its share rose from 40% at the end of 2023, in the detriment of other cryptocurrencies, such as USD Coin or Solana. Even Binance Coin lost share, sitting at 4.31% currently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chart shows that only two cryptocurrencies keep pace with Bitcoin &ndash; Ethereum and Tether. Ethereum&rsquo;s share remained stable even during the bearish market of 2022. The same with Tether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three comprise about 75% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization &ndash; a good statistic to consider next time when investing in cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/">Cryptocurrency prices</a> have been quite volatile in April, with a number of coins seeing massive gains before toppling to pre-rally levels amid extensive selling. But the outlook of some tokens suggests they are trending in extremely overbought territory, while a few remain greatly underbought.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Render (RNDR), Injective Protocol (INJ) and Bella Protocol (BEL) are all heavily overbought. <a href="https://coinjournal.net/omg-network/">OMG Network (OMG)</a>, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/serum/">Serum (SRM)</a> and Vidt DAO (VIDT) fall in the latter category.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto price predictions for OMG, SRM and INJ</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While Bitcoin (BTC) price is back above $29,000 on Friday and is trending with positive sentiment as bulls target a good start to the historically slow May, analysts say ending April above the key support of $28,200 is the critical move.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, trading patterns for some altcoins suggest this might be a good buying moment &ndash; with market intelligence platform Santiment highlighting <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/omg/">OMG</a>, SRM and VIDT &nbsp;as some of the most underbought tokens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, with the global crypto market cap shrinking to $1.25 trillion from recent highs, some altcoins that rallied hard are massively overbought. These tokens, including RNDR, INJ, and BEL could be quite risky, Santiment explained on Friday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Prices have been more scattered and non-correlated to one another here in April than in previous months. And our MVRV model confirms average trading returns appear as historically good times to buy for some ($OMG, $SRM, $VIDT), and quite risky for others ($BEL, $INJ, $RNDR)</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The MVRV (market-value-to-realized-value) model gives the ratio of a token&rsquo;s market capitalization against its realized capitalization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a comparison of the two metrics, that is market cap and realized cap, the MVRV ratio is often used to highlight the price of an asset versus its deemed fair value. Being above or below this &ldquo;fair value&rdquo; price helps traders assess the potential profitability of the token.</p>

<li>H.C. Wainwright analyst sees upside in Bitfarms to $2.0 a share.</li>
<li>He explained his constructive view in a research note on Friday.</li>
<li>Bitfarms stock has already nearly tripled since the start of 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shares of Bitfarms Ltd have already nearly tripled since the start of the year but an H.C. Wainwright analyst is convinced that rally is far from over just yet.</p>
<h2>Bitfarms stock could climb to $2.0</h2>
<p>On Friday, Kevin Dede reiterated his &ldquo;buy&rdquo; rating on the bitcoin miner and said its shares could climb to $2.0 &ndash; up another 80% from here.</p>
<p>The bullish call on Bitfarms stock arrives only hours after the company expanded operations in <a href="https://decrypt.co/138268/bitcoin-miner-bitfarms-hits-new-hashrate-high-argentine-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argentina</a> that increased its fleet hash to 5 EH/s.</p>
<p>Estimates Dede has for 2023 are based on a hash rate of about 5.7 EH/s &ndash; a level he&rsquo;s confident the miner will hit in its September quarter.</p>
<blockquote><p>This fleet expansion also came without further shareholder dilution &ndash; an added prize not universally shared across the spectrum of publicly traded bitcoin miners.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitfarms Ltd is generating cash</h2>
<p>The H.C. Wainwright analyst remains constructive on Bitfarms Ltd also because it did not slip into negative EBITDA even in the <a href="https://bitfarms.com/media/news/detail/182/bitfarms-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth quarter</a> when thing went haywire for the crypto space at large.</p>
<p>Other reasons cited for the constructive view on Bitfarms stock include its gross mining margin that declined sharply (year-over-year) in 2022 but still stood at a healthy 33% nonetheless. Dede said in his <a href="https://hcwco.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=79331a69-55b5-4219-b70c-27c84b787bb9&amp;mime=pdf&amp;co=Hcwco&amp;id=jayson.derrick@investoogroup.com&amp;source=mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research note</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand potential upside in Argentina. With greater financial flexibility via stronger balance sheet, Bitfarms has options to consider additional business development opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Expansion in Quebec, Paraguay, and Washington State will help the share price as well, he concluded.</p>
