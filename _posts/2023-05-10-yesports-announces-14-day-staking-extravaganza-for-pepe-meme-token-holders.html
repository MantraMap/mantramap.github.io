<p>New York, United states, May 10th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Yesports, the leading esports to web3 gaming platform, is thrilled to announce a special staking event for holders of the Pepe meme token. This 14-day extravaganza offers Pepe token holders the chance to stake and earn YESP rewards.</p><p>Beginning 11th of May, Pepe holders can stake their tokens and receive a share of 3m YESP, which will be distributed over 14 days. As part of the special offer event, Pepe holders can also participate in Yesports&rsquo; popular NFT prize games which enable gamers and collectors to explore web3 games and provide engaging new ways to win exclusive NFTs.&nbsp;</p><p>Building strong communities is a central focus for businesses in both traditional gaming and web3. Given the speed at which blockchain technology advances and its ability to support the rapid growth of ardent communities, Yesports aims to expand its platform offerings further through this timely new event, activating utility for Pepe meme token holders.&nbsp;</p><p>Meme tokens serve to keep communities and audiences engaged through shared values, which are often represented by and translated through comical designs and themes. To date, the industry has seen very few meaningful examples of utility for meme tokens. The most notable can be backtracked to 2014 when Dogecoin holders sponsored NASCAR driver Josh Wise. For Yesports, this special event speaks to the sentiment of its web3 gaming community and its extended industry partners who share in the same vision and values.</p>"Offering this staking event for Pepe token holders is something we believe to not only be fun, but necessary, some might even say inevitable," says Sebastian Quinn, CEO of Yesports. "For a limited time, Pepe token holders can earn rewards while supporting the Yesports ecosystem, and Yesports can strengthen its community of avid gamers, esports organisations, fans and collectors."<p>To participate in the staking event, Pepe token holders can visit the Yesports website and follow the instructions provided at yesports.gg.
