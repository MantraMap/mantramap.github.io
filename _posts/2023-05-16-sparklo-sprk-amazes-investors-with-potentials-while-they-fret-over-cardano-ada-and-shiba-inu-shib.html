<p class="s4">Surprisingly 80% of addresses are unsafe for Cardano (ADA) holders</p>
<p>More than 80% of Cardano (ADA) holders, or over 3.53 million addresses, are losing money right now, according to IntoTheBlock. However, of those Cardano (ADA) addresses, only 682,920 (or around 16%) are profitable. At the current Cardano (ADA) price of $0.33 per token, an additional 173,770 holder addresses, or 4% of the total, are profitable.</p>
<p>This is intriguing because it coincides with the beginning of April when the local peak of Cardano (ADA) token trading occurred. That is to say, investors bought a lot of Cardano (ADA) because of the price action, only to be locked in with Cardano (ADA) losses the very following week. Those losses have continued to compound over the past four weeks for Cardano (ADA).</p>

<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community may anticipate that the chilly "cold" wallet, with its innovative tech and eye-catching appearance, will meet their needs. This week, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community may expect to hear some big news about the impending cold wallet.
