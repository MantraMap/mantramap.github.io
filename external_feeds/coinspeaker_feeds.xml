<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-account-uniswap-scam/">Twitter Account of Uniswap Founder Hayden Adams Faces Breach, Promotes Scam</a></p>
<p>Despite strong growth and maturity, hacks and theft incidents continue to plague the crypto industry. On Thursday, July 20, the crypto community found that the Twitter account of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/uniswap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniswap</a> co-founder Hayden Adams has faced a major breach.</p>
<p>The hackers made several tweets from the account driving users to all scammy websites. On July 20, the &#8220;Web3 Security Alerts&#8221; channel on Telegram informed its followers about the compromise of Adams&#8217;s Twitter account. The compromised account of Uniswap&#8217;s founder and CEO, with over 254,000 followers, posted a false tweet claiming that the platform&#8217;s Permit2 contract had been impacted by an unknown exploit, putting users&#8217; tokens at risk. The tweet included a malicious link, encouraging people to click on it.</p>
<p>The initial scam tweet was taken down shortly after being posted, but several similar ones followed. Web3 Security Alerts revealed that Adams&#8217; accounts with MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet remain blocked.</p>
<p>Also, the message offering free $UNI tokens doesn&#8217;t appear anymore. However, the account continued to post tweets with scam links as late as 4:43 p.m. in New York.</p>
<h2>Uniswap Labs Issues Statement, Adams&#8217;s Twitter Account Restored</h2>
<p>Hours later, Uniswap Labs issued a statement confirming the hack of Hayden Adams&#8217;s account. It <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1682130018225225728" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;@haydenzadams’ Twitter account has been hacked. Please do not click on any links. There is no giveaway, airdrop, or bounty. The Protocol has not been hacked or exploited. We will let you know when the issue is resolved.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, a few hours back, Haydem Adams stated that they have managed to restore the account again. &#8220;In control of my Twitter again. Appreciate everyone who helped out tonight, and the effort people put in to help with takedowns, warnings, etc,&#8221; he <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1682198527236096000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not new for scammers to use social media to trick people into giving away their cryptocurrency or money. Twitter&#8217;s Elon Musk announced on July 1 that they would limit the number of posts users can read each day to catch and stop fake accounts and bad actors.</p>
<p>Recently, Meta launched its new app Instagram Threads to compete with Twitter. Within days, the app gained over 100 million users. However, scammers have already started promoting fake nonfungible token projects and pretending to be other well-known crypto Twitter users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-house-republicans-crypto-bill/">US House Republicans Release New Crypto Oversight Bill for Investor Protection</a></p>
<p>Over the last few months, US lawmakers have been actively working to form a clear regulatory framework in the country. On Thursday, July 20, the US House of Republicans introduced a new cryptocurrency oversight bill with the goal of having a regulatory framework for investor protection in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The bill is part of several others trying to establish clear rules for digital assets. It comes at a time when the unclear regulations and aggressive actions from authorities are making some crypto businesses think about leaving the US. Also, crypto startups are hesitant to start their operations due to the lack of regulatory clarity. In a statement on Thursday, Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson (R-Pa.) <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today&#8217;s introduction of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act marks a significant milestone in the House Committees on Agriculture and Financial Services efforts to establish a much-needed regulatory framework that protects consumers and investors and fosters American leadership in the digital asset space.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The bill, initially drafted in early June, aims to create a regulatory framework for crypto exchanges to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). It would allow these exchanges to trade digital securities, commodities, and stablecoins all in one place.</p>
<p>“The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table. Our bill establishes clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate,” said Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) in the statement.</p>
<h2>Industry Experts Express Concern Over Revised Bill</h2>
<p>Although the Republican lawmakers have made an effort to push the crypto regulatory bill, some industry experts have shared their concerns. In the <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fit_for_the_21st_century_act_of_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revised bill</a> on page 10, traditional securities like stocks, bonds, &#8220;transferable shares&#8221;, &#8220;certificates of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement&#8221;, and similar assets are excluded from the definition of &#8220;digital assets&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to Gabriel Shapiro, Delphi Labs&#8217; general counsel, a recent change in the bill significantly impacts its value proposition and could reintroduce ambiguity. This change could lead to increased regulation for various assets in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, including Compound&#8217;s cTokens and Liquid Collective&#8217;s Liquid Staking Tokens, even if they are not currently regulated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SEC can still go on the warpath&#8230;all they have to do is argue that a token is a &#8216;transferable share&#8217; &#8216;a profit interest&#8217; etc.,&#8221; he warned.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-us-unemployment-fed/">Bitcoin Barely Scathed by High Impact of US Unemployment Claims as Fed Continues with Monetary Tightening Policies</a></p>
<p>Bitcoin dropped by just around 1 percent to trade around $29.9k on Friday despite the US unemployment claims coming in lower than expected.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-us-unemployment-fed/">Bitcoin Barely Scathed by High Impact of US Unemployment Claims as Fed Continues with Monetary Tightening Policies</a></p>
<p>The Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) market was arguably less concerned with the high-impact news from the United States Department of Labor regarding the unemployment claims on Thursday. Notably, the United States unemployment claims came in at 228k, which was lower than the previous and forecasted by a significant margin. As the US dollar currency index (DXY) showed some slight improvement compared to other global currencies, Bitcoin price too was slightly impacted by dropping about 1 percent in the past 24 hours. However, experts believe the Bitcoin market is facing a bigger challenge from the rising altcoin market, especially after the SEC vs Ripple judgment ruling.</p>
<h2>Impact of US Unemployment Claims on Bitcoin and Altcoin Market</h2>
<p>Moreover, the TOTAL3 market cap, which represents altcoins excluding <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, had its macro wedge breakout confirmed in the past few days. Essentially, crypto cash flow is expected to move from Bitcoin and Ethereum to lower and medium-cap altcoins in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Fed&#8217;s policies in fighting high inflation seem to be playing out in favor of the dollar. Economists highly anticipated the Fed raising the interest rates by 25 basis points on July 26 in a bid to further fight inflation.</p>
<p>In a bid to counter the rise of digital assets and the high demand from institutional investors, the United States Federal Reserve announced the launch of FedNow, an instant payment service. Reportedly, more than 35 banks have enlisted to the FedNow services with thousands more expected to join later.</p>
<p>“Over time, as more banks choose to use this new tool, the benefits to individuals and businesses will include enabling a person to immediately receive a paycheck, or a company to instantly access funds when an invoice is paid,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/fed-officially-launches-new-fednow-instant-payments-service.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Performance</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin market continued to flex its muscles against most global assets amid heightened demand from institutional investors. In the past few weeks, several fund managers led by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK), and Valkyrie, have filed for a Bitcoin ETF, with the SEC expected to either approve, deny, or delay one filed by Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest. In a recent interview, BlackRock CEO of BlackRock described Bitcoin as digitizing gold and its mainstream adoption is imminent.</p>
<p>Notably, the Bitcoin market capitalization is about $580 billion compared to that of gold at nearly $11 trillion. Interestingly, US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr has promised to back the greenback with Bitcoin if elected for the highest office next year. Notably, Kennedy has also indicated that the digital dollar will not happen under his watch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market remains an integral part of the investment industry not only in the United States but around the world.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/johnson-johnson-q2-2023-earnings/">Johnson &#038; Johnson Reports Better than Expected Q2 2023 Earnings, JNJ Shares Up Slightly</a></p>
<p>One of the oldest American pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/johnson-and-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> (NYSE: JNJ) announced its second quarter (Q2) 2023 earnings on July 20, which ostensibly beat Wall Street expectations. According to the company’s announcement, the second quarter sales grew by about 6.3 percent and the operational growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine jumped by 8.9 percent. Meanwhile, the company’s Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer highlighted that the future is bright for its vast products, especially as it moves ahead to split its shares.</p>
<p>“We are entering the back half of the year from a position of strength with numerous catalysts, including becoming a two-sector company focused on Pharmaceutical and MedTech innovation,” Duato <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-reports-q2-2023-results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<h2>Johnson &amp; Johnson Q2 2023 Financial Highlights</h2>
<p>During the second quarter of 2023, the company announced adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 compared to $2.62 expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Additionally, Johnson &amp; Johnson announced revenue of about $25.53 billion compared to the $24.62 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Splitting the sales, the company announced that it collected about $13.44 billion from the United States market and the remaining $22 billion from the international market.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical segment reported the highest sales with about $13.71 billion, followed by MedTech with a total sales of about $7.78 billion, and the remaining accrued from the consumer health segment. Although the company is facing several headwinds including some legal proceedings, it highlighted that the coming quarters could as well be profitable as the prior one.</p>
<p>As a result, the company announced that it will be increasing its 2023 full-year guidance midpoints for adjusted operational sales excluding the COVID-19 vaccine and the adjusted operating earnings per share. Notably, the company is forecasting its full-year sales to come in between $98.80 billion to $99.80 billion, which is about $1 billion higher than the guidance issued in April. Additionally, the company’s full-year earnings outlook is expected to come in between $10.70 to $10.80 per share, which is higher than the prior one issued in April between $10.60 to $10.70 per share.</p>
<p>Amid the legal litigations most centered on allegations that its pharmaceutical products are causing cancer to its users, the company has focused on splitting its pharma segment and MedTech segment for future growth prospects.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The $413 billion valued company has been on the receiving end in the past two years. According to the latest stock market data, JNJ shares have dropped approximately 7.3 percent and 10 percent in the last year and YTD respectively. Nonetheless, 21 analysts are still optimistic about the company’s future performance having given the JNJ market an average rating of Over.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/american-airlines-outlook-2023/">American Airlines Raises Earnings Outlook for 2023 as Travel Demand Soars</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/american-airlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Airlines Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AAL), one of the largest airlines around the world has announced an upward revision of its earnings outlook for 2023. The news comes on the heels of a robust start to the peak travel season, reaffirming the carrier&#8217;s resilience in the face of unprecedented challenges within the airline industry.</p>
<p>The airline revealed according to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/american-airlines-aal-2q-2023-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that it now expects to earn between $3 and $3.75 per share for the full year, after adjusting for one-time items. This represents a notable increase from their previous prediction made in May, which anticipated earnings of approximately $2.50 to $3.50 per share.</p>
<h2>Impact of the Pandemic</h2>
<p>The airline industry is experiencing a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/american-airlines-stock-rises-41-as-covid-19-crisis-is-backing-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable rebound</a> as travel demand increases, particularly for international travel. Airline executives have expressed optimism about the recovery, buoyed by the easing of travel restrictions, higher vaccination rates, and a growing desire among people to travel again after a prolonged period of restricted movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>One noticeable impact of the current scenario is the decline in airfares compared to the previous year. As demand outpaces supply, airlines have been able to offer more competitive pricing and a broader range of flight choices to passengers.</p>
<p>American Airlines said it is closely monitoring its unit revenues, which are expected to drop by up to 6.5% in the third quarter of the current year compared to the same period in 2022. Despite the expected decline in unit revenues, American Airlines is planning to expand its capacity for Q3, with growth projections of up to 7% compared to the same period in 2022.</p>
<p>In terms of earnings, American Airlines has forecasted adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) range of 85 cents to 95 cents for the third quarter, which aligns with estimates from financial analysts. The announcement comes with an acknowledgment of ongoing labor negotiations, particularly with its pilots’ union. The company’s forecasts include costs associated with labor deals, including a tentative agreement reached with its pilots.</p>
<h2>American Airlines Q2 2023 Performance Exceeds Expectations</h2>
<p>The report noted that American Airlines’ second-quarter performance exceeded Wall Street expectations. According to the breakdown, the airline announced adjusted profits per share of $1.92, exceeding the $1.59 consensus forecast from The Wall Street.</p>
<p>Also, the company’s total revenue for Q2 amounted to $14.06 billion, which exceeded the analysts’ anticipated figure of $13.74 billion. The record revenue marks a significant 4.7% increase compared to the same period a year earlier, signaling a strong rebound in passenger demand and economic recovery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, American Airlines reported a net income of $1.34 billion for Q2 or $1.88 per share. This marks a substantial improvement from the same period in the previous year when the net income was $476 million, or 68 cents per share.</p>
<p>For the second quarter, American Airlines’ adjusted net income was $1.37 billion, or $1.92 per share. Meanwhile, the airline’s flying capacity increased by 5.3% from the same period a year ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zeebu-partnership-hayo-axistel-qatama/">Zeebu Inks Strategic Partnership with Hayo, Axistel and Qatama</a></p>
<p>Zeebu, a revolutionary platform designed to harness the power of blockchain technology to address the challenges faced by the industry has inked strategic partnerships with three telecommunication companies; Hayo Telecom Inc., Axistel FZE and Qatama Ltd. According to a press release shared with Coinspeaker, this latest partnership brings the total number of Zeebu&#8217;s major telecom partners to seven.</p>
<p>The latest addition will play a crucial role in boosting the company&#8217;s mission of becoming a game changer in the telecommunications sector.</p>
<h2>The New Zeebu Tripartite Partnership</h2>
<p>Hayo Telecom is one of the growing firms in the Senegalese mobile operator industry with a broad range of services including Mobile, Fixed, WiFi, and Wimax. The company holds international clearing house licenses from Ghana and Nigeria. Hayo is known for generating traffic both locally and internationally as a key player in the telecom ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to become a member of Zeebu’s telecom loyalty platform and utilize an infrastructure that will enable instantaneous transaction settlements across the globe,” said Feraz Ahmed, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hayo Telecom, adding that “Based on the concepts of trust and transparency, Zeebu’s platform will provide game-changing benefits for telecom carriers.”</p>
<p>The second partner Axistel FZE is another key player in the global telecom sector known for services like Voice and SMS OTP HQ and CC services.</p>
<p>Most of its services are designed to cater to the ever-evolving needs of fixed and mobile carriers and corporate customers. Axistel FZE CEO Hiren Kakad believes that the adoption of the Zeebu blockchain network will play an important role in accelerating innovation in the telecom industry. He also highlighted the possibility of this integration to deliver real value to every participant.</p>
<p>Massih Qhoraish, Director of Qatama said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Zeebu’s blockchain-based loyalty solution is just what the telecommunications carrier industry needs. It offers unmatched security, with its rewards-based transaction infrastructure providing a strong incentive that will maximize operational efficiency for the entire industry.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Zeebu to Tackle Core Problems in the Telecom Sector</h2>
<p>Zeebu owns a revolutionary blockchain solution that tackles some of the unique problems faced in the telecom sector. Some of these issues are security threats, rising and complex costs between intermediaries, and remittance delays of up to 20 days.</p>
<p>Telecom operators can now be more confident to perform instant global transactions without fear of delay or high costs. With Zeebu&#8217;s platform, they are assured of enterprise-grade security against cyberattacks and fraud.</p>
<p>The Zeebu platform creates a transaction ecosystem that is trustless, transparent, and highly efficient for telecom carriers and their partners by utilizing smart contracts. Also, the Zeebu Loyalty Token (ZLU) promotes fast and seamless cross-border transactions and eliminates traditional banking routes and intermediaries.</p>
<p>Generally, the telecom industry is fast <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/3rd-edition-connected-africa-premier-telecom-summit-transforming-telco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrating</a> blockchain into its ecosystem. Two months ago, Conflux Network and China Telecom <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/conflux-china-telecom-blockchain-sim-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a jointly developed Blockchain SIM (BSIM) card at the Xuhui District West Bank Artificial Intelligence Center in Shanghai.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-71m-subsidiaries/">FTX Exchange Files to Reclaim $71M from Its Philanthropic and Life Science Subsidiaries </a></p>
<p>Beleaguered cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> has been trying to recover assets the company spent under the leadership of its former CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, who is currently awaiting trial for his involvement in the collapse of the $32 billion valued exchange. In April, the company managed to recover $7.2 billion in cash and liquid crypto assets, but the FTX exchange is now pushing to retrieve an additional $71 million.</p>
<p>According to a recent court document filed in the United States court, the bankrupt crypto exchange seeks to reclaim the funds from the company&#8217;s subsidiaries, the FTX Foundation and Latona. The FTX Foundation serves as the philanthropic arm of the FTX group of companies, while Latona is a non-profit organization based in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Both firms received approximately $71.5 million from FTX and its sister company Alameda Research before its unfortunate collapse in November 2022.</p>
<h2>Personal Aggrandizement and Not Altruistic Purposes</h2>
<p>The funds were used to invest in and donate to life sciences companies between February and October 2022, including Lumen Biosciences, GreenLight Biosciences, Genetic Networks, and 4J Therapeutics. However, according to the court filing, the lawyers representing FTX claimed these investments were made for Bankman-Fried&#8217;s personal Aggrandizement rather than for charitable purposes as initially planned.</p>
<p>The attorneys also allege that both entities used commingled funds from Alameda and FTX accounts to make investments and donations in the life sciences sector, intending to generate goodwill, political capital, and influence for Bankman-Fried. The lawyers are now seeking to recover these funds as part of the company&#8217;s restructuring plan to repay creditors.</p>
<p>&#8220;While purporting to make these investments for altruistic purposes (i.e., pandemic prevention and preparedness), Bankman-Fried in fact pursued these transactions because he believed that doing so would generate goodwill and amass political capital and influence for himself,&#8221; the lawyers <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-seeks-recover-71m-philanthropic-070420401.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> in the filing.</p>
<h2>FTX Exchange Continues to Make Efforts to Recover Funds Spent by Bankmam-Fried</h2>
<p>FTX&#8217;s new administration has continued to make significant efforts to reclaim funds the former CEO spent during his time at the firm to ensure the company&#8217;s financial stability moving forward as it prepares to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-relaunch-international-exchange/">relaunch</a> the exchange. The latest court filing is not the first time FTX has sought to reclaim assets.</p>
<p>In June, Alameda Research&#8217;s lawyers pursued the recovery of $700 million, which Bankman-Fried allegedly transferred to a former aide of Hillary Clinton and the investment firm K5 Global in 2022. The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/k5-global-ftx-700m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> named other politicians and celebrities as part of the recipient of the funds.</p>
<p>The company had warned US politicians and other political parties that received goodwill donations from the former FTX boss to support their campaign. Last December, some politicians began returning the funds to disassociate themselves from the company.</p>
<p>The troubled crypto exchange has also asked the court to retract $323 million from FTX Europe&#8217;s leadership team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last month, the US Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/met-museum-550k-ftx-donations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to return the $550,000 donation it received from FTX before its demise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/el-salvador-bonds-rally-bitcoin/">El Salvador Sees Bonds Jump in Tandem with Massive Rally in Bitcoin</a></p>
<p>El Salvador&#8217;s junk-rated bonds have defied expectations by experiencing a remarkable surge, mirroring the extraordinary ascent of Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) throughout 2023. According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/20/el-salvadors-bonds-surge-62-amid-bitcoins-etf-driven-rally/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, El Salvador&#8217;s bonds have defied all odds by surging 62%, now trading at 72 cents on the dollar. Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency, experienced an impressive 79% rise during the same period.</p>
<p>The surge in El Salvador’s bonds has even outpaced the performance of the Invesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF (PCY), one of the largest holders of the country&#8217;s debt.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Adoption and ETF Surge</h2>
<p>The recent global trend of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) fueled by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK) is at the heart of this exponential surge in El Salvador&#8217;s bonds. As the application for spot Bitcoin ETFs expanded, the price of Bitcoin saw a notable upward trajectory. This rally, in turn, spurred investor confidence and may have increased the demand for El Salvador&#8217;s sovereign bonds.</p>
<p>As investor appetite for high-yield ventures surges, it can be deduced that El Salvador’s junk-rated bonds are not an isolated incident but rather a part of a larger market-wide trend. Junk-rated bonds of other countries, including Turkey, Argentina, and Nigeria, have also outperformed investment-grade bonds early this year.</p>
<h2>El Salvador Bitcoin Diversification Plans Faced Resistance</h2>
<p>El Salvador&#8217;s decision to embrace Bitcoin as a legal tender has been met with skepticism and opposition from rating agencies and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from the onset. The IMF opposition to El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption dates back to the early days when the country tapped the digital currency as its legal tender.</p>
<p>The IMF has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/imf-el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urged</a> authorities to reconsider their plans to expand government exposure to Bitcoin due to legal risks, fiscal fragility, and the speculative nature of crypto markets. Besides the IMF, other global financial institutions like the World Bank and Fitch Ratings have also criticized and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fitch-downgrades-el-salvador-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downgraded</a> the economic viability of adopting Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In 2021, S&amp;P also expressed skepticism over El Salvador&#8217;s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, citing immediate negative implications for the country&#8217;s credit. The rating agency raised concerns about the risks outweighing the potential benefits of embracing cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As an emerging economy, El Salvador believes the best way to hedge against the core fluctuations brought on by the US dollar devaluation can be effectively mitigated with Bitcoin. Shortly after it made BTC legal tender with some <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/el-salvador-buys-additional-500-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accumulations</a> sanctioned by President Nayib Bukele, Bitcoin slipped into its long winter with price not recovering as consistently as it has done in the past few months.</p>
<p>With top projections for Bitcoin to outperform traditional assets in the long term, Bitcoin proponents are convinced El Salvador will be the one to laugh last. Thus far, the country has been able to meet its debt obligations and the current growth in its bonds can help restore investor confidence to an extent.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mizuho-72m-fund-startups/">Mizuho Financial Group Plans for $72M Venture Debt Fund for Startups</a></p>
<p>Japanese financial giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mizuho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mizuho Financial Group</a> announced that it would be launching a venture debt fund worth 10 billion yen or $72 million with a goal to boost the startup economy of Japan.</p>
<p>Mizuho feels that Japan has been lagging in the number of startups and thus it seeks to address this issue upfront. Kazutoshi Isogai, Mizuho’s retail and business banking chief, said that the fund will start as early as this month.</p>
<p>The goal of the fund will be to provide finance to middle and late-stage startups without diluting their existing shareholder equity. “We want to help finance startups in deep tech fields such as biotech, space, renewable energy and artificial intelligence where large upfront investments are required for research and development,” he said.</p>
<p>The Japanese government aims to increase investment in startups to 10 trillion yen ($72 billion) within five years to revitalize the country&#8217;s innovation and competitiveness. Decades of weak economic growth had hindered private investment and stifled innovation, prompting the need for this initiative.</p>
<p>As part of the plan, the government also aims to foster the creation of 100 unicorns, startups with a valuation exceeding 100 billion yen. Currently, there are only about a dozen such firms in Japan.</p>
<p>Mizuho, along with its larger peer Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, is taking steps to support this effort. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group also plans to establish a 20 billion yen venture debt fund for Japan, building upon existing $750 million debt funds for overseas startups.</p>
<h2>Strong Demand from Startups</h2>
<p>Kazutoshi Isogai said that there&#8217;s strong demand for debt from Japanese startups. Besides, more of these firms have preferred loans to equity financing that requires diluting ownership stakes.</p>
<p>“Startup business has been our forte,” Isogai said in an <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mizuho-to-start-72-million-fund-targeting-japan-s-tech-startups-1.1948207" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>. “Other megabanks are also very active in this field. We don’t want to get beaten.”</p>
<p>Mizuho&#8217;s fund will primarily focus on purchasing bonds with stock options, allowing the lender to share in potential gains if the borrower goes public through an initial public offering in the future. Depending on the success of the first fund, the bank may establish more similar funds.</p>
<p>Apart from investment purposes, Mizuho sees this initiative as an opportunity to attract future unicorns, which will help build a strong pipeline of wealth management clients for the bank.</p>
<p>In the latest development, Mizuho has also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mizuho-45000-employees-test-openai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed</a> its 45000 employees to explore OpenAI, to unlock any major opportunities ahead in the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zhipu-ai-meituan-funding/">Chinese Project Zhipu AI Sees Huge Boost, Gets Meituan Funding</a></p>
<p>Zhipu AI has reportedly received a significant boost in its bid to challenge OpenAI&#8217;s domination of the artificial intelligence space. This follows after a recent announcement revealed that the firm has received funding from China&#8217;s food supply giant Meituan. Although the amount of funding remains undisclosed, Zhipu AI is now easily the country&#8217;s most promising project to take on OpenAI.</p>
<p>According to a local media <a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3693590" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, a Meituan subsidiary has become a major stakeholder in an affiliate of Zhipu AI. That is after buying a 10% stake in the firm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhipu&#8217;s exact funding to date also remains guesswork. The only idea about how much the startup has raised so far is the hint that it dropped earlier. Zhipu claims that it raised “hundreds of million yuan” ($1 = 7.23 yuan) from a Series B round last September. And mentioned that the round featured the likes of Qiming Venture Partners, Legend Capital, and Tsinghua Holdings, as its investors.</p>
<h2>Zhipu AI Aims to Build Dominant LLM</h2>
<p>Since OpenAI launched in 2015, several Chinese companies have been working to develop large language models (LLMs) that could compete with what their Western equals have created. And as it stands, Zhipu AI might already be in a clear lead among its Chinese counterparts.</p>
<p>Zhipu recently open-sourced its bilingual (Chinese and English) conversational AI model ChatGLM-6B. According to the firm, the model is trained on six billion parameters and is capable of carrying out inferences on a single consumer-grade graphics card, thereby, lessening the cost of running an LLM by a wide margin.</p>
<p>Before this, the firm had also open-sourced another model, the GLM-130B, which may be a more robust, general-purpose variant, being that it is trained on 130 billion parameters. Its user-facing chatbot app ChatGLM is currently in its beta phase.</p>
<p>Zhipu AI was founded in 2019 as a creative invention by the Chinese prestigious Tsinghua University. The startup is led by Tang Jie, a professor in the university’s Department of Computer Science and Technology.</p>
