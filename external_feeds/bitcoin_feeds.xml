India believes a more coordinated policy will be needed to enforce international standards in the field and adequately minimize associated risks.</strong></p>
<h2>India’s G20 Presidency Provides Its Input for FSB and IMF Global Crypto Regulatory Roadmap</h2>
<p>India, the current President of the Group of 20 forum of the world’s largest economies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G20</a>), has made some suggestions regarding the regulation of crypto assets. With the proposals, New Delhi seeks to help prioritize certain “areas of work essential to achieving a comprehensive, cohesive and coordinated global policy” for the sector.</p>
<p>In a Presidency Note <a href="https://www.g20.org/content/dam/gtwenty/gtwenty_new/document/Presidency_note_on_Framework_for_Crypto_Assets.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on Aug. 1, India said that while “considerable work” has been done so far by intergovernmental organizations to prepare regulatory standards for the crypto industry, it believes that more coordination is needed to consistently implement regulations adopted by different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The document represents India’s input for a Synthesis Paper that the International Monetary Fund (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-working-paper-urges-tax-system-overhaul-to-tackle-cryptos-tax-collection-challenges/">IMF</a>) and the Financial Stability Board (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/g20s-fsb-pushes-for-global-crypto-regulations-and-standards-aiming-to-curb-crypto-spillover-risks/">FSB</a>) are expected to publish in the end of August. The latter will feature an overview of the various crypto-related risks and will incorporate a “Roadmap on Establishing a Global Framework for Crypto Assets” which the G20 will consider for adoption.</p>
<p>“The goal of having a global and common roadmap would be to help countries put in place an agreed minimum policy standard for crypto assets which would aim to safeguard nations’ macroeconomic, financial stability and financial integrity,” the Presidency Note explains, adding that beyond that countries may choose to be even more stringent in their regulatory efforts.</p>

<p>India suggests the incorporation of several “action points” in the roadmap to be proposed by the IMF and the FSB in their paper. These include conducting outreach to all jurisdictions to create capacity for implementation, oversight and enforcement of standards, starting first with those that have seen higher crypto adoption and where internationally active crypto exchanges and large stablecoin issuers are based.</p>
<p>“Further, consensus would be built on extending the approved policy and regulatory frameworks on crypto assets to non-G20 member countries,” India highlights. It also calls for continued monitoring of financial stability risks posed by crypto assets by the FSB and monitoring of macrofinancial vulnerabilities by the IMF as well as cross-border information sharing and consumer protection.</p>
<p>The note urges to promote more effective implementation of anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards across jurisdictions, following a risk-based approach. India is convinced that these measures should have greater coverage and the Financial Action Task Force (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paris-fatf-plenary-global-implementation-of-virtual-asset-standards-remains-relatively-poor/">FATF</a>) should report on their implementation directly to the G20.</p>
<p>The Indian Presidency also suggests to establish a framework for providing technical assistance and guidance to regulators and institutions within the mandate of each standard setting body and to monitor the implementation of the recommended standards in each jurisdiction.</p>

The court’s decision blocks the attempt by Mashinsky to stop James from seeking to preclude him from issuing securities or serving as a company officer in the state.</strong></p>
<h2>Mashinsky Misstatements Induced Investors to Deposit Assets on Celsius</h2>
<p>A United States judge has rejected former Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky’s attempt to have the court dismiss a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James, a report has said. The court’s decision blocks the attempt by Mashinsky to stop James from seeking to preclude him from issuing securities or serving as a company officer in the state.</p>
<p>In her judgment, New York County Supreme Court Justice Margaret Chan <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-04/ex-celsius-ceo-mashinsky-must-face-new-york-civil-fraud-suit?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">reportedly</a> argued that James’ lawsuit should be allowed to stand because there are enough accusations to sustain the case against Mashinsky.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are sufficient allegations to support a plausible inference that Mashinsky’s alleged misstatements induced or promoted new investors to deposit assets in Celsius’ earned-interest accounts,&#8221; Justice Chan said in her ruling.</p>

<h2>Mashinsky&#8217;s Misrepresentation of Celsius&#8217; Financial Condition</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-attorney-general-sues-celsius-co-founder-alex-mashinsky-for-crypto-fraud/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in January, James is said to have filed the lawsuit against Mashinsky after it became of the former CEO’s false and misleading statements about Celsius Network’s financial well-being. In addition, the former boss of the collapsed crypto lender is also accused of encouraging thousands of investors to deposit onto the platform digital assets worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p>In response to the NYAG’s lawsuit, Mashinsky filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that the alleged misleading statements were in fact “nonactionable puffery” and immaterial. However, according to the Bloomberg report, Justice Chan did not agree with Mashinsky’s characterization of his interactions with the crypto lender’s investors.</p>
<p>Instead, she suggested in her ruling that the allegations against Mashinsky depict an &#8220;individual actively misrepresenting the financial condition of his company to keep it afloat.&#8221;</p>

The report, titled &#x201C;How Many Bitcoin Are For Sale?&#x201D; published on June 26, 2023, looks at exchange flows and onchain metrics to gauge bitcoin demand and supply dynamics.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Demand Shifts: Glassnode Highlights U.S. Recovery and Asia&#x2019;s Lead</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-26-2023/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=gn_social&utm_campaign=woc_26_2023">Glassnode report</a> found that while Asia-based exchanges saw net inflows of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) in 2023, U.S.-based exchanges saw net outflows. This suggests weaker relative demand from U.S. investors compared to those in Asia so far this year. However, Glassnode suggests a wave of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-filing-announcement-propelled-btc-in-q2-study/">spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings</a> in the U.S. in recent weeks signals growing U.S. institutional interest.</p>
<p>To estimate bitcoin&#x2019;s &#x201C;available supply,&#x201D; Glassnode&#x2019;s report isolated the most active portion of circulating supply, dubbed &#x201C;hot supply.&#x201D; This hot supply, representing just 3.5%-11.3% of the total supply, has a velocity of at least one transaction per day. With a current hot supply of around 511,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, Glassnode estimates around 983,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> (worth $29.5 billion) is actively in play.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our recent newsletters highlighted the ongoing transfer of wealth from investors with high time preferences towards HODLers,&#x201D; Glassnode&#x2019;s report explains. &#x201C;This pattern of growing illiquidity is a primary component of all prior Bitcoin bull markets. However, while a &#x2018;supply shock&#x2019; can positively affect price discovery, the sustainability of the trend still depends on the influx of new demand entering the market.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Notably, Glassnode highlights that this is on par with open interest in bitcoin perpetual futures contracts, suggesting spot and derivatives markets are similarly sized. For perspective, Glassnode researchers believe 983,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could absorb the remaining Mt. Gox bankruptcy coins (137,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and U.S. government-seized coins (204,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>).</p>
<p>&#x201C;From this, we can see that a single quarter of similar demand inflows may be capable of absorbing the full distribution from both sources,&#x201D; the Glassnode report details.</p>
<p>Expanding hot supply historically accompanied bull markets as existing holders distributed coins, Glassnode researcher <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/author/cryptovizart/">Cryptovizart</a> details. Quarterly hot supply growth from 400,000-900,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> preceded rallies between 26%-154%. Recently, short-term holder cost basis of around $26,000 provided support, suggesting a shift away from bearish sentiment, the researcher notes.</p>

<p>Glassnode concludes U.S. demand appears to be recovering as new ETFs are proposed. With limited actively circulating bitcoin, new inflows could readily absorb known future supply shocks. Recent onchain trends suggest the market has shifted to an accumulation mentality, setting the stage for a renewed bull market.</p>
<p><em><strong>With the shifting dynamics in Bitcoin&#x2019;s demand and supply, as well as the surge in U.S. institutional interest through ETFs, how do you see the cryptocurrency market evolving in the coming months?

Yet, as scientists have been laboring to replicate the LK-99 experiment up until August 5, 2023, the academic community has yet to formally endorse the superconductivity of this material. Even so, the dialogue has evolved into almost mythical conjectures, encompassing visions of handheld quantum computers and the dismantling of today&#x2019;s most robust encryption, as well as the theoretical ability to penetrate Bitcoin&#x2019;s cryptography.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Community Responds to LK-99&#x2019;s Alleged Superconductivity and Possible Implications</h2>
<p>Since July 22, 2023, scientists have been invigorated by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008">new paper</a> called &#x201C;The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor,&#x201D; published by the researchers Sukbae Lee, Ji-Hoon Kim, Young-Wan Kwon. South Korean and Chinese researchers published preliminary results claiming the material now known as LK-99, reportedly allows electricity to flow without resistance at room temperature and standard air pressure.</p>
<p>If proven and commercialized, a superconductor that provides these features could have wide-ranging impacts on technology and sustainability. The invention of the semiconductor changed the world as they have partial conductivity that can be precisely controlled, making them ideal for electronics.</p>
<p>Superconductors, on the other hand, can transmit electricity without losses, meaning no energy is wasted as heat. Superconductors have perfect conductivity but only at impractical temperatures, limiting their every day applications so far. The <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/superconductor-breakthrough-replicated-twice">new material LK-99</a> reportedly changes that. If validated, room-temperature superconductors like LK-99 could <a href="https://twitter.com/Andercot/status/1684339092635496449?s=20">revolutionize</a> computers, quantum computing, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/study-generative-ai-could-add-trillions-to-global-economy/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), healthcare, transportation, and more.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A viable superconductor could span nearly every technology involving electricity and magnetism. However, some experts remain skeptical given the limitations of initial studies. More rigorous testing is needed to validate the claims, and no timeline exists for commercialization. The original paper also lacked key details, <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/how-india-debunked-south-koreas-so-called-superconductor-at-room-temp-lk99-12958422.html">raising doubts</a>.</p>
<p>But the potential is enormous if LK-99 proves real. So far, the early results have <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/04/lk-99-room-temperature-superconductor-claim">energized research</a> worldwide. Groups are now <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-diy-race-to-replicate-lk-99/">racing to reproduce</a> the findings on LK-99 and related compounds. As of August 5, 2023, the elusive quest to produce or mirror LK-99&#x2019;s purported superconductivity has remained unfulfilled by any team. Yet, this has done little to quell the surge of wide-eyed speculations that have since emerged.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hot take &#x1F336;&#xFE0F;</p>
<p>The consensus debate about migrating <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> to Post-Quantum Cryptography is expected to be driven or at least lifted again by the sudden <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LK99?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LK99</a> discovery. <a href="https://t.co/GAr6X1vptB">pic.twitter.com/GAr6X1vptB</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the realm of cryptocurrency, the buzz surrounding the LK-99 discovery has evolved into a web of inquiries and hypotheses concerning quantum computers cracking Bitcoin&#x2019;s cryptography. These theories have found their way into spirited debates across social media platforms like X and Reddit, becoming a hot topic over the past week. A notable example can be found in a post published on the subreddit forum r/bitcoin, which delves into this intriguing subject.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2023, a Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/15fe9jx/any_thoughts_on_lk99_implications_for_bitcoin/">inquisitively queried</a> the community, asking if anyone had &#x201C;any thoughts on LK-99 implications for Bitcoin?&#x201D; The responses were quick and varied; one individual <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/15fe9jx/comment/juciivq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">envisioned</a> that if the claims were true, new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) rigs might emerge. Another person candidly asserted that Bitcoin would need to implement quantum resistance with haste should LK-99 prove to be genuine.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bitcoin will need quantum resistance and relatively fast (5 years?). And more importantly actually be live on mainnet, that might be hard for Bitcoin community to actually vote and approve, on time,&#x201D; the Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/15fe9jx/comment/juduegi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">said</a>. &#x201C;Ok so maybe it might be 10 years. But do you really want to bet your entire <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> stash on that?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/15fe9jx/comment/jueyfa1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">declared</a> that the &#x201C;wealth equalization that will occur will make Bitcoin obsolete.&#x201D; Meanwhile, on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), similar conjectures regarding Bitcoin and LK-99 are scattered throughout various threads. &#x201C;Is LK-99 Bitcoin &#x2018;s biggest threat ever?&#x201D; one individual provocatively <a href="https://twitter.com/Rmalk/status/1687875222811381760?s=20">posted</a> on X, further elaborating, &#x201C;A new wave of Quantum computers, powered by superconductors, could crack its cryptography.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The skepticism and excitement extend further, with another user on the platform <a href="https://twitter.com/Kristrodamus/status/1686356015267139584?s=20">proclaiming</a>, &#x201C;Of course, if LK-99 is real, which is looking to be the case &#x2026; the revolution in quantum computing will kill many types of encryption and put [a] nail in [the] coffin of bitcoin.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At this juncture, a balanced blend of healthy skepticism and burgeoning optimism prevails. The future of LK-99 remains uncertain&#x2014;it may flourish or falter. Yet, the sheer magnitude of its potential is such that the research alone could yield rich rewards, unlocking unprecedented insights into the very fabric of physics. The mere hint of room-temperature superconductors has sent a thrilling charge through the scientific community.</p>
<p>This pursuit, even if LK-99 ultimately falls short, might guide us to unexpected revelations and answers. However, the notion that LK-99 poses a threat to Bitcoin&#x2019;s cryptography seems rather exaggerated for a phenomenon that has yet to be officially replicated and peer-reviewed. And, even if it were to reach that milestone, the journey from discovery to mass production and commercialization could span well over a decade.</p>

The network reached an all-time high on May 1, 2023, with 682,281 transactions. This unprecedented activity began its upward trend in April and has been attributed to the rise of Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Network’s Daily Transaction Rate Shatters Records in 2023</h2>
<p>Since its inception in 2009, the Bitcoin network has grown exponentially, both in terms of adoption and technical advancements. In 2023, the network achieved a new record, reaching its all-time high in transaction count. On May 1, 2023, approximately 682,281 transactions were confirmed during the course of the day.</p>
<p>The initial surge began in April 2023, with transactions starting to increase noticeably from April 2. This marked a turning point in the year, leading to consecutive months of increased activity. Most of the rise has been linked to the trend of Ordinal inscriptions taking place on the Bitcoin blockchain, a phenomenon that has captured the attention of both enthusiasts, BRC20 traders, and non-fungible token (NFT) collectors.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the all-time low for the year occurred on January 1, 2023, with only 187,516 transactions. This stark contrast between the low and high points within the same year emphasizes the dynamic and ever-changing nature of Bitcoin’s landscape. Meanwhile, 2023 is not an isolated case of growth. Looking back at the 14-year data, there&#8217;s a consistent pattern of upward momentum in terms of the number of confirmed transactions per day.</p>
<p>In 2009, the daily transaction average was 91 transfers, while in 2010, the median average escalated to 508 transactions. The momentum continued into 2011, with the average leaping to 5,210, followed by another surge to 23,096 per day in 2012. The trend persisted in 2013 with an average of 53,817 and soared to 69,216 per day in 2014. The upward climb marked 2015 with 125,134 transactions, 2016 with an average of 225,756, and 2017 witnessed a median average of 285,105 confirmed transfers each day.</p>

<p>Contrastingly, 2018 experienced a dip to an average of 223,002 daily transactions, less than the preceding year. 2019 rebounded to 328,174, but 2020 saw a decrease to an average of 307,523 daily transactions, and 2021 fell further to a median average of 267,935 transfers. The numbers in 2022 averaged 255,086 confirmed transactions per day, while 2023 has already shattered the yearly average with 378,833, and the year has not yet concluded.</p>
<p>Ethereum, ranking as the second-largest blockchain project by market capitalization, handles significantly more daily transfers than Bitcoin. Yet, Ethereum has not matched its peak number of confirmed transactions per day, which reached 1,932,711 on December 9, 2022. The apex of confirmed daily transactions on Ethereum for this year occurred on May 5, 2023, with 1,208,777. Despite this, Ethereum&#8217;s daily transfer count in 2023 has still not surpassed the fifth-highest record, a milestone achieved on May 13, 2022, with 1,342,405 transfers.</p>

The number of individual addresses possessing WLD under Worldcoin&#8217;s umbrella has surged by more than 148%, escalating from 164,195 wallets to a figure of 408,721 unique addresses.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin&#8217;s Unique Addresses Soar 148%</h2>
<p>From July 24, 2023, to Saturday, August 5, Worldcoin&#8217;s native asset <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/worldcoin">WLD</a> has maintained a median average price of $2.41 per token over the course of the past 12 days. On that specific day, WLD achieved an unprecedented high of $3.30 per unit, only to witness a decline of 35.55% by August 5.</p>

<p>Conversely, WLD also touched an all-time low of $1.66 on July 24, but the price has since rebounded, climbing more than 27% from that low. In the week leading up to August 5, WLD&#8217;s value has eroded by 9.2% against the U.S. dollar, with 1.7% of that loss occurring on August 5 alone.</p>
<p>What has improved in Worldcoin&#8217;s recent performance is the rise in the number of unique addresses holding WLD. As of July 25, the count of WLD token holders stood at <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/examining-worldcoins-concentrated-supply-at-token-launch/">164,195 wallets</a>. Fast forward 12 days to August 5, and that figure has expanded by 148% to <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xdc6ff44d5d932cbd77b52e5612ba0529dc6226f1#balances">408,721 unique addresses</a>.</p>
<p>Dominating the landscape, the largest address commands a staggering 57.8604% of the supply, encompassing 103,494,839 WLD tokens, while the top 100 holders collectively wield ownership of 95.08%. Since the token&#8217;s launch on Optimism, 1,912,129 WLD transfers have taken place.</p>

<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s preeminent two addresses, which function as contract addresses, are firmly within the control of the Worldcoin project, holding 57.86% and 17.88% of the WLD supply, respectively. Following those wallets is the third-largest address, held in Binance&#8217;s custody, and the fourth, maintained by the firm Wintermute.</p>

<p>The fifth position is occupied by another contract wallet under Worldcoin&#8217;s dominion, while the sixth-largest wallet is overseen by the South Korean exchange Bithumb. The subsequent ranks are controlled by Okx as the seventh largest, Huobi as the eighth, and Flow Traders owning the ninth largest WLD wallet. Wintermute has yet another significant presence, commanding the tenth-largest WLD wallet with a balance of 850,000.</p>
<p>The following ten positions are designated as Uniswap, Gate.io, Bithumb, Bybit, an unknown wallet, Mexc, Bitget, Worldcoin, another unknown wallet, and Bybit, in that order. Cumulatively, the top 20 wallets encapsulate a commanding 94.0125% of the WLD supply as of August 5, 2023.</p>

Adams however argues that there are certain &#8220;geopolitical issues&#8221; that must be overcome first before the BRICS currency becomes a reality. </strong></p>
<h2>Debt Ceiling Standoffs and the Impact on the U.S. Credit Rating</h2>
<p>According to Riley Adams, a personal finance expert and the CEO of <a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/">Young and the Invested</a>, the credit rating agency Fitch’s recent <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-united-states-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa-outlook-stable-01-08-2023">downgrade</a> of the United States to AA+ will likely &#8220;embolden anyone in the BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa] that supports the creation of a new currency.&#8221; Adams, also a certified public accountant (CPA), told Bitcoin.com News that Fitch’s report on the country also &#8220;relays legitimate concerns about how the budgeting process has devolved in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, Fitch has tied its downgrade of the U.S. long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+ to the &#8220;repeated debt-limit political standoffs&#8221; and the last-minute resolutions which have in turn &#8220;erode[d] confidence in fiscal management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the personal finance expert has posited that many of those opposed to the U.S. dollar’s reserve currency status will now attempt to use news of Fitch’s downgrade to further rally support for a BRICS currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the very least, it could trigger a short-term shift in sentiment that BRICS-currency supporters could use to get some traction on their ideas,&#8221; Adams, a former senior financial analyst for Google, explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>BRICS Currency and Geopolitical Issues</h2>
<p>In the past few years, critics of the U.S.-dominated financial system have highlighted how the country’s divided legislature has played a part in eroding confidence in America’s ability to meet its obligations on time. Also, before the latest <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-republicans-strike-tentative-deal-to-raise-us-debt-ceiling/">debt ceiling agreement</a> was struck, senior U.S. officials including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the U.S. Congress’ constant failure to raise the debt limit on time posed a serious threat to the dollar’s dominance.</p>
<p>However, as has been reported by Bitcoin.com News, the same U.S. officials appear less concerned about the possibility of the Chinese yuan or the much-vaunted BRICS currency toppling the greenback. While American leaders have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-no-alternative-reserve-currency-can-replicate-role-played-by-the-dollar/">flaunted</a> the dollar’s unmatched backing by United States’ &#8220;deep, liquid and open financial markets&#8221; when dismissing the prospects of rival currencies, Adams sees &#8220;geopolitical issues&#8221; as one of the reasons why people ought to be less sanguine about the BRICS currency’s chances of success.</p>
<p>To illustrate, the personal finance expert pointed to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/brics-currency-not-august-summit-agenda-south-african-official-2023-07-20/">report</a> in which the governor of the South African central bank reveals that a common currency would require a banking union, a fiscal union, and macroeconomic convergence for it to succeed. According to Adams, attempting to achieve this takes &#8220;many steps farther than simply trying to decouple from the dollar individually, and [is] much more unlikely to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams said the fact that proponents of a BRICS currency are seemingly trying to walk back earlier comments about the launch suggests the alternative reserve currency will not start circulating in August as some proponents had predicted.</p>

The respective legislative changes have been made alongside the adoption of a dedicated law regulating the introduction of Russia’s own digital ruble.</strong></p>
<h2>Amendments Legalizing Foreign CBDCs Enter Into Force in Russia</h2>
<p>Russian authorities have granted digital currencies of other states a similar status to that of the digital ruble, the Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media informed readers on Thursday, quoting the government’s official online <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202307240024?index=1&amp;ysclid=lks2d847bj563975366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portal</a> for legal information.</p>
<p>The recognition of other central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDCs</a>), such as China’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinas-central-bank-digital-yuan-transactions-reach-250-billion/">digital yuan</a>, for example, has been done through amendments to Russia’s federal law “On currency regulation and currency control” which entered into force on Aug. 1, the report details.</p>
<p>The update adds to the definition of foreign currency the text “issued in digital form by the national central bank of a foreign state.” In accordance with the revised legislation, non-residents will not be restricted in carrying out transactions with such digital currencies, the publication pointed out without elaborating.</p>
<p>Russia’s digital ruble law also came into force on Tuesday. The legislation, which creates the legal basis for the introduction of Bank of Russia’s digital currency, was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-passes-digital-ruble-law/">passed</a> by both houses of parliament and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-signs-digital-ruble-law-allowing-cbdc-payments-in-russia/">signed</a> by President Vladimir Putin in July. Russian banks participating in the CBDC pilot are expected to start <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-launch-digital-ruble-transactions-with-real-users-in-august/">testing transactions</a> with real users as early as this month.</p>

<p>Pressed by sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been exploring ways to circumvent financial restrictions and looking to digital currencies, including crypto payments under special legal regimes, as an option for international settlements.</p>
<p>Last month, Central Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-russia-discusses-digital-ruble-integration-with-other-countries/">unveiled</a> that the monetary authority is already discussing the possible integration of the digital ruble platform with the payment systems of other nations to facilitate cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>However, the digital ruble is yet to win wider recognition from Russia’s private sector. According to a recent poll among over 1,200 representatives of small and medium enterprises, almost two-thirds of Russian companies don’t see any advantages of the CBDC for their businesses.</p>

He also anticipates the BRICS economic bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) merging with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). &#8220;A single merged organization will be much more clearer, stronger and grow into very meaningful pole,&#8221; he described.</strong></p>
<h2>Indian Analyst on BRICS Merging With SCO, World War III</h2>
<p>Robinder Sachdev, president of Imagindia Institute, a New Delhi-based think tank and research center, has shared his predictions on World War III and the possible merger of the BRICS economic bloc and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The BRICS nations are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The SCO members comprise China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both BRICS and SCO are initially founded by China and Russia. Many big picture goals of both organizations are same. It is necessary for both organizations to have very different roadmap in future. Otherwise, I have said many times that it is now time to consider merging of the SCO and BRICS into a single organization,” the Indian analyst told Russian news outlet Tass on Friday. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>A single merged organization will be much more clearer, stronger and grow into very meaningful pole … Let’s see in next 5 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Discussing the BRICS economic bloc&#8217;s current position globally, Sachdev emphasized: &#8220;BRICS will have to create its own space and find a way to be as effective or more effective than other international organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He detailed: &#8220;If the BRICS countries work together strongly on some common agenda then BRICS can have an important role. If BRICS becomes a strong organization, then it can play very important role in building the new world matrix of the 21st century.&#8221;</p>

<p>The think tank president also believes that World War III has already begun, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my view, we are already in the middle of World War III or the First World War of the 21st century.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the war, there are climate and economic challenges, for both the global north and south countries. Role of strong and neutral international institutions is extremely needed now to shape the new world matrix. The UN is rudderless. Others, some are inactive, and some have become one-sided in this war,” he further shared.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you agree with the assessment provided by the Indian analyst regarding the future of the BRICS economic bloc and the assertion that World War III has commenced? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>
