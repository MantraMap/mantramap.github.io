Quant (QNT), a cryptocurrency with a total market cap of $1.88 billion, is outperforming some of the more popular altcoins out there, going up by 10% during the last seven days. According to latest tracking from Coingecko, at the time of this writing, the altcoin is changing hands at $129.88 and is in the midst of a 22.5% increase over the previous two weeks. At a glance: Quant has established important support zones of $111.5 and $100 QNT may soon test the $157 resistance territory The altcoin is enjoying a weekly gain of 10% Prior to the crypto market woes that were brought about by the collapse of the FTX exchange platform, the digital asset was enjoying a good run above the $160 region. After the exchange imploded, QNT was hit very hard, diving all the way down to $95.28 on November 14. Since then, the digital coin has done a great job of bouncing back to reclaim and sustain the $100 territory. Over the last few days, Quant&#8217;s price action formed an ascending triangle pattern which indicates more bullish activity from the 30th largest cryptocurrency in terms of overall valuation. A Possible Push Beyond $150 Zone For QNT With its Relative Strength Index (RSI) positioned above the neutral zone, there is indeed a positive outlook for the trajectory of Quant price.

The asset, on December 2, made a decisive push beyond the set resistance neckline of $128, triggering the bullish run that comes with its current price action pattern. Combining with the definitive increase in QNT trading volume, this momentum is expected to kickstart a strong surge of 18.5% to catapult the asset all the way up to the $155 resistance region. Traders and those who are considering buying right now, however, need to keep a close eye on the altcoin as the bullish thesis will be nullified in the event of a price dump that pulls Quant below its support zones of $111.5 and $100. Worst Case Scenario For Quant Should the digital coin fail to capitalize on its current momentum and do fall below the crucial support territory, Coincodex predicts a sharp decline for its trading price. If this unfolds, within the next five days, Quant will most likely decrease its value by almost 27% to change hands at $95.77. Meanwhile, after such price dump, the asset is seen to once again mount a recovery to trim its losses. The online crypto information provider predicts that during the next 30 days, QNT will possess a trading price of $101.58 Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Surge As Hash Rate Records New ATH – How About LTC Price?
