<p>As meme coins continue to rise, new projects are springing up with new uses and access to untapped industries. One such project is Pomerdoge. Pomerdoge will be a P2E game that will connect players from all corners of the globe. The Pomerdoge ecosystem will have three key components; NFT collections, Pomergame (an immersive game center with rewards and compensation), and Pomerplace (a marketplace for the buying, selling, and trading of valuable in-game items).</p>
<p>One of the notable highlights of Pomerdoge lies in its unwavering commitment to security and user protection. Currently, Pomerdoge is in the initial phase of its token presale and is available at only $0.0000264 per token. Those who jump in now will benefit from the upcoming 40x price surge and receive profits based on their holdings.</p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Dips Despite New Development&nbsp;
<p>As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to make its mark in the crypto-sphere, Shiba Inu's (SHIB) ecosystem lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has announced that Shibarium will launch in August. Despite the news, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still trading between $0.0000072 and $0.0000078, following recent price advancements last week. However, to experience an upward surge, Shiba Inu (SHIB) needs to overcome a supply barrier near the $0.000008 level, where 91,460 addresses hold a considerable amount of SHIB.</p>
<p>At present, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 5.24% drop in the last 24 hours, resting at $0.0000072. Notably, IntoTheBlock's Global In/Out of the Money indicates a significant supply barrier in the $0.000008 to $0.000014 range. Many Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors have purchased SHIB at an average price of $0.000010, with 400,380 addresses holding 286.42 trillion SHIB. A successful breakthrough of this barrier could potentially propel Shiba Inu (SHIB) toward the $0.000014 to $0.000019 range.</p>
Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Losing Relevance?
<p>In 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) emerged as a remarkable meme cryptocurrency, capturing widespread attention and reaching its peak of $0.7376 in May. The excitement surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) was amplified by endorsements from prominent figures like Elon Musk, whose acquisition of Twitter in 2022 triggered multiple price surges for the memecoin.</p>
<p>Over time, Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed the crypto ladder, thanks to support from the Dogecoin (DOGE) community, and is now the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, the fortunes of Dogecoin (DOGE) took a turn after its all-time high. The bankruptcy of several cryptocurrency firms in 2022 further impacted Dogecoin's (DOGE) price. Presently, Dogecoin (DOGE) is being traded at $0.065436, exhibiting a modest increase of 0.25% within the last 24 hours.</p>
Conclusion&nbsp;
<p>Amid the price declines for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), the emergence of Pomerdoge has reignited investors' interest in meme coins. The prospect of Pomerdoge surpassing these top guns in the market has generated interest from investors. Pomerdoge's utility and connection to the gaming sector which houses millions of users can help propel POMD's price in the ongoing run, making it an enticing investment opportunity.</p>
