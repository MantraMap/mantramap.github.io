					<description><![CDATA[In the ongoing market turbulence on higher timeframes, Bitcoin (BTC) is at a crucial juncture as a great consolidation phase persists. Research and analysis firm Material Indicators closely monitored the recent weekly candle close/open, paying particular attention to two key factors: the trend line and the 21-day, 21-week, and 21-month moving averages (MA) – all of which are currently influential in shaping market dynamics.  Uncertainty And Potential Turning Point For Bitcoin The opening of the weekly candle below the trend line triggered a “subsequent nosedive,” amplifying concerns. While the 21-week and 21-month moving averages continue to serve as robust support, the 21-day MA has faced a rigorous seven-day testing period, according to the firm’s analysis.  Notably, the tight correlation of the 21-MA across three distinct time frames is rare, indicating that the market is at a critical inflection point.  Despite the compressed volatility witnessed in recent days, the price action observed over the past 24 hours exemplifies the market&#8217;s attempt to shake out weak hands. According to Material Indicators, given the complexity of the current price action, it is prudent to zoom out and gain a broader perspective. Both Trend Precognition algorithms identified these moves on the four-hour chart, emphasizing the significance of adopting a comprehensive outlook. Moreover, according to Materials, the order book reveals a concerning trend in bid liquidity, with less than $40 million holding the price up.  The absence of substantial liquidity below this level raises fundamental worries. However, it also suggests that there may not be sufficient sentiment to drive prices significantly lower – at least not yet.  Related Reading: XRP Volume Jolt: How Did The $3 Billion Surge Impact Price Action? In addition, Material Indicators highlights that the examination of liquidity movements within the order book over the past month paints a picture of continued price volatility with a potential upward bias.  However, the lack of volume raises concerns about the market&#8217;s overall health. Despite a $13 million buy wall at $27,900, the bottom of the channel at $28,300 remains a critical threshold for BTC to extend its current trend. The firm claims: &#8230; the bottom of the channel at $28.3k remains my line in the sand for BTC to extend the trend, and I maintain that we must see weekly candles printing above the 100-Week MA to even consider a bull breakout. BCT Faces Renewed Pressure Amid Strengthening US Dollar As Bitcoin enters a new week of trading, market participants closely monitor the potential impact of the strengthening US Dollar Index ($DXY) on the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency.  According to Yan Alleman, co-founder of blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, recent developments suggest that BTC may face renewed pressure due to the upward momentum of the $DXY. Alleman highlights that the $DXY&#8217;s renewed strength could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the value of the US Dollar and the price of BTC, meaning that when the dollar strengthens, Bitcoin often faces headwinds.  However, options pricing indicates a bullish sentiment for Bitcoin in the coming month. Options are financial derivatives that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin.  The pricing of options contracts suggests an expectation of a bullish move shortly. This aligns with the technical analysis indicating potential upside for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? Analyzing the potential price movements, Alleman notes that it would require nearly twice as much selling pressure to push Bitcoin down to the low $28,000 range compared to the buying pressure needed to surpass the $30,000 level.  This observation suggests that there may be greater support and buying interest at higher price levels, making a sustained drop less likely. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,500, reflecting a marginal 0.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a shocking turn of events, the developer behind the controversial meme coin BALD initiated a series of significant transactions, raising eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community. The events surrounding the deployer’s recent actions have left both the coin&#8217;s value and its reputation teetering on the edge. BALD Deployers Send Funds To Kraken Exchange Blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain has revealed that the deployer of the BALD token has executed audacious moves, bridging a staggering 7,000 ETH ($12.9 million) out of the Coinbase Layer 2 network, Base. Of the 7,000 ETH that has been sent to the Ethereum network, the deployer sent 2,100 ETH ($3.87 million) in two different transactions to the Kraken crypto exchange, for purposes that can only be for selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin-Friendly Javier Milei Wins Presidential Primaries In Argentina Following this, the BALD deployer currently holds 4,902 ETH in their balance on the Ethereum blockchain, worth over $9 million at current prices. The wallet’s tokens holdings also remain significant, sitting at $1.115 million at the time of this writing. The recent transactions have now dredged up speculations about who the BALD deployer might be. On-chain investigator ZachXBT previously lent his expertise to the investigations, with findings pointing toward an X (formerly Twitter) user who goes by the username @milkyway16eth due to a previous transaction between the deployer wallet and Milkyway’s wallet. However, there is yet to be any concrete proof if Milkyway is actually the brains behind the rug. A Rollercoaster For Investors The BALD meme coin started making the rounds on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after being launched on Base. The coin which was named after Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong’s bald head rose rapidly, climbing more than 289,000% in less than two days. This growth rate served as an attraction for investors, who bridged quickly to the ETH blockchain to invest in the token. It continued to rise, crossing a $70 million market amid the euphoria. However, this would end up being short-lived. Related Reading: More Selling? Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase On August 1, the BALD deployer pulled liquidity from the token, making off with 10,705 ETH ($20 million at the time). The coin’s price declined rapidly after this, although the official X account for BALD continued to deny that it was a rug pull. Although BALD continues to trade on the Base network, it has been unable to reclaim its past glory. Its price is down over 90% from its all-time high and recorded 18% losses in the last 24 hours alone, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Its daily trading volume is sitting at $503,000 and its market cap is $9.03 million.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows large Maker holders have accumulated recently, a sign that the rally could extend soon. Maker Large Holders Have Continued To Expand Their Holdings Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, inflows to the wallets of the large MKR investors have been taking place for a while now. The &#8220;large holders&#8221; here refer to those investors who hold at least 0.1% of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s circulating supply. In Maker&#8217;s case, this value would equal about $1.2 million. Thus, the only holders who would clear these criteria would be the sharks and whales, the largest entities on the network. These investors generally hold some influence in the market, as they can move many tokens at once. Thus, the behavior of this cohort could be worth watching, as it may reveal answers about where the asset might be heading next. One way to track the behavior of these humongous holders is through the &#8220;netflow&#8221; metric, which measures the net amount of MKR that these large investors are adding into or moving out of their combined holdings right now. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that a net number of coins is entering into the supply of these investors currently, suggesting that they are participating in buying. On the other hand, negative values could imply that this group may be selling as its members are transferring a net amount of the asset away from their wallets.

There were a few dips into the negative territory, but the net outflows weren&#8217;t significant in scale then. In the past few weeks, there haven&#8217;t been any drops below the zero mark, suggesting that the large holders have only continued accumulating more MKR recently. Something to note here is that a positive netflow doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t any selling taking place at all. Instead, it simply suggests that the accumulation is enough to cancel any distribution. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin?

This conviction from these large holders can naturally be a positive sign for Maker, as the asset could potentially continue its rally soon.

					<description><![CDATA[Michael Burry, renowned investor, and hedge fund manager, has once again made headlines with his significant short position in the traditional market, which could impact the nascent crypto industry if his bet is to materialize. Burry, known for accurately predicting the subprime mortgage crisis, recently went mega-short with over $1.6 billion in S&#38;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) puts. These indexes often record a high correlation with the crypto market as they attract similar investors.  Burry&#8217;s $1.6 Billion Short Signals Potential Implications For Crypto Market Burry&#8217;s track record as an astute investor lends weight to his latest bet. By predicting and profiting from the subprime mortgage crisis, he gained a reputation as an investor capable of identifying market trends before they unfold.  It is important to consider that Burry has established himself as a prognosticator who is often ahead of the curve and is willing to wait for the anticipated market changes to come to fruition. Related Reading: HBAR Token Spikes 16% In One Day, Can Bulls Sustain the Momentum? On this matter, Yan Alleman, co-founder of Glassnode, has supported Burry&#8217;s approach, suggesting that while the short-term effects may not be immediately evident, the long-term payoff is likely to be significant. Alleman also highlighted the potential impact of the US Dollar Index (DXY) on the cryptocurrency market, specifically Bitcoin. According to Alleman, the recent renewed strength of the DXY could exert pressure on Bitcoin. The DXY measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies.  On The Verge Of A Final Leg Up? As Burry predicts, a drop in the DXY could result in a significant surge in crypto assets, including Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. This surge would represent a final leg up before a presumed deep correction across financial markets. While the correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin has been subject to debate, the potential consequences of Burry&#8217;s short position on the market cannot be ignored.  If his prediction were to come true, it could trigger a domino effect, leading to a substantial downturn in traditional markets and a subsequent surge in crypto assets. Nevertheless, the implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in such a scenario are twofold. On the one hand, Bitcoin has often been hailed as a digital store of value and a hedge against traditional market downturns.  Burry&#8217;s short position on the market could reinforce this narrative, attracting more investors to Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s extreme volatility could magnify the potential crypto bloodbath if Burry&#8217;s bet materialized.  A sudden surge in selling pressure for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, coupled with a widespread market correction, could result in a sharp decline in the crypto market, causing substantial losses for investors who entered the market at its peak.

As of the current writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,300, indicating a marginal 0.3% decline over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has continued to be in a consolidation phase since the start of August. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HBAR has soared with momentum after the US Federal Reserve adopted the Hedera Hashgraph-based Dropp micropayments platform. According to the announcement, Dropp is now on the list of service providers on Fed’s FedNow instant payment system.  Following this news, HBAR&#8217;s market sentiment improved, causing a rapid price surge that propelled the token from $ 0.0561 to $0.06544. This represents an over 16% increase in the last 24 hours. However, HBAR price has crossed the overbought region, raising questions about how long the current rally can last. FedNow Adds Hedera Hashgraph-Powered Dropp To Its List Of Service Providers On July 20, the US Federal Reserve launched the FedNow instant payment system. This payment system allows banks and credit unions to transfer money for customers any time, any day, instantly. However, according to the latest development, FedNow adopted Dropp, a micropayment platform built on Hedera as a service provider. Dropp allows users to use micropayments for small-valued transactions in USD Coin (USDC), HBAR, and US dollars. Related Reading: SHIB, PEPE, APE Gain Against Bitcoin, Santiment Explains What This Means Adopting Dropp as a FedNow service provider implies that banks and other financial service providers can use the micropayment platform for real-time payments. This feat marks a milestone for Hedera as FedNow indirectly supports the token, granting the Hedera blockchain support from traditional finance companies.  Similarly, Hedera is already benefiting from this partnership as its price has increased by over 16% in the last 24 hours. Also, Hedera garnered massive investor attention in the past week due to increased partnerships, such as South Korean automobile companies Kia and Hyundai, which have adopted Hedera’s infrastructure to track vehicle carbon emissions. HBAR Price Outlook; How Long Can The Bulls Hold? HBAR soared over 16% within a few hours after the FedNow support announcement. That brought the token’s seven-day price increase to nearly 17%. In addition, HBAR’s valuation is now 25% higher than its price 30 days ago. HBAR trades at $0.065, with a day high of $0.06625 and a low of $0.05046. One remarkable thing about HBAR’s performance is the massive surge in trading volume, which signifies increased network activity and investor interest. As of the time of writing, HBAR has recorded an over 1,219% surge in 24-hour trading volume, after securing its position as the highest-gaining cryptocurrency today.  According to the daily chart, HBAR trades above two key support levels at $0.063035 and $0.06005. Moreover, the bulls have formed green bars above the support levels as they vie to push HBAR to higher highs. The Relative Strength Index is at 72. But while this signifies increased buying pressure, the sideways movement of the RSI graph suggests a weakening trend. So HBAR buyers have reached saturation and are probably about to lose momentum.

					<description><![CDATA[Recent comments from former SEC Attorney John Reed Stark have further dampened optimism about the regulator approving any of the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Looking More Unlikely The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has continuously denied applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, and Stark has suggested that this trend isn’t going to change anytime soon as the SEC will likely deny all the pending applications due to several “compelling reasons.” While aligning his opinion with that of Better Markets, Stark stated that the arguments laid forward in the nonprofit’s letters to the SEC “brilliantly” highlighted why the SEC would not approve any of these applications. Related Reading: Want A Bitcoin Spot ETF? Then Prove BTC Is Not Manipulated, Says SEC Better Markets had, in two separate letters (here and here) dated August 8, laid out arguments why the SEC should reject the proposed rule changes by the Cboe BZX Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market “to list and trade shares in Spot bitcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETP).”  According to them, the Spot Bitcoin market is known to show inflated trading volumes due to illicit practices like market manipulation and wash trading. They argue that the markets are highly concentrated and Bitcoin’s network is maintained by a “select group of individuals and entities.” All this makes any proposed Spot Bitcoin ETP susceptible to manipulation by “bad actors” and puts investors and the public interest at risk.  In their applications, these exchanges stated that CME Bitcoin futures, a regulated market of significant size, could provide the necessary data and insights relating to any fraud and manipulation in the Spot Bitcoin ETF market. Additionally, they had entered into a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase as an extra measure to prevent fraud and market manipulation. However, Better Market has labeled these measures as “wholly inadequate.” They argue that the CME Bitcoin futures market is not a “regulated market of significant size” and the surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase is insufficient to prevent market manipulation.

Stark believes that the “crypto-regulatory tides could shift exponentially” once the US 2024 elections take place.

Although the elections are slated for November 2024 (long after the SEC might have decided on the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications), Stark has forecasted that a GOP-led administration could bring about the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF.  Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 rollup developed by crypto exchange Coinbase, is already making a name for itself in the market. The blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has been on a rapid rise over the last few weeks, rising triple-digits in just the last two weeks alone. So the question now is, what’s driving the TVL growth? Meme Coins, Rugs, And Newcomers Unlike other Layer 2 networks, Base seemed to have gotten its big break with the growing trend of meme coins being launched on the network. The most notable of these was the BALD meme coin which went from less than $100,000 in market cap to over $50 million in a matter of days. As the popularity of BALD ramped up, so did the popularity of Base and decentralized finance (DeFi) traders clamored to bridge to the blockchain. Related Reading: Regulatory Pressure Mounts On Worldcoin, Can WLD Price Recover? The rug deployer rugged the project not long after, making off with over $9 million in liquidity. Following this, there were speculations of former FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried Nverbeing the mastermind behind BALD, although nothing came from these accusations. However, instead of the blockchain’s first big project rugging being a deterrent, it seems to have had the opposite effect. More developers have moved to launch their projects on the blockchain seeing the potential. This includes the likes of SushiSwap, Uniswap, and Compound, among others, which have all provided support for the Base network. New projects such as Alien Base, SwapBased, and Krav have also been gaining ground with their TVL growing rapidly during this time as well. So for Base, it has been able to turn a negative situation into a positive one. Base Joining The Layer 2 Blockchain Race In the last two weeks, the Base TVL has grown from $13 million to more than $130 million, data from DefiLlama shows. This represents an almost 900% increase in TVL during this time, making it the fastest-growing Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain in terms of TVL. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Chances Of Revival Grow Slimmer, Here’s Why Base’s rapid growth has already put it in the race with other Layer 2s. However, when put in comparison against other established Layer 2 networks, Base still has a long way to go. It is currently the 5th-largest Layer 2 in terms of TVL, lagging well behind the likes of Arbitrum, Polygon, and Avalanche. Nevertheless, Base’s bull case continues to grow with over $203 million already bridged to the blockchain and daily active users sitting above 100,000 over the last four days. Given Coinbase’s backing and Base’s growing popularity, it may not be long until it becomes one of the most prominent Layer 2 blockchains in the space.

The blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has been on a rapid rise over the last few weeks, rising triple-digits in just the last two weeks alone. So the question now is, what’s driving the TVL growth?</p>
<h2 class="p2">Meme Coins, Rugs, And Newcomers</h2>
<p class="p2">Unlike other <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/polygon-labs-unveils-major-upgrade-to-sidechain-with-zkevm-validium-layer-2/">Layer 2</a> networks, Base seemed to have gotten its big break with the growing trend of meme coins being launched on the network. The most notable of these was the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/29-meme-coins-bald-rugged-base-investors-lose-millions/">BALD meme coin</a> which went from less than $100,000 in market cap to over $50 million in a matter of days. As the popularity of BALD ramped up, so did the popularity of Base and decentralized finance (DeFi) traders clamored to bridge to the blockchain.</p>

<p class="p2">The rug deployer rugged the project not long after, making off with over $9 million in liquidity. Following this, there were speculations of former FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried Nverbeing the mastermind behind BALD, although nothing came from these accusations.</p>
<p class="p2">However, instead of the blockchain’s first big project rugging being a deterrent, it seems to have had the opposite effect. More developers have moved to launch their projects on the blockchain seeing the potential. This includes the likes of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi/sushiswap-burns-5-million-per-year-but-will-it-rebrand-in-2023/">SushiSwap</a>, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/uni/why-the-uniswap-uni-token-is-almost-worthless/">Uniswap</a>, and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/compound-comp-bears-take-full-control-as-price-dips-20-in-7-days/">Compound</a>, among others, which have all provided support for the Base network.</p>
<p class="p2">New projects such as Alien Base, SwapBased, and Krav have also been gaining ground with their TVL growing rapidly during this time as well. So for Base, it has been able to turn a negative situation into a positive one.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Base Joining The Layer 2 Blockchain Race</h2>
<p class="p2">In the last two weeks, the Base TVL has grown from $13 million to more than $130 million, <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Base?volume=true" rel="nofollow">data</a> from DefiLlama shows. This represents an almost 900% increase in TVL during this time, making it the fastest-growing Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain in terms of TVL.</p>

<p class="p2">Base’s rapid growth has already put it in the race with other Layer 2s. However, when put in comparison against other established Layer 2 networks, Base still has a long way to go. It is currently the 5th-largest Layer 2 in terms of TVL, lagging well behind the likes of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-arbitrum-promise-fading-downtime-metrics-decline-raise-arb-price-alarms/">Arbitrum</a>, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/when-will-polygon-matic-rebound-analyzing-this-months-recovery-potential/">Polygon</a>, and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/avalanche/avalanche-foundation-commits-50-million-to-tokenized-asset-purchases/">Avalanche</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Nevertheless, Base’s bull case continues to grow with over $203 million already bridged to the blockchain and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-newly-launched-layer-2-network-records/" rel="nofollow">daily active users sitting above 100,000</a> over the last four days. Given Coinbase’s backing and Base’s growing popularity, it may not be long until it becomes one of the most prominent Layer 2 blockchains in the space.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining has been up by a considerable fraction this year, as the blockchain network recorded a new all-time high in hash rate in the second quarter of the year. Mining revenue is also up, as the bitcoin Bitcoin recorded a spike in transaction volume.  As a result, Riot Blockchain, one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies in the US, has recorded an increase in operations in the second quarter. According to its 2023 second-quarter financial results, the mining company recorded a new all-time record hash while ramping up its Bitcoin mining operations. Solid Second Quarter 2023 According to its financial report, Riot has seriously ramped up its Bitcoin mining operations. As a result, the mining company produced 1,775 BTC during the second quarter of 2023, a 27% increase compared to the 1,395 BTC it produced during that same period in 2022.  In May 2023 alone, the company produced 676 BTC at an average of 21.8 BTC per day. The average cost to mine each bitcoin was $8,389, beating Q2 2022&#8217;s average of $11,316. Related Reading: More Selling? Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase Riot also witnessed an increase in mining revenue, as Bitcoin miners generated a remarkable total revenue of $2.4 billion. Although the price of Bitcoin during the quarter was 15% less than what it was in Q2 2022, Riot saw a total revenue of $76.7 million, as compared to $72.9 million in Q2 2022. Mining revenue ($49.7 million), engineering revenue ($19.3 million), data hosting revenue ($7.7 million), and power curtailment credits ($13.5 million) were also higher than in Q2 2022.  Not only has RIOT’s revenue from bitcoin mining increased, but their actual bitcoin holdings have also grown substantially. As of June 30, Riot held 7,264 BTC with the price of each BTC at $30,477. In total, Riot finished the quarter with $408.4 million in working capital, including $289.2 million in cash on hand and $221.4 million in Bitcoin, while also reducing its net loss to $27.7 million compared to $353.6 million in Q2 2022.

					<description><![CDATA[In the dynamic realm of Bitcoin, the ability to discern patterns and trends from raw data is invaluable. Glassnode&#8217;s latest report, &#8220;Exhaustion and Apathy,&#8221; serves as a beacon, illuminating the intricate nuances of the current state of the market. Let&#8217;s delve deeper into the numbers and their implications. Historic Lows In Bitcoin Volatility The overarching theme of Glassnode&#8217;s findings is the unprecedented stagnation in Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility. The data reveals that the digital asset has been trading within a remarkably narrow $29,000 to $30,000 range. Historically, Bitcoin has been synonymous with volatility, making this current phase an anomaly. The report underscores this by highlighting the Bollinger Bands&#8217; tightness, noting, &#8220;The upper and lower Bollinger Bands are currently separated by just 2.9%.&#8221; Such constricted movement has been a rarity in Bitcoin&#8217;s tumultuous history. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? Meanwhile, the dynamics between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH) offer a captivating narrative. Glassnode&#8217;s data indicates a significant shift in wealth between these two cohorts. The STH&#8217;s wealth has burgeoned by +$22B this year, while the LTH has witnessed a near-identical reduction of -$21B. This shift is not merely about numbers but also about market sentiment and strategy. The cost basis further elucidates this dynamic. The STH cost basis has surged by +59% YTD, settling at $28.6k. In stark contrast, the LTH cost basis lingers considerably lower, around $20.3k. This divergence suggests that recent market entrants might be paying a premium, potentially due to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or speculative behavior. Glassnode&#8217;s exploration into spending patterns in this low volatility environment is also particularly enlightening. The data suggests that in such periods, the majority of coins moved on-chain have a cost basis that hews closely to the spot rate, resulting in minuscule realized profits or losses. The Sell-Side Risk Ratio, a pivotal metric in this context, is languishing at an all-time low. To put it in perspective, fewer than 27 trading days (0.57%) have recorded a value lower than the current one, signaling a market teetering on the edge of a potential volatility resurgence. Segmented View Of BTC&#8217;s Supply The report&#8217;s segmented analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s supply, based on &#8216;investor holding time,&#8217; offers a layered understanding of market behavior. The &#8216;Hot Supply,&#8217; representing the most active coins, constitutes a mere 2.8% of all invested value in BTC. This suggests a market dominated by holders rather than traders. Related Reading: SHIB, PEPE, APE Gain Against Bitcoin, Santiment Explains What This Means The &#8216;Warm Supply,&#8217; spanning from a week to six months, has seen a modest uptick year-to-date, now accounting for around 30% of Bitcoin&#8217;s wealth. This segment&#8217;s behavior is crucial as it often acts as a bridge between short-term reactions and long-term convictions. The &#8216;Single-Cycle Long-Term Holders,&#8217; those entrenched in the 2020-23 cycle, are the behemoths, holding a staggering 63% of the invested capital. Their cost basis, as per Glassnode, stands at $33.8k, indicating an average unrealized loss of -13.3%. In juxtaposition, the classic LTH cohort, which includes the long-dormant and deep HODLed supply, boasts a cost basis of $20.4k, translating to an unrealized profit of +43.6%. This stark contrast underscores the lingering impact of the 2022 bear market and the cautious optimism of early adopters. In conclusion, Glassnode&#8217;s data-driven insights paint a nuanced picture of the Bitcoin market. The dominance of long-term holders, the historic lows in volatility, and the evident investor apathy all converge to suggest a market in a state of stasis. The numbers indicate a market that&#8217;s waiting, perhaps for a Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? or a significant event, to determine its next direction. At press time, Bitcoin was trading just above the 50-day EMA. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[XRP has recently witnessed a remarkable surge in trading volume, with an impressive increase of $3 billion reported by Messari. This surge reflects the cryptocurrency&#8217;s enduring appeal, adaptability to market trends, and potential to disrupt traditional finance. Speculations abound about the factors driving this surge, sparking discussions on its implications for both XRP&#8217;s future trajectory and the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite this surge in trading activity, the expected correlation between volume and price failed to materialize, leaving market analysts puzzled by the intriguing phenomenon. XRP transaction volume. Source: Messari The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to unexpected fluctuations, but the recent surge in XRP&#8217;s trading volume has brought forth a unique puzzle. Unlike the traditional market dynamics, where a surge in volume often corresponds with a significant price movement, XRP&#8217;s price remained relatively muted.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges This divergence has led experts to speculate that the surge in volume might not primarily represent genuine buying support for the asset. XRP Buyers&#8217; Attempt To Reclaim Higher Ground In a separate report, it was highlighted that the XRP price had staged a minor recovery attempt from the $0.6 support level the previous week. In an endeavor to regain higher ground, the coin price exhibited a short-lived 11.4% jump, only to encounter immediate resistance at $0.665.  The subsequent rejection candle at this crucial barrier spoke volumes about the prevailing market sentiment. Traders, it seems, are still inclined to sell on bounces, a strategy often observed in established downtrends. XRP is trading at $0.6286, according to TradingView.com Over the course of seven days, the gains amounted to a mere 0.1%, underscoring the tenuous nature of the recovery attempts. Anticipating A Potential Turnaround Amidst the price volatility, a key question emerges: can the falling XRP price rally once more? If the price does indeed witness another surge in buying pressure that propels it to the $0.6 support level, it could signal a concerted effort by buyers to accumulate the asset at a discounted rate. All eyes are now on the critical resistance level of $0.665. Should the XRP price manage to break through this barrier, it could serve as the initial sign of a broader recovery trend.
