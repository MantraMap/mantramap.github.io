<p>The platform has been attracting over 20,000 new registrations each month, solidifying Spain&#8217;s position as the fastest growing market for World ID in the European Union.</p>



<p>The World ID, a unique digital identity system, offers users a secure and decentralized way to verify their identity online.

<p>In addition to Spain&#8217;s remarkable growth, neighboring Portugal has also witnessed a significant uptake of World ID registrations. Earlier this year, the number of World ID registrations in Portugal exceeded 1% of the country&#8217;s population, demonstrating a notable interest in the platform&#8217;s capabilities.</p>



<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s expansion into Spain can be seen as a response to the country&#8217;s thriving AI boom and its increasing reliance on advanced technologies. As Spain continues to foster innovation and digital transformation, Worldcoin aims to meet the rising demand for secure digital identity solutions and contribute to the country&#8217;s technological progress.</p>

<p>The World ID platform not only enhances online security but also opens up new possibilities for streamlined digital interactions across various sectors. From financial services to e-commerce, the integration of World ID can revolutionize the way individuals authenticate their identities, reducing fraud and improving overall efficiency.</p>

With Worldcoin&#8217;s expansion and continuous innovation, more individuals are expected to embrace the advantages of a secure and decentralized digital identification system.</p>



<p>As Worldcoin expands its World ID access in Spain and responds to the country&#8217;s AI boom, it is likely that the platform will continue to gain traction across Europe and globally. With increasing concerns over data privacy and security, blockchain-based solutions like World ID offer a promising path forward, empowering individuals with greater control over their digital identities while fostering a more trustworthy online ecosystem.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Hashrate Index, Bitcoin&#8217;s network hashrate has soared to new highs, reaching an average of 401 EH/s over the span of seven days and an average of 445 EH/s over three days. </strong></h5>

<p>This surge in hashrate indicates a significant increase in mining activity and highlights the growing interest in <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/hashrate-index-roundup-july-9-2023/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/hashrate-index-roundup-july-9-2023/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>. Concurrently, the price of Bitcoin has witnessed a remarkable 14% rise over the past month, cementing its position as the leading cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate indicates an intensified competition among miners, as they strive to secure a larger share of the network&#8217;s mining rewards. The increase in hashrate is a positive sign for the Bitcoin network, as it reinforces the security and robustness of the blockchain.</p>

<p>In tandem with the hashrate surge, premium ASIC miners like the S19 XP have experienced a notable increase in price. These specialized mining rigs are highly sought after for their superior mining capabilities. However, the price increase has not been uniform across all ASIC models, with some experiencing a decline in prices. The fluctuation in ASIC prices suggests an evolving market demand, with miners opting for more efficient and cost-effective options.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price surge in the last thirty days reflects growing investor confidence and renewed interest in the cryptocurrency. Several factors have contributed to this upward trend, including increased institutional adoption, positive regulatory developments, and a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature and limited supply have further bolstered its appeal as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to climb, market analysts are closely monitoring its trajectory. Some experts believe that the current bullish trend may pave the way for new all-time highs in the coming months. However, others caution that price volatility remains a characteristic of the cryptocurrency market, advising investors to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before entering the market.</p>

<p>BitDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization focused on funding the development of open finance protocols, has released a new proposal to deploy $200 million to the L2 Mantle ecosystem. The proposal, known as MIP-24, aims to deploy capital within the Mantle ecosystem over the next three years to support founders and protocol technology partners building within the ecosystem. The goal is to deploy over 40 projects on the Mantle ecosystem and achieve a financial return of 1.5x MOIC in three years.</p>



<p>The Mantle Network is a high-performance Ethereum layer-2 network that&#8217;s built with modular architecture and aligned with Mantle strategic interests via the $MNT token. Ecosystem funds have historically served as an important catalyst of growth for new emerging protocols and ecosystems, particularly for developer and decentralized applications (dApps) adoption of a new protocol. The Mantle EcoFund aims to be the &#8220;first money&#8221; into high-quality and innovative early-stage projects building within Mantle Ecosystem, providing support alongside the Strategic Venture Partners.</p>



<p>The Mantle EcoFund consists of two components: 100 million USDC provided by Mantle from its Treasury and managed by the Mantle EcoFund, and the remaining $100 million in external matching capital from Strategic Venture Partners when they co-invest with the Mantle EcoFund opportunistically. This capital pool aims to support the adoption of Mantle Network among developers and dApps and incentivize reputable Strategic Venture Partners to invest in the Mantle ecosystem.</p>

<p>This news came as a surprise, as Kennedy initially denied being a Bitcoin investor during a conference in Miami in May. However, recent financial documents have shown that the nephew of former president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy" rel="noreferrer noopener">John F. Kennedy</a> is indeed a cryptocurrency investor.</p>



<p>Kennedy&#8217;s investment in Bitcoin was made after he delivered a pro-cryptocurrency speech at Bitcoin Miami. A representative for the presidential hopeful told CNBC that the investment does not represent a conflict of interest. Despite concerns over a possible conflict of interest, Kennedy remains a strong proponent of Bitcoin and its potential benefits.</p>

<p>Kennedy has previously tweeted his support for Bitcoin, stating that it can help protect against totalitarianism and the manipulation of money supply while also promoting more transparency and democracy in government institutions. His investment in BTC is just one example of his commitment to this vision.</p>



<p>Kennedy&#8217;s campaign initially suggested that the investment was made by his wife, Cheryl Hines, but they later confirmed that it belonged to the presidential candidate himself. Kennedy is not alone in his support for cryptocurrency, as other presidential hopefuls like Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have also expressed their pro-crypto views.</p>



<p>This news is significant for the cryptocurrency community, as it highlights the growing mainstream acceptance of BTC and other cryptocurrencies. As more politicians and public figures begin to embrace cryptocurrency, it&#8217;s likely that we&#8217;ll see increased adoption and investment in this emerging asset class.</p>

<p>On June 1, about 150 firms applied for a local crypto license that allows them to operate a crypto trading platform in the region. Some firms have even reportedly spent up to $25 million to acquire one. Sue Wei, managing director of major recruitment firm Hays, that while exchanges have been looking to establish a base in Hong Kong, the industry&#8217;s hiring needs are currently &#8220;light.&#8221; However, she anticipates that as many Web3 companies continue to grow and mature, there will be an increase in job openings.</p>



<p>Wei also mentioned a significant decrease in requests for recruiting technical talent since the dip in the crypto market. She said that when talent was laid off en masse, some people became hesitant to work at a crypto company due to the business&#8217;s unstable nature, which primarily relies on the prices of crypto. Similarly, founder of crypto recruiter Cryptorecruit, Neil Dundon, said he has not noticed much activity in Hong Kong. Although he thinks the market has bottomed out, he expects it to start trending upward from now on. Olga Yung, managing director of Michael Page Hong Kong, stated that she has yet to see a significant increase in people seeking jobs in Web3, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Hong-Kong-opens-crypto-exchange-licensing-ahead-of-retail-trading" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Hong-Kong-opens-crypto-exchange-licensing-ahead-of-retail-trading" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite</a> the government&#8217;s recent push. However, Yung has noticed a slight uptick in Web3 firms seeking legal and compliance hires in mid to late Q2 2023.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Kevin Gibson, founder of Web3 recruitment firm Proof of Search, believes that it might take six months for crypto talent to surge into the region as companies wait for license approvals. Gibson explained that a lot of specialist talent has left Hong Kong in recent years, and the local talent pool is thin. Therefore, companies that have landed in Hong Kong will find themselves in an extreme war for talent. Setting up in Hong Kong requires full-time positions for key roles. Gibson thinks that Web3 companies will probably look to move their headquarters to a pro-crypto jurisdiction if things go according to <a href="https://coincu.com/200024-hong-kong-considers-launching-hkdg/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/200024-hong-kong-considers-launching-hkdg/" rel="noreferrer noopener">plan</a>.</p>

<p>The latest data shows a negative population growth rate in Hong Kong since 2020, indicating that attracting talent will be challenging. However, employment stats for Q1 2023 show that the number of vacancies increased by almost 38% compared to the same time last year. Yung added the main challenge is attracting talent with an interest in these sectors because many candidates are risk-averse given the current market sentiment. On the other hand, Neil Tan, chair of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong, said he has met several people who recently switched over from TradFi to crypto. Tan stated that many people were directly approached by crypto firms, while others used sites such as LinkedIn to find roles. He added that &#8220;TradFi keeps shedding headcount every year or two,&#8221; so the stability is not necessarily as attractive as it was before.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin&#8217;s 90% climb over the past year, due to the halving, offers insights into Bitcoin&#8217;s future, while Bitcoin sees a partial rebound from a crypto rout, as per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-09/bitcoin-btc-bulls-cheered-by-litecoin-ltc-surge-before-halving?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-09/bitcoin-btc-bulls-cheered-by-litecoin-ltc-surge-before-halving?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>.</strong></h5>



<p>Bitcoin investors should take note of Litecoin&#8217;s recent success, as it may provide valuable insights into what&#8217;s to come. Litecoin has experienced an almost 90% climb over the past year, partly due to its upcoming supply curb, or &#8220;halving,&#8221; which Bitcoin will also experience in the coming months. This event cuts the amount of tokens miners receive in half, which is part of the process of capping the supply of tokens.</p>



<p>Despite Litecoin&#8217;s recent tempering, its performance over the past 12 months has surpassed Bitcoin&#8217;s advance of about 39% as well as the 22% increase in a gauge of the largest 100 tokens. This is partly due to Litecoin&#8217;s faster transaction times compared to Bitcoin, making it a more attractive option for investors.</p>



<p>Litecoin is trading at around $93 at the time of this writing, which experienced a significant down of nearly 17% last week.</p>

<p>The halving is just one factor contributing to Bitcoin&#8217;s partial rebound this year after a 2022 crypto rout. Other factors include increasing optimism about demand if BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and others succeed in their efforts to start spotting Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US. An institutional-only crypto exchange, EDX Markets, recently went live with backing from billionaire Ken Griffin&#8217;s Citadel Securities as well as Fidelity and Charles Schwab Corp. It offers trading in only four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.</p>



<p>While Bitcoin has hit records after its last three halvings, the current outlook for crypto is clouded by the prospect of more central bank interest-rate hikes to tighten liquidity and curb inflation. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $30,000 after surpassing $31K last week.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how Bitcoin will behave when the stock market correction eventually arrives in earnest, but investors should keep an eye on Litecoin&#8217;s success as a potential indicator of things to come for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>As per Bloomberg, some experts also suggest that Bitcoin is likely to experience a boost in demand due to its potential as a hedge against inflation. With the current outlook for more central bank interest-rate hikes, investors may turn to Bitcoin to protect their assets against inflation. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the recent moves towards greater institutional adoption of Bitcoin, such as the launch of Bitcoin futures contracts on major exchanges and the entry of large financial institutions into the cryptocurrency market, could help to further drive up demand for Bitcoin in the coming months and years.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>UniSat&#8217;s Bitcoin wallet tweeted that it will launch the NFT marketplace next week.</em></li>



<li><em>This wallet will support all 1500+ existing collections with preferential service fees from 1.6% to less than 1% across the market.</em></li>



<li><em>In addition, the collection mentioned by the project earlier this week will also be made public in the coming days.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UniSat Marketplace for NFT Collection is launching next week. It will support all of the 1500+ existing collections, using the information stored in a given <a href="https://github.com/ordinals-wallet/ordinals-collections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>To celebrate the launch of collection trading, we&#8217;re reducing the entire market&#8217;s service fee from 1.6% to a lower 0.x%. UniSat Marketplace offers the lowest fees compared to existing platforms, often incurring a total fee of 2-3%.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In addition, the UniSat collection mentioned earlier this week will be made public in the coming days with beautiful recursivePlay images and UniSat Badge, exclusive to wallet supporters. Specific information will be shared in upcoming announcements.</p>



<p>UniSat Wallet is the first BRC-20 token-enabled wallet on the Bitcoin network. It is a decentralized application that allows you to create a Bitcoin wallet that can be used to interact with the Ordinals protocol.</p>



<p>The success of this project greatly depends on the fate of the orders themselves. There is a fervent debate happening right now about how memecoins are slowing down transaction speeds on the already unhurried BTC blockchain. Moreover, their popularity has caused transaction fees to skyrocket.</p>

<p>In May, several explosive trends emerged regarding BRC-20 tokens created on the Bitcoin network. However, it didn&#8217;t last long. Whether or not to invest in BRC-20 tokens will depend on one&#8217;s risk appetite. In fact, as we have seen, when FOMO increased, many people saw huge profits from these tokens.</p>



<p>UniSat Wallet, which officially went into operation on April 23, is the earliest BRC-20 supported wallet. However, just a day later, on April 24, Twitter UniSat Wallet <a href="https://coincu.com/183535-unisat-wallet-suffers-double-spend-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>that the wallet had been attacked by double-spending, making the wallet unusable for many hours. The project hopes users can understand because BRC-20 technology is still very new.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitget Exchange released the eighth asset reserve certificate (snapshot June 7).</em></li>



<li><em>There are now 2311.23 BTC, up 7%; 11,200 ETH, up 9%; 346 million USDT, up 4%.</em></li>



<li><em>Amid dwindling user confidence in private crypto platforms, Cryptocurrency Exchanges race to compile Proof of Reserves</em>.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to information from <a href="https://coincu.com/199950-bitget-to-launch-new-product/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitget</a> has released the eighth asset reserve certificate (snapshot June 7).</strong></h5>



<p>The reserve categories include BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC, with a total reserve ratio of 223%. The snapshot shows that it holds 2311.23 BTC, marking a 7% gain, 11,200 ETH, reflecting a 9% increase, and 346 million USDT, with a 4% increase over May.</p>

<p>Bitget launches Proof of Reserve (PoR) to improve the security and transparency of user assets. These tools will allow you to independently test Bitget&#8217;s Proof of Reserve and verify that Bitget&#8217;s reserves have exceeded known exchange liabilities for all users to confirm viability Bitget payments.</p>



<p>Proof of Reserve is a concept created to make centralized cryptocurrency exchanges more transparent by sharing the money and assets they have in their reserves. It helps the user determine the exchange&#8217;s true state to prevent the spread of information.</p>



<p>The crash of the FTX exchange is one of the most important reasons behind this idea. This process involves the use of cryptographic proofs, public wallet ownership checks, and periodic audits.</p>

<p>Using the Merkle Tree system, an exchange like Bitget stores the details of a user&#8217;s account on the system online, allowing the user to verify the report at any time and from anywhere.</p>



<p>To achieve this, the exchange stored the hash of each user&#8217;s account assets in a leaf node on the Merkle tree. Each user can verify that their coins are included in the Merkle tree by checking the total amount of user assets stored in the leaf nodes of the Merkle tree. The open source code of the platform&#8217;s 100% payment proof has also been published to GitHub.</p>



<p>Participating in this trend are Kucoin (May 4), OKX (April 28), Bybit (April 14), MEXC (April 10), Binance (July 3) continue to issue updates. Among them, OKX is updated most often, once a month.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Google Cloud partners with Voltage for global expansion of Bitcoin-based services, signaling growing interest in cryptocurrency.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Bitcoin-Based services offered by Google Cloud are being expanded.</strong></h5>

<p>In a significant move, Google Cloud, the renowned cloud and data service provider valued at $225 billion, has joined the Bitcoin bandwagon by partnering with Voltage, an infrastructure provider specializing in the Bitcoin Lightning Network. This collaboration aims to expand Bitcoin-based services globally while supporting Voltage&#8217;s operational growth.</p>



<p>Through this partnership, Voltage will leverage Google Cloud&#8217;s vast resources to cater to its customers on a global scale. By deploying nodes in specific geographic regions, Voltage can meet the demands of larger customers seeking Bitcoin and Lightning integration, such as those in the U.K. or Asia.</p>



<p>The announcement of this collaboration has generated considerable attention on social media, signaling Google&#8217;s increasing interest and acceptance of Bitcoin and Lightning. This move sets Google apart from competitors like Apple, which recently removed a Lightning-friendly decentralized social media protocol from its App Store.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voltage.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="530" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voltage-1024x530.jpeg" alt="Google Cloud Expands Bitcoin-Based Services, Partners With Voltage For Global Expansion" class="wp-image-201052" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voltage-1024x530.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voltage-300x155.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voltage-768x398.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voltage-750x388.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voltage-1140x590.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Voltage.jpeg 1483w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Google Cloud Expands Bitcoin-Based Services, Partners With Voltage For Global Expansion 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>With<a href="https://coincu.com/184701-google-clouds-game-changing-web3-startup/"> Google Cloud</a>&#8216;s parent company Alphabet&#8217;s extensive reach, the collaboration strengthens the position of Lightning in the tech industry, particularly among payment services providers. Google Pay, with millions of users across over 15 countries, further bolsters the company&#8217;s influence in the digital payment space.</p>



<p>This partnership comes after Google Ventures (GV), the investment arm of Google, exhibited a strong interest in blockchain, Web3 companies, and Bitcoin. GV&#8217;s participation in a $6-million seed round for Voltage in 2021 reflects the growing momentum of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>While Lightning continues to gain traction worldwide, industry observers emphasize the need to monitor its growth. Notably, one of Mexico&#8217;s largest companies has started experimenting with Lightning, and major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have committed to integrating Lightning.</p>



<p>Voltage&#8217;s CEO, Graham Krizek, anticipates more services to be rolled out soon, accompanied by efforts in Bitcoin education. The partnership with Google Cloud is seen as a significant step forward, exposing organizations to the possibilities of Bitcoin and Lightning and capturing their attention amid the increasing interest and demand.</p>



<p>As the adoption of Bitcoin and Lightning progresses, it will be crucial to monitor the industry&#8217;s response and the evolving landscape of decentralized finance. The collaboration between Google Cloud and Voltage marks a notable milestone in the intersection of traditional cloud services and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>In a recent development, the Discord channel of decentralized finance (DeFi) project Fei Protocol has been taken over by the San Francisco Superior Court, as announced by renowned crypto influencer Julian Traversa in a tweet on July 9.</p>



<p>According to court filings, Fei Labs, the company behind <a href="https://coincu.com/118826-fei-protocol-issue-hits-new-low-for-defi/">Fei Protocol</a>, is facing a class action lawsuit for alleged non-compliance with securities laws during the &#8220;Genesis Event&#8221; from March 31, 2021, to April 3, 2021. The lawsuit claims that Fei Labs failed to register the sale of Fei and TRIBE tokens, resulting in a violation of securities regulations.</p>

<p>The takeover of Fei Protocol&#8217;s Discord channel by the San Francisco Superior Court serves as a significant development in the legal proceedings surrounding the alleged securities law violations. The court&#8217;s intervention aims to ensure proper adherence to regulatory requirements and protect the interests of affected individuals and entities.</p>



<p>Fei Protocol is a DeFi project that has garnered attention in the crypto community for its innovative approach to stablecoin issuance and decentralized governance. However, the recent class action lawsuit highlights the challenges faced by DeFi projects in navigating regulatory frameworks and compliance obligations.</p>



<p>As the settlement fund has been established, affected parties are encouraged to promptly file valid proof of claims to secure their share of the compensation. This resolution marks a step forward in addressing the legal implications faced by Fei Protocol and showcases the importance of regulatory compliance within the evolving DeFi landscape.</p>
