					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved closer to the $17,000 level on Tuesday. The digital currency dropped to $16,400, its lowest level in the last three weeks. As year-end approaches, BTC could face high volatility and low liquidity. Bitcoin Hit A Brief Surge Bitcoin surged to a short-lived peak of $16,837 in today&#8217;s session, barely 24 hours after hitting $16,398. The cryptocurrency saw an impulsive decline after experiencing significant rejection at the resistance level. The sharp fall has been associated with a straight daily decline for the S&#38;P 500 and general nervousness about the Federal Reserve&#8217;s potential to hike interest rates. BTC/USD trades at $16,870 on the daily chart. Source: TradingView BTC could witness more decline as the year closes given the decline in trading volume and liquidity. This would lead to a spike in the volatility of the asset. Katie Stockton, the founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, has predicted that BTC could retest November lows, dropping “near $15,600, in the coming weeks.” BTC hit an all-time high of $68,997 on Nov. 8, 2021. But the big crypto produced a major shift in market structure by producing a lower low on the weekly timeframe at $32,995 on January 24. This move confirmed the start of a bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised To Resume Its Inclination To Outperform, Says Bloomberg Senior Analyst Possible Rally For BTC While the dust settles from the FTX crash and FUD surrounding Binance, the bitcoin price could begin to see a gradual recovery over the next few months. According to Jim Wyckoff, “Neither the bulls nor the bears have any near-term technical advantage.” This suggests that traders will continue to see “more choppy and sideways trading on the daily chart into the end of the year – barring any major fundamental shock to the marketplace,” Wyckoff concluded. However, a tweet by Crypto Trader, PlanB shows that the next Bitcoin halving is set to take place in 15 months. The build-up in price will not happen for at least 5 months as the U.S. FED will continue to tighten up monetary policy. BTC price will have room to breathe as macroeconomic conditions soften. Schroders, a global asset management firm, made the case that risky assets like Bitcoin have a nearly 80% chance of closing the year with positive returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still “Overvalued” According To NVT Ratio The investment firm noted that December was the best-performing month after collecting data on U.S. large-cap stocks since 1926. Schroders estimates that there is a 77.9% likelihood that large-cap stocks will end December with a net gain. The company divides all percentage gains vs. all percentage losses over the course of a month to arrive at these metrics. Investors should keep in mind that this year, the correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market has been over 90%. It may be argued that until the end of the year, the peer-to-peer digital currency will continue to reflect price changes on the stock market. Bitcoin is down 2% from December&#8217;s opening price of $17,167. Thus, following Schroders&#8217; analysis, Bitcoin may rise by 3.5% to reach $17,550 by Jan. 1, 2023.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano’s price started a fresh decline after it failed to surpass $0.32. ADA remains at a risk of more losses below $0.25 and $0.245 in the near term. ADA price is gaining bearish momentum below the $0.280 support against the US dollar. The price is trading below $0.280 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2560 on the 4-hours chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down below the $0.245 support zone. Cardano (ADA) Price Could Dive Further In the past few days, cardano’s price saw a steady decline from the $0.320 resistance zone. The bears were able to push the price below the $0.30 and $0.280 support levels. The decline gained pace below the $0.265 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). ADA price even spiked below the $0.250 support zone and traded as low as $0.2481. It is now showing a lot of bearish signs near the $0.250 zone, unlike bitcoin and ethereum. It is trading well below $0.280 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $0.255 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2560 on the 4-hours chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first major resistance is forming near the $0.264 zone. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3188 swing high to $0.2481 low. Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com The main resistance is now forming near the $0.2840 level. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3188 swing high to $0.2481 low. If there is an upside break above the $0.280 and $0.284 resistance levels, the price could start a strong increase. In the stated case, the price could rise steadily towards the $0.32 level. More Losses? If cardano’s price fails to recover above the $0.255 and $0.264 resistance levels, it could continue to move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $0.248 level. The next major support is near the $0.245 level. A downside break below the $0.245 level could open the doors for a fresh decline towards $0.220 in the coming days. The next major support is near the $0.200 level. Technical Indicators 4-hours MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. 4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level.

					<description><![CDATA[Grayscale Investments may offer to buy up to 20% of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust  (GBTC) shares. This is a move the company hopes will close the gap between the GBTC share price and the company&#8217;s underlying Bitcoin holdings. Grayscale Can&#8217;t Act Independent Of Investors The Wall Street Journal released a letter by Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein urging that Grayscale would consider issuing a tender offer should the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and shareholders give their approval. Being a close-ended fund, GBTC shareholders can only liquidate their holdings on the open market. Under the Williams Act (part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that governs tender offers in the US, an investor tendering for a security must disclose their source of funds, legal agreements related to the offer, and reasons for the offer. GBTC trades at $8.08 on the 24-hour chart. Source: TradingView If the company cannot return GBTC shareholders funds, it will continue to offer the tender until it&#8217;s converted to an ETF. Sonnenshein wrote to investors: In the event we are unsuccessful in pursuing options for returning a portion of the capital to shareholders, we do not currently intend to dissolve GBTC, but would instead continue to operate GBTC without an ongoing redemption program until we are successful in converting it to a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with the SEC after its application to convert GBTC to a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 29, 2022. The letter by the CEO was an attempt to ease shareholder concerns after a turbulent few months across the crypto market. Related Reading: GBTC Unlocks Spells Doom For Bitcoin? Top Expert Breaks It Down ETF Conversion Seems To Be Only Option As it stands, Grayscale doesn&#8217;t have a specific timeline for when it may explore other options apart from the ETF conversion. The lawsuit seems to be a long-drawn battle. Grayscale filed its opening brief against the SEC on Oct. 11, 2022. In response, SEC filed a brief on Dec. 13, 2022 denying Grayscale&#8217;s accusations that its rejection was discriminatory and arbitrary. The firm has until Jan. 13, 2023 to respond. Afterwards, a three-judge panel will be selected to listen to oral arguments and rule on the case. Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust has roughly $10.78 billion or 633,000 BTC in assets under management. The fund has failed to meet its goal, and it&#8217;s currently changing hands at a 48.8% discount to Bitcoin. Source: YCharts Sonnenshein didn&#8217;t clarify if the business may later sell off its Bitcoin holdings. However, a market dump like Grayscale could see Bitcoin crashin to a fresh yearly low. Grayscale selling off its Bitcoin stash could also drive down confidence in crypto as significant liquidations for those engaged in Bitcoin derivatives markets. This would hurt crypto volumes, and send a bearish crypto market further down.

It is important to keep in mind that the total number of active Shiba Inu addresses currently sits below 5% of its total addresses. This means that there is a decreased activity for the digital asset, which could explain why there have been no positive reactions to the milestones.  The cryptocurrency has also fallen out of favor with large Ethereum whales who no longer hold a significant amount of the cryptocurrency on their balances.

					<description><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market continues to feel the darkness of crypto winter, but it could be Litecoin bringing the blossom of a new bull trend, according to a an eerily similar fractal found in LTCUSD daily price charts.  The fractal pattern developed following the most recent pullback, and appears to have a similar structure to a major bull market breakout. Could this be the light at the end of the tunnel for cryptocurrencies? Hawkish Fed Dims Litecoin Rally, But A Fractal Gives Hope After a stellar month leading the market with 40% returns for November, Litecoin has given back nearly half of that thus far in December.  LTC had been on a tear, outperforming top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and clawed its way closer toward making it back into the top ten cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Explodes Around $18K Level, As Fed Reveals 50 Basis Point Rate Increase But the greater market pullback stemming from a hawkish Fed meeting this month, caused a failure to liftoff in Litecoin.   However, the discovery of a price action fractal in LTCUSD could suggest this recent pullback wasn’t necessarily a failure, but a refueling of sorts — before taking off in an even stronger rally.  The price action is strikingly similar then versus now &#124; LTCUSD on TradingView.com Comparing Price Action Then Vs Now: Will Bulls Get A Break? The fractal begins on Black Thursday in March 2020 — a black swan event few saw coming. Litecoin rebounded and the fractal formed.  Unlike Bitcoin, which made a lower low during the FTX, LTCUSD hasn’t, and instead has followed the same pattern from 2020 almost flawlessly.  Price following the fractal further could lead to some minor continued downside, but ultimately holds at resistance turned support. If the current pullback proves to be a retest and holds, a more obvious rally could materialize. Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Slide, Now Below Shiba Inu In Market Cap Failure would almost certainly send Litecoin back toward 2018 lows and potentially beyond, making the fractal among one of Litecoin bulls’ best hope for a redemption rally. Importantly, a concurrent reversal taking place in the LTCBTC and LTCETH trading pairs appear to indicate strength in the altcoin relative to the top two crypto assets. However, there is no telling what this might mean for the overall market at this time.

<h2>Comparing Price Action Then Vs Now: Will Bulls Get A Break?</h2>
<p>The fractal begins on Black Thursday in March 2020 — a black swan event few saw coming. Litecoin rebounded and the fractal formed. </p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin, which made a lower low during the FTX, LTCUSD hasn’t, and instead has followed the same pattern from 2020 almost flawlessly. </p>
<p>Price following the fractal further could lead to some minor continued downside, but ultimately holds at resistance turned support. If the current pullback proves to be a retest and holds, a more obvious rally could materialize.</p>

<p>Failure would almost certainly send Litecoin back toward 2018 lows and potentially beyond, making the fractal among one of Litecoin bulls’ best hope for a redemption rally.</p>
<p>Importantly, a concurrent reversal taking place in the LTCBTC and LTCETH trading pairs appear to indicate strength in the altcoin relative to the top two crypto assets. However, there is no telling what this might mean for the overall market at this time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) remains one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies even before the bear market was officially in full bloom. The digital asset which had seen returns higher than 1,000% during the 2021 bull run would eventually see almost the entirety of those gains wiped out. Despite this, it had been able to maintain above a critical point for a long time. However, the cryptocurrency has now lost its footing, leading to an incredibly bearish outlook for the asset. ADA Price Falls Below $0.3 For a digital asset such as ADA, maintaining above $0.3 was important for it at a time when assets in the space needed to hold on to their critical support levels.

However, this time around, there was no recovery to save the digital asset and it would continue to spiral down.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows signs aren&#8217;t looking good for Bitcoin as the NVT ratio is indicating that the crypto is still overvalued right now. Bitcoin NVT Ratio Continues To Be At High Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC is currently overvalued from an on-chain perspective. The &#8220;Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its transaction volume (both in USD). This ratio judges whether the current value of Bitcoin (that is, the market cap) is fair or not, by comparing it against the network&#8217;s ability to transact coins right now (the transaction volume). When the metric has a high value, it means the price of BTC is high compared to the volume, and thus the coin could be inside a bubble at the moment. On the other hand, low values suggest BTC may be undervalued as the chain has a high ability to transact coins (in comparison to the market cap) right now. Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Slide, Now Below Shiba Inu In Market Cap Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT ratio over the past year: Looks like the metric's value has been pretty high during recent weeks &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph highlights, the Bitcoin NVT ratio jumped up following the LUNA collapse back in May of this year and has since mostly stayed at similar or higher levels. This means that despite the price observing multiple crashes in the period, the coin&#8217;s value still became increasingly overvalued as volumes across the market sharply dropped. Even after the FTX crash, which has delivered another solid blow to the crypto&#8217;s market cap, the metric has only climbed higher as it has registered a new high for the year recently. BTC has only been getting more and more overpriced as the bear has gotten deeper, suggesting the dire state of the market in terms of trading volumes.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain data shows signs aren&#8217;t looking good for Bitcoin as the NVT ratio is indicating that the crypto is still overvalued right now.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin NVT Ratio Continues To Be At High Values</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63a07ede36ec775f47466f3b-BTC-Evaluation-and-Trading-Perspective-from-On-Chain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">post</a>, BTC is currently overvalued from an on-chain perspective. The &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bullish-signal-nvt-ratio-btc-undervalued/">Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio</a>&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its transaction volume (both in USD).</p>
<p>This ratio judges whether the current value of Bitcoin (that is, the market cap) is fair or not, by comparing it against the network&#8217;s ability to transact coins right now (the transaction volume). When the metric has a high value, it means the price of BTC is high compared to the volume, and thus the coin could be inside a bubble at the moment. On the other hand, low values suggest BTC may be undervalued as the chain has a high ability to transact coins (in comparison to the market cap) right now.</p>

<p>Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT ratio over the past year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/165524/quicktake/elWHFI3Ko_4ade16ab9a5ca400aa560adf3c6692e22209f53fe4253aa66145fc2399c8b36f.png" alt="Bitcoin NVT ratio" width="1778" height="1125" /></p>

BTC has only been getting more and more overpriced as the bear has gotten deeper, suggesting the dire state of the market in terms of trading volumes.</p>

<p>Both these signs are certainly not in the favor of Bitcoin and may imply there is further pain ahead for investors. &#8220;A more extended bear market could be seen as a potential risk that could add selling pressure,&#8221; explains the analyst.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a surprising turnaround in its monetary policy today, the Bitcoin price managed to rise near the important resistance level of $16,900. The BOJ announced that it will drastically widen its yield curve control band to 0.50%. At the same time, it announced that it will significantly increase the number of government bonds it will buy each month. According to Bloomberg senior commodities analyst Mike McGlone, this trend could continue. McGlone shared his insights via Twitter and said that a &#8220;warm spell&#8221; is ahead for Bitcoin. As the analyst notes, BTC has taken a beating as a risk asset in 2022 with most other cryptocurrencies, but &#8220;appears poised to resume its inclination to outperform.&#8221; This will happen when the U.S. Federal Reserve eases monetary policy and completes its pivot. Bitcoin Is Set To Outperform When&#8230; According to the chart from a Bloomberg Intelligence report, the levels that BTC and the Nasdaq 100 stock index have been resisting have now turned into support. According to the analysis, the BTC price soared in 2020 and 2021 due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, allowing it to outperform the stock index. McGlone further elaborated: At a Bitcoin/ Nasdaq ratio of 1.5x on Dec. 16, what&#8217;s been consistent for most of the benchmark crypto&#8217;s history is its declining relative risk vs. the stock index. At 2x, Bitcoin&#8217;s annual volatility at the end of 2022 compares with 4x at the end of 2021. In the coming year of 2023, McGlone expects that it will be a matter of how much lower global economies fall. Investors should by no means underestimate BTC then, as the risk/reward ratio is in favor of the leading cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off $16,300, Here’s Why &#8220;Risk vs. reward appears to argue against under-allocating or estimating the propensity for Bitcoin to continue its trajectory toward becoming digital collateral,&#8221; McGlone claimed. In other words, the Bloomberg analyst predicts that as soon as the U.S. Federal Reserve fires up its money printer again, cuts interest rates and returns to monetary easing, Bitcoin will &#8220;outperform&#8221; the rest of the market again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Topside Bias Vulnerable If It Continues To Struggle Below $17K In another tweet, McGlone predicted that the leading cryptocurrency will outperform the Tesla stock. &#8220;The near-certain decline in Bitcoin supply compared to the rising number of Tesla shares outstanding favors cryptocurrency outperformance when the rules of economics apply,&#8221; McGlone said. BTC Price At Crucial Level Meanwhile, the BTC price needs to crack the extremely crucial $16,900 level in the short term and could then have a strong continuation. If so, investors should then keep an eye on the next vital resistance in the $17,350 area. Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
