He expects the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to launch a gold-backed currency that will kill the USD. The famous author</strong><strong> further stressed that U.S. dollars will come flooding home and inflation will go through the roof.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki on Death of US Dollar, BRICS Currency Launch, Inflation</h2>
<p>Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has weighed in on the proposed BRICS currency and its potential impact on the U.S. dollar. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The anticipation surrounding the new BRICS currency has surged after a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">report</a> by Russian news outlet RT, suggesting that the BRICS economic bloc is preparing to introduce a gold-backed currency, with an official announcement expected to be made during the leaders&#x2019; summit scheduled for Aug. 22-24. However, no BRICS officials have made an announcement regarding the new currency, and there is no confirmation that it will be backed by gold.</p>
<p>In a Tuesday tweet, Kiyosaki predicted that the U.S. dollar will die and trillions of USD will rush home, as he expects the BRICS nations to announce a gold-backed currency during their summit in August. The famous author added that inflation will go through the roof, emphasizing that investors should buy gold, silver, and bitcoin &#x2014; his usual recommendation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-597318 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kiyosaki-brics-currency.jpg" alt="" width="793" height="266" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kiyosaki-brics-currency-300x101.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kiyosaki-brics-currency-768x258.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kiyosaki-brics-currency.jpg 793w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"></p>
<p>This was not the first time Kiyosaki has warned about the BRICS nations challenging the dominance of the U.S. and its currency. In April, he similarly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-america-is-dying-warns-of-hyperinflation-death-of-us-dollar/">said</a> that &#x201C;quadrillions of dollars&#x201D; are coming back, cautioning that &#x201C;the ramifications of that are possibly &#x2026; hyperinflation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Kiyosaki has been recommending gold, silver, and bitcoin for many years. He previously explained that the three investments are the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">best</a> for &#x201C;unstable times.&#x201D; In his tweet on Tuesday, he also mentioned that the price of bitcoin will hit $120,000 next year. The famous author could be quoting the revised forecast by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-raises-bitcoin-price-forecast-now-expects-btc-to-reach-50000-this-year-120000-next-year/">Standard Chartered</a>. The banking giant said Monday that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could reach $50,000 this year and $120,000 in 2024.</p>
<p>The renowned author has made his own predictions about the future price of gold, silver, and bitcoin, stating in February that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will hit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoins-price-to-keep-rising-says-im-betting-on-it/">$500,000 by 2025</a>, gold will hit $5,000, and silver will reach $500.</p>
<p>While many people expect the launch of a common BRICS currency to be announced at the August summit, the vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, said that the creation of a common currency that would compete with the U.S. dollar is a medium to long term ambition. &#x201C;No one is suggesting right now that BRICS will form an alternate currency,&#x201D; he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">stated</a>.</p>

This figure is 154,160 bitcoins less than the number held on centralized trading platforms 72 days earlier, on April 30. The number of bitcoins on exchanges has significantly dropped since July 31, 2020, when nearly 3 million bitcoins were held in exchange reserves.</strong></p>
<h2>Centralized Crypto Exchanges Face Bitcoin Drain</h2>
<p>The number of bitcoins held in exchange reserves has steadily decreased over the past two years and 11 months, <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=log&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line">data</a> from cryptoquant.com shows. On July 31, 2020, metrics indicated that 2,941,655 bitcoins were held on exchanges. As of today, the number has decreased to 2,086,034. This means that over the past 1,075 days, customers have removed 855,621 bitcoins from centralized trading platforms.</p>

<p>Since April 30, 2023, approximately 154,160 bitcoins have been removed from exchanges, which then held 2,240,194 bitcoins in reserves. Bitcoin reserve <a href="https://archive.ph/5nxzw">balance data</a> from coinglass.com shows that Binance experienced a reduction of 18,566.71 bitcoins over the past 30 days. During the same period, Coinbase saw a withdrawal of 38,253.59 bitcoins, and OKX had about 9,403 bitcoins withdrawn. According to coinglass.com, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange Kraken had 8,544 bitcoins withdrawn in the past month.</p>
<p>When fewer bitcoins are available for purchase on exchanges, the principles of supply and demand typically suggest that if supply decreases and demand remains steady or increases, the price should rise. This has often been a <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015014.html">self-fulfilling prophecy</a> in the Bitcoin universe, as the perception of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> becoming an increasingly scarce resource tends to drive the price up through supply squeezes. Moreover, in 289 days, following the halving event, the total supply of new bitcoins entering the market will significantly decrease.</p>

<p>The data also indicates that the remaining circulating supply of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> not held by exchanges is managed by market makers, third-party custodians using cold storage services for institutional and high-net-worth clients, layer two (L2) solutions like Lightning Network, and numerous individuals utilizing self-custodial wallets in hot or cold wallet settings. Recent trends show a shift towards these alternatives over storing funds on exchanges. The collapse of platforms such as FTX and Voyager has only intensified the withdrawal of bitcoin from these businesses.</p>

<h2>Peter Schiff Warns About All Banks Failing</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff reiterated his concerns regarding the state of the U.S. economy and the impending banking crisis on the David Lin show, published last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole banking sector is completely insolvent, thanks to what we&#8217;ve done over the last decade or so by loading up these banks with all this long-term, low-yielding debt. And we had all [this] deposit insurance so nobody really cared about what the banks were doing with their money because it was all insured by the government,&#8221; Schiff described.</p>
<p>However, he stressed that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/first-citizens-bank-acquires-silicon-valley-bank-costing-fdic-deposit-insurance-fund-an-estimated-20b/">collapses of major banks</a> earlier this year have made people aware that the government may not fully cover all bank deposits in the event of a failure, especially if the amount exceeds the FDIC insurance limit. &#8220;The message that sends is if you&#8217;re a customer of a small bank, a regional bank, [or] a community bank, and you&#8217;ve got a large account, you just better get your money out. There&#8217;s no reason to leave it there. They can&#8217;t pay you enough interest to compete with a money market and what if the bank fails? You may be, you know, SOL,&#8221; Schiff detailed, cautioning:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, there&#8217;s a huge run on these banks. They&#8217;re all going to fail.</p></blockquote>
<p>The gold bug added that if the government wants to bail out all of these banks, &#8220;the only way it can do it is by destroying the value of the deposits because of massive inflation.&#8221; He emphasized: &#8220;The money to bail out the banks has to be created by the Fed. It&#8217;s the only way they&#8217;re going to get it.”</p>

<p>Schiff further warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if your bank fails, you&#8217;re going to lose money if you have a bank account.</p></blockquote>
<p>The economist explained that “either the bank&#8217;s going to fail because the government doesn&#8217;t bail it out and you&#8217;re going to lose your deposits or the government bails out your bank and your deposits lose their value because inflation destroys the purchasing power. So, no matter what happens, people are going to lose a tremendous amount as this banking crisis unfolds.”</p>
<p>Moreover, Schiff recently said the Federal Reserve has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-the-fed-has-lost-inflation-fight-markets-just-havent-figured-that-out-yet/">lost the inflation fight</a> but the markets have not figured that out yet. He stated that the Fed has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-says-the-fed-destroyed-us-banking-system-its-insolvent/">destroyed the banking system</a> and Fed Chair Jerome Powell is &#8220;clearly worried&#8221; about a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-us-dollar-decline-will-be-far-greater-than-yellen-warns-fed-chair-powell-clearly-worried-about-financial-crisis/">financial crisis</a>. He also warned about a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-of-us-dollar-crisis-and-catastrophic-end-national-debt-will-spiral-out-of-control/">U.S. dollar crisis</a> and the national debt spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>Last month, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki similarly cautioned that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-more-banks-are-about-to-fail/">more banks are about to fail</a>, noting that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/">regional banks are being wiped out</a>. In May, the Fed revealed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-reveals-722-banks-reported-unrealized-losses-over-50-of-capital-as-concerns-over-us-banking-crisis-grow/">722 banks</a> reported unrealized losses over 50% of capital.</p>

After more inspections in the past couple of months, the watchdog vowed to continue to take action against operators of unregistered crypto teller machines.</strong></p>
<h2>Financial Watchdog Shuts Down Dozens of Crypto ATMs in the U.K. This Year</h2>
<p>British authorities have inspected 18 more sites believed to be illegally operating automated teller machines (ATMs) supporting cryptocurrencies in the United Kingdom, the country’s financial regulator announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The checks have been carried out in May and June by the FCA, working together with representatives of the South West Regional Organized Crime Unit, Bedfordshire Police, Hertfordshire Police, and the Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p>“This action follows the FCA’s previous inspections of a number of sites across the U.K. including East London, and Leeds, Exeter, Sheffield, and Nottingham that were suspected of hosting unregistered crypto ATMs,” the authority noted.</p>
<p>The joint inspections with other law enforcement agencies are part of the FCA’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-widens-crackdown-on-unauthorized-crypto-atms/">ongoing crackdown</a> on what the agency considers to be an illicit sector. Since the beginning of 2023, the FCA has visited 34 locations and disrupted 26 crypto ATMs “operating unlawfully.”</p>

<h2>FCA Vows to Take More Action Against Unregistered Crypto ATM Operators</h2>
<p>“If you use a crypto ATM in the U.K., you are using a machine that is operating illegally and you may be handing your money over to criminals,” Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>“You will not be protected if something goes wrong, and you could lose your money,” he also warned, explaining that users are unlikely to be able to contact the operator of an ATM and resolve any problems. Smart also insisted:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will continue to warn the public and take appropriate enforcement action against unregistered crypto ATM operators.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FCA reminded that it regularly warns consumers crypto assets are unregulated and high-risk and that crypto exchange providers in the U.K., including ATM operators, are required to register with it and comply with Britain’s money laundering rules.</p>
<p>Crypto ATMs have been playing a role as an entry point to the crypto space but the number of new machines <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/study-6100-crypto-atms-installed-in-2022-figure-3-times-less-than-in-previous-year/">installed</a> in 2022, a troublesome year for the whole industry, was three times smaller than in the previous year, according to a report published in November.</p>
<p>Data released by the <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coin ATM Radar</a> website in April of this year showed that global bitcoin ATM numbers had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-atm-numbers-drop-by-13-91-since-december-2022-over-3600-went-offline-in-march/">dropped</a> by almost 14% since December 2022, with over 3,600 crypto machines going offline in March 2023 alone.</p>

<h2>U.S. Lawmaker Demands Investigation Into Prometheum</h2>
<p>Republican senator <a href="https://twitter.com/TTuberville">Thomas Tuberville</a> from Alabama believes the digital asset firm Prometheum should be investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ). In addition to Tuberville, the Republican lawmakers Mark Alford, Blaine Luetkemeyer, Ralph Norman, Byron Donalds, and Barry Loudermilk have also signed the <a href="https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/DOJ-SEC-Oversight-Letter-re-Prometheum-July-202311.pdf">letter</a>.</p>
<p>“We write to express concern that Prometheum, Inc. (Prometheum) may have provided false testimony to Congress or violated U.S. securities laws,” the letter details.</p>
<p>Senator Tuberville points out that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prometheum-testimony-raises-doubts-crypto-community-questions-credibility-amid-regulatory-clarity-hearing/">Prometheum</a>&#8216;s Co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, stating that the company began developing its technology platform independently from its China-based partners in December 2019. However, audited financial statements and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1718271/000101905621000348/offeringcircular.htm">SEC filings</a> indicate that Prometheum continued to rely on its partnership with Wanxiang and Hashkey, subsidiaries of China-based entities, well into 2021.</p>
<p>The senator emphasizes that the audited financial statements for 2020, included in Prometheum&#8217;s SEC filings, clearly state that the company relies on Wanxiang as its sole project developer. The loss of Wanxiang&#8217;s services could ostensibly have a significant adverse effect on Prometheum&#8217;s ability to develop and maintain its platform, raising questions about the claimed independence from its Chinese partners.</p>
<p>“If Prometheum began developing its own technology platform totally independent of its China-based, CCP-tied partners in December 2019 as Mr. Kaplan attempted to lead Congress to believe in his congressional testimony, why was this not made clear in Prometheum&#8217;s SEC filings?” the letter asks Garland and Gensler.</p>
<p>Senator Tuberville urges Garland and Gensler to conduct a thorough review of Prometheum&#8217;s statements to Congress, its audited financial statements, and SEC filings. The alleged inconsistencies in these documents raise concerns about potential false statements to Congress and securities fraud through misleading SEC filings, the letter discloses.</p>

<p>The senator concludes by highlighting the seriousness of making false statements to Congress, which constitutes a crime, and the implications of submitting false or misleading statements in SEC filings, which constitutes securities fraud. Tuberville insists the conflicting statements made by Prometheum in different forums, combined with its ties to China-based entities with CCP connections, underscore the need for a comprehensive investigation.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and Bitcoin, both groundbreaking technologies in their respective fields, have the potential to transform numerous aspects of our world. One fascinating prospect is their intersection, where <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> can serve as the payment system for AI, introducing fresh levels of efficiency, security, and autonomy to AI operations. Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of Bitmex, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/arthur-hayes-insists-bitcoin-will-be-the-currency-of-artificial-intelligence/">made a prediction</a> four days ago that the dominant cryptocurrency will become the &#x201C;food&#x201D; for AI.</p>
<p>Shortly after the publication of Hayes&#x2019; article, Lightning Labs <a href="https://twitter.com/lightning/status/1676972956193521665">announced</a> the release of new developer tools that integrate with LLMs (Large Language Models) such as Openai&#x2019;s Chatgpt. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/roasbeef/status/1677031256134152192?s=20">tweet</a>, Lightning Labs&#x2019; engineer Olaoluwa Osuntokun shared details about the tools. &#x201C;In 2023, the bots pay you!&#x201D; the developer exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Today we&#x2019;re releasing a new L402 specification, alongside Langchainai powered tools that enable AI Agents to traverse L402 APIs (HTTP 402 pay-per call APIs over Lightning), and also directly hold+manage bitcoin via Openai function calls,&#x201D; Osuntokun added.</p>
<p>The tools essentially merge AI technologies, APIs, and blockchain technology to facilitate transactions over the Lightning Network. Osuntokun further showcased the capabilities of the tool by <a href="https://twitter.com/roasbeef/status/1677037020156399616?s=20">sharing a video demonstration</a> of it collaborating with Openai&#x2019;s Chatgpt-4 to initiate a transaction. In addition, software engineers Osuntokun and Michael Levin authored a blog post explaining the motivation behind the creation of these new Lightning tools.</p>
<h2>LLMs or AI Agents &#x2018;Are Unable to Easily Gain Access to Fiat Systems&#x2019;</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://lightning.engineering/posts/2023-07-05-l402-langchain/">blog post</a>, developers initially incur significant costs when acquiring training GPUs (graphics processing units), and they typically recover these expenses through the convenient but costly means of credit cards. Regrettably, this approach places an additional financial burden on the end user due to the added expenses related to chargebacks and fees associated with fraud. Moreover, the authors at Lightning underscore a fundamental flaw in this business model.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45979.pdf">lack of access</a> to conventional credit card or banking systems creates significant barriers for billions of individuals worldwide who are unable to harness the power of these groundbreaking tools designed to enhance education, productivity, and creativity. &#x201C;Finally, because of these cost scaling issues, the best models end up behind closed source APIs, which significantly harms the accessibility and inclusivity of the latest and greatest LLM models,&#x201D; Osuntokun and Levin opine.</p>

<p>Considerable <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-chatgpt-traffic-fc878c6d">attention</a> has been dedicated to AI systems in 2023, and the integration of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has given rise to fresh ideas and solutions. The developers emphasize that intelligent LLMs or AI agents &#x201C;are unable to easily gain access to fiat systems of payment as they aren&#x2019;t registered &#x2018;entities&#x2019; with any nation.&#x201D; The authors underscore the fact that these agents will still require payment for resources, whether from restricted APIs or paid data sources.</p>
<p>The most recent tools from Lightning Labs and discussions about the two subjects have led <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supporters to <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1677404088408084483?s=20">believe</a> that bitcoin has the potential to function as a worldwide, impartial reserve currency for AI systems. By embracing bitcoin, AI systems can ostensibly overcome a plethora of limitations, as bitcoin is universally recognized and not bound by any specific government or jurisdiction. In theory, the decentralized and worldwide reach of a prominent digital currency holds the promise of significantly enhancing the scalability and effectiveness of AI systems when operating across borders.</p>

The new feature aims to make this sophisticated investment method more accessible for new crypto traders without profound expertise in trading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grid trading is a quantitative strategy that utilizes trading algorithms to automate transactions for users. It involves trading algorithms that place buy and sell orders within a predefined price range at specified time intervals and follow a &#8220;buy low, sell high&#8221; strategy to execute trades. In volatile cryptocurrency markets, grid trading bots help eliminate emotional decision-making and efficiently execute a preplanned strategy, saving time and enhancing effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grid trading strategy involves analyzing historical data to identify </span><a href="https://www.bitget.com/en-GB/earn/smart-trend"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and optimize trading parameters for specific market cycles. By studying price movements and volatility under various conditions, traders can determine the price range and intervals between buys and sells. This strategy relies on patterns that emerge from extensive datasets, providing insights into asset performance at different stages. While grid trading was traditionally accessible to experienced traders, Bitget&#8217;s AI Grid Trading enables beginners to leverage this strategy without requiring extensive expertise in the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitget&#8217;s AI feature offers benefits for both novice and experienced traders. Users can select from a range of AI bots, including &#8220;conservative,&#8221; &#8220;secure,&#8221; and &#8220;aggressive,&#8221; catering to different risk appetites. The conservative algorithms are designed for risk-averse beginners, while the secure algorithms target balanced, risk-neutral investors. The aggressive algorithms aim to maximize returns for experienced and frequent traders. This diversified selection of AI bots provides users with tailored options to suit their individual trading preferences and goals.</span></p>
<p><b><i>“</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new feature aligns with Bitget’s goal of providing tools for users to trade smarter. AI products can make sophisticated strategies more accessible, resulting in more reliable systems and optimized profits,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><b>Gracy Chen, managing director at Bitget. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also added,&#8221;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financial sector has long embraced AI, and the rise of AI-powered products will undoubtedly enable more accessible complex strategies. As a leading crypto exchange, Bitget will introduce AI in a safe manner to help traders generate more robust strategies and maximize their returns.&#8221; </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grid Trading AI feature follows the launch of </span><a href="https://www.bitget.com/blog/articles/bitget-launches-new-martingale-strategy-empowered-by-ai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitget’s Martingale AI </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in June. The solution makes a complicated strategy more intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly. The Martingale strategy involves progressively increasing the investment size after each loss to recover losses and generate profits. </span></p>

So far, it has been more than two years without an altcoin season, and there have been no signals indicating one might emerge.</strong></p>
<h2>Altcoin Season Eludes Cryptocurrency Market for 2 Years</h2>
<p>Recently, social media and cryptocurrency-related forums have been <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=altcoin%20season%20&src=typed_query">abuzz</a> with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14wjmyj/this_is_now_the_longest_streak_without_altcoin/">discussions</a> about an &#x201C;altcoin season&#x201D; and the unprecedented duration without one. Essentially, an altcoin season is a period in the cryptocurrency market when the prices of alternative cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins, surge in comparison to <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> for several weeks or months. The <a href="https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/">Altcoin Season Index</a>, available on blockchaincenter.net, notes that if 75% of the top 50 coins perform better than bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is considered an &#x201C;altcoin season.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The index currently indicates that we are in a &#x201C;bitcoin season,&#x201D; a state that has persisted since at least May 2021. Some market observers believe an altcoin season may have occurred from late 2020 to November 2021. Regardless, it has been roughly two years since the last altcoin season. The most significant altcoin season to date began in the second half of 2017 and ended in the first quarter of 2018. As of now, according to the index, 75% of the top 50 cryptocurrency tokens are underperforming compared to bitcoin.</p>

<p>At press time, the cryptocurrency economy is valued at $1.19 trillion, with bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) accounting for <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">49.9%</a> of that value and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) comprising 19%. <a href="https://cryptobubbles.net">Data</a> from cryptobubbles.net reveals that many altcoins have seen significant gains over the past 24 hours, and the 30-day metrics highlight several leaders. Compound (COMP) has risen 153% in the last month, while bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) has jumped 163% higher against the U.S. dollar. FTX&#x2019;s FTT has increased 77% in 30 days, and PEPE has gained 63%.</p>
<p>Although a significant number of tokens have outperformed <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> over the past month, this has not triggered any signs of an impending altcoin season, where alternative cryptocurrencies would perform better than the market leader. A potential obstacle to an altcoin season is the recent crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other U.S. regulators. To date, the SEC has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/">classified</a> more than two dozen alternative cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities.</p>

<p>The U.S. regulator considers these tokens to be investment contracts that promise future rewards and are centralized by issuance and development activities. However, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has not been classified in this way. It is widely accepted that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is not a security but rather a broadly recognized commodity. Even <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a>, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-attorney-general-files-lawsuit-against-kucoin-and-declares-ethereum-a-security/">labeled</a> a security by New York attorney general Letitia James in a lawsuit against Kucoin.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The petition argues that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, just like LUNA and UST, is a speculative asset that relies on the efforts of third-party developers in order to provide profit to the holders of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>,&#x201D; James said in a court filing in March.</p>

The move saw the cryptocurrency hit a one-month high, following a recent five-day bull run. Solana also rose higher, following a sell-off to start the week.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) rose by as much as 8% earlier in today’s session, hitting a one-month high in the process.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.7033 earlier in the day, MATIC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $0.7473 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As a result of this surge, MATIC hit its highest point since June 9, which is the last time the token broke out of a ceiling at $0.7480.</p>

<p>MATIC bulls were unable to breach this ceiling in today’s session, with the price retreating from an earlier high.</p>
<p>This comes despite the relative strength index (RSI) marginally breaking out of a ceiling at 59.00, with a current reading of 59.31.</p>
<p>In the event the index continues to strengthen, the odds of a breakout above $0.7480 will greatly increase.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>After dropping by nearly 7% to start the week, solana (SOL) bulls moved to buy the dip, with price now closing in on a fresh multi-month high.</p>
<p>SOL/USD jumped to a high of $22.29 earlier in the day, which is less than 24 hours after almost falling below $20.00.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s peak sees the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency $0.20 away from a recent two-month high at $22.49.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, it seems that traders reentered the market after the RSI hit a support level at 65.00</p>
<p>As of writing, price strength is at a reading of 69.05, with the next visible resistance zone at 72.00.</p>
<p>Should today’s momentum extend throughout the week, there is a good chance that solana will climb past $23.00.</p>

<h2>India Snubs Common Currency Idea, Reduces Russian Oil Imports While Increasing U.S. Crude Purchases</h2>
<p>In recent times, a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/google-trends-data-reflects-rising-interest-in-brics-bloc-and-de-dollarization-searches/">great deal of interest</a> is aimed at the BRICS nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. In August, BRICS ministers plan to discuss <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-discuss-expansion-plan-as-membership-interest-grows/">adding new members</a> to the alliance and creating a gold-backed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">common currency</a>. Last week, Rasoul Mousavi, a representative from Iran&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-gold-backed-currency-will-benefit-iran-weaken-us-dollar-iranian-official-says/">told the press</a> that a BRICS currency could benefit Iran and diminish the influence of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa are supporting the creation of a common BRICS currency, but India is not interested, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/world-news/jaishankar-makes-big-comment-on-brics-currency-plans-amid-de-dollarisation-push-watch-101688387595429.html">according</a> to Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India&#8217;s external affairs minister. Jaishankar, in a press conference on July 3, 2023, said India is solely focused on bolstering the rupee, the country&#8217;s native currency. &#8220;On what we will discuss at the BRICS meeting, we&#8217;ll have to see because there are many other issues – but there is no idea of a BRICS currency,&#8221; Jaishankar stated.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s external affairs minister added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currencies will remain a national issue for a long time to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>India&#8217;s GDP has proven resilient amid global economic uncertainty, outpacing other members of the BRICS bloc. Moreover, a recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-poised-to-leapfrog-major-economies-becoming-worlds-second-largest-by-2075-goldman-sachs-report-predicts/">report</a> from Goldman Sachs Research predicts India could become the world&#8217;s second-largest economy by 2075. The Times of India <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/truth-lies-and-politics/bricss-plan-to-float-a-common-currency-indias-reaction-to-it/">reported</a> that India, which has strong ties with the U.S. and Europe, does not want to jeopardize its trade relationships with Western nations by endorsing a “yet-to-be-released BRICS currency.”</p>

<p>Moreover, India has started <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-27/india-is-starting-to-reach-the-limits-of-its-russian-oil-splurge#xj4y7vzkg">buying more</a> oil from the United States and <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/india-ups-crude-oil-imports-from-the-us-as-russian-shipments-stagnate/article67060219.ece#">reducing its purchases</a> of Russian crude, according to data from energy intelligence company Vortexa. In May, Russian crude made up half of India&#8217;s imports. However, in June, daily oil imports from Russia to India fell from 1.96 million barrels to 1.798 million barrels. The Times of India suggests India may be hesitant to invite <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethiopia-joins-egypt-in-seeking-brics-membership/">new members</a> to the BRICS alliance. The newspaper&#8217;s contributor, Dr. Prashant Prabhakar Deshpande, says India will want to establish “well-established criteria for qualification.”</p>
<p>In a noteworthy development, preceding Jaishankar&#8217;s remarks on July 3, president <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bidenomics-agenda-struggles-to-gain-support-as-joe-bidens-approval-ratings-plummet/">Joe Biden</a> of the United States and prime minister Narendra Modi of India emphasized the exceptional partnership between their nations, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/22/joint-statement-from-the-united-states-and-india/">referring</a> to them as two of the “closest partners in the world.”</p>
