<p>Building Blocks 23 will form a day-long event for the foundations of web3 entrepreneurship. Founders and builders will share personal knowledge and experience of the industry&rsquo;s ups and downs. The lessons, mistakes, and success stories of successful web3 builders will be recounted for the benefit of those whose web3 journey has just begun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A series of talks will cover lessons and experiences of building in web3, mastering leading protocols, and staying on course in the face of market turbulence.
