<p>A single person has been traced to be the mastermind behind the launch of 114 questionable memecoins in just two months</p>
ZachXBT Uncovers Memecoin Connection
<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a popular online wallet for storing and managing multiple cryptocurrencies. However, according to the latest report, a MEW user launched 114 memecoins with no real purpose or value. Instead, they were designed to attract investors and generate profit for the wallet's owner. This has raised concerns within the crypto community about the potential for scams and fraud in the industry and the need for greater regulation and oversight.</p>
<p>Blockchain detective ZachXBT and other internet sleuths discovered that only one person was behind 114 meme coin scams. After every rug pull, the funds stolen were deposited in the same wallet address - 0x739c58807B99Cb274f6FD96B10194202b8EEfB47. After tracking all the coins, he uncovered that the scammers successfully collected these cryptos while staying relatively hidden by using multiple alternate wallet addresses and splitting the proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
BSC Criticized For Lack Of Oversight
<p>The memecoins were launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) platform, which has become a popular destination for creating and trading new cryptocurrencies. However, the lack of oversight and regulation on the platform has made it a prime target for fraudulent activities, including the propagation of such memecoin scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report also highlights that the creators of the memecoins did not reveal their identities, which raises suspicions about their intentions and credibility. This lack of transparency is a common tactic scammers use to avoid detection and prosecution.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, the Binance Smart Chain has stated that it is taking steps to improve its security measures and crack down on fraudulent activities. The platform has also encouraged users to exercise caution when investing in new cryptocurrencies and conduct due diligence before making investment decisions.</p>
Experts Call For Regulation
<p>The crypto industry is rife with hacks and attacks, many of which were uncovered by ZachXBT himself. The North Korean Lazarus group has also posed a serious threat to the market as the mastermind behind a series of attacks on crypto companies from the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These reports highlight the need for greater regulation and oversight in the crypto industry. While the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies has many benefits, it also makes it challenging to regulate and monitor the activities of individuals and organizations operating within the industry.</p>
<p>Experts have called for increased collaboration between industry players, regulators, and law enforcement agencies to address these issues and prevent fraud and scams from tarnishing the entire industry's reputation. They also recommend that investors exercise caution and only invest in well-established cryptocurrencies with a proven track record of success.</p>
