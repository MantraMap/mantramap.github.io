			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bears Test 25128 Objective:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 19 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained very weak early in the Asian session as the pair remained at risk after depreciating to the 25234.76 area, its weakest print since mid-June.&nbsp; This fresh multi-month low represented a test of a major downside price objective around the 25128.94 area that is associated with selling pressure that increased around the 31862.21 and 30421.29 levels in July.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Stops were elected below the 27620.46 area during the decline, another downside price objective linked to recent downward pressure around the 30222 and 29665.27 areas.&nbsp; Major Stops were also elected below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in appreciating ranges from the 15460 and 19568.52 levels include the 23661, 22793, and 21725 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of technical resistance and potential selling pressure include the 26798, 27139, 27728, 27766, 28316, 28548, 29154, 29330, and 30443 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 28941.97 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 27930.41.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink (LINK), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Everlodge (ELDG) &ndash; three coins that could bring unique value to your investment portfolio. When it comes to building a portfolio, the key is diversity. Including a mix of established players and promising newcomers can help mitigate risks and maximize potential gains. Due to these reasons, let's explore all three of them in greater detail. </p>
Summary
- Chainlink integrates with Coinbase&rsquo;s Base 
- Shiba Inu one of the top weekly gainers 
- Everlodge expected to rally by 30x
<p>Join Everlodge Presale</p>
Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Solution
<p>Chainlink (LINK) has solidified its position as a cornerstone in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a bridge between smart contracts and real-world data, Chainlink's decentralized oracle network ensures blockchain applications access to accurate information.</p>
<p>In recent Chainlink news, it announced that it merged with Coinbase's Base. As a result, the Chainlink crypto interest rose. In fact, its value jumped by 6.3% over the past month alone. </p>
<p>Currently, Chainlink is trading hands at $7.28 with a market cap of $3.9B. However, due to its technical indicators showing green, market analysts remain bullish about it. Therefore, they forecast a $9.12 price for Chainlink by the end of 2023. </p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB): Expected To Soar 
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the scene as a community-driven experiment inspired by the success of meme coins like Dogecoin. While often associated with its meme status, Shiba Inu aims to create a decentralized ecosystem that includes tokens like BONE. </p>
<p>The Shiba Inu price has increased 13.2% over the previous week, ranking among the top 20 altcoins by total market capitalization. Not only that, Shiba Inu is one of the best-performing currencies overall. The Shiba Inu crypto has a value of $0.00001036 with a market cap of $6.1B. </p>
<p>Most importantly, the Shiba Inu technical analysis shows bullish signs. To clarify, all its moving averages and technical indicators are showing strong buy signals. As a result, experts in the field predict Shiba Inu surging to $0.00001078 soon..</p>
Everlodge (ELDG): Brings Something Unique to the Real Estate Market
<p>Everlodge (ELDG) aims to democratize real estate investment by tokenizing properties and offering fractional ownership through blockchain technology. This approach allows investors to purchase fractions of high-value properties, such as luxury villas, vacation homes, and hotels, for $100. Therefore, Everlodge enables more individuals to participate in real estate investment.</p>
<p>One of the most innovative aspects of Everlodge is its integration of NFTs into the real estate market. Each property is minted as an NFT, representing ownership, and stored securely on the blockchain. This provides several benefits, including increased transparency, immutability of ownership records, and removing the need for intermediaries.</p>
<p>At the core of this platform lies the ELDG native token. ELDG holders are rewarded with discounts on property purchases, reduced trading fees, and even free nightly stays in the properties within the Everlodge ecosystem. This rewards program incentivizes participation and fosters a vibrant and engaged community of investors.</p>
<p>One ELDG token costs only $0.01. But keep in mind that it is in Stage 1 of its presale. In other words, it will rise as it advances. And with Stage 2 coming this month, a 20% surge will also occur. Everlodge stands out from Chainlink and Shiba Inu thanks to its low market cap, which means it will surge faster. Consequently, experts foresee a 30x growth for it on launch day. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea will be sunsetting its on-chain royalty enforcement tool, Operator Filter.&nbsp;</p>
Operator Filter Falls Short Of Expectations
<p>On Thursday, OpenSea announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it would be removing the Operator Filter tool from its platform. The tool was introduced on the platform back in November 2022 to allow creators to blacklist NFT marketplaces that didn't adhere to royalty enforcement standards. However, according to founder and CEO Devin Finzer, the tool's effectiveness fell short of expectations.</p>
<p>Starting August 31, the Operator Filter will cease to block any marketplaces. For existing collections on non-Ethereum blockchains and those currently using the tool, creator fees will remain enforced until February 29, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finzer clarified,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To be clear, creator fees aren&rsquo;t going away &mdash; simply the ineffective, unilateral enforcement of them."</p>

Operator Filter Rendered Useless
<p>The Operator Filter, touted as a "simple code snippet," aimed to limit NFT sales exclusively to marketplaces that upheld creator fees. Yet, its impact didn't align with the aspirations of its creators, as Finzer pointed out that the NFT ecosystem's support for the tool was insufficient.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain NFT marketplaces like Blur, Dew, and LooksRare managed to bypass the filter by integrating Seaport Protocol, which helped them circumvent OpenSea's blacklist and thus avoid creator fees.</p>
Creator Concerns and Redirecting Efforts
<p>Creators themselves expressed concerns about the Operator Filter infringing upon their control over where their collections were sold.</p>
<p>He said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have heard from some creators that the Operator Filter limits their sense of control over where their collections are sold, and at the same time may collide with a collector&rsquo;s expectation of full ownership&hellip;The Operator Filter&rsquo;s restrictions come at the expense of decentralized ownership.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finzer also emphasized that while creator fees play a role in specific business models, they constitute only one among many revenue streams available to creators. OpenSea is redirecting its efforts toward enabling new use cases, such as digital and physical redeemables, and promoting these use cases more effectively in primary and secondary experiences.</p>
Mixed Reactions from the NFT Community
<p>This decision from OpenSea holds implications for NFT artists seeking passive income. Some creators expressed disappointment, suggesting that collectors should support them on platforms that enforce royalties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a Reddit avatar artist posited that the move might have been prudent, as the existing business model appeared to profit excessively from hype trading.</p>
<p>OpenSea's cessation of the Operator Filter reflects a shift in approach to NFT market dynamics. While the decision might disappoint some in the NFT community, the move aims to strike a balance between creator autonomy and the evolving landscape of NFT technology applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Trading-focused blockchain Sei&rsquo;s latest SEI token launch did not go over as well as expected after being plagued with delays and problems with the token giveaway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
SEI Token Drama
<p>The newly launched Sei blockchain Sei generated quite a buzz in the crypto space as its SEI token hit the market with a resounding start, quickly amassing a market capitalization of over $400 million within the first day of trading. Despite the promising start, a wave of discontent emerged on social media platforms regarding the much-anticipated airdrop of SEI tokens to early users and community members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airdrops have become a common tactic for attracting users and bootstrapping liquidity, but they often encounter operational and legal complications. The SEI airdrop was no exception, facing issues such as difficulties in claiming tokens and uncertainties surrounding eligibility criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sei Labs intended to incentivize users from established platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain to migrate by offering SEI tokens upon "bridging" assets.</p>
Airdrop Discontent
<p>Trading activity for SEI surged, with a staggering $1.6 billion in trading volume over the next 24 hours. Leading exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken all joined the fray, listing SEI in conjunction with the blockchain's debut.</p>
<p>The situation led to confusion and frustration, as the initial announcement about the airdrop's launch did not align with the actual claim process. Early SEI adopters experienced delays, with some users unable to claim the promised tokens at the network's launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company behind the blockchain, Sei Labs, attempted to clarify the situation through an X post, mentioning that "airdrop rewards will be claimable following an initial warmup period," yet failing to provide a specific timeline. Only after the airdrop claim process had already been criticized by some as a "fiasco" did the functionality eventually open to users, underscoring the complexities inherent in crypto airdrops.</p>
Airdrop Challenges
<p>Sei's mainnet launch coincided with the announcement of an airdrop of the SEI token. In response to airdrop-related concerns, a spokesperson from the Sei Foundation explained that the airdrop was never officially tied to the mainnet launch and would be executed according to the Foundation's timeline.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trading-focused blockchain Sei&rsquo;s latest SEI token launch did not go over as well as expected after being plagued with delays and problems with the token giveaway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
SEI Token Drama
<p>The newly launched Sei blockchain Sei generated quite a buzz in the crypto space as its SEI token hit the market with a resounding start, quickly amassing a market capitalization of over $400 million within the first day of trading. Despite the promising start, a wave of discontent emerged on social media platforms regarding the much-anticipated airdrop of SEI tokens to early users and community members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airdrops have become a common tactic for attracting users and bootstrapping liquidity, but they often encounter operational and legal complications. The SEI airdrop was no exception, facing issues such as difficulties in claiming tokens and uncertainties surrounding eligibility criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sei Labs intended to incentivize users from established platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain to migrate by offering SEI tokens upon "bridging" assets.</p>
Airdrop Discontent
<p>Trading activity for SEI surged, with a staggering $1.6 billion in trading volume over the next 24 hours. Leading exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken all joined the fray, listing SEI in conjunction with the blockchain's debut.</p>
<p>The situation led to confusion and frustration, as the initial announcement about the airdrop's launch did not align with the actual claim process. Early SEI adopters experienced delays, with some users unable to claim the promised tokens at the network's launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company behind the blockchain, Sei Labs, attempted to clarify the situation through an X post, mentioning that "airdrop rewards will be claimable following an initial warmup period," yet failing to provide a specific timeline. Only after the airdrop claim process had already been criticized by some as a "fiasco" did the functionality eventually open to users, underscoring the complexities inherent in crypto airdrops.</p>
Airdrop Challenges
<p>Sei's mainnet launch coincided with the announcement of an airdrop of the SEI token. In response to airdrop-related concerns, a spokesperson from the Sei Foundation explained that the airdrop was never officially tied to the mainnet launch and would be executed according to the Foundation's timeline. Despite community frustration, the Foundation encouraged patience and emphasized the need for partners and validators to ensure a smooth experience for Sei's mainnet beta launch.</p>
Foundation's Response
<p>The Sei Foundation addressed issues with its official Discord server, limiting channels to combat spam and fraudulent links arising from the excitement around the mainnet beta launch. Sei Labs allocated 40% of the circulating SEI supply to its team and private investors, while 48% is designated for ecosystem reserves, including the airdrop and other incentives. The remainder of the supply is divided between the SEI Foundation (9%) and Binance launchpool incentives (3%).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After a heavy crash on Thursday bitcoin bulls are still struggling to stop the king of the cryptocurrencies from falling further. Is this it, or is there more to go?</p>
A precipitous drop
<p>A palpable nervousness had beset the crypto market over the previous week. All eyes were on bitcoin as it continued to traverse down in its bull flag. Given the pattern, many were expecting the apex crypto to finally break out to the upside and confirm the bull market.</p>
<p>However, bears had other ideas.</p>
<p>Things really started getting serious on Thursday evening as bitcoin suddenly painted an hourly red candle to the downside, of a whopping 9.6%.</p>
<p>This reached the $25,000 price level where bulls were waiting in numbers to buy the asset back up. A wick back to $26,250 resulted - all in the space of the same hourly candle.</p>
A healthy correction
<p>Around 12 hours later and bitcoin is moving sideways, with the market waiting for the next direction to become apparent. Bitcoin is currently at a reasonable area of support at $26,500, which is just above the 0.786 Fibonacci level. The next very strong support below is at $24,250.</p>
<p>The upwards trendline has been broken and so has the 200-day moving average, both incredibly important supports if bitcoin is to maintain its bull momentum. However, the weekly candle does not close for another couple of days or so, giving bulls a chance to at least potentially regain the 200-day MA at $27,250.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, it does look like bitcoin just came to the bottom of a range it entered back in March of this year, with the bottom of the range at $25,000 and the top at $31,000.</p>
<p>So far, this looks like a healthy correction, given the incredible thrust upwards since the beginning of this year. Even if bitcoin were to go lower, $25,000 is a huge platform to sustain the price.&nbsp;</p>
Bull market still intact
<p>Some investors may have been cursing their luck at missing the giant step up out of the bear market. This correction, or even if bitcoin were to go back down to $25,000, would be great areas to start building a position.</p>
<p>If investors are still nervous, they only need to look at the other available asset options, all of which are tied into the monetary system. Even gold and silver are manipulated by the paper futures market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin may have corrected, but there is certainly no reason for panic. Phase 1 of the bull market is still very much intact, and phase 2 can potentially begin next year when bitcoin gets above the $31,000 level.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Securities Commission (SEC) is all set to greenlight the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ether (ETH) futures in a big win for the crypto space.</p>
<p>Nearly a dozen companies have expressed interest and filed applications with the SEC to launch ETFs.</p>
Big Win For Crypto
<p>According to sources familiar with the matter, the regulator will not block or oppose products. This comes as a major relief to companies who have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Bitwise, Roundhill, ProShares, and Volatility Shares. However, it is still unclear which funds would receive the nod from the SEC. Officials and sources close to the matter have stated that approvals could come as early as October, but the SEC has yet to comment on the matter. Ether (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and is the world&rsquo;s second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin.</p>
The SEC&rsquo;s Changing Stance
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly blocked previous attempts at an ETF based directly on a cryptocurrency. However, in late 2021, the regulator began permitting trading in a fund that involved Bitcoin futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Since then, speculation has been growing that the Securities and Exchange Commission would allow a product with Ether futures which would also be traded on the exchange.</p>
<p>However, despite the buzz and excitement, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dragged its feet when it comes to approvals for a product that involves derivatives in Ether. Data from CoinGecko shows that ETH commands a market value of just under $200 billion, second only to Bitcoin, which has a market value of nearly $700 billion.</p>
Hope For Bitcoin ETFs?
<p>However, the Securities and Exchange Commission is still pushing back against Bitcoin-based ETFs and is locked in a tense standoff with the crypto industry on the matter. Grayscale Investments has already challenged the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s rejection of its application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. A panel of US federal appellate court judges will be deciding on the matter soon.</p>
<p>On its part, the Securities and Exchange Commission has argued that the crypto space is fraught with several hazards. The regulator has repeatedly expressed concerns about price manipulation and insufficient liquidity when it comes to crypto. The regulator has also flagged Bitcoin&rsquo;s volatility as a threat, especially to newer investors. However, several firms, including BlackRock, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list ETFs based on Bitcoin. BlackRock&rsquo;s filing had a considerable impact on the market, pushing the price of Bitcoin above $31,000. However, since then, the price has hovered around the $29,000 mark.</p>
Valkyrie&rsquo;s ETF Filing
<p>Asset management firm Valkyrie has also submitted an application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for an Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund. The application signals the asset manager&rsquo;s intention to move beyond just offering Bitcoin futures ETFs. Valkyrie had filed the application on the 16th of August. The application stated that the ETF would not directly invest in ETH, purchasing ETH futures contracts instead.</p>
<p>The application also outlines a specific limit on the ETF&rsquo;s investment in ETH futures contracts. As per the application, the investments are capped at 8000 contracts per month. This has been done to comply with position limits set by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. If the Securities and Exchange Commission approves the application, investors will be able to speculate on ETH&rsquo;s future price movements via the ETF. Valkyrie also plans to invest in cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities. These include government-issued bonds, bills, notes, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.</p>
<p>Valkyrie is one of several asset managers looking for approval for an Ether futures ETF. Others include VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, Volatility Shares, and Round Hill Capital.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX has reportedly reduced the value of its Bitcoin by a whopping $373 million and has potentially liquidated all of its holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elon Musk-led technology firm had announced in 2021 that it held some Bitcoin. Accounting rules state that once written down, the value cannot be adjusted upwards.&nbsp;</p>
Uncertainty Around Bitcoin Holdings&nbsp;
<p>According to a report published on the 17th of August, the Wall Street Journal stated that SpaceX had recorded $373 million worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet in 2021 and 2022. It has now reportedly sold the cryptocurrency in question. However, it is still not clear if the company has sold its entire $373 million stash. The Wall Street Journal stated in its report,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SpaceX wrote down the value of bitcoin it owns by a total of $373 million last year and in 2021 and has sold the cryptocurrency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The outlet reportedly viewed financial documents related to the firm&rsquo;s finances, showing expenses of around $5.2 billion for 2022. The documents also showed expenses of around $5.2 billion towards acquiring property and equipment and towards research and developmental costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Big Four Accounting Firm Deloitte, Bitcoin is typically considered an &ldquo;indefinite-lived intangible asset.&rdquo; It further adds that companies should account for Bitcoin at cost and then make adjustments should the price of the asset experience a notable decrease. If the value of Bitcoin declines, companies must declare a write-down in its books, which is also referred to as impairment charges. However, the asset&rsquo;s value cannot be written up after recording a decrease. This applies to all subsequent Bitcoin price increases or rebounds.</p>
Tesla&rsquo;s Revision Of Bitcoin Holdings&nbsp;
<p>Elon Musk had publicly announced that SpaceX had acquired crypto, Bitcoin in particular, in 2021. This announcement came after a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Tesla, another of Musk&rsquo;s companies, was planning to purchase $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The announcement by Tesla had played a crucial role in Bitcoin hitting a then-all-time high price of $43,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, according to the company&rsquo;s second-quarter earnings report for 2023, Tesla had sold all except for $184 million worth of its Bitcoin holdings. Tesla confirmed that it had liquidated over 30,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2022, netting around $936 million. This figure represented around 75% of Tesla&rsquo;s original $1.5 billion worth of BTC holdings. However, since then, Tesla has held on to its remaining Bitcoin reserves, with the company continuing to do so in the second quarter of 2023 as well. This means the company has not purchased or sold Bitcoin for the fourth consecutive quarter, with the value of its assets holding steady at $185 million.&nbsp;</p>
Musk and Crypto&nbsp;
<p>Elon Musk is one of the richest individuals in the world and has often commented on the crypto space and cryptocurrencies. Musk seems particularly fond of Dogecoin (DOGE) and had briefly changed Twitter&rsquo;s iconic blue bird logo to the Shiba Inu of Dogecoin. Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, later rebranding the company to X, and has suggested that the platform could offer an entire financial world to users, including payment and banking services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Musk and his companies may hold a considerable amount of Bitcoin, he has often reaffirmed that his favorite crypto remains Dogecoin. Musk has not given any reason for his admiration for Dogecoin, simply stating that &ldquo;it has the best humor, and it has dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not advising anyone to buy crypto or bet the farm on Dogecoin or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX has reportedly reduced the value of its Bitcoin by a whopping $373 million and has potentially liquidated all of its holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elon Musk-led technology firm had announced in 2021 that it held some Bitcoin. Accounting rules state that once written down, the value cannot be adjusted upwards.&nbsp;</p>
Uncertainty Around Bitcoin Holdings&nbsp;
<p>According to a report published on the 17th of August, the Wall Street Journal stated that SpaceX had recorded $373 million worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet in 2021 and 2022. It has now reportedly sold the cryptocurrency in question. However, it is still not clear if the company has sold its entire $373 million stash. The Wall Street Journal stated in its report,&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The National Agency for Prospective Projects in Uzbekistan has granted two banks in the country to issue crypto cards. </p>
<p>Two banks in the Central Asia nation of Uzbekistan have obtained permission from the National Agency for Prospective Projects (NAPP) to issue crypto cards.</p>
Private Banks to Issue Crypto Cards Powered by Mastercard
<p>The NAPP reported on August 14 that it granted approval to two private banks in Uzbekistan &ndash; Kapital Bank and Ravnaq Bank &ndash; to issue cryptocurrency cards and take part in the NAPP&rsquo;s digital sandbox of crypto regulation. The announcement reported Ravnaq Bank had just received approval, but Kapital had already received its approval in May.</p>
<p>The two private Uzbeki banks will issue UzNEX cards and will be supported by payment giants Mastercard. The UzNEX cards will integrate a bank account with access to a crypto exchange and automated exchange mechanism, Cointelegraph reports.</p>
<p>Kapital Bank and Ravnaq Bank are two of the three registered participants in the Uzbeki national sandbox, the NAPP reports. The third participant is &ldquo;UZINFOCOM,&rdquo; a &ldquo;single integrator for the creation and support of state information systems,&rdquo; which will implement &ldquo;NFT certificates based on distributed data registry technology (&ldquo;blockchain&rdquo;) for names in the &ldquo;.UZ&rdquo; domain zone.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The deadline for final customer rollouts of both institutions&rsquo; cards expires in December 2023.</p>
Uzbekistan Restricts Provision of Crypto Services to Licensed Firms
<p>The government of the Republic of Uzbekistan initially granted licenses to local crypto firms in November 2022, according to the NAPP. But from 2023, it has restricted crypto service provision to licensed crypto firms.</p>
<p>Before providing clarity regarding crypto service provision, the Uzbeki government restricted access to several international cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, and the now-collapsed FTX, after accusing them of conducting unlicensed activities.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan introduced its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in early 2022 by presidential decree and launched the NAPP to oversee the industry.</p>
<p>The government of Uzbekistan started its crackdown on the crypto industry in October 2021 after it identified over half a dozen crypto exchanges operating illegally.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Pushing the possibility of artificial intelligence (AI), tools like Google Bard are now being used for market analysis and predictions. With very high accuracy, these tools are growing in relevancy. Today, Google Bard has stirred excitement in the crypto space, after bullish predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB), ApeCoin (APE), and Everlodge (ELDG).</p>
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Summary
● Shiba Inu is forming a golden cross and can rally by as much as 50%
● With an expansion of the APE ecosystem, the price of ApeCoin could rally to $2.5
● Experts predict up to 20x rally as Everlodge allows everyone to invest in real estate
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts a Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rally
<p class="s5">Over the last eight weeks, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been steadily increasing, finally reclaiming the $0.00001000 support last week. Google Bard has predicted that the rally for the Shiba Inu coin will continue, citing three major reasons.</p>
<p class="s5">The first reason according to Bard is the launch of Shibarium. The layer 2 network is set to launch this week and add more utility to Shiba Inu. Next, Google Bard highlights the increasing Shiba Inu burn. By reducing the number of SHIB, it predicts an increase in the Shiba Inu price.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, SHIB is approaching a golden cross after printing six consecutive weeks of bullish candles. If this holds up, Google Bard has predicted that the price of Shiba Inu could rally by 50% and trade as high as $0.00001510.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an ApeCoin (APE) Rally
<p class="s5">The AI chatbot has highlighted several reasons why the ApeCoin price could increase in the coming days. According to the AI chatbot, ApeCoin (APE) first is part of the biggest non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, ensuring its success.</p>
<p class="s5">Also, the ecosystem is about to witness a significant expansion, which could also help the Apecoin value increase. Lastly, APE has been decoupling from the price of Bitcoin, which hints at a major price outbreak.</p>
<p class="s5">At the time of this writing, the price of Apecoin stands at $2.01. With the current projections, ApeCoin could reach highs of $2.5 by the end of August.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an Everlodge (ELDG) Rally
<p class="s5">Everlodge (ELDG) is another project that has attracted strong bullish predictions from Google Bard. The project is disrupting the timeshare sector by introducing a hybrid property co-ownership model, allowing millions of new investors to participate with as little as $100.</p>
<p class="s5">Google Bard is bullish about Everlodge as the project debuts as a one-of-a-kind initiative in the $280 trillion global real estate industry. Also, the project&rsquo;s partnerships with well-known hotel brands and luxury real estate developers would drive the price higher.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, Everlodge's growth will be ensured by the project's broad ecosystem and customer-friendly benefits. At the time of this writing, Everlodge is in its beta presale stage and sells for $0.01.</p>
<p class="s5">Based on Google Bard&rsquo;s predictions, investors can expect a 20x price surge for Everloge in 2023 as the token has been given a yearly high of $0.20 per token.</p>

<p class="s5">Google Bard is bullish about Everlodge as the project debuts as a one-of-a-kind initiative in the $280 trillion global real estate industry. Also, the project&rsquo;s partnerships with well-known hotel brands and luxury real estate developers would drive the price higher.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, Everlodge's growth will be ensured by the project's broad ecosystem and customer-friendly benefits. At the time of this writing, Everlodge is in its beta presale stage and sells for $0.01.</p>
<p class="s5">Based on Google Bard&rsquo;s predictions, investors can expect a 20x price surge for Everloge in 2023 as the token has been given a yearly high of $0.20 per token.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Visa announced its trial of Ethereum (ETH) gas payments via cards, marking a significant milestone toward mainstream crypto adoption. Additionally, the popularity of projects like Pomerdoge (POMD) and its presale has further illustrated the appeal of innovative crypto projects. Today, we will take a closer look at both of these developments. </p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Price Rises After Visa Announcement 
<p>The global payment company Visa has been developing an experimental method that enables on-chain Ethereum (ETH) gas prices to be paid using credit cards. The fintech startup claims that the testing for this solution is now complete, allowing customers to use credit or debit cards to pay the gas cost with fiat on Ethereum directly. </p>
<p>The ease of use and convenience offered by this approach has the potential to make Ethereum transactions more accessible to a broader audience. As a result, the Ethereum price soared by 1.2% over the past seven days.</p>
<p>This bullish trend has continued as the Ethereum value now sits at $1,849.67 with a market cap of $222B, a rise of 0.18% overnight. Furthermore, the technical analysis of Ethereum paints a bullish picture. In other words, its moving averages and technical indicators show buy signals. Therefore, experts forecast a jump to $2,335.71 by December 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Stellar Presale Performance
<p>While traditional financial players are making strides in crypto adoption with Ethereum, innovative blockchain projects are also making waves. Pomerdoge (POMD), an exciting play-to-earn gaming project, has captured mass appeal with its presale, providing early birds with a 14% ROI.</p>
Exploring The Pomerdoge (POMD) Success
<p>At the heart of Pomerdoge is the opportunity to build and nurture your Pomer character. As you progress through the game, your Pomer character evolves and grows to elite levels, reflecting your skill and dedication. To clarify, this unique feature adds an element of personalization and ownership that resonates with the core principles of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pomerdoge 7,777 NFT collection is another rare and exciting component. Each NFT within this limited edition collection holds the promise of something extraordinary, but the full extent of its benefits remains tantalizingly undisclosed until closer to the launch. What we do know is that only POMD holders will gain access to it, and each NFT will be worth 0.2 ETH.</p>
The Allure of POMD Tokens
<p>POMD tokens fuel the play-to-earn mechanics, allowing players to engage with the game and reap the rewards. Currently, the POMD token is valued at just $0.008 as it is in Phase One of its presale. However, millions of tokens have been sold already, so demand is high. In fact, some experts even foresee a 20x surge for it before its presale concludes.</p>
<p>Considering its low market cap of $14M and ties to an online game industry with 3B players, Pomerdoge could see the same growth as Ethereum did. If you wish to purchase this token and participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000 - sign up below. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, three cryptocurrencies have been catching the eye of traders - Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Everlodge (ELDG). While the crypto market is a dynamic and ever-expanding landscape, these cryptocurrencies stand out with their unique features and potential for substantial growth. Let&rsquo;s examine these three projects further and find out what makes them so appealing. </p>
Summary
- Stellar partners up with Bitso, causing a price increase
- Dogecoin shows green monthly charts
- Everlodge to bring outstanding returns for early buyers
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Stellar (XLM): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments
<p>Stellar (XLM) is hailed as one of the frontrunners in the blockchain industry when it comes to facilitating cross-border transactions. Designed to bridge traditional financial systems with decentralized networks, Stellar&rsquo;s mission is to make money more fluid and accessible globally. </p>
<p>Additionally, Stellar&rsquo;s partnerships with established financial institutions bolster its credibility.</p>
<p>Recently, Bitso announced its partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation. This partnership aims to improve communication between the world stage and the Latin American crypto ecosystem. As a result, interest in the Stellar crypto rose as its trading volume jumped by 3% overnight, reaching $75,597,416. </p>
<p>Currently, one Stellar token costs $0.1339. In the past week, it achieved a peak of $0.1450. But,the technical indicators for Stellar are all showing strong buy signals. Therefore, experts remain bullish about it. Consequently, they predict a jump to $0.17 for Stellar by December 2023. </p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): From Meme to Market Resilience
<p>The Dogecoin (DOGE) journey from being a playful meme to a resilient cryptocurrency is a testament to its enduring popularity. Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has carved out a significant place in the crypto market. Consequently, gaining attention from high-profile individuals and capturing the mainstream spotlight.</p>
<p>This attention was displayed on the Dogecoin price charts as well. Most notably, the Dogecoin value soared by 4% in the past month alone. Moreover, its trading volume surged by 11.11% overnight, jumping to $318,640,213. One Dogecoin costs $0.0737 with a market cap of $10.3B. </p>
<p>While its price may experience fluctuations, its strong community engagement and potential for broader adoption continue to make it an attractive choice for investors. Due to all these reasons, bullish experts predict Dogecoin skyrocketing to $0.098 by this year&rsquo;s end. </p>
Everlodge (ELDG): Transforming Real Estate Investment
<p>While Stellar and Dogecoin are tokens worth watching, one project may outshine them - Everlodge (ELDG). With a predicted 20% pump coming in August, this upcoming property marketplace is breaking new ground by merging real estate and blockchain technology through fractional ownership and NFTs.</p>
<p>This innovative approach allows investors to gain exposure to many real estate assets that were previously out of reach. In other words, you can become a fractional owner of a luxurious home on the blockchain for prices as low as $100. Everlodge accomplishes this by minting NFTs representing high-end villas, homes, and properties and then fractionalizing them. </p>
<p>Due to this investment method, Everlodge provides greater property ownership transparency, security, and immutability. Not only that, NFTs enable unique and customizable ownership experiences, as owners can trade their NFTs on Everlodge&rsquo;s secondary marketplace or any third-party ERC20-compatible marketplace.</p>
<p>Holding the ELDG native token is crucial to obtaining discounts on trading fees, free nightly stays in properties, or staking rewards. One token costs only $0.01 since it is in Stage 1 of its presale. What separates ELDG from Stellar and Dogecoin is its low market cap, which means it can surge much faster. Thus, analysts forecast a 280% rise before its presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this market analysis, we'll delve into the movements of three intriguing cryptocurrencies: XRP (XRP), Tron (TRX), and Pomerdoge (POMD). Market analysis is important since trends can shift daily in the cryptocurrency market. Thus, traders and enthusiasts alike must keep a keen eye on the performance of various tokens.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
XRP (XRP): Navigating the Waves
<p>XRP (XRP) has been navigating waves in the market. Recent weeks have seen the XRP price experiencing turbulence, with a 10.8% decline over the past 14 days. </p>
<p>However, XRP has shown green charts again as it trades hands at $0.6306 with a market cap of $33.2B, up 0.70% overnight. This came as a result of the recent XRP listing on Gemini. </p>
<p>Despite this minuscule rise, the XRP coin trading volume has plummeted by 40.78% daily, sinking to $1,022,725,535. Moreover, its moving averages and technical indicators show strong sell signals. Therefore, many experts foresee a short-term price drop for XRP, prompting buyers to sidestep this token.</p>
Tron (TRX): Showing Increased Volatility
<p>Tron (TRX) has been facing challenges recently. In fact, over the past two weeks, the Tron price has dropped by 7.2%. Since it was rejected by the range high on July 22, the Tron coin value has been fluctuating between $0.070 and $0.088.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tron recently breached a short-term ascending support line, further indicating the possibility of a negative trend. Tron has a value of $0.07725 with a market cap of $6.9B, up 0.39% in the past day alone. </p>
<p>But, the trading volume of Tron has taken a 10.41% dip during that time, sinking to $154,358,626. Its technical indicators also paint a bearish outlook as they are all in the red. Thus, market analysts foresee a drop to its support level of $0.066 for Tron soon. </p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Unleashing Gaming Potential
<p>Amid XRP's and Tron's ups and downs, a new player has emerged on the scene with an intriguing ecosystem - Pomerdoge (POMD). This cryptocurrency introduces a gaming-focused approach, aiming to connect players globally through a play-to-earn model. In fact, with over 3B individuals playing online games, Pomerdoge taps into a flourishing market.</p>
Closer Look at the Pomergame
<p>The main appeal for gamers will lie in the Pomergame - a unique P2E crypto game where users can earn rewards just by playing it. Not only that, the Pomerplace marketplace is another exciting component of Pomerdoge. This innovative platform is a bustling hub where players gather to engage in many activities.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Pomerplace is a marketplace that opens doors to a universe of possibilities. Here, you can buy, sell, and trade the valuable items you've skillfully collected throughout your Pomerdoge journey, adding a tangible dimension to your virtual conquests.</p>
What Makes the POMD Native Token So Alluring?
<p>Buyers are flooding the Pomerdoge presale looking to obtain the POMD native token for an affordable price. One POMD token is worth $0.008, and those who bought it early enjoy a 14% ROI. Also, experts have taken notice of POMD's $14M market cap. In other words, when compared to XRP and Tron, POMD will skyrocket much quicker.</p>
<p>Those who purchase it now will gain access to an exclusive 7,777 NFT collection created by Pomerdoge. Each NFT will cost 0.2 ETH and provide holders with unique perks. In addition, early birds will also participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000. Therefore, do not miss out on this potential blue-chip token projected to surge by 20x before its presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University of California Berkeley&rsquo;s SETI@Home project is no longer allowing new users to participate in its ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, meaning it&rsquo;s no longer able to provide a passive income stream for those who&rsquo;re willing to leave their computer on 24/7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SETI@Home project launched way back in 1999, inviting users to download a special software program that enabled them to donate their excess computing power to the initiative, which is looking for signs of alien life elsewhere in the cosmic void. But much to people&rsquo;s disappointment, scientists announced in 2021 that they&rsquo;re winding down the project and no longer require contributions from the general public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the announcement was a major disappointment for participants, the good news is that there are still many other distributed computing projects that allow users to make money by renting out their idle storage space or processing power.&nbsp;</p>
What is Distributed Computing?
<p>It might sound incredibly technical, but the concept of distributed computing is actually a very simple one. It refers to a process where the combined resources of multiple, distributed computers are aggregated together, providing powerful compute or storage resources for heavy-duty projects. In some ways it can be likened to Airbnb, but instead of renting out your spare room or vacation home, you simply rent out your unused computing resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To participate, you&rsquo;ll need to download and install the required application or plugin for whatever project it is you want to contribute to. Then it&rsquo;ll run in the background, allowing your computer&rsquo;s excess resources to be used by the organization concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Where Can I Participate?
<p>There are dozens of interesting projects looking to borrow people&rsquo;s excess computing capacity in support of various use cases:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Spacemesh
<p>Mining cryptocurrency is one of the most obvious ideas for utilizing your spare capacity that comes to mind, but it&rsquo;s important to choose a suitable network. While it was possible to mine Bitcoin from a PC back in the early days, its cryptographic algorithms have become so complex and its mining ecosystem so competitive that such limited hardware simply won&rsquo;t do any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter Spacemesh, an alternative cryptocurrency network that&rsquo;s designed to serve the average joe who wants to mine a little crypto on his or her computer at home. Unlike Bitcoin&rsquo;s proof-of-work consensus algorithm, Spacemesh uses a novel proof-of-space time consensus mechanism that is much less energy-intensive. It also employs a unique &ldquo;race-free approach&rdquo; that disincentivizes the use of massive amounts of hardware, ensuring everyone can participate and earn a passive income on their personal Mac or PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s required to start mining with Spacemesh is an Intel or AMD CPU with at least 1GB of RAM, and an always-on, unmetered internet connection with a minimum of 5 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin, where the CPU is the main factor for miners, Spacemesh relies on disk storage resources, which do not use energy when they&rsquo;re idle, resulting in much lower costs. The protocol is centered on fairness, and ensures all miners are rewarded for their contributions at every EPOCH, which currently concludes every two weeks, with their exact reward based on how much storage space they commit in proportion to the network size. In addition, the protocol prevents whales from joining the system with massive storage resources &ndash; in such a case, they would face much higher overhead costs, eliminating any profit gains. In this way, Spacemesh ensures its network remains highly decentralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
HyperCycle&nbsp;
<p>As an alternative, PC and laptop owners can opt to join the HyperCycle network, which is a Layer-0 blockchain that&rsquo;s building an artificial general intelligence network. The idea with this is to promote cooperation between AI agents by establishing a network of nodes that collaborate with one another to solve complex problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cooperative AI sees distributed computers aggregate their compute resources to create a &ldquo;global brain&rdquo;, kind of like a distributed supercomputer. AI systems can tap into this network and use its combined power to perform computing tasks that would normally be performed by sophisticated server networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users are required to purchase an individual software node license to participate in HyperCycle&rsquo;s network and deposit a minimum of 1,024 HYPC tokens. That might sound expensive, but HyperCycle insists it&rsquo;s a small price to pay to democratize access to advanced AI computation and pave the way for a future &ldquo;Internet of AIs&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Fleek Network
<p>A great option for Web3 enthusiasts, Fleek Network is calling on users to participate in the industry&rsquo;s first decentralized content delivery network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CDNs play a key role in the internet, ensuring that websites, images and videos can load instantaneously no matter where users are located. Essentially, CDNs are geographically-distributed server networks that enable content to be cached closer to users. When someone connects to an app or website, the content will be delivered from the closest server to their location, significantly reducing latency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleek Network aims to provide an alternative to centralized CDNs operated by companies like Cloudflare, which go against the ethos of Web3. Of course, it cannot build out a global server network from scratch, so instead it relies on people who&rsquo;re willing to provide computing resources in exchange for rewards. It invites anyone to contribute bandwidth to its network by running a cache node, so they can accelerate content delivery to end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleek Network&rsquo;s approach could actually be more advantageous, as its reliance on contributors means its network can potentially extend to the smallest rural villages. Whereas most centralized CDNs are restricted to building their infrastructure in cities, Fleek will be able to operate nodes across the globe. The result is that someone living in Siberia can be served by a node from the same town, rather than connecting to a large data center several hundred kilometers away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Storj
<p>If you have plenty of hard drive space and you&rsquo;re willing to put it to work, Storj offers a viable opportunity with its decentralized cloud storage network, which it presents as an alternative to services like Dropbox, Box and Amazon Web Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It claims to have some big advantages, including greater privacy with guarantees that content stored within the Storj network will never be monitored or censored. All content stored on people&rsquo;s hard drives is fully encrypted, and only the owner has the keys required to access it. The other key selling point is that content is automatically distributed across multiple devices, eliminating the risk of downtime that would prevent users from accessing their files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rent out your extra disk drive space to Storj, all that&rsquo;s required is to download its application, install it, and then select how much storage capacity you want to contribute. Once activated, that portion of your hard drive becomes a part of the Storj network so you can no longer use it yourself. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be compensated for renting it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the requirements, obviously, is that you must be willing to leave your computer up and running and ensure it&rsquo;s always online, in return for payments made to your bank account each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Hyperlink
<p>Hyperlink refers to itself as the &ldquo;World Supercomputer&rdquo;, but is really a global network of computers that anyone can join to earn passive income. Users donate their computer&rsquo;s resources to host third-party websites, mobile applications and content. Its services are offered as a low-cost alternative to businesses that don&rsquo;t want to invest in their own infrastructure or traditional cloud computing services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the advantages of Hyperlink is that it claims to offer significant earnings potential for users, saying it&rsquo;s possible to earn up to $8,600 per year by connecting a desktop or laptop to its network and leaving it running 24/7. Users can even contribute an entire server if they happen to have one lying around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another bonus is that Hyperlink offers flexible payment options, allowing users to receive their earnings through PayPal, bank transfers, credit card payment and more. In future, Hyperlink will expand its network to include tablets and smartphones too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What Are The Downsides?
<p>There actually does not seem to be a lot of downsides to earning a passive income, but those considering it should be aware that by running these programs and keeping their computer switched on 24/7, it may degrade its performance and lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the reality is that most people don&rsquo;t normally use the full capacity of their machine, so they can afford to contribute without really noticing any performance impact. And of course, it&rsquo;s always possible to use an external storage device if you do need more disk space.</p>
<p>Then again, if you do need to perform intensive computing tasks yourself, it might be worth investing in a more powerful machine, or even a second computer that you can leave running and forget about.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of Hyperlink is that it claims to offer significant earnings potential for users, saying it&rsquo;s possible to earn up to $8,600 per year by connecting a desktop or laptop to its network and leaving it running 24/7. Users can even contribute an entire server if they happen to have one lying around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another bonus is that Hyperlink offers flexible payment options, allowing users to receive their earnings through PayPal, bank transfers, credit card payment and more. In future, Hyperlink will expand its network to include tablets and smartphones too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What Are The Downsides?
<p>There actually does not seem to be a lot of downsides to earning a passive income, but those considering it should be aware that by running these programs and keeping their computer switched on 24/7, it may degrade its performance and lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the reality is that most people don&rsquo;t normally use the full capacity of their machine, so they can afford to contribute without really noticing any performance impact. And of course, it&rsquo;s always possible to use an external storage device if you do need more disk space.</p>
<p>Then again, if you do need to perform intensive computing tasks yourself, it might be worth investing in a more powerful machine, or even a second computer that you can leave running and forget about.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest partnership is an extension of Open Campus&rsquo; mission to educate and raise awareness on issues of climate change and environmental conservation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This July, Open Campus, a community-led Web 3 educational content platform, announced the launch of their #ClimateChange4Kids campaign on X (formerly Twitter) to educate the upcoming generations on the importance of protecting our planet. To extend its efforts, Open Campus is now in partnership with its affiliate, TinyTap and Code Green, a Web 3 organization leveraging blockchain and art to help conserve the environment, to create educational content on climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategic partnership aims to extend knowledge and awareness of climate change via the Open Campus platform, providing creators, educators and teachers with a decentralized platform to create interactive educational games and earn from their content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While several parts of the world face extreme temperatures and wildfires, such an initiative could be a crucial step in imparting knowledge on how to stop it.&nbsp; Code Green, TinyTap and Open Campus come together in a mission to educate younger generations &ndash; in an engaging and interactive way &ndash; on climate change. Furthermore, the initiative extends the belief in &ldquo;the power of education to shape a more sustainable future&rdquo;, a mission also shared by the&nbsp; United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"By combining education, technology, and gaming, we're creating a unique platform to engage children and empower them with the knowledge and awareness to tackle this urgent crisis for our planet,&rdquo; Inna Modja, CEO of Code Green and Goodwill Ambassador for the UNCCD, said.</p>

Open Campus, TinyTap and Code Green launch NFT Giveaway&nbsp;
<p>In light of the new collaboration, TinyTap will create a new climate change-centred course and integrate some elements of Code Green&rsquo;s game HEALV3RSE, available on The Sandbox. Featured on the UNCCD website, HEALV3RSE is a metaverse game that allows users to play, learn about the planet, and have a real-world impact. The game&rsquo;s avatars and NFT will feature in the lessons to incentivize learners and enhance the overall quality of the course, the press statement reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through various levels of the game, players discover facts about the environment, make eco-friendly choices to help their virtual planet and perform healing actions. The &lsquo;Play To Heal&rsquo; model enhances the game and gives players a novel experience as they participate in healing actions for our planet, such as planting trees, cleaning oceans, and installing solar panels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Open Campus and Code Green are launching a giveaway to promote the new course. Players who participate in the giveaway campaign have a chance to win up to 100 HEALV3RSE avatars and equipment NFTs. Follow-up details on the giveaway will be posted on Open Campus X (fmr. Twitter) page.</p>
<p>The latest strategic partnership follows the successful launch of &lsquo;Climate Change for Kids&rsquo; in July, aiming to enhance awareness of climate change, especially in younger generations. The #ClimateChange4Kids initiative has seen tremendous support worldwide, with over 200,000 impressions on X. Lastly, Open Campus&rsquo; recent partnership with Cloud Co Entertainment saw the company get a license to use the image of Care Bears, one of the most popular children's products line.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to hedge fund manager Mark Yusko, banks take $7 trillion dollars out of the system every year. The advent of triple entry accounting with blockchain means that banks are becoming redundant.</p>
Banks fight dirty
<p>Founder of Morgan Creek Capital, Yusko recently gave an interview in which he gave a portrayal of the banks that isn&rsquo;t often heard. He stated that banks have paid more in fines for criminal acts such as fraud and money laundering than the entire market cap of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He affirmed that banks are extremely worried about crypto and blockchain technology because it heralds an end to their existence, given that the middle man is now no longer needed. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We (the banks) skim $7 trillion a year out of this system. It&rsquo;s 6 to 8% of GDP that goes to the banks for trust - but we can replace trust with truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yusko is of the belief that the FTX collapse was actually orchestrated in order to bring controversy to the crypto industry and allow US regulators to react by launching an aggressive onslaught against the crypto sector.</p>
<p>He believes that the banking industry, in charge of money for hundreds of years, is in league with regulators to cripple the crypto industry so that it can continue its hegemony over printing money.</p>
<p>Yusko expects the banks&rsquo; fight against the crypto industry will carry on for the next few years before the obvious advantages of crypto and blockchain are finally recognised and given government support.&nbsp;</p>
How the incumbent fights the newcomer
<p>An example of an antiquated and embedded system that seeks to suppress and cripple a new and better system is given by Yusko. He points to when cars were invented and how the incumbent transport system of the horse and buggy sought to do just this in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Reportedly there was collusion between those seeking to protect the horse and buggy system, and the regulators. Ridiculous and onerous rules were imposed on cars that forced them to have someone walking ahead of them holding a red flag. In addition, three persons were required by law to have charge of a vehicle, and additional persons were needed if wagons or carriages were attached.</p>
<p>These harsh and exacting laws were in place for 30 years before being repealed, and technology was finally allowed to progress.&nbsp;</p>
Imposition of CBDCs
<p>According to Yusko, banking is attempting to do the same thing against crypto. He believes that moves are afoot to impose central bank digital currencies on citizens, forcing their use. Yusko said of CBDCs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t watched Agustin Carstens (Head of the Bank for International Settlements) talk about what a CBDC actually is - and of course the central bank should control how, when, and if you are allowed to spend &lsquo;your&rsquo; money - it&rsquo;s one of the most chilling 1 minute and 47 seconds that you&rsquo;ll ever watch.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>$BNB, the Binance exchange token, is on the brink of a potential heavy collapse. Will this bring Bitcoin and the crypto market down?</p>
$BNB on the brink
<p>Following negative downward price action since November 2021, the $BNB token has reached the point where a slide under the critical $220 level could lead to a calamitous -5x crash down to below $50.</p>
<p>Right now the price is struggling to stay within the bottom limits of a bear flag it first entered in early June of this year. The price has already slid out of the bottom of the bear flag at time of going to press, but this break is still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>A nervousness does still appear to be upon the crypto market over recent weeks as bears and bulls both eye bitcoin and ethereum as they approach their own critical trendlines and support levels.</p>
Bitcoin and Ethereum also at critical levels&nbsp;
<p>If bitcoin hits the support of its bullish trendline this is likely to be as low as $28,000. The 200 daily moving average is just below this at $27,300. In its favour, the bitcoin hash ribbons indicator very recently signalled a buy. Ethereum is already at and holding its bullish trendline at just under $1,800. This is also the level of its 200 day moving average. Both bitcoin and ethereum could see a significant price drop if these levels break.</p>
Altcoins having a good day
<p>The rest of the altcoin market is mostly doing a lot better than either bitcoin or ethereum so far today. Total 3 (all cryptos with the exception of bitcoin and ethereum) is up 1% on the day so far. Strong support at $331 billion is below the current value of just under $337 billion.</p>
<p>$RUNE is still on the charge this morning with a more than 6% gain so far. This is counted in $RUNEs epic 70% rise since the beginning of August, making this crypto one of the biggest movers over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Kaspa ($KAS) has also featured prominently among the altcoins but more so over the longer term. The innovative proof-of-work layer 1 rose more than 330% since May, but has been correcting over the last couple of weeks. It is up 3.6% on the day so far.</p>
A $BNB wipeout could mean serious issues for crypto&nbsp;
<p>The question now is whether or not $BNB can hold its ground at $220 if it should get down there. Many will be shorting the token given how the SEC is suing both Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao. Should $BNB indeed make the drop, the token, as well as the exchange, could be in serious financial trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Binance accounting for much of the trade in crypto, plus holding large amounts of many other tokens, such a scenario could be calamitous for the exchange, as well as for the crypto market in general.&nbsp;</p>
