With the price consolidating under the key resistance, ADA may attempt a breakout. Key Support levels: $0.36, $0.34 Key Resistance levels: $0.38, $0.40 The price has formed a double bottom with good support at 36 cents. As long as this key level holds, bulls have a good chance to take ADA&#8217;s price to the resistance [&#8230;]
