<p>ADA Consolidates As Hoskinson Envisions Multiple Major Blockchains Like Solana Connected to Cardano</p>



<p>Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.3122, representing a change of -0.47% in the past day and -0.57% in the past week, per the latest data from CoinMarketCap. The smart contract token has oscillated between $0.30 and $0.32 since November 20.</p>



<p>As ADA trades sideways, its co-founder Charles Hoskinson <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hopes-high-as-charles-hoskinson-speaks-on-solana-becoming-a-sidechain-to-cardano/">suggests having Solana</a> as a sidechain (a separate blockchain connected to the main blockchain) for Cardano. Hoskinson floated the idea during an ‘Ask Me Anything&#8217; session on December 12.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>So you could take Solana to replace (its) current consensus algorithm with something 25 times faster and does not collapse all the time, make it a Cardano sidechain,</em>&#8221; the 35-year-old developer who is also behind Ethereum said. &#8220;<em>Solana would then be paid to ADA holders to maintain it, and they don’t have to worry about security anymore … and then all those dApps move over, and they get better reliability and security, and they get faster.</em>&#8220;</p>



<h2 id="h-hoskinson-envisions-multiple-major-blockchains-connected-to-cardano"><strong>Hoskinson envisions multiple major blockchains connected to Cardano</strong></h2>



<p>In the more than 2 hours AMA video, Hoskinson said that his blockchain has been exploring the possibility of accommodating sidechains for over six years–where Cardano becomes the main chain and other networks can plug in. According to the entrepreneur, the arrangement will let the partner sidechains pay block rewards to stake pool operators and the ADA token holders, as Cardano takes care of the security elements of the whole ecosystem.</p>



<p>Hoskinson has been pushing his ambitious plan for a while now. After Elon Musk acquired Twitter towards the end of October, he floated the idea of having Dogecoin <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doges-chances-of-being-merged-with-twitter-soar-as-hoskinson-proposes-making-dogecoin-a-cardano-sidechain/">as a sidechain</a> to Cardano. In a tweet dated October 28, the American blockchain developer said: &#8220;<em>Now that Twitter is in the hands of (Elon Musk,) I can see a real possibility that DOGE will somehow merge with (Cardano). He added that he would &#8220;do the migration free… and even add smart contracts.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Bitcoin and altcoins (non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies) are recovering – after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed better-than-expected inflation data. BLS published a Consumer Price Index report showing the inflation rate for November at 7.1%, compared to an expected rate of 7.3%. As a result, Bitcoin surged past $18,000 – the highest level in more than a month – as major altcoins, including ETH, XRP, DOGE, and LTC, registered positive gains.</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs plans to splash “tens of millions of dollars” on investments or buyouts in crypto firms after the FTX collapse hit last month and suppressed investor interest.</p>



<p>The FTX collapse and subsequent contagion across major lending firms had elicited calls for more regulatory oversight on players, assuring big banks of the sector&#8217;s stability. In an interview with Reuters, Mathew McDermott, Goldman&#8217;s head of digital assets, revealed that the bank was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/goldman-sachs-reportedly-keen-to-raise-2-billion-to-purchase-celsius-assets/">conducting due diligence</a> on several crypto firms noting that they saw an opportunity for businesses in the crypto sector to pick up.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We do see some really interesting opportunities, priced much more sensibly,&#8221;</em> McDermott said without giving details. According to the banker, despite the FTX debacle setting the crypto market back by far, they were focused on leveraging the sector’s underlying technology, which they project will explode in growth in a few years.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely set the market back in terms of sentiment.&nbsp;There&#8217;s absolutely no doubt of that. FTX was a poster child in many parts of the ecosystem. But to reiterate, the underlying technology continues to perform,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>While this is not the first time that the $129.48B bank is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/goldman-sachs-exploring-direct-crypto-offerings-to-clients/">showing interest</a> in investing in the crypto sector, its particular timing of the bear market surprised many players who have expressed little to no plans on increasing their exposure to crypto-related investments.</p>



<p>Notably, according to McDermont, FTX’s collapse had been a blessing in disguise for the bank since its trading volumes had shot up as investors who sought to trade with regulated and well-capitalised counterparties were onboarded.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>What&#8217;s increased is the number of financial institutions wanting to trade with us. I suspect a number of them traded with FTX, but I can&#8217;t say that with cast iron certainty,</em>” he went on.</p>



<p>In a November 10 interview, David Solomon, the bank&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, said that although he viewed cryptocurrencies as “highly speculative”, he saw a lot of potential in the underlying technology as its infrastructure becomes more formalised.</p>



<p>So far, Goldman has a stake in 11 digital asset companies which provide services such as compliance, cryptocurrency data and blockchain management. On November 3, the bank partnered with MSCI and Coin Metrics to launch Datonomy, a new classification system for the digital assets market.</p>



<p>According to McDermott, the bank has also been building its own private distributed ledger technology as it seeks to capitalize on the potential of the blockchain to offer improved speed and transparency.</p>

<p>According to a new report, despite the FTX implosion sinking over $2 billion of investors’ money in the past month, close to double that amount was lost to scams and rug-pulls in 2022.</p>



<p>Published by cybersecurity and data privacy firm Privacy Affairs, the report revealed that the five biggest crypto losses, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-doj-seizes-7-seven-domain-names-used-in-pig-butchering-crypto-schemes/">scams</a> and hacks of 2022, ranked by the amount of money lost or stolen ($100 million and above), accounted for nearly $3.5 billion.</p>



<p>As of November 2022, the collapse of FTX had become the biggest case of money lost, with between $1 to $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency evaporating, while Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network was second in place with $615 million, followed by the Wormhole crypto bridge scam with $320 million.</p>



<p>Hackers stole $1.9 billion in cryptocurrency between January and July, 2022-which is a 37% increase in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftc-report-says-victims-of-crypto-scams-have-lost-over-1-billion-since-2021/">same period last year</a>. Accordingly, the report noted that 97% of all stolen cryptocurrency came from DeFi protocols in Q1 2022. Bitcoin, Tether and Ether emerged as the most preferred cryptocurrencies by scammers to set up their cons, with social media platforms led by Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram being the most used playgrounds for crypto scams.</p>



<p>Notably, the firm cautioned over a spike in cryptocurrency flash loan scams. Flash loans allow users to borrow large amounts of virtual funds for a short period without collateral. Attackers who secure the loans and have extensive voting rights can execute a malicious vote for a malicious proposal allowing themselves to send funds to a wallet they control.</p>



<p>According to the firm, 27 flash loan attacks resulted in a loss of over $308 million in Q2 2022, marking a 66.7% increase in losses resulting from the vice from Q1 2022. Notable firms that have fallen victim to this scam include Decentralized Finance (DeFi) project Beanstalk, which lost $182M in April and the crypto trading platform Mango Market which was siphoned of $100 million in October.</p>



<p>The firm also noted that more than 188,000 rug pulls were executed on various blockchains this year, representing a 20% jump from 2021. Last year, $2.8 billion was lost to rug pulls, with more than $2.5 billion being lost to the Turkey-based Thodex crypto exchange alone.</p>



<p>According to Privacy Affairs CEO and Founder Miklos Zoltap, people in the 20-40 age group were the most susceptible to crypto scams. <em>&#8220;What our research shows is that cryptocurrency scams and related fraudulent activities are not plummeting anytime soon,&#8221;</em> he said.</p>



<p>That said, crypto-related scams are showing zero signs of abating; the executive advised people to protect themselves by, “<em>using established cryptos and tokens, avoiding cryptocurrency projects that guarantee significant returns, and never get crypto investment advice from dating sites and influencers.”</em></p>

<p>Binance has recorded massive withdrawals in the last seven days sparking concerns over the future of the exchange.</p>



<ul>
<li>The exchange saw $8.6 billion leave its platform and only a $5.1 billion inflow leading to a $3.6 billion deficit.</li>



<li>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has played off fears describing it as a “business as usual” with some bad days and good days.</li>
</ul>



<p>Sequel to the collapse of FTX, panic has ravaged the industry, with investors more sceptical than ever about centralized exchanges and service providers.</p>



<p>Although Binance has enjoyed the trust of millions of users since its launch, a lot may be changing in recent weeks. Binance has recorded huge withdrawals, most of which have come in the past seven days totalling up to $8.6 billion.</p>



<p>According to blockchain data analytics firm Nansen, the firm <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1602677725218492416?s=21&amp;t=kcM-Q5UmZY79Bef63vftCw">recorded</a> the highest amount of daily withdrawals since June on Tuesday, pushing up the weekly figure to $8.6 billion. Amidst increasing withdrawals, the exchange had an inflow of $5.1 billion, leaving it with a net outflow of $3.6 billion.</p>



<p>Binance withdrawal figures topped other centralized exchanges (CEXs), including Coinbase and Binance US, which both had net outflows of about $800 million and $38.7 million respectively. Crypto firms like JumpCrypto among others lead the pack in making the highest withdrawals on Binance. In two weeks, the firm has taken off $141 million from Binance’s balance sheet. </p>



<p>Despite this ugly trend, Zhao has played down the fears of users <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602676998094069760?s=21&amp;t=b0eRGCSIaV12uKaEPdCldQ">describing</a> the incident as “<em>business as usual.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“We saw some withdrawals today. I actually think it is a good idea to ‘stress test withdrawals’ on each CEX on a rotating basis.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In the midst of record withdrawals, Binance still holds assets worth over $58 billion, signalling a strong financial base for the exchange. </p>



<h2 id="h-more-fear-mounts-as-usdc-withdrawal-halted"><strong>More fear mounts as USDC withdrawal halted</strong></h2>



<p>On Tuesday, Binance temporarily halted withdrawals of USD Coin (USDC), with Zhao citing “token swap issues.” Recall that Binance announced a token swap policy in September, which will see USDC and two other stablecoins converted to BUSD.</p>



<p>The initial halt raised a lot of eyebrows and tension, with the CEO explaining that they received an increase in USDC withdrawals and the banks were not open for two hours of the halt because swapping tokens requires traditional fiat at the bank.</p>



<p>Withdrawals of USDC have resumed on the exchange, with the company giving an assurance that funds are backed 1:1.</p>

<ul>
<li>The deep-pocketed investors are transferring funds outside Binance.</li>



<li>Binance is under investigation by US regulators for money laundering claims.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-whales-on-a-gigantic-accumulation-spree-as-ripple-mulls-ipo-after-sec-lawsuit-ends/">XRP whales</a> holding between 100,000 and 10 million tokens increased their off holdings by 1.5% to 18.29% as of December 11 – per data provided by analytics firm Santiment. The buying activities were further accelerated by plans by the US lawmakers to prosecute Binance&#8217;s CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and &#8216;red flags&#8217; in the firm&#8217;s proof of reserves.</p>



<p>The largest exchange by trading volumes is reportedly under probe by the US Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service for alleged money laundering and violation of criminal sanctions. Despite division on the side of the prosecutors – with some claiming that they have enough evidence against CZ&#8217;s exchange while others believe otherwise – Binance is recording increased outflows.</p>



<p>At the start of the week, the exchange recorded a net outflow of $902 million, according to data from Nansen. Among the investors moving XRP are whales, as reported by WhaleAlert. The tracker tweeted on December 13 that 300,000,000 XRP worth $115 million were sent from Binance to an unknown destination.</p>



<h2 id="h-xrp-outflows-from-binance-are-linked-to-the-exchange-s-opaque-proof-of-reserves"><strong>XRP outflows from Binance are linked to the exchange&#8217;s opaque proof of reserves</strong></h2>



<p>Hours apart, another 37,371,039 XRP worth $14 million moved from Binance to an unverified destination. Part of Binance&#8217;s outflows – which now amount to more than $1 billion – could partly be tied to the irregularities on the exchange&#8217;s recently declared proof of reserves by Mazars.</p>



<p>The audit firm&#8217;s letter read: &#8220;<em>we found that Binance was 97% collateralized without taking into account the Out-Of-Scope assets pledged by customers as collateral for In-Scope-Assets lent through the margin and loans service offering resulting in negative balances on the customer liability report. With the inclusion of In-Scope Assets lent to customers through margin and loans overcollateralized by Out-Of-Scope Assets, we found that Binance was 101% collateralized.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Based on the report, industry experts are questioning why the exchange did not fully disclose its internal controls and their effectiveness. The former chief of the Securities Exchange Commission&#8217;s Office of Internet Enforcement, John Reed Stark, said: <em>&#8220;Binance&#8217;s proof of reserve report does not address the effectiveness of internal financial controls, does not express an opinion or assurance conclusion and does not vouch for the numbers.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Mazars’ report – released on December 7 – showed that Binance&#8217;s Bitcoin reserves manage more than 575,742.42, worth $9.7 billion at the current price. The company has also advocated for the Merkle tree proof of reserves, letting users verify their assets – something experts term inadequate because it fails to include liabilities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Former BitMEX CEO thinks that Bitcoin’s prices cannot go any lower after a series of implosions sent prices tumbling.</li>



<li>He notes that “irresponsible entities” have run out of Bitcoin to sell, and the only way for the asset is up.</li>



<li>Bitcoin stands on a delicate precipice ahead of the release of new inflation data.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has suffered from a string of negative reports involving some of the largest entities in the digital asset industry. However, BitMEX founder believes the asset has survived its darkest days and can expect a rally in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>Arthur Hayes, ex-CEO of digital asset derivatives platform BitMEX, thinks BTC is set for a rally since the “largest most irresponsible entities” have sold the last of their Bitcoins. Hayes argues that all the firms prone to going bankrupt have all gone bankrupt, leaving the coast clear for the bulls.</p>



<p><em>“I can’t demonstratively prove that all Bitcoin held by these failed institutions was sold during the multiple crashes, but it does look as if they tried their best to liquidate the most liquid crypto collateral they could right before they went under,”</em> said Hayes.</p>



<p>The former CEO backs his theory by saying that firms facing a liquidity crisis have no reason to hold onto their BTC when they urgently need fiat. Hayes notes that the typical playbook for distressed firms is to call in loans and then sell their BTC holdings to avoid going under.</p>



<p>In the weeks after FTX’s collapse, BTC fell to $15,599 as entities affected by the black swan event unloaded their BTC holdings. In the last few months, several top players in the industry have filed for bankruptcy, including FTX, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blockfi-has-10-billion-in-assets-and-liabilities-and-100000-creditors-bankruptcy-filing/">BlockFi</a>, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and Celsius.</p>



<h2 id="h-btc-has-an-eventful-week-ahead"><strong>BTC has an eventful week ahead</strong></h2>



<p>Some analysts have termed this week the most important for BTC, with several key events on the horizon. First on the list is the release of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-despite-us-cpi-data-spooking-investors-is-a-crash-to-12000-in-the-offing/">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) for November and the decision of the Federal Reserve regarding rate hikes.</p>



<p>Analysts believe that with two weeks till the end of the year, Bitcoin could go on a historical “Santa Rally”. Other factors that could decide BTC’s path are the U.S. dollar index (DXY) movement, Bitcoin’s supply shock ratio nearing a 10-year high, and the end of miners selling their assets.</p>



<p><em>“The mother of all decisions is coming, expect huge volatility next week,” </em>said one financial analyst. <em>“The incoming DXY move will decide the fate of the crypto and stock market.”</em></p>

<p>Media is awash with the news that Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of the collapsed FTX cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/">was arrested</a> by Bahamas law enforcement on Monday, Dec 12, 2022.</p>



<p>Authorities and crypto investors are keenly following the developments of SBF’s arrest, with the ensuing legal proceedings expected to throw more light on what led to the collapse of FTX. Investors who lost money in FTX are also seeking justice and would ultimately like to know the fate of their investment.</p>



<p>SBF is reported to have hired attorney Mark Cohen.</p>



<p>The arrest of SBF in the Bahamas is only the start of what is expected to be a lengthy legal proceeding that could involve extradition to the US. It is still unclear at this point as to which direction the legal proceeding shall take, as the Bahamas is also investigating the collapse of FTX.</p>



<p>SBF had been scheduled to testify in Congress before the US House Committee on Financial Services on Dec 13, 2022. However, following news of SBF’s arrest in the Bahamas, the Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee released the following statement on Monday, December 12, 2022:</p>



<p><em>“Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many. The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity. While I am disappointed that we will not be able to hear from Mr. Bankman-Fried tomorrow, we remain committed to getting to the bottom of what happened, and the Committee looks forward to beginning our investigation by hearing from Mr. John Ray III tomorrow.”</em></p>



<p>Mr. John Ray III, the newly appointed CEO of FTX Debtors, is scheduled to testify before the US House Committee on Financial Services on December 13, 2022. Mr John Ray III possesses extensive legal and restructuring experience, including overseeing the unwinding of Enron following its accounting scandal in 2001.</p>



<p>SBF is scheduled to appear on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, in the Magistrate Court, in Nassau, the Bahamas. SBF is facing charges and scrutiny from several authorities and other law enforcement agencies, including prosecutors for the Southern District of New York, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Department, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>

Ryan Pinder, SBF was arrested on December 12 by the Royal Bahamas Police Force following receipt of a sealed indictment filed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) saying that criminal charges had been filed against SBF in the US.</p>



<p>“<em>As a result of the notification received and the material provided therewith, it was deemed appropriate for the Attorney General to seek SBF’s arrest and hold him in custody pursuant to our nation’s Extradition Act,”</em> read the statement. The AG also noted that they would hand over SBF to the US should an extradition request be sent in.</p>



<p>Commenting on the arrest, Bahamas prime minister Philip Davis said they would continue pursuing individuals associated with FTX based on the countries&#8217; shared interest in fighting crime.</p>



<p><em>“While the United States is pursuing criminal charges against SBF individually, the Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX,”</em> he wrote in a note.</p>



<p>SBF&#8217;s arrest comes amid heightened calls for his apprehension by the crypto community after the disgraced businessman escaped to the Bahamas following the collapse of FTX. Today, Dec 13, SBF was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-rep-maxine-says-a-subpoena-on-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-is-on-the-table-as-calls-for-his-probe-intensify/">scheduled to appear</a> before the House Financial Services Committee alongside FTX’s new CEO John J. Ray to shed more light on what led to the giant exchange’s collapse. </p>



<p>Before his arrest, SBF confirmed on Monday on Twitter Spaces that he planned on testifying at the meeting via video from his location in the Bahamas. However, following the arrest, it was not clear whether SBF would still be able to attend the meeting at press time.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the crypto community welcome the news of SBF’s arrest, attention now turns to Alameda ex-CEO Caroline Ellison. Alameda Research, the sister trading firm of FTX, has been accused of being used to siphon User funds from FTX, channelling them to various investments and other uses.</p>



<p>According to Tuesday’s testimony of John Raym, which is now public, customer assets from FTX were commingled with assets from the Alameda trading platform. He also noted <em>that “the FTX Group went on a spending binge in late 2021 through 2022, during which approximately $5 billion was spent buying a myriad of businesses and investments, many of which may be worth only a fraction of what was paid for them.”</em> </p>



<p>While Ellison remains at large, it is believed that she could be in the U.S. after an unverified <a href="https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1599466158893432832">photo</a> of her making an order in a New York café surfaced earlier this month. Late last week, she hired a legal team which included a top SEC official and a lawyer who investigated the Bernie Madoff Ponzi Scheme raising speculations she could be looking to cut a deal with US authorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attorney John Deaton, famous for giving the cryptocurrency community insights on the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-new-dates-in-the-sec-vs-ripple-case-point-towards-a-final-court-verdict-in-q1-2023/">SEC vs Ripple</a> lawsuit from a legal perspective, has again broken down the possible implications of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) winning its case against the blockchain-based file-sharing and payment network LBRY.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-ripple-on-the-same-path-as-lbry"><strong>Is Ripple on the same path as LBRY?</strong></h2>



<p>As many predict the downfall of Ripple and XRP, alluding that its fate will be similar to LBRY, Deaton clarifies that the sentiments are not backed by fact in any way. He explains that both parties have made great arguments in court so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“..But Ripple doesn’t have the BURDEN OF PROOF &#8211; the SEC does. The SEC did a decent job at replying to Ripple’s pre-1934 Blue Sky Laws argument.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>The SEC also did a decent job attacking Ripple’s argument that there MUST be an underlying contract for an investment contract to exist.”</em> he explains.</p>



<p>He also notes the differences between LBRY and XRP’s case with the SEC, shedding more light on how the turnout might differ vastly from LBRY’s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>The Ripple/XRP case is in the 2nd Circuit. LBRY isn’t. Plus, LBRY didn’t contest the common enterprise factor &#8211; Ripple AND XRPHolders, who were granted Amicus by the Judge more than one year before any other Amici joined, VIGOROUSLY contest the common enterprise prong of Howey.”</em></p>



<p>Although he proceeds to make clear that his predictions might not be entirely accurate, he remains mostly convinced that Ripple and XRP stand a chance of conquering the SEC.</p>



<h2><strong>The future of LBRY and LBRY Inc</strong></h2>



<p>While Hogan’s breakdown exposes a more positive turnout for Ripple, it seems unlikely that LBRY will make any major comeback after its defeat.</p>



<p>The official LBRY Twitter handle recently made a series of significant tweets summarising the company&#8217;s next phase and what onlookers should expect.</p>



<p>LBRY explains that it expects the SEC to leak any confidential document it has with any company, and as such, LBRY will likely “be dead in the future.”</p>



<p>Additionally, LRBY made clear that although its mission will still be in motion, the company (LBRY Inc) itself will not be able to withstand the debts it has been slapped with from the SEC and the legal system.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“It is specifically LBRY Inc that must die, the LBRY protocol and blockchain will continue.”</em></p>

<p>The back and forth between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple has continued to play out as the SEC has filed its redacted reply to Ripple&#8217;s opposition to the SEC&#8217;s Motion for Summary Judgment. At the same time, Ripple expresses optimism that the case will soon end.</p>



<p>According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who is also a defendant in the case, the Ripple team can congratulate itself for having stood strong against the SEC&#8217;s onslaught till this point, where the case is entering its last lap.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse stated that Ripple, from day one, has been fighting aggressively to get clear rules for the entire crypto industry in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I said it on day 1, we will aggressively fight to get clear rules for the entire industry in the U.S. Congrats to all of Team Ripple for getting us to this point. Ripple stood strong and withstood the SEC’s onslaught. I look forward to being on the right side of justice,&#8221; he said. </em></p>



<p>The SEC, in its redacted reply to Ripple&#8217;s opposition to the SEC&#8217;s motion for Summary Judgment, argued that the court should rule in favour of the commission&#8217;s arguments for several reasons.</p>



<p>These include that Ripple defendants offered and sold XRP as a security; Ripple&#8217;s due process defences fail as a matter of law; Ripple engaged in domestic offers and sales; and that the SEC is entitled to summary judgment against the individual defendants as they violated security laws as issuers of XRP.  </p>



<h2 id="h-ripple-quite-confident-of-a-favourable-outcome-in-the-case"><strong>Ripple quite confident of a favourable outcome in the case</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple also filed its last submission on the same day as the SEC, arguing for the court to pass summary judgment in its favour as the SEC has failed to back its allegations with evidence but is only trying to bend the law in the case.</p>



<p>In a comment on the filing, Ripple&#8217;s general counsel Stuart Alderoty stated that the company is proud of the defence it has mounted in the case on behalf of the entire crypto industry. He added that Ripple had followed legal best practices, while the same can likely not be said of the SEC.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse had previously stated that the case, having gotten to the summary judgment stage, could be brought to an end in three to six months. The time frame is how long federal judges typically take to complete fact-finding and pass their verdict.</p>

<li>The service is currently available in the Netherlands.</li>



<li>Xumm wallet has partnered with several platforms, including BTC Direct, Banxa Official, and GateHub, in the rollout.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/colombian-government-launches-national-land-registry-on-xrp-ledger-for-over-50-million-people/">XRP Ledger</a> non-custodial wallet Xumm has announced plans to launch in France and the UK. In a Thursday tweet, the platform announced that it would roll out fiat on-ramp and off-ramp services in the two countries and beyond in partnership with BTC Direct and Banxa Official.</p>



<p>Xumm on/off-ramp services let users convert fiat currencies into XRP and vice versa through the Xumm Pro account. The service accepts Euros, allowing transfers from bank accounts to the XRP Ledger accounts.</p>



<p>In the Twitter thread, Xumm added that it&#8217;s planning to add more third-party providers, including stablecoin integration with GateHub. The wallet provider also plans to integrate the separate xApps into a single platform.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;More third-party providers are coming, so you will have plenty to choose from,&#8221; the announcement said. &#8220;While they are now separate xApps, we will soon add them all to one, fiat –XRP xApp listing the available options. A tight integration with GateHub for their stablecoin is also coming soon,&#8221; it added.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-xumm-is-currently-offering-xrp-on-ramp-off-ramp-in-the-dutch-market"><strong>Xumm is currently offering XRP on-ramp/off-ramp in the Dutch market</strong></h2>



<p>Last month,  Xumm rolled out the services in the Netherlands – under the Dutch Central Bank &#8211; with the prospects of expanding to other jurisdictions, including Germany and Belgium. The company also noted that it is waiting for regulatory clarity in North America before introducing the service to the region.</p>



<p>XRP on-ramp/off-ramp users must pay an annual subscription fee of 60 USD or 60 Euros and an additional 5 USD or 5 Euros per year as set-up fees. The company uses the top exchange rates from the liquidity service providers in the conversion &#8211; according to the information provided on its website.</p>



<p>The required KYC and proof of address reportedly take half an hour to complete on xApp. Users need to send a deposit description by xApp from their International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to Xumm&#8217;s IBAN. The current amount that can be on-ramped is 15,000 EUR per rolling 365 days.</p>



<p>Besides the fiat services, Xumm users can access XRP Ledger-based stablecoin USDS, launched on November 11 in partnership with Web3 payment platform Stably.</p>

<ul>
<li>FTX’s founder says he will be willing to float a new business to raise money for creditors.</li>



<li>The embattled founder is expected to appear in two Senate committee hearings investigating FTX’s collapse.</li>



<li>FTX’s creditors exceed one million, with debt surpassing the $10 billion mark.</li>
</ul>



<p>Running low on options, FTX’s founder wants to make one last-ditch attempt to repay customers, but experts term it a long shot.</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried revealed in an interview with the BBC over the weekend that he is willing to go the extra mile to repay <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-comes-clean-and-admits-that-it-owes-over-3-billion-to-its-50-biggest-creditors/">customers</a> after the implosion of his exchange. Bankman-Fried stated that he is considering the possibility of starting a new business venture and using profits to make customers whole again.</p>



<p><em>“I would give anything to be able to do that. And I’m going to try if I can,”</em> said Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be thinking about how we can help the world and if users haven&#8217;t gotten much back, I&#8217;m going to be thinking about what I can do for them,</em>” he said. <em>“And I think at the very least I have a duty to FTX users to do right by them as best as I can.”</em></p>



<p>It is unclear the nature of the business Sam Bankman-Fried will be embarking on, but his antecedents as an arbitrage trader could offer some hints. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao noted that given Bankman-Fried’s battered reputation, the best option would be for him to stay out of the industry.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried has been holed out in his luxury apartment in the Bahamas, giving a series of self-critical interviews while assuring users that it was not his intent to defraud them. “I didn’t knowingly commit fraud,” he told the BBC and blamed the implosion on a lack of competence on his part.</p>



<p>The ambitious plan of launching a new company faces the grim possibility of Bankman-Fried’s possible arrest by law enforcement agents. FTX’s founder does not deny the chances of his arrest but says at the moment he is trying to “ignore” things that are out of his control.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-looming-threat-of-a-subpoena"><strong>The looming threat of a subpoena</strong></h2>



<p>Bankman-Fried has been named as a witness in the House Committee of Financial Services hearing on FTX’s implosion. After an earlier reluctance to appear, United States House Representative Maxine Waters confirmed that the Committee might be forced to issue a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-rep-maxine-says-a-subpoena-on-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-is-on-the-table-as-calls-for-his-probe-intensify/">subpoena</a> to compel his appearance.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, the embattled founder confirmed that he would testify on the pathways that could return value to international customers and the events that led to the collapse.</p>



<p><em>“So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won’t be as helpful as I’d like. But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th,”</em> he wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>South Korea’s largest news site <em>Chosun Media</em> has indicated that the fugitive co-founder of Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, has been partially located. Kwon is reportedly residing in the Balkan country of Serbia after leaving Singapore in September.</p>



<h2 id="h-kwon-is-likely-in-serbia"><strong>Kwon Is Likely In Serbia</strong></h2>



<p>South Korean authorities have partially discovered Do Kwon’s location as the global manhunt for the CEO of the failed stablecoin company Terraform Labs continues.</p>



<p>Per a December 11 report from <em>Chosun Media</em>, South Korean authorities received a tip regarding Do Kwon’s whereabouts, saying he’s now in Serbia, and they were able to confirm it. “Recently, we obtained intelligence that CEO Kwon was in Serbia, and it was found to be true,&#8221; an official involved in the investigation of the disgraced Terra creator told the newspaper. </p>



<p>The report adds that the South Korean Ministry of Finance is currently requesting Serbian authorities for their cooperation in the investigation.</p>



<p>The Terra ecosystem imploded in May, eroding around $40 billion in value in weeks, after which Kwon faced charges of violating Korean capital markets laws. Terra&#8217;s meltdown was a seismic event in the crypto sector, with reports of some investors losing their entire life savings. Crypto analytics companies, including Nansen and Glassnode have also noted that Terra’s ignominious crash led to the downfall of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, as crypto contagion spread throughout the industry.</p>



<p>Kwon left his native South Korea for Singapore in late April, right before the Terra-LUNA catastrophic fall. He repeatedly denied reports of being on the run, even <a href="https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1588298460595249153">claiming </a>he would throw a meetup to “get over this in hiding bs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sometime in September, it was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-do-kwon-faces-57-million-lawsuit-in-singapore-for-financial-fraud/">reported </a>that Kwon had left Singapore for Dubai in transit to another destination, which turns out to have been Serbia.</p>



<p>Though Kwon’s country of residence has seemingly been located, it’s not clear whether law enforcement knows Kwon’s exact location or is able to conduct an immediate arrest. He’s the subject of an<a href="https://zycrypto.com/lunas-do-kwon-bags-a-red-notice-from-interpol-in-bid-to-hasten-his-arrest/"> Interpol red notice</a> as of September, meaning that he is now wanted in most countries. In October, his passport was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/south-korean-authorities-seek-to-revoke-terra-co-creator-do-kwons-passport-to-expedite-deportation/">cancelled </a>by South Korean authorities.</p>



<p>If Kwon is indeed in Serbia, it remains to be seen whether South Korea will succeed in extraditing the fallen 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur since the two countries don’t have a bilateral extradition treaty.</p>

<p>CNBC’s mad money host Jim Cramer has slammed XRP, Solana and Dogecoin, describing the three cryptocurrencies as a “giant con” for failing to demonstrate their value beyond being speculation assets.</p>



<p>Cramer made the comments on Dec 8, shortly after CNBC hosted television personality, Kevin O’Leary, over his <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-blasts-kevin-oleary-for-supposedly-defending-ftx/">alleged connections</a> and promotion of collapsed crypto exchange FTX.</p>



<p><em>“XRP, Solana and Dogecoin, those I believe are all cons,” </em>said Cramer when asked about his general view on cryptocurrencies by Squawk Box’s Rebecca Quick. <em>“Why don’t we just put up like a bunch of stocks that are valued at the same size? so tired of these cons.”</em></p>



<p>Cramer, 67, however, noted that it was important to differentiate between cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, emphasizing that he was a big fan of the latter.</p>



<p><em>“Remember the cons is not blockchain, blockchain is great, but we keep comparing blockchain with the con, and I don’t know how long that can continue,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Commenting on the FTX debacle, the presenter noted that “blockchain had nothing to do with what happened” adding that the whole thing seemed bottomless and that he did not know how to fathom it.</p>



<h2 id="h-cramer-crypto-comments-draw-ire"><strong>Cramer Crypto Comments Draw Ire</strong></h2>



<p>Following Cramer’s criticism of cryptocurrencies, a trail of comments by disgruntled crypto users has been an outpouring on Twitter.</p>



<p>John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer and founder of Crypto-Law US, hit back at the presenter shortly after the interview accusing him of conflating XRP with FTX’s fraudulent dealings. The lawyer went on to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-counsel-gives-strong-argument-about-xrp-as-landmark-lawsuit-nears-end/">defend XRP</a> by reminding Cramer that a range of US government agencies, including FinCEN, DOJ and the CFTC, had described XRP as a virtual currency along with Bitcoin and Ethereum-and, not a con. He also reminded the presenter of a previous session where two CNBC fast money presenters had highlighted XRP and showed viewers how to acquire it live on TV.</p>



<p><em>“I represent some of your viewers who purchased XRP after Brian Kelly and CNBC showed them. He didn’t say it was a con, did he?”</em> said Deaton.</p>



<p>Dogecoin Core developer Michi Lumin also weighed in on the conversation, seeking to correct the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cnbcs-jim-cramer-boldly-calls-dogecoin-a-security-urges-investors-to-treat-doge-with-extreme-caution/">misinformation about dogecoin</a>. According to the developer, for something to be a &#8220;scam&#8221; or a &#8220;con&#8221;, there has to be a mark and a beneficiary. She went on to note that, unlike other cryptos, which had a &#8216;developer premine&#8217; and a way for devs to have an inordinate amount, Dogecoin never did as its code rules did not allow for such activities.</p>



<p><em>“The developers own far less than you may think, far less than other crypto devs do. That&#8217;s because we all had to get it the same way you all did. There&#8217;s no magic button and no special allocation,”</em> she wrote, adding that dogecoin was not &#8220;run&#8221; by a &#8220;company&#8221; or a body. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Cramer, who is no stranger to controversy in crypto-land, has continued to take heat from crypto adherents, with some jokingly taking his comments as a bullish signal.</p>
