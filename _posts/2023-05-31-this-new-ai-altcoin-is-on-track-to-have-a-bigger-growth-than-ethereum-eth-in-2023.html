<p class="s7">The crypto market constantly evolves, allowing for crypto projects with better utilities and features. Some new altcoins have properties that make them stand out amongst established cryptocurrencies. Consequently, those with unique profit-making capabilities enjoy more success in the crypto market.</p>
<p class="s7">For new cryptocurrencies hoping to gain investors' trust, it is important to be backed up by properties that contribute to the token's value. One of the ways of doing this is by creating systems that can keep up with the technological evolution of the 21st century. InQubeta (QUBE) is here to usher AI technology into the crypto market this season.</p>
<p class="s7">By ensuring that crypto investors can now invest in AI start-ups, InQubeta is one of the unique altcoins that has created a new playing field for itself, and analysts suspect that it may soar higher than crypto giants like Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p class="s10">InQubeta (QUBE) Merges AI Investment with the Crypto Market</p>
<p class="s7">InQubeta is certainly on the right path to becoming one of the biggest cryptocurrencies. With an impressive presale, InQubeta is already making the right moves to ensure that it remains relevant long after it has been launched. The presale is in its early stages and has already raised over $200,000, with more than 50% of the Beta Stage tokens sold.</p>
<p class="s7">The increased demand for QUBE tokens will only increase its value. The InQubeta platform will make significant contributions to the growth of AI technology. The way it works is that AI start-ups needing investors can create trending NFTs with inherent utilities and list them on the InQubeta platform, allowing investors to choose what kinds they want.</p>
<p class="s7">By leveraging the properties and popularity of trending NFTs, InQubeta has positioned itself as a crypto project worth long-term investment purposes. The QUBE token also offers an avenue for governance on the platform. This means that QUBE holders can use their ERC20 tokens to participate in important decisions on the platform.</p>
<p class="s7">InQubeta ensures that investors can keep in touch with innovations in the AI market. Its ERC20 tokens are an added advantage as the Ethereum blockchain successfully allows the platform to host its NFT marketplace. What makes it all the more impressive is that InQubeta is projected to grow more than Ethereum in 2023.</p>

<p class="s10">Ethereum (ETH) Opens the Door to a New Generation of Crypto Tokens</p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) was one of the cryptocurrencies created to serve as an alternative to Bitcoin. It is now one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world. A large portion of Ethereum's popularity is because it allows other cryptocurrencies to grow.</p>
<p class="s7">Several projects rely on the Ethereum blockchain, and numerous tokens rely on the Ethereum standard, making it a valuable addition to the crypto market. Many of these tokens are in the top 100 list on the DeFi market.</p>
<p class="s7">ETH was the first project to introduce the idea of smart contracts, making it possible for different parties to carry out transactions with each other. Overall, Ethereum has reduced transaction costs and increased the number of operations on its blockchain. By introducing periodic updates, Ethereum can stay ahead of the demands of the crypto market. It also allows for a cryptocurrency, such as InQubeta, to potentially experience bigger growth.</p>
<p class="s7">Conclusion</p>
<p class="s7">What better way to make money from the DeFi market than to invest in new crypto projects like InQubeta? This AI cryptocurrency is already on the way to making a name for itself worldwide. Every indication indicates that InQubeta could grow bigger than Ethereum in 2023.</p>
