					<description><![CDATA[According to Bloomberg, in a key development for the cryptocurrency industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly set to allow the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ethereum (ETH) futures. This move marks a significant win for numerous firms that have long sought to introduce such products. While the SEC has previously hesitated to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies, the decision to greenlight an Ethereum futures ETF could have profound implications for Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a non-security.  This development also holds potential ramifications for other cryptocurrencies, as the SEC&#8217;s stance on where the line between security and non-security lies becomes a subject of litigation. Ethereum Paradigm Shift According to Bloomberg’s report, sources familiar with the matter claim the SEC is unlikely to block the ETFs based on futures contracts for Ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Related Reading: More Blood Ahead? Why Bitcoin Could Crash Further If It Loses $26,000 Nearly a dozen companies, including prominent names like Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill, and ProShares, have filed applications to launch these ETFs. While it remains unclear which funds will receive approval, insiders suggest that several may be granted the green light as early as October. This anticipated approval of an Ethereum futures ETF by the SEC could have far-reaching implications for the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies.  The SEC&#8217;s reluctance to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies has spurred speculation that derivative-based products would offer a potential pathway to market access.  On this matter, crypto analyst Adam Cochran has highlighted that the SEC potentially approving an ETF based on Ethereum futures contracts implicitly acknowledges that Ethereum itself is not considered a security.  This decision challenges the notion that Ethereum should be regulated as a traditional financial security, considering its proof-of-stake mechanism, purpose, and usage. Cochran further believes that the SEC&#8217;s approval of an Ethereum futures ETF bolsters Ethereum&#8217;s non-security status and sets a precedent that could impact other cryptocurrencies facing regulatory scrutiny.  The ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Grayscale Investments over rejecting their Bitcoin trust&#8217;s conversion into an ETF highlights the agency&#8217;s concerns regarding investor protection, manipulation risks, and price volatility.  However, this approval could provide a compelling argument in favor of distinguishing between the underlying asset and how it is sold, bolstering the Torres Doctrine and potentially influencing the outcome of similar cases, such as the XRP appeal. The SEC&#8217;s approval of an Ethereum futures ETF holds tremendous significance for the cryptocurrency industry. If confirmed, it would mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a non-security, further solidifying its position as a commodity or currency.  Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH The decision also highlights the regulatory challenge of defining clear boundaries between securities and non-securities in crypto.  As the industry evolves, approving an Ethereum futures ETF could shape the regulatory landscape, paving the way for increased adoption and investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. However, the news is not entirely favorable for ETH as it trades at $1,660, following a downward trend similar to Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. The market has experienced a substantial outflow of liquidity, leading to a significant decline in most digital currencies. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has declined more than 4% after breaking its previously established range between $1,895 and $1,830. Additionally, it has suffered a notable loss of 10% within the seven-day timeframe. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a shocking twist, Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, has plunged to levels not seen since the early days of 2023. The battle-hardened Bitcoin bulls have suffered another crushing defeat, leaving investors on edge, anxiously pondering whether the dreaded sub $20,000 abyss will haunt them again. With relentless uncertainty gripping the market, the burning question lingers: Has Bitcoin truly hit rock bottom, or is BTC in for an even darker descent? Bitcoin Path Aligned With 1930 Stock Market Crash According to Mike McGlone, Bloomberg&#8217;s Senior Macro Strategist, Bitcoin&#8217;s current trajectory bears an uncanny resemblance to the US stock market crash of 1930.  In his analysis, McGlone highlights the clear rollover pattern and downward trend evident in Bitcoin&#8217;s 100-week moving average (MA) graphic.  The implications of this pattern, combined with the fundamental principle of “not going against” the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the potential for reversion of one of history&#8217;s best-performing assets, warrant serious consideration. Related Reading: Valkyrie Taps Into Ethereum Momentum With New ETF Filing Adding to the potential headwinds for Bitcoin, US Treasury two-year notes yield nearly 5%, marking a historic high in the crypto realm. Bitcoin, born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and during a period of highly low-interest rates, may now be facing an extended period of retracement. According to Mcglone, in an era of near-zero and negative interest rates, the allure of a digital equivalent to gold can be captivating. However, the landscape is shifting as the world&#8217;s safest securities offer approximately 10% total return over two years. This shift may pressure the prices of riskier assets, including Bitcoin. The significance of the US Treasury two-year note&#8217;s approximate 5% yield has historical parallels. It harkens back to before the financial crisis and the birth of Bitcoin. This correlation suggests potential headwinds for most risk assets.  McGlone&#8217;s analysis, focusing on the 100-week moving averages, reinforces the prevailing downward biases observed in Bitcoin, particularly when compared to the steepest Treasury yield competition witnessed in almost two decades. Analyst Warns Of Potential Sub-$20,000 Levels Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price trajectory has left many investors uncertain about its future, with some analysts drawing parallels to historical price crashes. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan has shared insights on the current market conditions. Since the beginning of the bear market, Alan has been closely monitoring Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements and sharing a chart that suggests the potential for retesting sub-$20,000 levels.  While acknowledging the possibility of short-term scalping opportunities, Alan advises caution and limited exposure to preserve capital for what he believes could be a generational buying opportunity. Notably, Alan emphasizes that he does not believe the bottom has been reached for Bitcoin.  The chart highlights various downrange levels, showcasing Alan&#8217;s belief in the potential for further downside movement.  As depicted in Alan&#8217;s chart, the Bitcoin market faces a critical juncture where the strength of support at $25,000 is crucial for the bullish case in the near term. Failure to hold this level could lead to a revisit of the December 2017 bull market peak at $19,800. Adding to concerns for Bitcoin, there is the possibility of continuing the downside momentum, potentially reaching a four-year low around the June 2019 bull market top of $13,800. This scenario would catch many bulls off guard, especially considering the prevailing belief throughout 2023 that the crypto winter was ending.

Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan has shared <a href="https://twitter.com/KAProductions/status/1692505278577619298?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insights </a>on the current market conditions.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the bear market, Alan has been closely monitoring Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements and sharing a chart that suggests the potential for retesting sub-$20,000 levels. </p>
<p>While acknowledging the possibility of short-term scalping opportunities, Alan advises caution and limited exposure to preserve capital for what he believes could be a generational buying opportunity. Notably, Alan emphasizes that he does not believe the bottom has been reached for Bitcoin. </p>

<p>The chart highlights various downrange levels, showcasing Alan&#8217;s belief in the potential for further downside movement. </p>
<p>As depicted in Alan&#8217;s chart, the Bitcoin market faces a critical juncture where the strength of support at $25,000 is crucial for the bullish case in the near term. Failure to hold this level could lead to a revisit of the December 2017 bull market peak at $19,800.</p>
<p>Adding to concerns for Bitcoin, there is the possibility of continuing the downside momentum, potentially reaching a four-year low around the June 2019 bull market top of $13,800. This scenario would catch many bulls off guard, especially considering the prevailing belief throughout 2023 that the crypto winter was ending.</p>

<p>The momentum has shifted for the most prominent cryptocurrency in the market, and the bulls must defend their remaining support levels to avert an extended decline throughout the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>BTC has briefly reclaimed the $26,000 threshold; however, it remains down by over 7% in the past 24 hours.</p>

This price move resulted in more than $50 million being wiped away from the asset&#8217;s market capitalization in the past day. Algorand&#8217;s market cap stands at a valuation of $755 million, a 7.1% drop from its earlier record of $808 million on Thursday. Despite the bloodbath the asset&#8217;s market cap and price currently suffer, its trading volume has moved in the opposite direction.

This isn&#8217;t surprising as it indicates a potential violent sell-off.

					<description><![CDATA[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reopened old wounds after a federal Judge grants the regulator’s request to file a new appeal against Ripple.   Ripple And SEC Legal Battle Continues Ripple, the crypto firm behind XRP cryptocurrency, had secured a partial victory in July in its case against the SEC that had raged on for almost three years. However, the regulator has not taken this lying down as on Thursday, August 17, Judge Analisa Torres reportedly gave official approval to the SEC’s motion to file an interlocutory appeal against XRP cryptocurrency.  Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout According to the court proceedings, the SEC will file its motion in court from Friday, August 18 until Friday, September 1. This gives the regulator the opportunity and ample time to develop and provide a compelling argument for its allegations of XRP being a security.  This is because the appeal will be focused on the judge’s decision on Ripple’s programmatic sales and direct sales and offerings of XRP tokens as a trade for goods and services.  The new filing is not an official approval of an appeal by the judge but a gateway for the SEC to file its motion. But regardless, this new development could be bad for Ripple who recently celebrated Judge Torres’ declaration that secondary sales of XRP did not count as a security.  Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, and Chief Learning Officer, Stuart Alderoty have addressed the SEC’s decision to put forward an appeal motion. They publicly opposed the SEC’s interlocutory appeal, detailing that the Judge’s ruling on July 13 refutes any allegations the SEC may harbor of XRP being a security.  “We oppose the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal. There is no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal,” Alderoty stated in a Twitter post.  On his part, CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented:  Reminder &#8211; the request for appeal (even if granted) doesn’t change the fact that XRP is not a security. That’s not up for debate/trial. But the SEC continues to claim that Chris and I acted recklessly in believing that XRP is not a security. That’s utter nonsense.

These two issues involve controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed,” the SEC said in its new filing.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price range has been obliterated as the crypto market was corrected into a final support line. Volatility in the sector was compressed for weeks, and many were expecting some action in the short term, but the drop caught market participants by surprise as BTC kept on pushing lower. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,400, with an 8% loss in the last 24 hours. BTC recorded a 10% correction in the previous seven days, while some altcoins experienced a 17% and even 20% loss on BTC’s crash. Bitcoin Ready To Re-Test Support, Your Longs Could Be In Danger Bitcoin’s sudden crash into critical support around $25,000 saw over $1 billion in long liquidations. The number of traders waiting for a breakout at $30,000 provided the downside with a lot of liquidity, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Therefore, the selling pressure was exacerbated as BTC kept on dropping. The recent crash was worse than the one experienced when crypto exchange FTX collapsed, and the crypto sector nuked all long positions by collapsing below $30,000. Similar to that occasion, the Bitcoin price took some time to recover. According to Material Indicators and its analyst Keith Alan, the same could happen in the current market conditions. Via his official X account, Alan stated that the BTC price bottom it’s not in. The chart below shows that the analyst pointed out some key levels to watch while the number one cryptocurrency by market caps hovers at $26,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidations Top $500 Million Amid $1 Billion Crypto Decimation As the chart shows, the levels pointed out by Alan include the 2017 bull market top at $20,000, the 2019 bull market top at around $14,000, and even the COVID-19 lows at $3,850. The analyst stated the following regarding BTC’s potential for further losses: (…) I can build an argument for every downrange level shown. I personally think there is a high probability of retesting sub $20k levels.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that there won&#8217;t be opportunities to scalp longs along the way because whales still want to distribute as high as they can.

<p>As the chart shows, the levels pointed out by Alan include the 2017 bull market top at $20,000, the 2019 bull market top at around $14,000, and even the COVID-19 lows at $3,850. The analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/KAProductions/status/1692505278577619298" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a> the following regarding BTC’s potential for further losses:</p>
<blockquote><p>(…) I can build an argument for every downrange level shown. I personally think there is a high probability of retesting sub $20k levels.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that there won&#8217;t be opportunities to scalp longs along the way because whales still want to distribute as high as they can.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency often referred to as &#8216;digital gold&#8217;, has been on a roller-coaster ride lately. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has transformed from an obscure digital token into an economic powerhouse, drawing attention from retail investors to global financial institutions. However, as recently observed over the past 24 hours, the asset&#8217;s resistance is being tested as a report from Santiment reveals chances of it plunging below the critical $26,000 mark. Whale Activity Driving Bitcoin Price Movement Whale activity, or large-scale investors, has historically played a pivotal role in determining the direction of any crypto asset, and currently, Bitcoin is not an exception. Blockchain intelligence firm, Santiment, recently shed light on this phenomenon via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculators Retreat As Long-Term Holders Double Down Since $69,000 Peak According to the firm, the rapid price decline of Bitcoin might have been influenced by heightened whale transaction activity. And despite the substantial loss BTC has suffered in value over the past day, Santiment noted &#8220;the dust has far from settled.&#8221; This statement in an actual sense means Bitcoin&#8217;s price decline might just be starting, as according to Santiment, &#8220;whales are very active on this dump&#8221; and &#8220;the amount of large wallets is not falling.&#8221; The Blockchain intelligence firm further revealed that the surge in large transactions had commenced even before the significant market drop, hinting at the possibility of a sustained price drop. 🐳 The dust has far from settled after #crypto markets had one of its sharpest price drops of 2023. We are seeing a large amount of $1M+ $BTC transactions, indicating whales are very active on this dump. But the amount of large wallets is not falling. 👍 https://t.co/WtXYUPdFOf pic.twitter.com/gdrbUD1wFO — Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 18, 2023 BTC Plunge Below $26,000 Imminent? Given the fundamentals pointed out by Santiment, Bitcoin could see a further plummet potentially dropping it below the $26,000 mark. Moreover, from a technical perspective, such a price move may not actually be far from happening. Looking at Bitcoin&#8217;s chart on the 1-day timeframe, the asset has a two-way movement of taking out liquidity which is the upside and downside. However, the likelihood of tapping into the downside liquidity appears more convincing. Given the current market trajectory, which leans bearish, each significant price movement typically correlates with liquidation efforts. As the market currently trends downwards, the most immediate liquidity target seems to be the wick beneath the $26,000 zone.

The wick represents the highest and lowest prices of an asset during a specific time frame, while the main body of the candlestick indicates the opening and closing prices As for its current price, Bitcoin is changing hands at $26,468 at the time of writing, down by nearly 10% over the past 24 hours. The asset has made significant movement in the past day recording a 24-hour high of $28,507 and a 24-low of $25,649. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

Shibarium had on August 17 paused block production following the traffic surge, which overwhelmed the blockchain upon mainnet launch.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu DAO Gets Serious With New Advisory And Investment Firm Close to $1.7 million in bridged funds had reportedly gotten stuck on the Shibarium bridge, with lead developer Shytoshi Kusama confirming that the funds were irrecoverable.

He further emphasized the team’s commitment to position Shibarium as one of the major players in the DeFi world.

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows the Bitcoin market sentiment has plunged into fear as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has observed a crash to the $26,500 level. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Points At &#8220;Fear&#8221; In The Market The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. This metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 for displaying the sentiment. All values above the 54 mark suggest the presence of greed among the investors, while those below 46 imply a majority mentality of fear. The region between these cutoffs reflects the neutral sentiment. As for how the index calculates the sentiment, Alternative.me, the creator of the metric, explains that it takes into account several different factors. Namely; volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends are what the indicator currently makes use of to pinpoint the market mentality. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8217;s value looks like right now: The value of the metric seems to be inside the fear territory at the moment &#124; Source: Alternative As you can see above, the index&#8217;s value is 37 currently, which suggests that the majority of the investors are fearful. This latest value of the indicator reflects a new shift in the sector, as prior to today, the indicator had been stuck inside the neutral territory for more than three weeks straight. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidations Top $500 Million Amid $1 Billion Crypto Decimation The below chart displays the trend in the fear and greed index over the past year. Looks like the value of the metric has taken a plunge recently &#124; Source: Alternative From the graph, it&#8217;s visible how sharp this latest drop in the metric has been. In a flash, the market sentiment went from being completely neutral (50), to firmly inside the fear territory (37). The reason behind this hit to the investor mentality has been the sharp crash that Bitcoin has observed during the past day, as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has now slumped below $26,500. Earlier, when the index was consolidating in neutral territory, investors had been hesitant and undecided. But with this price action, it would appear that their mind has been made up, and they think that the asset would go down even lower. Historically, the market has actually tended to make moves that the majority of the holders aren&#8217;t expecting. The harder investors lean toward any one direction (fear or greed), the more probable price action of the opposite type becomes. The Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index also has two sub-sentiments inside fear and greed called extreme fear and extreme greed. These take place at values below 25 and above 75, respectively. Cyclical bottoms and tops in the asset have usually always formed whenever the market has been inside these zones, showcasing the aforementioned effect in action. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Volatility Continue? These Metrics Say Yes As the market hasn&#8217;t yet dipped too deep into the fear region, the probability of a bottom is likewise not raised too much yet. Back in March, however, Bitcoin did manage to find its bottom when the investors were fearful to a degree not much greater than right now. It now remains to be seen how the market sentiment will develop in the coming days, and if BTC will be able to find its bottom off the back of this fearful situation. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,400, down 10% in the last week.

<p>Historically, the market has actually tended to make moves that the majority of the holders <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-xrp-sentiment-plummets-greedy-fearful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">aren&#8217;t expecting</a>. The harder investors lean toward any one direction (fear or greed), the more probable price action of the opposite type becomes.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index also has two sub-sentiments inside fear and greed called extreme fear and extreme greed. These take place at values below 25 and above 75, respectively. Cyclical bottoms and tops in the asset have usually always formed whenever the market has been inside these zones, showcasing the aforementioned effect in action.</p>

<p>As the market hasn&#8217;t yet dipped too deep into the fear region, the probability of a bottom is likewise not raised too much yet. Back in March, however, Bitcoin did manage to find its bottom when the investors were fearful to a degree not much greater than right now.</p>
<p>It now remains to be seen how the market sentiment will develop in the coming days, and if BTC will be able to find its bottom off the back of this fearful situation.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,400, down 10% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a filing dated August 4, Valkyrie applied to add an Ethereum futures ETF to its Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF). However, it would seem this move was pushed back by the SEC as the asset manager has now filed a separate application to offer an Ether futures ETF.   Valkyrie Moves To Offer Ethereum Futures ETF In an application dated August 16, Valkyrie seeks the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) approval to offer an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).  If approved, the fund will not directly invest in Ether. Instead, it will focus on purchasing several ether futures contracts to match the total value of the ether underlying the futures contracts with the net assets of the fund.  Related Reading: Post-Hack Shenanigans: Curve (CRV) To Launch On TRON Following $2 Million Investment While this fund is relatively similar to the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has existed since 2021, it differs from the Spot Bitcoin ETF, which prominent institutional firms have filed for. Spot ETFs track the crypto asset&#8217;s price, while futures ETFs focus on the asset’s future contracts.  Valkyrie categorically noted this fact as part of its application and stated that investors looking to invest in the price of ether directly should consider investments other than this particular fund. The application also highlighted the risks involved in investing in this fund as, according to Valkyrie, “the Fund’s investments could decline rapidly, including to zero.” As such, investors should understand that they could lose their entire investment.  As is common with applications such as this, applicants must prove to the SEC that the underlying asset has a regulated market of significant size. And Valkyrie’s filing stated that its fund would be guided by the futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  ETH price recovers to $1,685 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com No First Mover Advantage? Valkyrie failed to clarify the status of its initial filing in its most recent application. The asset manager had previously tried to add ETH futures contracts to its Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) in a bid to gain a first-mover advantage over other applicants.  Several other asset managers, including Bitwise, ProShares, Grayscale, and Volatility Shares, have also applied to offer an Ethereum futures ETF. However, it remains uncertain in what order the SEC is likely to approve (if it does) these applications, especially with this recent development.  Related Reading: Ledger Users Can Now Buy Crypto Directly Using PayPal Just like Cathie Wood has suggested regarding the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications, the SEC can approve multiple applications at once, which will likely eliminate the first mover advantage, or it can decide to approve them in the order in which these applications came in.  Despite expectations that the regulator will approve an Ether ETF this year, the probability of the SEC approving any of these applications remains uncertain as optimism dwindles.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
