It is one of the first debt Security Tokens aimed at retail investors who wish to invest alongside institutional investors in the most sought-after real estate developments in the United States. The Tokens will have a 5-year life, earn an annualized cash yield of 10%, and a 5-year IRR of 150%. RMCG has aligned with diversified developers like </span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Donahue_Peebles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donahue Peebles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the largest minority real estate developer in the United States, and </span><a href="https://www.rpcholdings.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Royal Palm Companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of Florida&#8217;s premier real estate development firms, to invest the net proceeds of the FraXion Security Token Offering (STO).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demetrius Ford, RMCG’s Managing Director of Digital Assets, stated that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a very exciting time for RMCG and FraXion, but an even more exciting time for retail real estate investors who have traditionally been locked out of institutional-grade real estate investment opportunities due to high minimum investments and other barriers to entry. FraXion is all about access. By pooling the investment capital of many, we can invest substantial sums as one, which grants our investors entry into the institutional world.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FraXion has already sold 250,000 tokens within the first weeks of the STO, and the company has also secured a funding round of $250,000 from Park Place Consultants to assist with the marketing and promotion of the FraXion Token. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited for the launch of the Fraxion Token and the opportunity it brings to the marketplace; a new way of Real Estate Investing. We are humbled and honored to be part of such an extraordinary team at Randolph &amp; Main, and these are the types of projects we look to support.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Rashidah &#8220;Roz&#8221; Billups, Principal at Park Place Consultants.</span></p>
<p><b>Tokenization of Real Estate</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FraXion Token is a game changer in the Fintech space. Tokenization of high-quality real estate, coupled with the cutting-edge technology of the blockchain, is attractive to investors that usually shy away from the crypto market. FraXion is a cutting-edge platform for investors to build generational wealth in Real Estate using Blockchain. FraXion creates “Digital Asset Partners” and allows token holders to invest in prime income-producing properties as well as land suitable for immediate commercial development through strategic alliances and partnerships with some of the most successful real estate developers in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FraXion Ecosystem provides fractionalization, liquidity and access to global investors. The FraXion Token is an application blockchain asset that is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Ownership of a blockchain asset is established by recording on the blockchain ledger the owner’s unique identifier address and the amount of the asset held by such an address.</span></p>
<p><b>More About FraXion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FraXion is a non-traditional real estate investment platform utilizing the latest blockchain technologies that will provide individuals, not just institutions, with access to distinguished real estate development ventures, side-by-side with large development groups and some of the most recognized institutional partners in the world. FraXion&#8217;s innovative real estate investment vehicle can diversify investment portfolios and provide assurance that each investment dollar is backed by tangible real property with the intent of promoting investor confidence.</span></p>

According to the Namibian Finance Minister, safeguarding the interests of consumers and combating market abuse are some of the reasons why parliament has taken this step.</strong></p>
<h2>Mitigating Money Laundering Risks</h2>
<p>The Namibian parliament is reported to have passed a bill aiming to legalize cryptocurrencies and establish a framework for regulating these types of assets. According to the country’s Finance Minister, Iipumbu Shiimi, the law is expected to help authorities safeguard the interests of consumers and to combat market abuse.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://namibian.com.na/parliament-approves-law-to-regulate-cryptocurrency/">remarks</a> published by The Namibian, Shiimi also suggested that the law will enable authorities to deal with money laundering risks associated with digital assets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim of the legislation was to create a regulatory framework to protect consumers, and the risk of money laundering is mitigated,&#8221; the Minister reportedly said.</p>
<p>The legislative body’s move to regulate digital assets seemingly contradicts the Bank of Namibia (BON)’s which declared in the second half of 2022 that cryptocurrencies had no legal tender status in the country. The Namibian central bank however <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/namibian-central-bank-virtual-assets-remain-without-legal-tender-status-but-merchants-can-still-accept-them-as-payment/">said</a> it would not stand in the way of merchants and traders who accepted crypto assets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Namibian parliament’s passage of the bill has been lauded as a step in the right direction. However, some Namibian experts like Jesaya Hano-Oshike warned the enactment of the law should not result in unnecessary obstacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legislation should not stifle innovation in the space, but rather encourage and foster innovation when it is done in the scope of the legislation,&#8221; Hano-Oshike.</p>
<p>Financial analyst Arney Tjaronda welcomed the passage of the bill but said authorities must not ignore digital assets’ likely impact on the country’s financial system.</p>

Crypto exchanges that fail to abide by the requirement will either be fined or closed down, Unathi Kamlana, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority commissioner, said. </strong></p>
<h2>The Importance of Regulation</h2>
<p>The South African financial services regulator, Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), has said cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country must secure operating licenses before the end of the year. According to Unathi Kamlana, the FSCA commissioner, entities that fail to abide by this requirement will either be fined or closed down.</p>
<p>The latest crypto-related comments by Kamlana just a few months after a fintech analyst with the South African Reserve Bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-regulations-governing-tokenized-deposits-and-crypto-assets-in-south-africa-set-to-effect-in-january-2025/">revealed</a> that regulations governing tokenized deposits and crypto assets will become effective on Jan. 1, 2025. However, the analyst warned that regulators will still need to learn and understand the risks that come with the technology which underpins digital assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his remarks during an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/south-africa-to-require-crypto-exchanges-licensing-by-year-end">interview</a>, Kamlana explained why the regulator has finally taken this step. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FSCA commissioner, however, acknowledged that the effectiveness of this and related measures will only be determined after a certain period of time. According to the Bloomberg report, the FSCA has already received 20 applications and more will be received before the Nov. 30 deadline.</p>

<p>In addition to seeking to regulate the crypto industry, Kamlana also revealed his organization’s involvement in efforts aimed at raising the public’s awareness of crypto products. He also offered his thoughts on why the public needs crypto education.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an area where you can lose quite a bit of money, so you must think twice before exposing yourself to it,&#8221; Kamlana reportedly said.</p>

<h2>Iranian President Calls for De-Dollarization at SCO Summit</h2>
<p>Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi emphasized the need to de-dollarize in his remarks at the 23rd virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State on Tuesday. Iran became a new permanent member of the SCO at the summit, which was hosted by India and chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>The summit was also attended by China’s President Xi Jinping, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kyrgyzstan’s President Sadyr Japarov, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon, and Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev.</p>
<p>During his address at the summit, the Iranian president underscored the importance of establishing a fairer world order in which the U.S. dollar is no longer the only dominant currency. “The Western hegemonic powers, by resorting to economic coercion and sanctions, have jeopardized the security and economic prosperity and the principles of fair trade in the world,” Raisi was quoted by the Tehran Times as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Relying on the experience of the past decades, it is now quite evident that, along with militarism, what forms the basis of the Western domination system has been the dominance of the dollar,” he continued, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore any attempt to shape a fair international system requires the removal of this instrument of dominance in intra-regional relations.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Expanding the use of national currencies in international trade and financial exchanges between the members of this organization and their business partners requires more serious attention,&#8221; the Iranian leader further stressed. &#8220;The Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes any move to introduce financial payment instruments based on modern technologies to facilitate financial exchanges between members and business partners, especially in multilateral frameworks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iran’s president additionally noted that the SCO member countries can build unity and peace by promoting civilization based on ethics, spirituality, justice, rationality, and respect for human dignity. He opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is a symbol of this ‘great family of civilizations,’ is now standing in a position that can establish new horizons of regional convergence and security-building cooperation.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Regarding respect for the sovereignty of nations: multilateralism in the contemporary world means joint efforts and synergy of independent countries to achieve common good. Such a perception of multilateralism is in conflict with security alliances to promote violence and hostility with other countries. Real multilateralism is for the benefit of the nations and not for the powers. In the light of respecting the sovereignty of countries and relying on mutually beneficial cooperation, the lofty goals of security and sustainable development can be realized,” Raisi further said.</p>
<p>At the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin also pushed for the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-push-for-increased-settlements-in-national-currencies/">use of national currencies</a> in trade settlements. According to Putin, more than 80 percent of commercial transactions between Russia and China are carried out in Russian rubles and Chinese yuan.</p>

<h2>Bolivia Calls for De-Dollarization at Mercosur Summit</h2>
<p>Bolivia’s President Luis Alberto Arce Catacora (Lucho Arce) called for de-dollarization and increased strategic alliances with international organizations, including the BRICS economic bloc at the 62nd Summit of Heads of State of Mercosur and Associated States in Puerto Iguazú, Argentina.</p>
<p>The Southern Common Market, also known as Mercosur, is a South American trade bloc whose full members are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Venezuela joined as a full member in 2012 but was suspended indefinitely in late 2016. Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname are associate members of Mercosur, with Bolivia currently in the process of becoming a full member.</p>
<p>The summit was attended by Argentina&#8217;s President Alberto Fernández, Brazil&#8217;s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Uruguay&#8217;s President Luis Lacalle Pou, and Paraguay&#8217;s President Mario Abdo Benítez. Bolivia’s president and the president-elect of Paraguay, Santiago Peña, also attended.</p>
<p>The Bolivian president tweeted Tuesday at the conclusion of the meeting (translated by Google):</p>
<blockquote><p>Our region is seriously affected by the restrictions imposed by the northern financial system, which limits financing options, making it necessary to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar and diversify our economic relations.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We must seek strategic alliances with other international actors, such as China, in a Eurasian and Asian bloc that, organized within the BRICS and other integration mechanisms, are projected as spaces for the construction of a new world economic order,” he added. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Regarding Bolivia becoming a full member of Mercosur, President Arce stated: “We believe that Bolivia&#8217;s accession to Mercosur represents a unique opportunity to strengthen integration, expand trade and regional cooperation.” He emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are experiencing a crucial moment of transition towards a multipolar world that guarantees a balance of powers and respects the principle of non-interference.</p></blockquote>

<p>Commenting on Brazil taking over the rotational presidency of Mercosur on Tuesday, the Bolivian leader said: “We also convey our best wishes to the incoming Brazilian presidency. We are sure that under the leadership of President Lula, guided by his integrating vision, Mercosur will continue to advance to respond to the enormous challenges that our times present.”</p>
<p>Lula has expressed strong support for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-urges-developing-countries-to-abandon-dollar-as-global-reserve-currency/">abandoning the U.S. dollar</a> and adopting national currencies in trade settlements. He also supports the creation of a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-voices-support-for-brics-currency/">common BRICS currency</a>. Last month, he announced his intention to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-to-push-de-dollarization-agenda-at-brics-meeting/">discuss</a> de-dollarization at the upcoming BRICS meeting.</p>

The financial regulator maintains that Saxo Bank&#x2019;s portfolio of crypto assets falls &#x201C;outside the legal business area of &#x200B;&#x200B;financial institutions&#x201D; and is in violation of the country&#x2019;s Financial Business Act.</strong></p>
<h2>Danish Financial Regulator Insists &#x2018;Unregulated Trading in Crypto-Assets Can Create Distrust in the Financial System&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The Danish financial regulatory authority, tasked with overseeing financial markets in Denmark, has <a href="https://www.finanstilsynet.dk/Tilsyn/Tilsynsreaktioner/Paabud/2023/Saxo_bank_050723">directed</a> Saxo Bank to liquidate its crypto asset portfolio. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saxo-bank-founder-lars-christensen-is-waiting-for-a-cryptocurrency-panic-sell-off/">Saxo Bank</a>, an investment bank established in 1992, specializes in online trading and investment. In 2017, Saxo Bank incorporated crypto assets into its services, enabling trading of digital currencies like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>
<p>The bank also offers customers access to crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), allowing investors to gain exposure to prominent cryptocurrencies. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) asserts that Saxo Bank, in addition to offering crypto services, maintains &#x201C;a portfolio of crypto assets, which are held as a hedge to offset the market risk associated with the bank&#x2019;s crypto asset products.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The DFSA maintains that trading in crypto assets is not listed in Annex 1 of the Financial Business Act. Moreover, the activity is deemed unacceptable as an ancillary bank business due to concerns regarding financial stability. The regulator believes that &#x201C;unregulated trading in crypto-assets can create distrust in the financial system.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Hence, the DFSA has now directed Saxo to &#x201C;dispose of its own holdings of crypto assets,&#x201D; citing that holding cryptocurrencies for the bank&#x2019;s own account exceeds the legal boundaries established for Danish financial institutions. Nevertheless, the DFSA does not specify a deadline or indicate in the press release the timeframe for Saxo&#x2019;s compliance with the recent ruling.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/05/denmarks-financial-watchdog-orders-saxo-bank-to-shed-its-crypto-holdings/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines">statement</a> provided to Coindesk, a Saxo spokesperson expressed that the financial institution will &#x201C;naturally take the decision of the Financial Supervisory Authority into account and will read it thoroughly to consider how we otherwise respond to it.&#x201D;</p>
<p><em><strong>What impact do you think the liquidation of Saxo Bank&#x2019;s crypto assets will have on the broader adoption and regulation of cryptocurrencies in Denmark and beyond? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

This has not only reduced a significant portion of the congestion but also led to a decrease in onchain fees within the same period.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Fees and Unconfirmed Transactions Slide Lower</h2>
<p>Although Bitcoin&#x2019;s backlog of transactions remains above 145,000, data indicates that miners have managed to clear more than half of the congestion during this week. <a href="https://archive.fo/TWy4i#selection-1733.1-1733.6">Archived information</a> from <a href="https://mempool.space">mempool.space</a> reveals that on June 27, 2023, a total of 332,508 pending transactions awaited confirmation.</p>
<p>Additionally, a high-priority onchain fee would cost users $1.29 per transaction, with 194 blocks needed to be mined to clear 100% of the backlog. With today&#x2019;s backlog consisting of <a href="https://archive.ph/FShQz#selection-1733.1-1733.6">145,240 transfers</a> still pending, only 94 blocks must be mined to alleviate congestion.</p>

<p>As of July 5, 2023, data demonstrates that a high-priority transaction fee is now $0.77 per transfer. Metrics also indicate that <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_transactions_per_day#:~:text=Basic%20Info,registered%20on%20the%20Bitcoin%20network.">daily onchain transaction confirmations</a> range between 309,000 and 445,000. Current block times are faster than the previous ten-minute average at eight minutes and 40 seconds.</p>

<p>Over the last week, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y">data</a> from bitinfocharts.com reflects a decline from an average of $2.73 per transaction to a current average of 0.000062 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $1.87 per transaction. This represents a drop of 31% in average onchain fees during this time frame.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3y">Median-sized fees</a> have also decreased from $1.06 to 0.000025 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $0.77 per transaction. In the meantime, the Ordinal inscription trend persists as inscriptions approach 15 million; approximately <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/fa2ace2d9a31a1b3dd63e35ccce59ce5a32206c407a7e002a9ffb17cd3fa68dci0">14,834,677</a> inscriptions are linked to the Bitcoin blockchain at this time.</p>

Moreover, amidst the top assets ranked by market capitalization, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> soared an impressive 14 positions, climbing to become the 12th largest asset based on market valuation since the conclusion of 2022. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Defies Odds Among the World&#x2019;s Most Valuable Assets and Currencies</h2>
<p>In stark contrast to the challenging &#x201C;Crypto Winter&#x201D; experienced throughout 2022, bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience this year. In the first half of 2023, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> surged by over 80% against the U.S. dollar, solidifying its position as one of the standout performers among a vast array of global assets.</p>
<p>This impressive achievement was highlighted by Colin Wu, a Chinese journalist known for blockchain reporting, who took to Twitter on July 1 to share the market performance of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> alongside a multitude of other prominent assets.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Data shows that in the first half of 2023, Bitcoin increased by 83.8%, ranking first, far exceeding other major assets in the world,&#x201D; the crypto reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1675352468199460864?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;The Nasdaq Index rose 31.7%, ranking second, and other major national stock markets rose. The price of natural gas fell by 37%, ranking the bottom, and the prices of other energy sources all fell.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Colin Wu&#x2019;s tweet provided an intriguing comparison of assets against <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, encompassing a wide range of influential players such as the Nasdaq Index, Nikkei 225 Index, Germany DAX Index, Euro Stoxx 50, S&P 500, Shanghai Composite, and major currencies like the yuan, yen, pound, ruble, and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes.</p>
<p>As of July 5, 2023, at 10:40 a.m. (ET), the numbers speak for themselves: <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has skyrocketed by a staggering 80.96% against the U.S. dollar since December 27, 2022. Back then, each unit of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was valued at $16,768, but today, it has firmly surpassed the $30K threshold.</p>
<p>Delving into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221227173918/https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/">archived data</a> from December 27, 2022, we discover that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was once ranked as the 26th largest asset globally based on market capitalization. Over the course of the last half-year, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has soared to claim the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/">12th spot</a> among the world&#x2019;s most valuable assets.</p>

<p>Currently, it stands above TSMC, the prominent semiconductor manufacturer, and just below Berkshire Hathaway, the renowned investment firm helmed by the financial moguls <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/warren-buffett-sees-no-option-other-than-us-dollar-as-reserve-currency-but-warns-fed-cant-just-print-money-indefinitely/">Warren Buffet</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/charlie-munger-raises-concerns-over-troubled-commercial-property-loans-at-us-banks/">Charlie Munger. </a></p>
<p>On Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway&#x2019;s market capitalization is above <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s by $152 billion. Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-BRK.A/">lackluster performance</a> during this period pales in comparison to the gains achieved by <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in the first half of the year, as Berkshire shares only witnessed a modest rise of 7.54%.</p>

The token fell for a third straight session, whilst the overall global crypto market cap also slipped on Wednesday. Monero was another notable token to fall in today&#x2019;s session.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>)</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>) slid by as much as 9% on Wednesday, as traders continued to capture profits following a recent bull run.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency surged to a 15-month high last Friday, after climbing to a peak at $329.71.</p>
<p>However, the price dropped to an intraday low at $258.17 in today&#x2019;s session, a day after trading at $281.46.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> has now dropped for a third straight session, a sell-off which started after the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a ceiling at 81.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 65.73, which is marginally below a floor around the 66.00 level.</p>
<p>Overall, the decline seems to be a result of profit taking which came once the RSI moved deep into overbought territory.</p>

<h2>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>)</h2>
<p>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>) was also in the red in today&#x2019;s session, dropping lower for a second consecutive session.</p>
<p>Following a peak at $169.52 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>/USD moved to a bottom at $161.89 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The decline comes as the token failed to break out of a ceiling at $173.00 on Monday, after hitting its highest point since February 4.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this was also due to the RSI, which was unable to move past a resistance level of 73.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is now tracking at 63.86, and appears to be headed to a floor at the 58.00 mark.</p>
<p>Should the index move to this floor, there is a possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> will drop to $160.00.</p>

This growth has propelled the network to secure the second-highest number of monthly NFT sales consistently since then. However, despite this impressive ascent within the past four months, Bitcoin&#x2019;s overall NFT sales figures still trail behind those of seven other blockchain networks.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Blockchain Gains Momentum in NFT Sales, Ranks Eighth Among Leading Networks</h2>
<p>Ethereum has long reigned as the dominant force in NFT sales and continues to hold that title. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has been making impressive strides in climbing the ranks among nearly two dozen blockchain networks when it comes to NFT transactions.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://archive.ph/IGhf9">data</a> recorded by <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">cryptoslam.io</a>, out of the 22 blockchain networks that have documented NFT sales, Bitcoin currently stands as the eighth largest. It&#x2019;s worth noting that NFT sales data for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> started on February 7, precisely 148 days ago, whereas many other blockchains have been recording NFT sales for a considerably longer period of time.</p>

<p>Outpacing Bitcoin in terms of total sales volume are several prominent chains, namely Ethereum, Ronin, Solana, Flow, Polygon, Cardano, and Wax. The sales generated from the Wax blockchain alone surpass Bitcoin&#x2019;s overall figures by $25.59 million.</p>
<p>Around 119 days ago, roughly on March 8, Bitcoin&#x2019;s sales gained significant momentum. While Bitcoin-based NFTs do not currently claim any positions in the top ten most expensive NFT sales, an <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/mint-brc-20-nfts/mint/3878c40c1880eb94d43e104ea96b86857710a1611de5bc9349eee0802ab44fdei0">NFT</a> rooted in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> secures the 11th spot, having fetched $4.7 million three months ago.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the BTC-based <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/space-pepes/mint/2c2433f34d6d67cd157f86c2bccb1144fa57b467694aff5be4848456ab654c8fi0">Space Pepe #8,253</a> claimed the 12th position, achieving a notable sale of $4.56 million just two months ago. Bitcoin NFTs also command the 13th and 14th position in terms of the top NFT collectible sales of all time.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Artifacts <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/btc-artifacts/mint/43fbc9e2d59c5cbd2c74563f71a470e69ade3ef6f832f1fbdb813e548bab1791i0">TNT #20,817</a> commanded a $4.48 million price tag three months ago, while an <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/uncategorized-ordinals/mint/a8118776e8c900a2bdc42749087ffdd418664e8f87473a332577d01a4e1755ffi0">Uncategorized Ordinal</a> fetched $4.45 million just two months prior. Additionally, another <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/uncategorized-ordinals/mint/7558f6a8ec11fe35d717ca166145d16ab48cae2631fa141e4864c46beaeb21c8i0">Uncategorized Ordinal</a> secures the 20th spot among the most valuable NFTs of all time, having been sold three months ago for $3.83 million.</p>
<p>Notably, while the other digital collectibles from alternative blockchains in the top 20 highest-valued sales were sold anywhere between a year to two years ago, the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> NFT sales that amassed millions in value occurred more recently. When it comes to collections, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> finds itself in a lower position, with the Uncategorized Ordinals collection ranking 27th in all-time statistics.</p>

<p>Ronin takes the lead, securing the first spot, while Flow claims a respectable fifth position. The remaining 24 collections, positioned below 27th place, are all Ethereum-based NFT collections. Although Bitcoin blockchain sales have garnered attention in recent times, with a total of $463.68 million in all-time sales, the Bitcoin figure pales in comparison to Ethereum&#x2019;s staggering $43.68 billion in all-time sales, as well as Ronin&#x2019;s $4.2 billion and Solana&#x2019;s $4 billion in NFT sales.</p>
