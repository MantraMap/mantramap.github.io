<p>Ethereum recently implemented its Shanghai/Shapella upgrade, which has been ground-breaking for its investors. How is this affecting staking?</p>
Successful upgrade but price decreases
<p>This incredibly important upgrade, implemented more than a month ago, permits ETH stakers to withdraw locked-up coins and contribute to increasing liquidity on Ethereum's network. The newfound liquidity also acts as a catalyst for encouraging developers' creativity resulting from new opportunities that diversified solutions provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, not all is rosy as Ether's value decreased by 14% within one month despite it being up by over half since January this year; market analysts attribute these fluctuations to investor sentiment surrounding potential economic fallout from recession risks and worries over the US banking crisis.&nbsp;</p>
Staking activity surpasses expectations
<p>Staking activity has surpassed expectations. According to BeaconScan, more than 18.5 million ether coins are now staked; there are also roughly 702,000 validators participating on the network earning average yields of approximately 5.5%. Consequently, through increased fees on its network, stakeholders are benefiting from higher yields, which are currently at their peak within the last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value of staked ether has grown significantly, whereas the overall supply has drastically decreased. This trend has compelled numerous investors to consider staking ETH as a worthy rival to U.S. Treasury bills as it offers an equivalent yield of 5% with a shorter duration of less than 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there was initially a backlog in withdrawing ether, the waiting time has now reached zero days, and entering the staking queue entails waiting for only 30 days. This development outperformed expectations from a month ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Ethereum's fees have risen steeply, staked Ether has also grown significantly, translating into higher returns for investors. Furthermore, Shapella's introduction has facilitated a remarkable increase in new depositors on the network. There has been an approximately 8% growth in unique depositors since April 12th as more individuals show willingness to lock up their funds for a return while keeping withdrawal options open.&nbsp;</p>
