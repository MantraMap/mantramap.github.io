<h2>Chinese Yuan Usage Hits Record High in Argentina</h2>
<p>The Argentine customs agency has revealed that over 500 companies in Argentina, spanning various industries such as electronics, auto parts, textiles, oil, and mining, have requested to use Chinese yuan for import payments, Bloomberg reported Friday.</p>
<p>As the scarcity of U.S. dollars persists in Argentina, the use of the Chinese yuan has reached an all-time high in the country. According to officials from the country&#8217;s central bank, import payments authorized in the Chinese currency have amounted to $2.9 billion. Marcelo Elizondo, a trade economist in Buenos Aires, explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>The central bank doesn’t have dollars so it needs the emergency aid China is offering … For Argentina, its currency ties to China represents an emergency, but for China it&#8217;s a point of leverage to take advantage of a geopolitical opportunity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whirlpool Corp. is among the companies seeking to utilize China&#8217;s currency for import payments. The American appliance giant invested $52 million in its new factory outside Buenos Aires last year. Juan Carlos Puente, president of Whirlpool Latin America, was quoted as saying: “We’ve had to stop the factory at some points and that’s not good for business, productivity nor quality … We’re working to see how we can leverage this new avenue of flows to be able to continue importing materials.”</p>
<p>According to Argentina&#8217;s customs agency, between May and August, Argentine companies, including Mirgor and Newsan, made import payments totaling $630 million in Chinese yuan.</p>

<p>China recently granted Argentina access to over half of an $18 billion currency swap line, aimed at bolstering trade between the two countries. This bilateral swap agreement, which has been in place since 2009, serves as a contingency measure to enhance foreign reserves during periods of liquidity crises.</p>
<p>Maria Castiglioni, director of consulting firm C&amp;T Asesores in Buenos Aires, emphasized that Argentina is left with limited options due to the scarcity of the USD, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only option it has left is to access the yuan from the China swap line.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recent data from Mercado Abierto Electrónico, one of Argentina&#8217;s prominent exchanges, shows that the daily proportion of Chinese yuan transactions in the country&#8217;s foreign currency market has reached a new daily record of 28%. This represents a significant increase compared to the previous month when the share of yuan transactions stood at a maximum of 5%.</p>

<h2>North Korean State Media on De-Dollarization and the BRICS</h2>
<p>North Korea’s state media, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), published an article Sunday titled &#8220;Expansion of BRICS is an inevitable result of the present unfair international economic order.&#8221; The article is authored by Jong Il Hyon, an international affairs analyst of the DPRK.</p>
<p>He explained that the primary driving force behind numerous countries joining the BRICS bloc is “the present unfair and unreasonable international economic order&#8221; that centers around the U.S.-led international monetary system built upon the dollar.</p>
<p>Jong added that the U.S. established the Bretton Woods system in July 1944 with the dollar as the international standard currency after accumulating a vast amount of wealth during World War II. However, since then, the U.S. has engaged in global exploitation, reaping advantages from its dominant position in currency minting and utilizing the dollar as a tool to achieve its political objectives, he opined, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is well known that the international monetary system based on dollar has become the two pillars backing the U.S. domination over the world, along with military means.</p></blockquote>
<p>The North Korean analyst further detailed that over the span of almost a century, starting from the gold dollar in the 1940s, followed by the oil dollar in the 1970s, and now the debt dollar, “the U.S. has resorted to every means and method to maintain the supremacy of dollar as the key currency.” He stressed that the U.S. “unhesitatingly committed despicable acts of imposing financial sanctions” on countries that displeased it through the abuse of the dollar&#8217;s predominant position. He cited the financial sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine as an example.</p>
<p>Jong emphasized that this led to a reduction in reliance on the U.S. dollar and the increased adoption of national currencies for international trade by various countries, including the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">ASEAN</a>). Notably, the BRICS has a proposal for a common currency, which is expected to be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discussed</a> during the upcoming leaders&#8217; summit.</p>

<p>The North Korean analyst added that the growing de-dollarization trend demonstrates that the U.S., through its assertive and arbitrary actions in pursuit of global dominance, has expedited international efforts to ditch the dollar, stimulated the creation of a new monetary system, and encouraged numerous countries to join the BRICS. He stressed that the sanctions and pressure wielded by the U.S. are now backfiring and undermining its own position.</p>
<p>Jong pointed out that at their recent meeting of foreign ministers, the BRICS member states agreed to encourage the use of national currencies for trade settlement among member states and with allies. Noting that the BRICS economic bloc is “steadily increasing its political influence in the international arena,” the analyst stated that it is “becoming a challenge to the existing international order and financial system led by the U.S. and the West.” He concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>The unprecedented international moves to limit the use of dollar and the tendency of many countries to join BRICS are accelerating the end of dollar as a key currency and the end of the U.S. hegemonism pursuant to it.</p></blockquote>

The bank’s economists warned: “Broad-based developed-market tightening points to a more synchronized global downturn sometime in 2024.”</strong></p>
<h2>JPMorgan’s Global Outlook and &#8216;Boil the Frog&#8217; Recession</h2>
<p>Global investment bank JPMorgan has <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/next-recession-outlook-us-economy-boil-frog-fed-inflation-jpmorgan-2023-6">provided</a> an overview of four potential global outlook scenarios that it expects to unfold in 2023 and 2024. The bank&#8217;s economists believe that the likelihood of the United States entering a recession outweighs the possibility of avoiding one.</p>
<p>The most likely outcome, according to JPMorgan, is &#8220;boil the frog&#8221; recession, with the U.S. slipping into recession at the same time as the rest of the global economy. The economists assigned a 36% probability to this scenario, highlighting that it is primarily driven by the implementation of aggressive monetary tightening in response to persistent inflation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Central bank aspirations for a soft landing have tempered the pace of tightening. However, hopes for a painless slide in inflation back to target are likely to be dashed, requiring policy to turn sufficiently restrictive to break the back of the expansion,&#8221; they described, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Broad-based developed-market tightening points to a more synchronized global downturn sometime in 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-595026 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpmorgan-4-recession-scenarios.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="383" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpmorgan-4-recession-scenarios-300x166.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpmorgan-4-recession-scenarios.jpg 691w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></p>

<p>The second-most likely outcome, with a 32% probability, is &#8220;slip-sliding away&#8221; recession that the economists expect to occur between late 2023 and early 2024. In this outcome, the U.S. economy would experience a mild downturn resulting from an ongoing credit crunch, leading to a recession, while other economies across the globe would display resilience, they detailed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the JPMorgan economists have assigned a 23% probability for a Goldilocks soft landing, in which the U.S. economy successfully avoids a recession. Lastly, they have identified a 10% probability of a near-term recession occurring in mid-2023.</p>

Conducted by the Heritage Foundation and unveiled in late February, the research unveils a stark reality: the United States has experienced a substantial decline in economic freedom. From being ranked as the 20th freest nation in 2022, the United States has now slipped to the 25th position in 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>John Stossel&#8217;s Video and Heritage Foundation Study Expose Decline in U.S. Economic Freedom</h2>
<p>John Stossel, the television show host and author known for his libertarian leanings, recently <a href="https://youtu.be/v6biwsMpoPw">released a video</a> discussing global economic freedom and the United States&#8217; position among other nations. “Is America really the land of the free?” Stossel <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnStossel/status/1671276749747789824?s=20">asked</a> in a tweet. “Not anymore, according to a new ranking. The U.S. fell to 25th freest country on Earth,” the broadcaster explained. In the video, Stossel refers to the 2023 Index of Economic Freedom, which is published annually by the Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/">study</a>, the United States has reached an all-time low in economic freedom rankings, with Singapore emerging as the top country in this regard. “The United States continued its decline in economic freedom, recording a score of 70.6, a 1.5 decrease in freedom score from 2022 and its lowest score in the history of the Index,” the study’s summary declares. “The U.S. maintained its global ranking of 25th freest in the 2023 Index after falling from 20th to 25th in 2022.”</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation’s summary adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>The report points to the Biden administration’s ill-informed economic and entrepreneurial policies and unchecked deficit spending for leaving the U.S. economy in flux.</p></blockquote>
<p>Singapore claims the title of the freest country this year, with Switzerland, Ireland, Taiwan, and New Zealand following closely in the rankings. Derrick Morgan of the Heritage Foundation, in his conversation with Stossel, emphasized the significance of preserving &#8220;data longevity&#8221; for study purposes. &#8220;Does economic freedom over time lead to freer, more prosperous, healthier, and cleaner environments?&#8221; Morgan inquired. &#8220;It does,&#8221; he affirmed. The Heritage Foundation&#8217;s data identifies North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Sudan, and Zimbabwe as the least economically free nations.</p>

<p>The United States scored 25 this year, coinciding with a period in which crypto asset firms grapple with regulators who employ enforcement rather than legislation. Such regulatory actions have the potential to drive crypto firms away from the United States and stifle innovation as a whole. Dr. Kevin Roberts, President of The Heritage Foundation, argues that numerous nations have forsaken essential economic principles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world and America are at a crossroads,” Roberts stated. “Too many countries have renounced basic economic principles leaving communities to suffer the consequences.”</p>

Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban central bank, said the peso&#8217;s depreciation has caused the &#8220;impoverishment of the economy and families in dollar terms.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Peso Down by More Than 20% in 2023</h2>
<p>According to data provided by El Toque, the Cuban peso’s exchange rate on the parallel market recently matched an all-time low of 200 per dollar last seen in Oct. 2022. The peso’s latest plunge means the currency, which is officially pegged at CUP25:USD1, has now depreciated by over 20% in 2023 alone and by more than 50% in under 12 months.</p>
<p>As per a <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cuban-peso-hovers-at-record-low-against-dollar-as-crisis-grinds-on">report</a>, the peso&#8217;s latest plunge has further eroded the purchasing power of Cuban salaries which rarely exceed an equivalent of $25 or 5,000 pesos per month. The currency&#8217;s accelerated depreciation is coming at a time when the country&#8217;s leader, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has joined other world leaders in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cuban-president-ditching-us-dollar-frees-countries-from-sanctions-and-aggression/">advocating</a> for an alternative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Commenting on the likely impact of the Central American state’s ongoing currency woes on the population, Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban central bank, said the peso’s depreciation has left many residents worse off.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exchange rate shows the impoverishment of the economy and families in dollar terms,&#8221; Vidal, a tutor at Colombia’s Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, said.</p>
<p>Although Cuba is reported to have carried out some market reforms, Vidal insisted that such reforms have failed to boost domestic production. The tutor also argued that the market reforms had failed to contain inflation.</p>
<p>However, Cuban officials including President Diaz-Canel have consistently blamed the country&#8217;s economic woes on sanctions imposed by the U.S. in the 1960s.</p>

The list of these digital assets includes popular tokens such as bitcoin, ethereum, usd coin, litecoin, and several others that the SEC has classified as securities in recent years.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Regulations Diverge: Indonesia Embraces 501 Digital Assets as Commodities</h2>
<p>On June 9, 2023, Indonesia&#x2019;s regulatory agency Bappebti made public a comprehensive <a href="https://bappebti.go.id/pbk/sk_kep_kepala_bappebti/detail/12673">catalog of 501</a> crypto assets that are now classified as commodities within the country. This classification encompasses well-known coins like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, UNI, SOL, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, SAND, DOT, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XTZ" target="_blank">XTZ</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>, BUSD, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, among others. These assessments were made following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesian-government-to-launch-crypto-bourse-this-year/">announcement</a> by the Indonesian government regarding the establishment of a crypto exchange in September 2022. The subsequent month witnessed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-to-change-crypto-regulators-as-part-of-plan-for-stricter-oversight/">discussions</a> around new financial legislation aimed at strengthening cryptocurrency regulations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following the downfall of FTX, Bappebti <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/regulator-halts-trading-of-ftx-tokens-in-indonesia/">issued directives</a> to cryptocurrency exchanges, instructing them to halt trading of FTX&#x2019;s native token, FTT. The regulatory approach of Indonesian authorities diverges significantly from that of their counterparts in the United States, where more than three dozen <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/">crypto assets</a>, including <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2019/comp-pr2019-212.pdf">telegram gram token</a> (TON), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">tokencard</a> (TKN), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59">tron</a> (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-338.pdf">xrp</a> (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-127.pdf">xyo network</a> (XYO), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-127.pdf">flexacoin</a> (AMP), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-175">hydro</a> (HYDRO), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">iht real estate</a> (IHT), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2019/comp-pr2019-87.pdf">kik</a> (KIN), <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-127.pdf">kromatica</a> (KROM), and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25060.htm">lbry credits</a> (LBC), have been classified as securities.</p>

<p>Moreover, Indonesia supports the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/what-is-de-dollarization-exploring-the-shift-away-from-the-us-dollars-global-dominance/">de-dollarization</a> efforts and the plans of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gofrom/most_popular/brazil-to-push-de-dollarization-agenda-at-brics-meeting">BRICS</a> countries to strengthen non-U.S. fiat currencies. In April, Perry Warjiyo, the governor of the Bank of Indonesia, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-is-following-brics-de-dollarization-lead-says-central-bank-governor/">stated</a>, &#x201C;Indonesia has initiated diversification of the use of currency in the form of LCT &#x2014; The direction is the same as the BRICS. In fact, Indonesia is more concrete.&#x201D; Indonesia&#x2019;s perspective on crypto assets resonates with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-is-virtual-property-that-is-protected-by-law-chinese-court-rules/">court rulings</a> in China, where digital currencies and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/court-in-china-recognizes-nfts-as-virtual-property-protected-by-law/">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) have been classified as property.</p>
<p>During an April court case involving the now-defunct crypto exchange Gatecoin, a judge in Hong Kong <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kong-judge-rules-crypto-assets-as-property-following-similar-rulings-worldwide/">ruled</a> that crypto assets should be treated as &#x201C;property.&#x201D; With Indonesia taking the lead in classifying 501 crypto assets as commodities, it is likely that several other countries in the region will follow the path laid out by Bappebti.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will Indonesia&#x2019;s classification of 501 cryptocurrencies as commodities pave the way for a global shift in regulatory approach? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Cryptocurrency largely consolidated to start the week, with the global market cap down 0.64% as of writing. Shiba inu was another coin to move lower today.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the red to start the week, as traders seemingly secured gains following a recent bull run.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD rose to a two-week high at $0.0704 last Thursday, however it has since gone on to record consecutive declines.</p>
<p>The latest drop pushed the meme coin to an intraday low of $0.06557, which is its weakest point since Saturday.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today’s sell-off comes as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a support point at 50.70.</p>
<p>Since the decline, the index is now tracking at 48.55, with the next visible floor being at the 46.00 mark.</p>
<p>In the event that this level gets breached, there is a strong chance that DOGE will drop below $0.0640.</p>

<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Another meme coin to fall lower on Monday was shiba inu (SHIB), which slipped following its own recent rally.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.000007907 on Sunday, SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.000007684 in today’s session.</p>
<p>Like with dogecoin, shiba inu also captured a multi-week high last week, however, sentiment shifted after the RSI hit a hurdle.</p>

<p>Price strength failed to break out of a resistance level of 54.00, and as of writing is currently tracking at 50.43.</p>
<p>Despite this bearish signal, a potential upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages is on the cusp of occurring.</p>
<p>Should this take place, it is likely that SHIB gains further in the upcoming week.</p>

<h2>2023 Records 8 Block Rewards From 2010 Spent, 2 Occured on Monday, June 26</h2>
<p>So far this year, a total of eight block rewards from the 2010 era have been transferred out of wallets for the first time in more than 12 years. Two of them occurred on Monday, June 26, 2023, after the blockchain parser Btcparser.com detected the movements. Both block rewards were obtained on July 12, 2010, suggesting that the two block subsidies were owned by the same individual.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1MSij5Qi9EbxGFLB9RmfHEFvfK51a9B3hx">first transaction</a> was confirmed at block height 795,936, and the owner sent 49 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to a single address, while the remaining 0.99 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was transferred to another address. Both of those wallets remain idle and have not spent the bitcoin. The <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1PJs7kzDby9887tGMjFQ7fPhUzSFtm7mTS">second transfer</a> was confirmed at block height 795,940 hours later, and these funds were all sent to a single address currently holding 49.99 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the corresponding bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) associated with the old coins has not been transferred, and the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> remains idle. Interestingly, the first transfer of 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> had very little privacy and scored a <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/privacy-o-meter/1c67730c7000b2aef333c6fcbd7fe2cef5bfa9ab68e130a42354c35c1f15443d">10 out of 100</a> due to three identifiable issues. With a low privacy score, Blockchair.com details that &#x201C;the identified issues are severely jeopardizing the privacy of the parties involved.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In contrast, the second transaction from 2010 used significantly more privacy, as Blockchair&#x2019;s privacy tool gave it a score of <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/privacy-o-meter/f63dea5f50c05e4b6ea34c80418bb82a707ab28f2fe94d1c2eb39181f463458d">55 out of 100</a>, which is considered &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; for privacy since only one issue was discovered. Essentially, the privacy tool found that the funds were swept from a legacy address to a Segregated Witness (Segwit) address. Blockchair explains that &#x201C;the identified issues are not that severe but can still be used by tracking tools to trace transactions.&#x201D;</p>

<p>While there have been eight 2010 block rewards spent in 2023, these are significantly fewer compared to the spending observed during the latter half of 2020 and into 2021. For instance, between January 1, 2021, and September 28, 2021, a total of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23250-sleeping-bitcoins-spent-in-2021-this-year-old-school-miners-moved-1-billion-in-btc-from-2010-2013/">152 block rewards</a> from 2010 were transferred. Last year&#x2019;s and this year&#x2019;s records indicate that sightings of 2010 block reward spends are becoming increasingly scarce.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved marginally lower to start the week, as price fell below the $31,000 mark on Monday.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,042.38 earlier in the day, which comes after price peaked above $31,000 on Sunday.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s slippage sees bitcoin decline for a third straight day, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved into overbought territory.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the index hit a peak of 72.92, which was not only near a ceiling of 73.00, but also its highest point since late January.</p>
<p>This reading prompted bears to once again enter the market, pushing the RSI down to a current reading of 68.81.</p>
<p>The next visible floor appears to be at 68.00, and in the event this support point is broken, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> slips below $30,000.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), for its part, was unable to remain above a key price level of $1,900 during Monday&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,920.08 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped by 2% today, hitting a bottom of $1,870.30 in the process.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency has since marginally rebounded, and as of writing is trading at $1,882.04.</p>

<p>A key reason for the turbulence remains the fact that price strength has been unable to move past a ceiling at 61.00.</p>
<p>Overall, momentum in ethereum has turned bearish following a failed attempt to move above a ceiling at $1,930.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the RSI fell below a floor at 58.00, with a current reading at 57.75.</p>

<h2>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire Calls for Stablecoin Regulation: &#8216;It&#8217;s Time to Act.&#8217;</h2>
<p>Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, a U.S.-based stablecoin company, has called for stablecoin regulation to preserve the country&#8217;s sovereignty over the issuance of digital dollars. In a congressional hearing, Allaire explained that other countries have already drafted and established frameworks for issuing dollar-backed stablecoins, leaving the U.S. behind.</p>
<p>Allaire <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1672276006697041923?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are seeing governments around the world — the EU, the U.K., Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and others — actually defining the rules for how dollars, digital dollars, are issued and operate in those markets, which is astounding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Allaire detailed how the lack of regulation could have &#8220;devastating consequences&#8221; for the competitiveness of the U.S. dollar in a world driven by digital interactions on the internet. Allaire recently reiterated his call to action on social media, <a href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1672450309359124480?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s time to act.&#8221;</p>

<h2>How Commercial Banking Affected USD Coin</h2>
<p>Circle is the company behind usd coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin in the crypto market, with a market cap of $28.3 billion. The token suffered a depegging incident in March due to the demise of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which held 8.8% — about $3.3 billion — of the total reserve backing the USDC stablecoin.</p>
<p>The depeg, which took the price of usd coin as low as $0.85, was reverted with the <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/3.3-billion-of-usdc-reserve-risk-removed-dollar-de-peg-closes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> that all the depositors of SVB would be made <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fdic-creates-bridge-banks-for-failed-silicon-valley-bank-and-signature-bank-clients-to-access-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole</a>. At the time, Allaire remarked on the importance of establishing clear rules to avoid this from happening again, advocating for &#8220;full-reserve digital currency banking that insulates our base layer of internet money and payment systems from fractional reserve banking risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stablecoins have risen as a significant part of the cryptocurrency market, with a notable jump in their utilization. According to Kaiko, a cryptocurrency market data provider, the utilization of stablecoins has <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1672208443032190976?t=IaFXZASabFywTd1JuXgtMA&amp;s=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risen</a> to 76% of all cryptocurrency transactions. This represents a 16% increase since the beginning of 2022.</p>
<p>A new stablecoin legislation draft was <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20230613/116085/BILLS-118pih-Toprovidefortheregulation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> by House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry on June 8.</p>
