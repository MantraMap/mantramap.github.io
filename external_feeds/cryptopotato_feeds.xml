			            <description><![CDATA[Despite cutting ties with the AFA, Binance has no intentions to push the brake in Argentina.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange &#8211; Binance &#8211; ended its partnership with the Argentine Football Association (AFA), claiming the latter has not &#8220;fully met its contractual obligations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The agreement, which turned the platform into the Global Main Sponsor of Argentina&#8217;s national soccer team, was supposed to last until 2027.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Parting Ways</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance and the AFA </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-becomes-the-new-global-sponsor-of-argentinas-national-soccer-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">signed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the deal in January 2022, several months before the start of the World Cup in Qatar, which saw Argentina lifting the trophy. The partnership was considered a significant achievement for the exchange since it was its first collaboration with a national soccer team. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/BinanceArg/status/1680971083904700416" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tweet</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, though, Binance maintained that the AFA has not complied with its agreement responsibilities. As such, it cut ties with the entity as this goes against its &#8220;business values and association principles.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Binance has decided to end its association with the AFA (Argentine Football Association). We regularly evaluate the results of our partnerships around the world, and unfortunately, despite being offered time and opportunity, AFA has not fully met its contractual obligations, which goes against our business values ​​and our association principles,&#8221; the announcement reads.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, Binance remains committed to strengthening its presence in Argentina. It said it will continue to engage with domestic partners, such as prestigious universities, to &#8220;expand educational efforts and strategic business alliances.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recall that the exchange </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.forbesargentina.com/money/binance-asocia-una-universidad-argentina-llevar-crypto-academia-n34234" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">teamed up</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the Austral University in May to provide a five-month training program focused on cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, Web3, and the Metaverse.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Argentina&#8217;s Soccer Team has Another Crypto Sponsor</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance was not the only cryptocurrency partner of the AFA, as the Association previously </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bybit-becomes-the-global-main-sponsor-of-argentinas-national-soccer-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">inked</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a deal with Bybit. The marketplace serves as the Global Main Sponsor for all soccer selections, whereas its logo is displayed on the training apparel of Lionel Messi (the captain of Argentina) and his teammates. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bybit and the AFA announced their collaboration in November 2021, revealing that it will last 24 months. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that the big star of Argentina &#8211; &#8220;Leo&#8221; Messi &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitget-partners-with-leo-messi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">collaborated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget in October last year. The winner of a record seven Ballon d&#8217;Or Awards became a brand ambassador for the platform, while his responsibilities include introducing the company&#8217;s products and services to sports fans, brands, and organizations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Messi is among the most influential athletes, having nearly 480 million followers on Instagram. His biggest rival &#8211; Cristiano Ronaldo (who has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-partners-with-soccer-legend-cristiano-ronaldo-to-launch-exclusive-nft-collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">partnered</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with Binance) &#8211; has almost 600 million. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Israel-based GK8 was initially acquired by Celsius for $115 million in 2021.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius, its creditors, and its Series B holders have reached a settlement with regard to the distribution of $25 million in proceeds from the sale of crypto custodian GK8.</p>
<p>According to the filing, the settlements seek to deploy $24 million for legal expenses while allocating the rest of $1 million among the Series B holders. The court document also states that the settlement agreement was born out of the &#8220;mutual desire&#8221; to prevent costly legal disputes and an extensive confirmation process, which would lead to higher professional fees.</p>
<ul>
<li>The agreement between the Debtors, the Committee, and the Initial Consenting Series B Preferred Holders is said to have been &#8220;thoughtfully negotiated and is eminently reasonable.&#8221;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907182380000000004.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">filing</a> read,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Settlement brings an end to nearly a year of highly contentious litigation and removes one of the largest obstacles to confirmation and emergence in exchange for a $25 million cash settlement from the proceeds of the GK8 sale and a mutual release of claims between the Initial Consenting Series B Preferred Holders and the Estate Parties.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GK8 was initially acquired by Celsius for an unknown amount, which was later disputed to be $115 million, in November 2021.</li>
<li>However, as Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last summer following the collapse of Terra&#8217;s ecosystem, Mike Novogratz-led Galaxy Digital agreed to purchase the Israel-based company as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</li>
<li>The former Celsius CEO, Alex Mashinsky, was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ex-celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-arrested-sec-files-against-celsius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">arrested</a> last week and charged with wire fraud and other crimes.</li>
<li>US prosecutors also alleged that the exec pumped up the price of his company&#8217;s cryptocurrency to lure customers to the platform.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[How will the market actually react to a Bitcoin spot ETF – even if it gets approved?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest influx of Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETF applications in the United States is certainly generating hype, but some analysts are split on whether that excitement is warranted.</p>
<p>While many claim approval will invite a new wave of investor capital into the asset, others think it may only amount to a sell-the-news event.</p>
<h2>The Bearish Case for a Bitcoin Spot ETF</h2>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-etf-hype-threatens-another-sell-the-news-fizzle-1.1947277" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, FLX Networks Managing Director Jillian DelSignore questioned whether a Bitcoin spot ETF will attract significant capital beyond the first few days from its launch.</p>
<p>She cited the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) as an example – a Bitcoin Futures ETF which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/first-bitcoin-futures-etf-generates-1-billion-in-trade-volume-on-first-day/" data-wpel-link="internal">listed</a> on the NYSE in October 2021. While Bitcoin spot ETF backs its shares with actual BTC, a futures ETF is backed by Bitcoin futures contracts.</p>
<p>BITO had the second-largest opening day in BITO history, attracting over $1 billion, but mostly stopped absorbing capital after a few days.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll definitely see multiple billions of dollars come in,” said DelSignoreregarding a potential spot ETF. “I do think it will be a very early momentum-driven asset growth, and then the question mark for me is what happens from there. Does it quiet down?”</p>
<p>JP Morgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou happens to agree. In a memo this month, the strategist <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-07/jpmorgan-says-a-bitcoin-etf-wouldn-t-be-an-industry-game-changer?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a> that spot ETFs have already existed in Canada and Europe for years, and have failed to attract much capital, “failing to benefit from investor outflows from gold ETFs.”</p>
<p>While conceding that there may be some benefits to having a spot ETF, the strategist predicted that they would be “rather marginal.”</p>
<h2>The Positives of a Spot ETF</h2>
<p>Contrarily, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts including Athanasios Psarofagis and James Seyffart see great potential for a spot ETF.</p>
<p>When looking at Canada’s existing crypto ETFs, analysts note that they’ve attracted 1% of the ETF market in the country already. If a roughly similar share of the United States’s ETF capital rushed into a U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF, that would amount to $54 billion.</p>
<p>For context, the total US commodity ETF market amounts to $137 billion. Furthermore, Glassnode analysts say that roughly $13.5 billion worth of BTC actively participates in price discovery right now.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nate Geraci – president of the advisory firm “The ETF Store” – thinks a spot ETF provides meaningful benefit to investors above a futures ETF, noting that the latter doesn’t perfectly track BTC’s price. While BITO is down 63% since launch, BTC has dropped just 53% since that time.</p>
<p>“Investors want the real deal,” he said. “They don’t want to hassle with potentially significant tracking error.”</p>
<p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – the world’s largest Bitcoin fund holding over 650,000 BTC under management – also faces a tracking error issue. Its share price currently trades 26% below the value of its underlying BTC, due to an inability to redeem shares easily for coins the way an ETF can do.</p>
<p>The fund is embroiled in a legal battle with regulators to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-calls-out-sec-for-approving-leveraged-bitcoin-futures-etf-while-denying-spot/" data-wpel-link="internal">transition</a> into a spot ETF, in which case its share price will immediately restore to parity with its BTC.</p>
<p>BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF race last month was alone able to boost Bitcoin’s price over the past few weeks, raising optimism that a spot ETF might finally be approved. The firm’s CEO Larry Fink, who was once a Bitcoin skeptic, said last week that Bitcoin may have the power to “transcend any one currency.”</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jeremy Allaire &#8211; Chief Executive Officer of Circle &#8211; believes American regulators should open arms to the cryptocurrency industry to prevent falling behind other nations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He said the US government was among the first to propose recommendations regarding stablecoin regulation, adding that the White House, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury Department are all focused on that mission. </span></p>

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The US may be late to the party in terms of getting these policies done, but it is the biggest economy and has the biggest technology industry and the biggest financial system in the world.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also gave his two cents on the numerous financial giants that have recently filed to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs in the States, such as the world&#8217;s largest asset manager <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock</a>. According to him, one factor behind the increasing interest from such companies is the end of the turbulence caused by<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal"> the FTX implosion</a> last year. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Circle&#8217;s CEO suggested the current condition of the crypto sector is much similar to the market after the Dot-com crash in the late 1990s.

			            <description><![CDATA[The closed-door gathering will be with lawmakers from the New Democrat Coalition, one of the largest caucuses in the House.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Armstrong, the chief executive officer of America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, will privately meet with Democrats from the House of Representatives on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-17/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-set-to-meet-with-house-democrats?sref=3REHEaVI" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, Democratic aides disclosed that the meeting would focus on crypto legislation and related issues like taxes, privacy, and national security.</p>
<h2>Coinbase CEO to Meet With House Democrats</h2>
<p>The closed-door gathering will be with lawmakers from the New Democrat Coalition, one of the largest caucuses in the House that is made up of 100 members who are committed to pro-economic growth, pro-innovation, and fiscally responsible policies.</p>
<p>Armstrong’s meeting with the New Democratic Coalition comes as Coinbase faces a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of securities law violations. Recall that the SEC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" data-wpel-link="internal">accused</a> the crypto exchange of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, clearing agency, and broker last month.</p>
<p>While Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-ceo-welcomes-sec-legal-battle-well-get-the-job-done/" data-wpel-link="internal">fights</a> the SEC’s allegations, Armstrong launched a campaign seeking clearer crypto rules in the U.S. Before the lawsuit, Coinbase petitioned the agency in July 2022, asking for clarity on crypto regulation. After ignoring the exchange’s request, the agency finally <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-responds-to-coinbase-request-for-crypto-clarity-wants-more-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">asked</a> for more time to file a concrete response.</p>
<h2>Armstrong Seeks Clear Crypto Rules</h2>
<p>The Coinbase chief has urged U.S. lawmakers to consider two crypto bills that have been circulating and promise to provide guidance on which regulators will oversee digital assets. Lawmakers from the House and Senate introduced the bills to provide clarity on crypto regulation.</p>
<p>The first one, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100652X1574425&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.4.2-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fpolicy%2F2023%2F06%2F02%2Fus-house-republicans-push-for-crypto-oversight-with-bill-to-make-sec-play-ball%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinancialservices.house.gov%2Fnews%2Fdocumentsingle.aspx%3FDocumentID%3D408838&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=-60&amp;xuuid=e221d84af2894b01674d9afbd13b765a&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">proposed</a> by Republican chairs of the House Financial Services Committee and the House Committee on Agriculture, would enable crypto exchanges to register with the SEC and trade digital securities, commodities, and stablecoins all in one place.</p>
<p>The second, introduced by crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, would require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to oversee exchanges while regulated depository institutions handle stablecoin issuers. The bill was initially <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/senator-cynthia-lummis-bill-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">proposed</a> in June 2022 but <a href="https://www.lummis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Lummis-Gillibrand-2023.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">re-introduced</a> last week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase’s COIN stock is up over 25% since a federal court <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-secondary-sales-of-xrp-not-an-investment-contract-judge-rules-following-over-3-year-long-legal-battle/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled</a> in favor of Ripple Labs in a lawsuit with the SEC concerning XRP’s recognition as a security or investment contract. The partial victory was considered a win for the crypto industry at large. The closed-door gathering will be with lawmakers from the New Democrat Coalition, one of the largest caucuses in the House.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meme coin market has a new contender looking to challenge the dominance of $PEPE – Evil Pepe Coin ($EVILPEPE).</p>
<p><a href="https://bs_1ecf342c.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-token-evil-pepe-coin-launches-presale-next-pepe-rival-to-watch" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evil Pepe Coin ($EVILPEPE)</a> This brand-new project launched its presale phase today, aiming to capture the meme coin hype with an edgy twist on the popular Pepe the Frog character.</p>
<p>With the frenzy around meme coins showing no signs of dissipating, $EVILPEPE could be the next viral hit when it makes its open market debut in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Evil Pepe Coin Unleashes Exciting Opportunity to Harness Meme Coin Magic</h2>
<p>Evil Pepe Coin has burst onto the scene with an appealing presale phase, generating excitement throughout the crypto scene.</p>
<p>This presale offers a golden opportunity for investors and meme enthusiasts, with 90% of the total $EVILPEPE supply on offer.</p>
<p>Priced at just $0.000333, $EVILPEPE beckons investors to embrace their dark side and engage in the exciting world of meme culture.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-21.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261246" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-21.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="256" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-21.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-21-300x128.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-21-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Early investors have the option to purchase tokens using $ETH or $USDT, without the constraint of any minimum or maximum investment size.</p>
<p>Per the project’s <a href="https://evilpepecoin.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, the presale&#8217;s hard cap is just $1,996,002, hastening the token&#8217;s debut on the open market.</p>
<p>Although 90% of the total $EVILPEPE supply has been set aside for the presale, the remaining 10% will be used for decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity – a solid foundation for the token&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>Importantly, this liquidity will be locked for one month, helping stabilize the price and prevent a dreaded rug pull from occurring.</p>

<h2>Evil Pepe Coin Looks to Challenge Dominance of Meme King $PEPE</h2>
<p>As indicated by its name, Evil Pepe Coin seeks to capitalize on the triumphant performance of the enormously successful meme coin Pepe ($PEPE).</p>
<p>$PEPE experienced a meteoric rise of over 10,000% earlier this year, kickstarting the meme coin frenzy that has been sustained until this day.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-21.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261245" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-21.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="309" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-21.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-21-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-21-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Evil Pepe Coin looks to tap into the existing enthusiasm surrounding $PEPE, which has demonstrated the massive potential (and profitability) of low-cap cryptos.</p>
<p>However, $EVILPEPE puts its own spin on things with a rebellious nature and dark branding – providing scope to attract investors who missed out on the original $PEPE’s ascent.</p>
<p>Describing itself as &#8220;unapologetic and audacious,&#8221; Evil Pepe Coin looks primed and ready to ride the hype wave and offer huge gains potential for early adopters.</p>
<h2>Ambitious $EVILPEPE Roadmap Hints at Token’s Future Potential</h2>
<p>Given $EVILPEPE’s stable price point throughout its presale phase, many members of the token’s <a href="https://t.me/Evilpepetoken" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram community</a> believe that it&#8217;s positioned for a remarkable take-off once it hits exchanges.</p>
<p>Importantly, $EVILPEPE will only be listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX) initially – a decision that has been taken to promote community engagement.</p>
<p>This is because a DEX listing aligns with the project’s vision of inclusivity, allowing for broader access to $EVILPEPE.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261244" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-14.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="141" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-14.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-14-300x70.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-14-50x12.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>As such, by launching exclusively on a DEX, the project&#8217;s creators ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to engage with the token and contribute to its growth.</p>
<p>With this solid foundation of inclusivity and community engagement, Evil Pepe Coin&#8217;s roadmap seeks to drive the project towards ambitious goals.</p>
<p>These goals include high-profile marketing campaigns, strategic partnerships, and a lofty market cap of $100 million.</p>
<p>All in all, Evil Pepe Coin&#8217;s roadmap reflects a vision of embracing the devilish side of meme culture – positioning $EVILPEPE as a potentially prominent player in the crypto landscape.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price rally has slowed down in recent weeks. The price has yet to break above the $2,000 level, which is making many market participants worried.</p>
<h2><strong>Ethereum Price Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has been forming higher highs and higher lows since rebounding from the 200-day moving average earlier in June.</p>
<p>However, there is a clear lack of bullish momentum, as the ETH price keeps pulling back towards the 50-day moving average located around the $1,900 mark. In case it breaks, there are two close support levels available: the $1,800 static level and the 200-day moving average close to the same price mark.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the momentum is seemingly fading, there is still hope that a rebound from either of these levels would initiate the next rally higher.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Recent PA developments become clearer on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>The ETH price has broken above the $1,930 resistance level a couple of times since the beginning of July but has failed in both instances, as it has rapidly dropped back below the level.</p>
<p>Currently, the price is seemingly targeting the $1,850 short-term support level once again, with the $1,750 level available as the next target in line in case the former level fails to hold. The RSI indicator, while previously signaling the potential fake breakout and drop, is offering little insight at the moment, as it is oscillating around the 50% value. This behavior confirms the indecisiveness of the market participants and the equilibrium in momentum.</p>

<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index</h3>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has remained relatively stagnant over the past few months, consolidating around the $2,000 level. However, interesting activity has been going on in the background.</p>
<p>The chart displays the Ethereum Coinbase premium gap, which is calculated based on the gap between ETH&#8217;s price on Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges in the world. This metric shows whether US investors are buying or selling on aggregate compared to other investors. Positive values indicate buying pressure from the United States.</p>
<p>As the image demonstrates, there has been a significant shift in the US market sentiment, as the premium gap index has mostly been positive. Considering that many US investors are wealthy individuals or institutions, this could be a positive signal for ETH, pointing out that it might be in the accumulation phase at the beginning of a new bull market.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s price has experienced a significant surge after finding strong support around the 100-day moving average at $0.497. It is now approaching a crucial resistance level at $0.85, indicating a prevailing buying pressure in the market and a positive outlook for Ripple&#8217;s medium-term prospects.</p>
<h2><strong>Ripple Price Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Analyzing the daily chart, it is apparent that the XRP price increased after finding support at the 100-day moving average. However, it now faces a strong resistance zone at $0.85, characterized by high selling pressure and increased supply.</p>
<p>This development suggests a bullish sentiment among traders, increasing the likelihood of a breakthrough above the resistance region. However, it&#8217;s important to note that every significant upward movement is typically followed by a consolidation or correction phase, and Ripple&#8217;s price is no exception.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems likely that the price will enter a short-term correction phase, accompanied by higher volatility and pullback periods before the next significant upward movement occurs.</p>

<h3><strong>The 4-Hour Chart</strong></h3>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, it can be seen that the price has successfully broken above the upper edge of a channel, evidenced by a large green candle resulting from a recent explosive rally. However, for a valid breakout confirmation, a pullback to the broken level should occur.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the price action, it appears more likely that the price will retrace back to the upper boundary and complete a pullback. If this occurs, the market can expect the bullish rally to continue, reaching higher resistance levels.</p>
<p>However, in the event that the recent breakout proves to be false, Ripple may face significant rejection and a subsequent decline.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Paris, France, July 18th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Sushi to deploy Interchain Tokens, powered by new Axelar product suite delivering cross-chain fungibility and customization. </strong></em></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://axelar.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Axelar</a>, the blockchain interoperability leader, is announcing the launch of <a href="https://axelar.network/its" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Interchain Token Service (ITS)</a>, a product suite that extends tokens cross-chain, preserving their native functionality and allowing teams to easily manage supply and features.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">ERC-20 tokens have unlocked powerful interoperability between Ethereum-based applications. In a similar way, Interchain Token Service creates Interchain Tokens that unlock new possibilities for interconnected applications spanning all EVM-compatible ecosystems. Sushi, the popular decentralized exchange (DEX) &amp; automated market maker (AMM), is among the first deployment partners to embrace Interchain Tokens.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Interchain Token Service delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fungibility: Wrapped versions on connected chains are fungible with one another.</li>
<li>Custom functionality: Custom tokens keep their features, cross-chain.</li>
<li>Low overhead: Smart contracts and developer tools automate complex developer tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Sushi will employ Interchain Token Service to give SUSHI, its native token, seamless interoperability across multiple chains. To start, Interchain SUSHI tokens will be interoperable across Arbitrum, Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon. Sushi will manage its multichain deployments with minimal overhead, deploying and updating Interchain Tokens with a single click.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Traditionally, in order for Web3 applications to reach multiple blockchain ecosystems, they would rely on <a href="https://axelar.network/blog/cross-chain-bridges-benefits-limitations-risks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">bridged versions</a> of their tokens: risky, limited in function and nonfungible with each other. <a href="https://axelar.network/blog/blockchain-interoperability-how-to-achieve-it-securely" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Alternatively</a>, they may deploy copies of the native token on multiple chains, incurring significant developer overhead. Using the Axelar network&#8217;s full-stack interoperability, Interchain Token Service delivers smart contracts and developer tools that automate away this overhead: developers can manage Interchain Tokens with the click of a button.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Axelar&#8217;s Interchain Token Service unlocks a more seamless, interchain experience for Sushi users,&#8221; said Sushi&#8217;s head chef, Jared Grey. &#8220;Currently, there are many bridged versions of $SUSHI – lacking fungibility, carrying bridge risk. With Interchain Tokens, Sushi can achieve true cross-chain interoperability, simply and securely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Sergey Gorbunov, co-founder of Axelar, highlighted the significance of Interchain Tokens. &#8220;With Interchain Token Service, we are empowering developers to unlock the full potential of their tokens and extend their reach across multiple chains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This new extension of Axelar&#8217;s secure and programmable interoperability layer will be the catalyst to a more connected and inclusive blockchain economy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
