<ul>
<li>XRP (XRP), sixth largest crypto asset was outperforming the top ten cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>XRP is up 5% at $0.3762 in the last 24 hours</li>
<li>The improving clarity on its legal case with the SEC can be seen as increasingly favorable for XRP by the investment community</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-price-analysis-xrp-usd-price-spikes-to-0-543-report-shows-ripple-xrp-preferred-to-btc-eth-as-a-model-for-cbdcs/">XRP (XRP),</a> the sixth largest crypto asset, was outperforming the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of daily gains, as it is up 5.12% at $0.3762. According to a recent CoinShares report, despite $9.7 million flowing out of digital asset investment products last week, investors put $3 million into XRP. Only authorized investors, who must meet certain income standards as per the SEC, are permitted access to these products. CoinShares gives a probable reason for this: <em>&#8220;The improving clarity on its legal case with the SEC can be seen as increasingly favorable for XRP by the investment community.&#8221;</em> As stated in a new year&#8217;s insight report, Ripple General Counsel Stu Alderoty predicts the judge&#8217;s ruling in Ripple&#8217;s ongoing case with the SEC will come in the first half of 2023 and that it will be in Ripple&#8217;s favor. He thinks this will be the catalyst required to propel the U.S. cryptocurrency industry ahead and prevent companies from offshoring their crypto operations.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.4400, $0.4200, $0.3923<br />Support Levels: $0.3750, $0.3400, $0.3130</p>

<p>XRP continues rising today following a bounce from the MA 50 at $0.3700 and a five-day positive streak. On the daily timeframe, the fall to lows of $0.2996 on January 2 paved the way for a positive structure. The RSI is rising toward the overbought level of 80. If the bulls maintain control, the price is poised to breach the $MA 200 barrier before reaching the level at $0.3923.<br /><br />After clearing this significant barrier, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-2023-here-are-five-reasons-per-santiment/">XRP/USD pair</a> may target the $0.4200 level before advancing to the $0.4400 level and the $0.4700 convergence zone set in the 4th quarter of 2022. Otherwise, a drop below the MA 50 might push the bulls toward the $0.3400 critical zone, where the bears could continue their downward trend.</p>

<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63935 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSD-4-Hour-Jan-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSD-4-Hour-Jan-12.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSD-4-Hour-Jan-12-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSD-4-Hour-Jan-12-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSD-4-Hour-Jan-12-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSD-4-Hour-Jan-12-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSD-4-Hour-Jan-12-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">XRP/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>XRP has so far rallied off lows of $0.3000 and past the 4-hour moving averages (MA 50 and MA 200) near $0.3500, but investors will need more bullish evidence before committing again. Buyers might face early resistance from the $0.3923 handle after breaking through the $0.3800 handle. While crossing this significant boundary, the XRP/USD pair may aim for the $0.4000 level before resuming its descent toward the $0.3750 level.<br /><br />If buyers win more ground, the bulls may revisit the $0.4400 resistance zone until it hits $0.5000. If sellers re-emerge and drive the price down, the short-term MA 50 around $0.3500 could provide early limits ahead of the $0.3000 low region. To summarize, XRP/USD looks to be bullishly biased between $0.3500 and $0.3700.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) momentarily surpassed $19,000 during Thursday&#8217;s rally, gaining more than 7% for the day and reaching its highest level since it was gapping down in early November as cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed.<br /><br />After plummeting by 63% in 2022, bitcoin is already up roughly 14% this year. In line with predictions and down from a 7.1% increase in November, the Consumer Price Index increased by 6.5% from a year earlier in December.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve will probably be able to reduce the rate of rate increases from 50 basis points in December to 25 basis points per meeting as a result of the slower rate of inflation (and 75 before that).<br /><br />In the first half of 2023, according to Steven Lubka, managing director of Swan Bitcoin&#8217;s private client division, inflation should continue to decrease, allowing the Fed to ease off on its monetary-tightening stance. But he issued a warning, saying that consumer prices in the second half of the year would not be so benign and that the central bank might have to deal with both growing inflation and a softening or even a recessionary economy.<br /><br />Crypto Capital Venture founder, Dan Gambardello is optimistic about the return of bulls to the crypto market because, as he says, &#8220;bears are getting exhausted.&#8221; <br /><br />Bitcoin has started 2023 on a positive footing, with its price rising steadily over the last 12 days.</p>
<h2>GALA, Aptos, Immutable X, Flow, Bitcoin Cash, LDO, AAVE, FraxShare Trade Higher</h2>
<p>Most of the largest cryptocurrencies were up on Thursday, with Bitcoin Cash, up 13% in the last 24 hours. LDO has added another 17% of value in the past 24 hours alone and trades at above $2 at the time of writing.<br /><br />Gala Games’ GALA continued its ride higher after an impressive 130% rise in the week. The official Gala Games Twitter handle shared information regarding the ongoing work with American actors Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a. &#8220;The Rock&#8221;) and Mark Wahlberg. Gala would also be the gas token used in GoGalaFilms and GoGalaMusic.<br /><br />In the last 24 hours, Aptos (APT) has shot into the limelight with a massive 24% surge. As a result, the asset has soared above $6.<br /><br />Immutable X, Flow, AAVE, and FraxShare exploded higher, recording significant gains in the last 24 hours as altcoins saw an aggressive pump.</p>

<p>Fashion will continue to lead the way in Web3 adoption –Cathy Hackl.</p>
<p>2023 is a significant year for the cryptocurrency market. A notable projection is that the fashion world will embrace web3. Smart investors are investing in different <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tax-cryptocurrencies-4-facts-aware-2/">cryptocurrencies</a> to join the web3 trend.</p>
<p>Several crypto exchange platforms allow you to buy cryptocurrencies with your credit card. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/buy/eth">How to buy Ethereum with a credit card</a> and join the crypto revolution.</p>
<p>1. To purchase Ethereum with your credit card, enter the amount in ETH you wish to purchase<br />
2. Put in your ETH wallet address<br />
3. Confirm your email and the necessary information</p>
<p>You can pay for Ethereum with your credit card or other payment methods.</p>
<h2>Four crucial tactics for crypto trading in 2023</h2>
<p>Crypto tactics and strategies refer to proven methods or roadmaps developed by a trader according to his <strong>risk profile</strong> that helps in successful trading and risk management.</p>
<p>There are no fixed best tactics, but the best tactics for crypto trading come from years of experience trading and analyzing the market. It&#8217;s vital not just to have tactics but ones that work.</p>
<p><strong>The following are tactics that prove to work:</strong></p>
<h3>1. Arbitrage</h3>
<p>Arbitrage is when a trader tries to maximize the price differences of a particular crypto across various exchange platforms. For example, bitcoin is trading at $15,000 in one exchange platform and $15,500 in another.</p>
<p>The trader will maximize these disparities in price by buying from the lower exchange and selling off at the higher deal, thereby making some profit. Arbitrage is a term that is adopted even in traditional investments.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitrage trading involves little or no risk</strong>, and the beautiful thing is that you don&#8217;t have to be an expert or have lots of funds to start arbitrage trading. Some traders ignore arbitrage trading as a profitable strategy due to the transaction fees of the various platforms.</p>
<h3>2. Scalping</h3>
<p>Scalping is the process of positioning in line with a trend. It involves entering and quitting the market several times in a short period as it develops. Scalping is one of the shortest-term strategies– individual trades are held for only a few seconds or minutes at most.</p>
<p>For active day traders, this trading method performs exceptionally. Scalping concentrates on minute-to-minute price variations due to changes in volume. You will close the deal as soon as it starts to make money.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing like &#8220;waiting for the market to represent trends&#8221; since you must act quickly and exit failing trades. Scalping works best when the market is highly volatile. A trader needs to understand that every strategy has its own risk. It&#8217;s essential for you as a trader to manage your risk.</p>
<h3>3. Event-driven trading</h3>
<p>This strategy involves buying the cryptocurrency you&#8217;ve chosen to trade when there is positive news and selling it off in the case of adverse or suspicious information.</p>
<p>Some traders call this &#8220;<strong>fundamental analysis</strong>,&#8221; Markets for cryptocurrencies may be impacted by a particular coin&#8217;s or exchange&#8217;s significant media exposure.</p>
<p>The main goal of this cryptocurrency trading method is to profit from these &#8220;events or news.&#8221; The influence of this news isn&#8217;t just speculation most of the time.</p>
<p>Before an anticipated news release, such as an earnings report, you will have to watch the market for a consolidation pattern and then take action as soon as the market breaks out. <strong>Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, you have to wait to participate in a trade until after such a press release</strong>.</p>
<h3>4. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</h3>
<p>Dollar-cost averaging is a popular tactic for experts and beginners. It&#8217;s a trading strategy that doesn&#8217;t involve indicators.</p>
<p><strong>DCA utilizes a simple process</strong>. You divide your investments into smaller sums than putting all of your money into one asset. These funds are allocated over a set period and consistently invested on a specific day and time per week.</p>
<p><strong>Why use DCA as a trading tactic?</strong></p>
<p>Regularly purchasing an asset reduces the effects of market volatility. Hence, you get more money back from your final investment than putting in all of your money at once.</p>
<h3>What are the steps for cryptocurrency trading</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-63926 size-full aligncenter" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-2.png" alt="crypto trading tactics" width="650" height="400" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-2.png 650w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-2-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>2022 wasn&#8217;t as exciting for crypto traders. The Crypto market <a href="https://finbold.com/crypto-market-loses-55-of-its-capitalisation-in-2022-as-bitcoin-drops-below-24k/">lost 55% of its capitalization</a> in 2022, with bitcoin dropping below $24. However, some traders are taking advantage of this fall to make more investments.</p>
<h3>Here are the steps for crypto trading:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange</strong></p>
<p>The ultimate step in trading cryptocurrencies is to create an account on a crypto exchange. Cryptocurrencies aren&#8217;t traded with fiat directly from the bank; a crypto exchange platform is essential in selling crypto assets successfully.</p>
<p>A crypto exchange is a platform where users can <strong>purchase and sell cryptocurrencies</strong>. Examples of such outlets include Moonpay, Binance, and Coinbase. To register a crypto exchange account, you need to provide some personal information, like your date of birth, home address, Social Security number, and email address.</p>
<p><strong>2. Deposit into the account</strong></p>
<p>The next step after creating an account on an exchange is to fund the account. There are several ways to finance the account, but connecting the trading account to a regular bank account is the easiest.</p>
<p>Transmit your fiat money using a debit card, wire transfer, or bank deposit. Thanks to its little to no fees, a wire transfer is the least expensive alternative for funding your account.</p>
<p>Pro tip: check different exchanges to compare transaction fees and pick the cheaper and more favorable option.</p>
<p><strong>3. Choose a cryptocurrency to trade</strong></p>
<p>The next step after funding the account is to choose a cryptocurrency to trade. Picking the right crypto asset to trade depends on several factors that a trader should know, which include: the market cap of the cryptocurrency, fundamental news, market sentiment, and technical analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Most traders prefer to trade bitcoin and Ethereum due to their enormous trading volumes over other cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>
<p>However, many cryptocurrency traders devote some of their funds to minor cryptocurrencies. Whether you stick with minor coins or choose substantial and stable cryptocurrencies is for you to decide.</p>
<p><strong>4. Develop a strategy</strong></p>
<p>You must have tactics tested and confirmed over time to work effectively in every investment.<br />
A strategy involves the methods, or roadmap traders follow to manage funds and mitigate financial risks while trading. These tactics are critical to avoid unnecessary losses and fit into your risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>5. Start trading</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-63927 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-3.png" alt="crypto trading in 2023" width="650" height="400" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-3.png 650w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-3-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>After the account and tactics for trading are all set, you&#8217;re good to commence trading. It&#8217;s time to get busy with the cryptocurrency you decide to buy and sell based on your risk profile, strategy, knowledge, and abilities.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency trading is active or automatic. <strong>Trading bots are the most straightforward and efficient approach to automate this procedure</strong> though they have their risks.</p>
<p><strong>6. Store your crypto asset</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to keep your coins in a wallet while exchanging digital currencies. Apps for crypto exchanges are not wallets in the real sense. They don&#8217;t store your cryptocurrency coins but hold them.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets come in two forms, hot wallets, and cold wallets. Hot wallets are the various wallets offered by crypto exchange platforms for you to keep your crypto assets, and they require an internet connection to function.</p>
<p><strong>Cold wallets don&#8217;t require an internet connection to function. Yubo Ruan</strong>, CEO and founder of Parallel Finance, a decentralized lending and staking protocol on Polkadot, <strong>says it&#8217;s better to hold roughly 80% of long-term funds inside a cold wallet</strong>. The remaining crypto assets stay in a hot wallet for short-term moves.</p>
<h3>Optimize your crypto trading tactics in 2023</h3>
<p>While many traders lost hope in 2022, 2023 will depend on regulations and government policies. As we move towards 2023, traders must adopt crucial tactics to get the most out of crypto trading and maximize their profits.</p>
<p>As we outline the best tactics for trading, every trader will have to stick to the tactics that work for them. The Crypto market is far from a Ponzi gimmick, and expert traders invest for <strong>long-term purposes</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great for traders to learn to manage greed and fear, as these two factors are crucial in successful trading.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-trades-hit-new-records-in-argentina-following-tighter-central-bank-restriction/">Argentina&#8217;s government</a> has proposed a new measure that would encourage its residents to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings in exchange for lower tax rates.<br /><br />Tax incentives may soon motivate Argentines to disclose their crypto holdings. According to<a href="https://www.errepar.com/blanqueo-de-capitales-proyecto-de-ley-al-congreso"> local news sources</a>, Argentina&#8217;s Ministry of Economy &#8211; the country&#8217;s economic policy manager &#8211; has submitted a new crypto bill intended at combating money laundering and encouraging its residents to reveal their crypto holdings by enticing them with lower tax rates. Economy Minister Sergio Massa proposed the <em>&#8220;Externalization of Argentine Savings&#8221;</em> draft bill to combat money laundering.<br /><br />The bill requires <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-continues-to-fluctuate-at-19k-as-bitcoin-retail-holders-increase/">cryptocurrency holders</a> to provide the Argentine government with an affidavit indicating the location of their holdings. Those who report their holdings are eligible for tax benefits.<br /><br />Under the draft bill, persons who voluntarily reveal their holdings within 90 days of the law&#8217;s implementation would be subject to a 2.5% tax on capital gains on their holdings. The rate gradually rises every 90 days until it reaches 15%, Argentina&#8217;s regular capital gains tax rate. <br /><br />The proposed measure would require domestic and foreign holdings to be lodged in Argentina-approved banks or foreign banks supervised by the country&#8217;s central bank or securities commission.<br /><br />The bill also urges Argentines to declare any financial assets subject to capital gains, such as fiat currencies, stocks, and shares, as well as real estate.<br /><br />According to recent reports, the Argentine Senate is debating a measure that would control how people and organizations promote cryptocurrency. The project&#8217;s goal is to educate customers about the risks of investing in cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Two months after the ailing crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-founder-sbf-pleads-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges/">FTX</a>&#8216;s new leadership claims to have found $5 billion in cash, liquid bitcoin, and liquid financial instruments. According to FTX attorney Andy Dietderich, the assets were discovered at a bankruptcy court hearing in Delaware on Wednesday morning.<br /><br />Dietderich pointed out that the $5 billion figure does not include the $425 million in cryptocurrency held by the Bahamas Securities Commission. <br /><br />The lawyer did not clarify whether it included<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-charged-with-eight-criminal-offenses/"> Sam Bankman Fried</a>&#8216;s $450 million in Robinhood stock, which the US government claimed last week while the former FTX CEO awaits trial on fraud allegations.<br /><br /><em>“We are engaged in a complex effort now to recreate petition date claim values for every customer. We are building financial statements from the ground up using the general ledger and bank transaction records rather than the previous incomplete and unreliable financial statements of the debtors,”</em> Dietderich said. <em>“This will put us in the position to describe the financial results of the debtors accurately for the first time.”</em> <br /><br />Lawyers went before Judge John Dorsey for a lengthy hearing that covered the potential sale of FTX businesses as well as whether the identities of the firm&#8217;s nine million clients should be redacted.<br /><br />According to Kevin Cofsky, a partner at FTX&#8217;s proposed investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners, FTX could sell its main exchange during the bankruptcy process.<br /><br /><em>“We have already initiated a review of a reorganization of the core exchange, and that process is ongoing,”</em> Cofsky said. Four companies that FTX claims are largely independent of the crypto giant and could lose value if sold later are being sold first. LedgerX, Embed, FTX Japan, and FTX Europe is those companies.<br /><br />Following discussions regarding the redacted customer list, Dorsey decided to keep the majority of customer and creditor identities secret for at least another three months because such individuals or organizations may have privacy issues if their information is made public. Major investors in FTX, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel, Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, and Kevin O&#8217;Leary, have already had their names made public in court.</p>

<li>The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has decreased by more than 5%</li>
<li>Binance transferred 4 trillion Shiba Inu (about equivalent to $36 million) to an unidentified wallet in one transaction</li>
<li>Shibburn said that ShibaSwap was used by Binance to stake those 4 trillion SHIB tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past 24 hours, the price of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-price-analysis-shiba-inu-holds-key-support-200-billion-shib-bought-by-top-whale/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> has decreased by more than 3%. As of the time of publication, SHIB is trading at $0.00000892. Its 24-hour trading volume has likewise decreased by 5%. Binance, according to WhaleAlert, transferred 4 trillion Shiba Inu (approximately $36 million) to an unidentified wallet in a single transaction. Shibburn said that ShibaSwap was used by Binance to stake those 4 trillion SHIB tokens. Shiba Inu tokens worth about $36 million have been temporarily removed from circulation as a result of this action. Shibburn continued by mentioning another transaction in which Binance unstaked 12.6 trillion Shiba Inu tokens (about $116.2 million worth) from ShibaSwap. The biggest cryptocurrency exchange, however, re-staked 4 trillion Shiba Inu coins after this transaction. Shiba Archives had previously declared Binance to be the largest holder of Shiba Inu. Along with other assets, including $255 million worth of Ethereum, Binance added SHIB tokens worth $76 million.</p>
<p><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />

<h4>SHIB/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63904 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-Daily-Chart-Jan-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-Daily-Chart-Jan-11.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-Daily-Chart-Jan-11-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-Daily-Chart-Jan-11-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-Daily-Chart-Jan-11-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-Daily-Chart-Jan-11-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-Daily-Chart-Jan-11-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">SHIB/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) began a new slide against USD after breaking through the $0.00000950 barrier level. The SHIB/USD pair has lately begun an upward retracement after trading as low as $0.00000779. A clear rise over the $0.00000880 zone and the moving average (MA 50) occurred.</p>
<p>The pair is currently stabilizing below $0.00000950. The $0.00001000 level is an immediate upward resistance. The next significant barrier is located near the daily moving average (MA 200) at the $0.00001100 level. A clear break above the $0.00001000 resistance level might drive the price up near the next significant barrier where bears may appear.</p>
<h4>SHIB/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63905 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Jan-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Jan-11.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Jan-11-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Jan-11-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Jan-11-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Jan-11-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Jan-11-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">SHIB/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-price-analysis-shiba-inu-gains-18-shib-burn-rate-spikes-538-as-519-million-tokens-are-burned-in-single-transaction/">SHIB/USD</a> got trapped around $0.00000950 immediately after the bounce and returned toward the 4-hour moving average (MA 50) near $0.00000865. Interestingly, the congestion is developing around the lower boundary before the bearish channel of 2022. A break above the $0.00000950 resistance level could pave the way for a move towards $0.00001000 next.</p>
<p>Above here we&#8217;ll also have the upside bulls converging. The SHIB/USD has broken out of its very narrow range since December and not until this week the pair is seeing a mild retracement. So, this bullish breakout could hold, and if it does, we might see a strong recovery in this pair.</p>

<p>The price of Avalanche’s native token, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/avax-price-analysis-avalanche-is-trading-up-in-a-sea-of-red-enters-top-10-as-vaneck-avax-etn-launches/">AVAX</a>, surged nearly 17% within an hour following news of Avalanche’s collaboration with Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis.<br /><br />At the time of writing, AVAX is up 13.69% in the last 24 hours at $14.46 as some of the gains had eased. AVAX price gains remain significant as most cryptocurrencies were posting slight gains or even losses as investors pulled profits from the recent Altcoin rally earlier in the week.<br /><br />Ava Labs and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have partnered to hasten the adoption of blockchain by businesses, organizations, and the government. <br /><br />Through the AWS Marketplace, AWS supports the infrastructure and dApp ecosystem of Avalanche, including a one-click node setup. An essential feature and prerequisite for businesses and governments, Avalanche node operators can run in AWS GovCloud for FedRAMP compliance use cases.<br /><br />Now that Ava Labs is a part of the AWS Partner Network (APN), it is able to assist clients in deploying custom offerings on AWS that are interconnected with more than 100,000 partners in more than 150 nations.<br /><br />Subnet deployment as a managed service will be added by Ava Labs to the AWS Marketplace so that anybody may quickly launch a unique Subnet, including organizations.<br /><br />The AWS-Avalanche partnership makes it simpler for more users to set up and maintain nodes on Avalanche, enhancing the network&#8217;s strength and developer flexibility. Additionally, Ava Labs joining AWS Activate allows builders in the Avalanche ecosystem to benefit from AWS credits.<br /><br />The Avalanche Summit, Avalanche Creates, and hackathons are just a few of the business and developer events that Ava Labs and AWS are working on together to enable everyone, technical or not, to reach their goals of creating on Avalanche.</p>
<h2>International Chess Federation Enters Web3 With Avalanche Integration</h2>
<p>In other positive news, the organization that oversees competitive international chess, FIDE, is using Avalanche to create Web3 products. Over 500 million people play chess worldwide, and FIDE tournaments like the World Chess Championship and Chess Olympiad draw hundreds of millions of viewers.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/avalanche-raises-42m-from-token-sale-in-4-5-hours/">Avalanche</a> and Core will be promoted as sponsors at FIDE competitions, such as the upcoming 2022 World Rapid and Blitz Championships, and they will contribute to FIDE&#8217;s product development to bring chess to Web3.<br /><br />Ava Labs and FIDE will collaborate closely to employ blockchain technology to address chess-related difficulties, promote game integrity, onboard new generations of players, and drive innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a recent<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-10/binance-bnb-acknowledges-past-flaws-in-managing-busd-peg-stablecoin-reserves?utm_content=business&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter"> Bloomberg report</a>, Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, has admitted to historical concerns with the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. According to statistics produced by blockchain analytics firm ChainArgos and evaluated by Bloomberg, the difference between the stablecoin&#8217;s reserves and total supply surpassed $1 billion three times.<br /><br />A Binance representative described the process of maintaining a steady $1 peg as <em>&#8220;challenging,&#8221;</em> but highlighted that there have been considerable advancements in the management of the BUSD stablecoin.<br /><br />They also stated that there was no impact on user redemptions and that this issue had not affected anyone else, despite minor anomalies appearing in the data. Binance CEO <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-sues-bloomberg-unit-for-libel/">Changpeng Zhao</a> slammed the Bloomberg report as <em>&#8220;FUD&#8221;</em> in a recent tweet, ostensibly emphasizing that BNB remains in fourth place in terms of market capitalization.<br /><br />The BUSD dispute is an example that emphasizes the significance of competent asset management by stablecoin operators, particularly as some of them pioneer new horizons such as algorithmic stability methods. <br /><br />The collapse of TerraUSD last May serves as a strong lesson to stablecoin holders to remain alert. It remains to be seen how much distrust this event will instill among consumers, who rely on these issuers to provide some kind of protection in unpredictable crypto markets.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-lender-blockfi-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection/">BlockFi</a>, a bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, is attempting to reimburse its investors. In a recent bankruptcy court hearing, the firm&#8217;s lawyers claimed that BlockFi executives paid $15 million to an investor who threatened to sue the company due to its plunging share value in the summer of 2022.<br /><br />The investor, identified only as Counterparty A, had purchased equity shares as part of executive compensation packages. The shares were worth more in 2022 due to the company&#8217;s $6 billion valuation. However, there was havoc on the market with the collapse of the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-s-sbf-bows-out-following-liquidity-crunch/">FTX ecosystem</a>, resulting in the value of BlockFi shares falling.<br /><br />As per BlockFi attorney Joshua Sussberg, the investor threatened to sue, claiming that BlockFi and its officials should have been more forthcoming about the risks of contagion in such an occurrence. The accusations, however, were dropped after the settlement amount was received.<br /><br />BlockFi founder Zac Prince provided $6.144 million of the $15 million. According to Sussberg,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I think the important takeaway here is that there was no situation where insiders were pulling money off the platform on the eve of or anywhere near this bankruptcy file&#8230; So this is not the Celsius case where management extracted value on the eve of the file.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of the company&#8217;s exposure to FTX, the value of BlockFi shares has plummeted dramatically. On July 1, 2022, the crypto exchange extended an emergency loan to the lending platform. The financing enabled FTX to purchase BlockFi for $240 million, creating a maximum value for existing shares. <br /><br />This buyout price led to the founder, Zak Prince, losing $412.82 million in stock and missing out on a $600,000 bonus payment. The failure of the loan platform also resulted in the layoff of 20% of BlockFi&#8217;s personnel. Although an employee bonus package is being prepared for court approval, Prince and other upper management will not be considered.<br /><br />The site has also requested authorization from the courts to restore frozen assets from BlockFi wallets to users.<br /><br />The loan platform declared bankruptcy in November 2022, just weeks after the FTX ecosystem collapsed. Both companies had been at odds over $435 million in Robinhood shares that BlockFi claimed as collateral for an outstanding obligation owed to it by FTX partner <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-and-alameda-merge-venture-capital-operations/">Alameda Research</a>. The shares were seized by the US Department of Justice, complicating matters even further.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-polygon-matic-briefly-spikes-16-following-robinhood-listing-heres-what-to-watch/">Polygon (MATIC)</a> briefly surpassed the key (MA 50) barrier at $0.850 on Jan. 10 as its price slightly rebounded. At the time of publication, MATIC was up 2.36% at $0.849. According to staking rewards, MATIC took the top spot for the week in net staking inflow. MATIC saw the highest net staking inflow of $127,993,510, surpassing Ethereum&#8217;s $122 million staking inflow. MATIC has also set a new record in staking, as the staking balance reaches an all-time high of 3.55 billion MATIC. MATIC&#8217;s staking metrics are currently: a nominal yield of 6.08%, an adjusted yield of 3.30%, and a staking market cap of $2.97 billion. Mastercard is launching a spotlight program for emerging musical artists built on the Polygon blockchain to help up-and-coming creators tap into the power of Web3 and blockchain technologies. Kicking off in spring 2023, the Mastercard Artist Accelerator program will provide five emerging artists—such as musicians, DJs, and producers—with the tools, skills, and access they need to forge their musical paths in the digital economy.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1.150, $1.000, $0.950<br />Support Levels: $0.800, $0.750, $0.700</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-where-will-matic-price-go-in-wake-of-recent-market-events-polygon-teases-big-reveal/">MATIC</a> is currently soaring at $0.85, seeking to break through to the $0.90 zone. The MATIC/USD pair could be on the verge of breaking out toward the bullish zone. If the breakout occurs, a push past the $1.0 level is possible. If the upward pressure continues, bullish traders will almost certainly approach the next horizontal resistance line, which is positioned at overbought RSI levels.<br /><br />A sustained break out of the $0.80 convergence zone, on the other hand, will indicate that MATIC consolidation from the $0.70 level is not yet complete. If the $0.95 ceiling is retested first, the daily bias could shift to the positive side. A break below the $0.80 level, on the other hand, may result in a lower correction.</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63887 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The MATIC/USD intraday bias is stable, with the focus shifting from $0.85 support to $0.90 resistance. As a result, a continuous breach may imply that the $0.876 pullback was effective. The intraday bias will shift back to the upside to retest this level.<br /><br />Breaking the MATIC/USD level of $0.876 will indicate a resumption of growth from the level of $0.832. The intraday trend is strengthening once more. The long-term level of $1.0 is the next aim. A break below the minor support level of $0.80, on the other hand, could shift the expected bullish bias to neutral and result in sideways trading.</p>
