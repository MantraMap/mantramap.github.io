<h2>Ackman Calls for Urgent Action as Time Runs Out to Prevent More Bank Failures</h2>
<p>Billionaire Bill Ackman, CEO and portfolio manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, has warned that time is running out for the U.S. government to fix the banking system. He tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The regional banking system is at risk … The rapid rise in rates impaired assets and drained deposits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ackman explained that the “failure” of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) “to update and expand its insurance regime has hammered more nails in the coffin.” He stressed that First Republic Bank “would not have failed if the FDIC temporarily guaranteed deposits while a new guarantee regime were created. Instead, we watch the dominoes fall at great systemic and economic cost.” First Republic Bank was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">seized</a> by regulators earlier this week and most of its assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>The billionaire added that globally systemic banks (G-SIBs) “have an unfair competitive advantage as too big to fail means only their uninsured depositors can sleep soundly. Until the playing field is leveled, the regional banks are at grave risk.”</p>

<p>Ackman continued: “Confidence in a financial institution is built over decades and destroyed in days. As each domino falls, the next weakest bank begins to wobble. Until investors are rewarded for betting on a wobbling bank, there will be no bid, and the best sale is the last price.” He stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are running out of time to fix this problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>“How many more unnecessary bank failures do we need to watch before the FDIC, U.S. Treasury, and our government wake up? We need a systemwide deposit guarantee regime now,” he concluded.</p>

<h2>722 Banks Reported Unrealized Losses of More Than 50% of Capital</h2>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has revealed in a board presentation by the Division of Supervision and Regulation that 722 banks reported unrealized losses exceeding 50% of their capital at the end of the third quarter of 2022. The presentation, released to the public in April, is dated Feb. 14. It highlights the impact of raising interest rates on certain banks and the Fed&#8217;s supervisory approach to address issues at these banks.</p>
<p>“Rising interest rates are creating significant unrealized losses in investment securities and in some cases depressing tangible equity,” the Fed presentation states. “As interest rates increase, banks with large market value losses could experience increased financial and risk management challenges.”</p>
<p>The Fed presentation further details:</p>
<blockquote><p>At third quarter end, 722 banks reported unrealized losses exceeding 50% of capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, “31 of these banks report negative tangible equity levels,” which means they are currently “not able to borrow new money from Federal Home Loan Banks and may lose the ability to sell loans to Government Sponsored Enterprises,&#8221; the Fed presentation adds.</p>

<p>Many people took to social media Saturday to voice concerns about the U.S. banking crisis. Some stressed that this is a clear indication that the banking crisis is far from being resolved while others warned that the banking crisis in the U.S. is just getting started.</p>
<p>Gabor Gurbacs, director of Digital Assets Strategy at investment management firm Vaneck, opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed had the data, knew what could be coming after their reckless interest rate policies yet they didn’t meaningfully warn either the government or the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite multiple bank failures, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">insisted</a> that the U.S. banking system is &#8220;sound and resilient.&#8221; Regarding the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, the Fed chairman claimed: &#8220;Those have all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiple people have cautioned that the U.S. banking crisis is not over, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who said last month that there will be &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-says-banking-crisis-not-over-warns-of-repercussions-for-years-to-come/">repercussions for years to come</a>.&#8221; Economist Peter Schiff also recently warned that the banking crisis is not over and a much worse <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-says-banking-crisis-not-over-much-worse-financial-crisis-incoming-warns-of-massive-recession/">financial crisis</a> is incoming.</p>

In its application challenging the injunction, Binance said the action had been taken without notice. Binance also said it could not comply with the injunction since it was granted after the fraudulently acquired crypto assets in question were moved.</strong></p>
<h2>Claimant Proceeded Against Binance Without Notice</h2>
<p>A United Kingdom high court recently ruled to set aside an interim proprietary injunction against the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The interim injunction, which required Binance to preserve a certain amount of cryptocurrency, was issued after a victim of cryptocurrency fraud claimed to have traced the stolen funds to the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>According to a recent post on the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills&#x2019; <a href="https://hsfnotes.com/litigation/2023/05/04/high-court-sets-aside-interim-proprietary-injunction-against-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance/">blog</a>, the discharge of an injunction against Binance is one of the first known cases where a cryptocurrency exchange has challenged granting a proprietary injunction. The proprietary injunction, which was granted on October 18, 2022, was issued in respect of 470,904 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> stablecoins that were traced to Binance user accounts.</p>
<p>However, following the granting of this injunction, Binance applied for the setting aside of the injunction. The crypto exchange argued that the claimant proceeded to seek the injunction without notice. Binance also argued that it was not possible for it to comply with the injunction since it was granted after the funds in question had been moved.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was impossible in practice for Binance to comply with the injunction because the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> in question had been transferred to its central pooled funds address where they had been mixed and dissipated in the ordinary course of its business before it was served with the injunction,&#x201D; Binance said.</p>
<p>In addition to setting aside the injunction, the high court also ordered the claimant &#x201C;to pay Binance&#x2019;s costs of the application on the indemnity basis amounting to &#xA3;90,000 [$113,685.00].&#x201D;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Legal Risks for Crypto Fraud Victims</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in the same blog post, the law firm sought to point out the difference between obtaining an injunction against the account owner and serving this &#x201C;on the exchange as a third party&#x201D; versus identifying the crypto exchange as a respondent.</p>
<p>The law firm also argued that if an injunction against the cryptocurrency exchange &#x201C;is inappropriately obtained&#x201D; and is later &#x201C;discharged,&#x201D; this may leave the fraud victim &#x201C;with a significant adverse costs order.&#x201D; Therefore, before seeking an injunction, Herbert Smith Freehills, which acts for Binance in relation to the claim, said legal advisers of victims of crypto fraud should first distinguish the position of a crypto exchange from that of other defendants.</p>
<p>They should also consider if there is a proper basis for making an application against the exchange without notice. Legal advisers should see to it that there are identifiable assets when an application is made, the blog post added.</p>

Two sources have claimed that the securities regulator is scrutinizing the bank&#8217;s executives for making trades using confidential information. Although the sources have not named any specific individuals under investigation, they assert that the SEC is looking into the matter. Furthermore, reports indicate that U.S. lawmakers sold shares of the troubled bank before it collapsed and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase. </strong></p>
<h2>Securities Watchdog Investigates First Republic Execs</h2>
<p>On May 1, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">took control</a> of First Republic Bank, a San Francisco-based financial institution, and placed it under the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). With $229 billion in assets, this was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">second largest bank failure</a> in U.S. history, following the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual (Wamu).</p>
<p>In the wake of the First Republic Bank&#8217;s collapse, Sabrina Willmer and Austin Weinstein, reporters for Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/first-republic-executives-trading-probed-by-sec-investigators?leadSource=uverify%20wall">revealed</a> that &#8220;two people familiar with the matter&#8221; disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating the bank&#8217;s executives for potential insider trading schemes. This development comes on the heels of the SEC&#8217;s investigation into the executives of Silicon Valley Bank, whose failure resulted in the third-largest bank collapse in U.S. history.</p>
<p>According to Willmer and Weinstein, when they reached out to the SEC and JPMorgan Chase for comment on the alleged investigation into First Republic Bank, representatives from both entities &#8220;declined&#8221; to provide a statement. The sources who disclosed the investigation did not identify any specific executives from First Republic, and the reporters emphasized that no one from the bank has been accused of any misconduct.</p>
<h2>U.S. Lawmakers Dump First Republic Shares Prior to Bank’s Failure</h2>
<p>In addition to the information provided by Willmer and Weinstein&#8217;s sources, several other <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/05/04/lawmakers-dump-first-republic-shares-amid-banking-crisis.html">reports</a> suggest that U.S. lawmakers sold off their shares in First Republic prior to its collapse. During the fallout of First Republic Bank, Florida Democrat Lois Frankel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/democratic-congresswoman-first-republic-stock/index.html">disclosed</a> that she had sold her shares in the bank prior to its collapse and had instead invested in JPMorgan Chase. In an interview with CNN, Frankel explained that her stocks are &#8220;managed independently by a money manager who buys and sells stocks at his discretion.&#8221;</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that U.S. officials have been accused of selling off stocks before a market crash. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, several members of the United States Senate were <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market/">accused</a> of violating the 2012 STOCK Act. However, no charges were filed against the lawmakers and the cases were eventually closed. In a 2022 editorial, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/13/us/politics/congress-members-stock-trading-list.html">reported</a> that 97 members of the U.S. Congress had reported trades in companies that were &#8220;influenced by their committees.&#8221;</p>

As of today, the TVL amounts to $49.31 billion, registering a 1% increase within the last 24 hours.</strong></p>
<h2>TVL in Defi Shows Signs of Improvement, Yet to Surpass Previous Record of $53 Billion</h2>
<p>Currently, the combined TVL across all defi platforms stands at <a href="https://defillama.com">$49.31 billion</a> as of May 6, 2023, with Lido Finance leading the pack by commanding a 24.82% share of $12.24 billion on Saturday. Over the past month, Lido&#x2019;s TVL has grown by 9%, while posting a moderate 2.42% increase in the preceding week. The remaining top five candidates in today&#x2019;s defi landscape include Makerdao, Aave, Curve Finance, and Uniswap; three out of these four experienced monthly downturns, with Uniswap being the exception by posting a 3.48% gain over the past 30 days.</p>

<p>Ethereum takes the lion&#x2019;s share of this TVL with its <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">$28.66 billion</a> accounting for over 58% of the defi market cap. Following Ethereum are other contenders such as Tron, BSC, Arbitrum, and Polygon who boast relatively large TVL statistics. Both Tron and Arbitrum have recorded monthly gains of 7.77% and 9.98%, respectively. However, BSC stands as the top defi-chain loser in terms of TVL losses from last month with a decrease of approximately 6.52%.</p>

<p>A sizable $16.416 billion worth of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> (8,550,940 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) is locked in liquid staking platforms out of the entire $49.31 billion amount locked in defi systems today. The dominant liquid staking platforms for Ethereum are Lido, Coinbase, Rocket Pool, Frax, and Stakewise. Rocket Pool and Frax have witnessed impressive 30-day increases of 29.75% and 39.49%, respectively. Furthermore, the largest number of defi applications belongs to Ethereum with 771 protocols in total.</p>

<p>While Binance Smart Chain and Polygon follow Ethereum&#x2019;s protocol count with 593 and 409 applications, respectively, Tron &#x2014; the second-biggest defi blockchain &#x2014; has only 18 associated protocols. However, Tron boasts the highest user base among the top five defi platforms with 2,538,896 participants. Ethereum&#x2019;s active user count for its defi apps is approximately 332,548. Although the TVL in defi has shown signs of improvement in 2023, it has yet to surpass its previous record of $53 billion.</p>

During a meeting with his colleagues in India, Moscow’s top diplomat also discussed the similar initiative within BRICS.</strong></p>
<h2>Sergey Lavrov Convinced SCO Countries Will Switch to National Currencies, Won’t Rule Out Single Fiat</h2>
<p>There is understanding about increasing the use of national currencies in settlements between the member states of the SCO, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov said after conferring with counterparts in Panaji, capital of the Indian state of Goa.</p>
<p>To achieve that, Lavrov believes participants can apply practices that are being formed in the Eurasian Development Bank, the Asian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the New Development Bank established by the BRICS bloc.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this was discussed. All of this is very relevant. All this is now being considered by the relevant departments, ministries of finance, central banks,” Lavrov was quoted as saying by the Tass news agency. He also emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>This work is underway, and, in general, it cannot be stopped.</p></blockquote>
<p>The head of the Russian diplomacy also reminded about the proposal put forward by President of Brazil Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the transition towards payments in national currencies in the BRICS group of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).</p>
<p>The topic has been also discussed at the SCO meeting, including the creation of “some kind of aggregated currency” which, in Lavrov’s words, cannot be ruled out either.</p>
<p>“The main thing now is to consider practical issues that will make it possible to protect the cooperation of independent states,” he said, accusing the West of abusing its position in the global economy and the reserve currency status of the U.S. dollar and the euro.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://eng.sectsco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCO</a>, the world’s largest regional organization which unites China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and several Central Asian nations, is preparing to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/syria-urges-brics-to-lead-in-ditching-dollar-talks-yuan-adoption-with-china/">ditch the dollar</a> in favor of settlements in the national currencies of members, its Deputy Secretary General Grigory Logvinov <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worlds-largest-regional-organization-to-switch-to-settlements-in-national-currencies/">unveiled</a> in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Despite intentions to move away from the greenback, however, the introduction of a common currency is not yet being considered by its members, the Russian diplomat noted. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">BRICS</a>, arguably the world’s largest bloc by gross domestic product (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-emerges-as-the-worlds-largest-gdp-bloc-propelled-by-chinas-rapid-expansion/">GDP</a>), also intends to initially <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">promote</a> the use of its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currencies-to-have-no-alternative-former-russian-president-medvedev-says/">national currencies</a>.</p>

<h2>Voyager Digital Expects Initial Distributions to Creditors ‘Within the Next Few Weeks’</h2>
<p>Voyager Digital has published an update for creditors. According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1654203057591267329?s=20">tweet</a> from the firm on May 4, 2023, they may be able to expect some cash or crypto back &#8220;in a few weeks.&#8221; This update comes after a long and difficult journey for the TSX-listed crypto lender. Last year on July 1, 2022, Voyager Digital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tsx-listed-voyager-digital-temporarily-suspends-trading-deposits-and-withdrawals/">halted withdrawals</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/voyager-files-for-bankruptcy-citing-contagion-in-crypto-markets-three-arrows-capitals-loan-default/">filed for bankruptcy</a> just days later. Since then, the defunct business has been navigating the bankruptcy process after it was almost acquired by Binance US.</p>
<p>After Binance US <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-pulls-the-plug-voyager-purchase-deal-falls-through/">backed out of the deal</a>, the crypto lender has been left to navigate the bankruptcy process in the Southern District of New York in order to reimburse creditors. But despite the challenges, Voyager Digital says it is making progress. In the tweet on Thursday, the firm explained that they are &#8220;in the process of finalizing liquidation procedures.&#8221; Voyager also reminded creditors that the liquidation procedures must be filed before the plan can go into effect.</p>

<p>While Voyager is moving forward with their plan to reimburse creditors, there&#8217;s still a chance for objections. According to the firm, parties will have ten full days to object to the plan. If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go &#8220;effective&#8221; with the plan at that time. However, if an objection is filed, the court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go into effect. The plan had a clause that explained what would happen if the Binance US deal fell through, which allowed Voyager to begin liquidating assets.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1654203061277949952?s=20">stated</a> on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors. We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news of Voyager Digital&#8217;s plan to reimburse creditors has been met with mixed reactions. While many customers are pleased with the progress, others are feeling frustrated. One person <a href="https://twitter.com/NoLimitAlski/status/1654203694945017856?s=20">responded</a> that customers wanted their assets “last August and July.&#8221; Another individual <a href="https://twitter.com/JOSHREKT/status/1654216255522447360?s=20">stressed</a> on Twitter, &#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; And yet another person <a href="https://twitter.com/tvch2/status/1654250696152174599?s=20">added</a>, &#8220;No one, I repeat no one, file an objection! Ok!&#8221;</p>

The company said it will use the funds to help it launch what it called the &#8220;world’s first federated operating system.&#8221; Obi Nwosu said the Fedi Alpha version, which is targeted at the builder community, is set to be rolled out later in May. </strong></p>
<h2>&#8216;Protecting User Privacy and Autonomy&#8217;</h2>
<p>The United States-based fintech and bitcoin-focused company Fedi announced on May 3 that it has raised $17 million in a Series A funding round. Ego Death Capital led the round that also saw TBD, Kingsway, Trammell Venture Partners, and Timechain taking part. The latest round brings the total funding raised by Fedi to $21.21 million.</p>
<p>In a statement on its <a href="https://www.fedi.xyz/blog/fedi-inc-announces-raising-17-million-in-series-a-round">blog</a>, the company said it will use the funds to help realize its goal of launching the &#8220;world’s first federated operating system.&#8221; According to the statement, Fedi wants the application to allow members of different communities to collaborate and take control of their funds, data and digital lives &#8220;while still protecting user privacy and autonomy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obi Nwosu, the founder and CEO of Fedi, is quoted in the statement expressing his satisfaction with the makeup investors that have come on board. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are excited that with so much interest in this round, we were able to select investors who are fully aligned on the future we are trying to create with Fedi, the world’s first federated operating system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nwosu, a bitcoin advocate, added that he wants the app to enable not just bitcoiners or tech-savvy individuals but anyone attempting to &#8220;solve real problems&#8221; within their respective community to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Fedi&#8217;s Initial Focus</h2>
<p>As explained in Fedi&#8217;s blog post, the company wants to initially &#8220;focus on a few core functions like securely storing and transacting bitcoin.&#8221; Protecting user data as well as ensuring safe and secure communications between community members are also areas that Fedi will focus on, the blog post added.</p>
<p>In his remarks following Fedi’s announcement, Jeff Booth, co-founder of Ego Death Capital, praised the bitcoin-focused company’s offering which he said enables users to &#8220;take back control of everything that matters in [their] digital life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nwosu is quoted in the blog stating that his company is hoping to unveil details about the Fedi Alpha version which is targeted at the builder community. According to the post, Fedi hopes to roll out this version sometime in May.</p>

If enacted as law, the bill, which is being discussed by a Texas House committee, would create an electronic system for users to transact and pay with this digital currency and would also allow them to execute redemptions for the gold specie, or coins, backing it.</strong></p>
<h2>Texas House Committee Passes Gold-Backed Digital Currency Bill</h2>
<p>A Texas House committee has taken the first steps in the discussion of a bill that creates a digital currency 100% backed by gold specie. The bill, identified as <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/HB04903I.pdf#navpanes=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HB4903</a>, which was introduced on March 10 by Representative Mark Dorazio, has garnered the support of 42 sponsors and is ready to exit by the House State Affairs Committee to be voted on by the House.</p>
<p>The bill specifies that the comptroller of the state will &#8220;establish a digital currency that is backed by gold so that each unit of the digital currency issued represents a particular<br />fraction of a troy ounce of gold held in trust.&#8221; In the same way, the state will have to design an electronic system to allow citizens to freely transact with this currency to make payments.</p>

<h2>Custody and Redemptions</h2>
<p>The bill, in its current state, establishes that the custody of the gold backing the digital currency will be provided by the Texas state comptroller, or can be assigned to a third party, which will have to maintain the same amount of gold as the issuance of the digital currency, making it a 100% backed digital currency.</p>
<p>Redemptions of the currency will be processed in gold specie or in money, with the comptroller of the state or a contracted third party managing these redemptions. The implementation of this bill would cost the state $25 million for a limited system, with a more functional transactions system costing up to $100 million, according to <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/fiscalnotes/html/HB04903I.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimations</a>.</p>
<p>However, the bill has managed to get grassroots support, evidenced by a 78-page document <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/publiccomments/billhistory/HB04903H.pdf#navpanes=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> on April 26, signed by several Texans calling for the approval of this sound money law.</p>
<p>Other states are also pursuing laws to establish alternatives to the U.S. dollar as a transactional and reserve currency. On April 11, Arkansas <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/arkansas-makes-gold-silver-legal-tender-23-states-involved-in-similar-legislation-to-establish-us-dollar-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> a bill that makes gold and silver legal tender, allowing its citizens to use gold specie to legally pay debts and obligations without having tax implications, and 23 more states are also involved in similar legislation.</p>
