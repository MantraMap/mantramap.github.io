<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Jasmine Monsegue, aka Spacebrat, released her first free NFT called &#8220;Gleam&#8221; through Holograph&#8217;s open mint, which became popular, exceeding her expectations.</em></li>



<li><em>The NFT was minted over 300k times across several chains, with the lion&#8217;s share on Polygon, and around 164k unique wallets participated.</em></li>



<li><em>Holograph is a protocol for multi-chain art and digital collectibles. It bridges NFTs across several chains, currently supporting Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Polygon.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jasmine Monsegue, also known as Spacebrat, is a talented artist who recently made her first foray into the Web3 space with her first free NFT called ‚ÄúGleam‚Äù. The NFT was released through an open edition mint, and its popularity exceeded her expectations.</strong></h5>

<p>In fact, planet Earth minted her first NFT more than 30,762 times in just 23 hours, an impressive feat that left Monsegue cheering on Twitter. But that was only halfway through the mint‚Äôs 48-hour window. The protocol called Holograph provided fans with the capability to mint the NFT over 300,000 times across several chains, and the lion‚Äôs share of collectors claimed their token on Polygon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The NFT was created by CXIP Labs, and the protocol takes a multi-chain approach toward art and digital collectibles, yielding assets ‚Äúthat exist as single instances across multiple execution environments,‚Äù according to the protocol‚Äôs website. This means that users can then bridge the NFTs‚Äîunique digital tokens that signify ownership of an item, often digital art‚Äîacross several chains. Currently, it supports Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Polygon.</p>



<p>Monsegue is not just any artist. Her work has been featured in Vogue and Hypebeast, and she has designed murals for Virgil Abloh&#8217;s OFF WHITE and done commissioned work for Drake. Her work has been a sensation, and the piece featured in the NFT mint, ‚ÄúGleam,‚Äù was previously exhibited at WHAAM!, an art gallery in New York, for her solo show, ‚ÄúPipe Dream.‚Äù</p>



<p>While the NFT is currently available on secondary marketplaces such as OpenSea, each chain has its own dedicated page, whether that‚Äôs for Ethereum-based versions of ‚ÄúGleam‚Äù or those that exist on Polygon. The NFT was originally available for free during the two-day window through Holograph‚Äôs website, where collectors could choose which chain to mint their collectible on, but they still had to pay costs associated with transactions, also known as gas fees.</p>



<p>Of the 301,798 times ‚ÄúGleam‚Äù was minted, the NFT was minted around 203,000 times on Polygon, the Ethereum scaling solution, a spokesperson for Holograph told Decrypt, citing a Dune query. The numbers of versions of ‚ÄúGleam‚Äù minted on Avalanche or BNB Chain, which totaled around 53,000 and 46,000, respectively, were significantly smaller. On Ethereum, the collectible was minted just 82 times.</p>



<p>Despite the success of the NFT, it is important to note that the total number of unique wallets that participated in the open-edition mint was around 164,000, according to a Dune query cited by the spokesperson. One wallet minted ‚ÄúGleam‚Äù a total of 1,241 times, while at least 50 other wallets minted ‚ÄúGleam‚Äù in excess of 100 times.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Curve Finance shares that Curve&#8217;s native stablecoin crvUSD contract redeployment is complete.</em></li>



<li><em>This implementation has been tested in place through soft liquidation of address difference transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, Curve&#8217;s stablecoin went through several tweaks due to some bugs.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeFi protocol Curve Finance tweeted yesterday evening that the re-implementation of Curve&#8217;s native stablecoin crvUSD contract is complete. This implementation has been tested in place through soft liquidation of address difference transactions.</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">crvUSD redeployment done. Arb traders &#8211; please update addresses in your bots!<a href="https://t.co/iqCDvO402B" target="_blank">https://t.co/iqCDvO402B</a></p>&mdash; Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1657725762055667716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Additionally, Curve Finance reported that the DAO raised about $2,000 from about 1.5 million crvUSD and stable crvUSD generated from Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) last week. These are &#8220;test revenue,&#8221; so they don&#8217;t translate into fee allocations but test what&#8217;s possible in the product.</p>



<p>Prior to that, Curve Finance <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185347-crvusd-completes-third-deployment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will re-deploy </a>crypto-backed stablecoins due to a crash in the first rollout. A bug in the original script was identified through a peer-review process.</p>



<p>This happened after the team identified an issue with the initial rollout that could prevent Curve (veCRV) token holders from escrow from voting for rewards from the liquidity pool containing their new crvUSD stablecoin. To get around this, the team said it would need to redeploy the stablecoin.</p>



<p>This announcement follows yesterday&#8217;s team&#8217;s confirmation that smart contracts for crvUSD have been deployed. However, they also note that the final launch still needs to be completed as the user interface &#8211; the user interface for interacting with crvUSD smart contracts &#8211; is still under development.</p>

<p>The implementation marks a significant milestone in Curve&#8217;s long-awaited stablecoin public launch. Curve, one of the largest decentralized marketplaces focused on stablecoins, with around $5 billion in assets on the protocol, announced last year that it had begun developing stablecoins pegged to its dollars.</p>



<p>According to the white paper, what sets crvUSD apart from its competitors is a new loan liquidity algorithm called LLAMA. This algorithm continuously rebalances users&#8217; collateral as cryptocurrency prices fluctuate.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Litecoin&#8217;s visibility boosted by the LTC20 standard and hype around upcoming halving.</em></li>



<li><em>LTC price maintained resilience against the downside in the last five days.</em></li>



<li><em>Contrary to top cryptocurrencies which continued slipping lower</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin has two primary reasons behind its recent hype. One of them being the LTC20 standard, which has resulted in an increase in address activity. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>This has created more visibility for Litecoin and has also supported its price action. Another reason is the upcoming halving event which is expected to take place in August.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that Litecoin‚Äôs price has maintained its resilience against the downside in the last five days, which is a noteworthy feat. The top cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, have been slipping lower. This has led some experts to question whether Litecoin can continue to sustain this resistance against the downside.</p>



<p>While the upcoming halving event has undoubtedly contributed to LTC‚Äôs recent price surge, it is not the only reason behind its upside. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s price action has been trading at a long-term support level, which means that investors are likely to avoid selling. This support level has been instrumental in Litecoin&#8217;s ability to hold its ground at the current price level of $80.95, at press time.</p>



<p>Litecoin&#8217;s recent success can be attributed to its increased visibility due to the LTC20 standard and the hype around the upcoming halving event. Additionally, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price action has been trading at a long-term support level which has helped it sustain its recent price surge. While the hype around the halving event will eventually run its course, Litecoin&#8217;s long-term support level is likely to continue providing stability to its price action.</p>

<p>Although Litecoin&#8217;s current support seems to be holding up well, there is still a chance that the price could fall below its current support level. This is because the halving event, which will decrease the supply of Litecoin, is still over two months away. During this time, market momentum could shift and investors may become hesitant, causing the price to decrease. If the price does fall below support, it could lead to a potential buying opportunity for investors who are looking to enter the market at a lower price point. As always, it&#8217;s important to keep an eye on market trends and news that could impact LTC&#8217;s price in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Recently, Twitter user Mike Hassard dug up the case of Roman Sterlingov, accused of operating Bitcoin Fog, a Bitcoin mixing service. While Roman has incorporated mixing into his personal privacy practices when transferring Bitcoin, he is wrongfully accused of operating the service. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Roman Sterlingov is wrongfully accused of operating Bitcoin Fog, a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Bitcoin</a> mixing service. This is the first in a series of threads  I will post in an effort to spread word of this unjust prosecution.</p>&mdash; Mike Hassard (@mikehassard) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikehassard/status/1657808025300639748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The government has seized all his remaining assets, and he remains trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare at the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Virginia.</p>



<p>Following the thread, Roman moved from Russia to J√∂nk√∂ping with his mother in 2003 and excelled in math and science at school. In 2010, he first heard about Bitcoin and was excited by the new technology. He learned how to set up wallets and funded them with his paycheck. Roman traveled to Bitcoin meetups across Europe, where he met like-minded individuals and helped them set up their own wallets. He purchased Bitcoin in bulk and sold it peer-to-peer to newcomers at the meetups, allowing them begin their own Bitcoin journeys.</p>



<p>At one of these meetups, someone suggested that Roman mix his Bitcoin before selling it to people he didn&#8217;t know. Roman learned that his wallet address became public when he made Bitcoin transactions. He worried that someone could target him and steal his funds. This led him to incorporate mixing into his personal privacy practices when transferring Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Roman created a Kraken account in 2014 and began using it as his daily Bitcoin account. By this time, Bitcoin had appreciated to approximately $475. Roman left his job and lived off the appreciation of his investment. He used Bitcoin Fog to send Bitcoin from his early wallets, through Bitcoin Fog, to a Kraken account held in his real name with KYC authentication. </p>



<p>In 2017, Roman realized that he had spent much of his Bitcoin and had not accumulated any new Bitcoin. He tried his hand at trading and multiple business ventures, including a VPN, a music studio, and a life coaching business, but all his efforts failed.</p>



<p>In April 2021, Roman flew to LAX to enroll in a commercial pilot licensing class in California. However, he was arrested by the FBI and accused of operating Bitcoin Fog for the past seven years. He was confused and shocked to hear that he was accused of creating and operating Bitcoin Fog. A Magistrate judge ordered Roman to be &#8220;detained indefinitely,&#8221; and he was transferred to Northern Neck Regional Jail, where he remains.</p>

<p>The SEC filed a motion on May 12 in a New Hampshire District Court, requesting a change to its original request for remedies in its successful case against LBRY. Instead of the original $22 million, which the SEC claimed LBRY had earned from the sale of its token LBRY Credits (LBC), the SEC is now asking for a fine of $111,614. The SEC cited LBRY&#8217;s &#8220;lack of funds and near-defunct status&#8221; as the reason for the decreased penalty.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Millions of dollars spent for a fine of $111,614.00 and a company financially ruined.

</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, the SEC is asking the court to prevent LBRY from conducting future unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities. In its filing, the SEC recognized and acknowledged LBRY&#8217;s representations that it is defunct, ceasing operations, and without the funds to pay a larger fine, and recognizes that a defendant&#8217;s ability to pay is a factor when imposing a civil penalty.</p>

<p>The SEC initially filed a civil suit against LBRY in March 2021, alleging that the firm&#8217;s LBC sales were unregistered securities offerings. It asked for $22 million in disgorgement and for the court to order LBRY to halt any further LBC sales. In November 2022, the SEC won the case, with the preceding Judge also ruling LBC was a security.</p>



<p>However, in a December filing, LBRY argued that the SEC&#8217;s request for $22 million was unreasonable, as it was &#8220;vastly&#8221; overstated and failed to &#8220;deduct any of LBRY&#8217;s legitimate business expenses.&#8221; According to LBRY, the SEC&#8217;s calculation was &#8220;based on rough, back-of-the-envelope math&#8221; and the amount it sought was &#8220;simply not supported by the record.&#8221;</p>

<p>Acknowledging LBRY&#8217;s concerns, the SEC is now seeking a reduced penalty, which it believes balances the need to deter future violations with LBRY&#8217;s inability to pay. With this in mind, the SEC has requested the court to impose a fine of $111,614 instead of the original $22 million.</p>



<p>LBRY had previously mentioned that it &#8220;will likely be dead in the near future&#8221; due to being &#8220;killed by legal and SEC debts&#8221; in December 2022, around a month after the SEC won the case.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>One million Bitcoin addresses now hold at least 1 BTC, reflecting a growing interest in crypto and a surge in wholecoiners.</em></li>



<li><em>As Bitcoin has dipped in price, the number of addresses holding at least one BTC has surged.</em></li>



<li><em>While one million marks a new record, one Bitcoin wallet.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to data from Glassnode, the number of Bitcoin wallet addresses holding one whole BTC or more has recently surpassed the one million mark. </strong></h5>



<p>This milestone was achieved on May 13, and it is noteworthy that many crypto investors have multiple BTC addresses. Additionally, some of the addresses belong to major institutions such as cryptocurrency exchanges and investment firms that typically own large sums of BTC.</p>

<p>As the price of Bitcoin fell over 65% last year, the number of wallet addresses holding one Bitcoin or more spiked. The most notable surges occurred during an acute market crash in June and from November 11, the date that FTX collapsed and subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Despite the price drop, a whopping 190,000 or so wholecoiners were added from early-February 2022, as the price of Bitcoin fell from its November 2021 highs.</p>



<p>Glassnode co-founder, @Negentropic, informed his 54,000 Twitter followers that the best time to buy BTC is when there‚Äôs ‚Äúblood in the streets.‚Äù His comments come in the wake of numerous major bank collapses in the United States, as well as the Fed looking to potentially pause interest rate hikes in the coming months. These are some of the reasons why Glassnode said that it ‚Äúremains confident‚Äù BTC can reach a price of $35,000 in the mid-term.</p>



<p>While the round number ‚Äúone million‚Äù marks a new notch in the record books, it‚Äôs worth pointing out that one BTC wallet address doesn‚Äôt always represent a single person. According to data from crypto analytics provider CoinGlass, of the roughly 19 million Bitcoin currently in circulation, 1.89 million of these BTC ‚Äî worth $50.7 billion ‚Äî are held on major centralized exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. Furthermore, a staggering 3 million BTC ‚Äî worth $80.4 billion and accounting for 17% of the total circulating supply ‚Äî are ‚Äúlost forever‚Äù according to estimates from Glassnode, which draws the figure from a combination of data including BTC sent to ‚Äúburn addresses,‚Äù wallets with lost keys and large accounts that have remained untouched for more than a decade.</p>

<p>The rapid growth of Bitcoin wallet addresses holding one whole BTC or more is impressive. Although there are factors that could potentially impact the value of Bitcoin such as major bank collapses and the Fed potentially pausing interest rate hikes, Glassnode remains confident in Bitcoin&#8217;s mid-term prospects. It is also important to note that one address does not always represent a single person, and a considerable portion of Bitcoin is held on centralized exchanges and considered &#8220;lost forever.&#8221;</p>

<li><em>Coinbase is reportedly experiencing an increase in canceled transactions for PayPal.</em></li>



<li><em>UK and Canadian users cannot sell or withdraw to Paypal.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange says users&#8217; funds are safe while their teams are working on a fix.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187171-paradigm-secures-50-million-stake-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> is experiencing a problem that prevents customers in the UK and Canada from selling or withdrawing their funds to Paypal.</strong></h5>

<p>5 hours ago, the largest electronic convenience exchange in the United States announced that they had recorded an error that caused a sudden increase in canceled transactions with Paypal.</p>



<p>The issue has prevented users of the exchange in the UK and Canada from making sales or withdrawing to their Paypal. It is not yet clear what caused the incident.</p>



<p>However, Coinbase also assured users that their funds were safe and their team was working on a fix. Paypal also said that they are working to fix the related transactions.</p>



<p>One of Coinbase&#8217;s goals is to add as many funding mechanisms as possible to make it easy to exchange digital currencies. As a step in that direction, the crypto exchange accepted PayPal (to sell bitcoins) and credit cards (to buy bitcoins) in 2016.</p>

<p>Thousands of Coinbase users use PayPal for their fiat currency transactions around the world. This integration allows Coinbase users to sell BTC and deposit their USD coins into a PayPal wallet.</p>



<p>PayPal integration is the third largest spending option besides bank purchases through automated clearinghouses (ACH), also capped at $25,000 daily, and wire transfers, without limits. With just a PayPal login to set up, it can provide users with an alternative to Coinbase&#8217;s cumbersome linking process for credit and debit cards (up to $5,000 weekly) and Bank accounts.</p>



<p>Buying crypto through PayPal ranks among Coinbase&#8217;s most expensive payment options. The 3.99% fee is as expensive as buying a debit card, although the limit is much higher. And it is markedly higher than the bank purchase fee of 1.49%. Sending US dollars from PayPal to Coinbase will trigger a 2.5% fee; ACH transfers are free.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency industry in Russia is undergoing a lot of changes and discussions. Recently, the Deputy Minister of Finance, Alexey Moiseev, revealed that the Federal Tax Service is likely to become the regulatory agency for the cryptocurrency industry in the country. It will be the entry window for market participants, the Federal Financial Supervisory Service, and the Central Bank. The government is also planning to appoint an agency to regulate the industry.</p>



<p>Currently, citizens, both legal entities and individuals, are permitted to mine, sell, or hold cryptocurrency. However, no other transactions, such as buybacks or payoffs, are allowed. All transactions must be declared and taxed as income. Information about wallets and transactions will be monitored by three organizations: the Federal Tax Service, Rosfinmonitoring, and the Central Bank.</p>



<p>The changes in the regulatory environment raise many questions about the future of the cryptocurrency market in Russia. There have been discussions about the legalization parameters and the risks associated with the industry, such as money laundering. A bill submitted to the State Duma proposes the appointment of an agency to regulate the industry, but the details of this department are still unclear.</p>

<p>In addition to the regulatory changes, Deputy Minister Moiseev spoke about the co-financing period under the new long-term savings program and how the marketplace will work for buying state property. These changes will significantly impact the cryptocurrency industry in Russia and its participants.</p>

<p>So far, OKX has no plans to list these tokens, but the decision to list will depend on the evolution of technology, liquidity, and the community.</p>



<p>The BRC-20 memecoin craze is overwhelming the Bitcoin network. These new meme coins are being minted using the BRC-20 standard.</p>



<p>Daily minting fees on BRC-20 hit a record high of 247 BTC on May 7, according to data from Dune. The total fee for these Bitcoin Orders is 641 BTC. From another perspective, transaction fees on Bitcoin surpassed 400 BTC on May 7, an 18-fold increase from a month ago.</p>



<p>BRC-20 tokens have taken over the Bitcoin network. These tokens reach a market cap of $541 million to date. There are a total of 14,079 BRC-20 tokens, including many memes. One reason meme coins moved to BRC-20 could be because the meme coins have been clogging up the Ethereum network.</p>



<p>The ORDI token is the first BRC-20 token ever created. It was designed as a meme to demonstrate the potential of the new standard. Currently, the market leader token is Ordinals (ORDI) which has gained 40% in the past 24 hours and reached the $14.9 mark.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe has been grappling with currency volatility and inflation for over a decade. In 2009, the country abandoned its currency due to hyperinflation, replacing it mainly with the US dollar. In an attempt to resuscitate the country&#8217;s stagnant economy, the Zimbabwe dollar was reinstated in 2019. Still, in June of that year, the government again declared the greenback legal currency to curb wild price hikes.</p>



<p>Last year, the government decided to use the US dollar again in a bid to curb surging prices in the country. Three weeks ago, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183316-zimbabwe-gold-backed-digital-currency/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/183316-zimbabwe-gold-backed-digital-currency/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>plans to establish a digital currency backed by gold that would be legal for domestic transactions. The central bank&#8217;s latest plan will allow small amounts of Zimbabwean dollars to be exchanged for the digital gold token, enabling more Zimbabweans to hedge against currency volatility.</p>



<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned Zimbabwe against the plan, stating that a careful assessment should be conducted to ensure the benefits from this measure outweigh the costs and potential risks, including macroeconomic and financial stability risks, legal and operational risks, governance risks, and the cost of forgone FX reserves. </p>



<p>Despite this, the central bank started selling digital tokens to investors on May 10, 2023, for a minimum price of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185346-zimbabwe-launch-gold-back-digital-currency/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/185346-zimbabwe-launch-gold-back-digital-currency/" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10 for individuals</a> and $5,000 for corporates and other entities. This is part of efforts to reduce demand for US dollars that now supersede the local unit as the preferred currency for transactions.</p>



<p>The central bank received 135 applications valued at 14 billion Zimbabwe dollars ($12 million) to purchase the gold-backed digital tokens. It plans a second auction on May 18. Zimbabwe used nearly 140 kilograms of gold reserves to back the first sale of its digital money. It appears the market is testing out the process before committing to converting significant Zim$ reserves into gold tokens, but still, it was a respectable first week.</p>
