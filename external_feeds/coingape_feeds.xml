										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/27115344/kong-kong-KG.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Hong Kong crypto news" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>As the US crypto market faces regulatory tensions, Hong Kong is taking every possible step to sway crypto firms for doing business in the region. While the regulators in the US have asked traditional banks to cut ties with crypto firms, Hong Kong does the opposite.</p>
<p>As per the recent development, HK regulators have urged banks to provide services to licensed crypto firms. This comes as part of the city&#8217;s plans to establish itself as a crypto hub. In a circular released Thursday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that banks should support regulated crypto businesses with &#8220;their legitimate need for bank accounts&#8221;.</p>
<p>The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/hong-kong-seeks-to-help-crypto-firms-escape-their-exile-from-the-banking-sector-1.1913406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> also asks lenders to train staff and dedicated teams in supporting the crypto sector. Besides, it also asks lenders to avoid the “wholesale de-risking approach” that turns away new industries.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for crypto companies is that banks have been growing skeptical about them considering the volatile behavior of the asset class. This has been specifically true following the major blow-up of the crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p>Also, regulators have been making crypto the scapegoat amid the current banking crisis emerging in the United States and the collapse of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank last month.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Accelerates Its Crypto Ambitions</h3>
<p>Hong Kong has been looking to expand its crypto ecosystem just at a time when other markets like the US have announced heavy crackdowns. The city will unveil its new licensing regime on June 1, after which it plans to allow retail investors to trade major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Hong Kong central bank recently <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-bull-run-imminent-hk-central-bank-issue-crypto-advisory-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a crypto advisory</a> for banks explaining the legal aspects of dealing with crypto firms. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has asked banks to cling to a “risk based approach” without compromising on customer due diligence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hong Kong regulator is already planning to release very soon, the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-hong-kong-regulator-to-release-crypto-rules-will-sec-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rules and regulations</a> for crypto exchanges.</p>

The search was conducted as part of a comprehensive investigation into the collapse of FTX by federal prosecutors in Manhattan which accuse ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) of masterminding a fraud that included several billions of dollars, which led to the eventual demise of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>.</p>
<h2>Salame Was Among SBF&#8217;s Close Aids</h2>
<p>Salame, who oversaw FTX&#8217;s Bahamian branch, was a trusted advisor to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried until the company <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">filed for bankruptcy</a> in December. Salame has been the subject of extreme scrutiny because of the $24 million he donated to political candidates in last year&#8217;s midterm elections.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Breaking: Coinbase CEO Hits Back At U.S. SEC, Says “Coinbase Does Not List Securities”" href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-hits-back-at-secs-allegations-ceo-we-do-not-list-securities/" rel="bookmark">Coinbase CEO Hits Back At U.S. SEC, Says “Coinbase Does Not List Securities”</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Data suggests Salame was one of the top political donors in the United States after contributing millions of dollars to predominantly Republican candidates and causes. The federal authorities have asserted, in documents filed with the court, that the majority of the $90 million which was donated to political candidates by a small group of former FTX employees, including Mr. Salame, was stolen from consumers of the exchange.</p>
<h2>Reason For Raid Remains Unknown</h2>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/ftx-ryan-salame-sam-bankman-fried.html" rel="nofollow">report</a> published by New York Times, the search of Salame&#8217;s $4 million residence took place at approximately 7 in the morning and it&#8217;s not yet apparent what the motive was or what the authorities eventually found throughout the course of the search.</p>
<p>The raid takes place in the midst of a lengthy federal inquiry into the demise of FTX, which occurred in November of last year and shook the crypto market in and out. As the proceedings draw closer to a formal trial scheduled for October 2023, the 31-year-old crypto mogul <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> currently remains in house arrest after paying a whopping $250 million for bail. SBF has pleaded not-guilty to all counts of charges levied against him.</p>
<p>In the wake of this FTX news, the exchange’s native <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> FTT, witnessed a drop of roughly 1.41% in the past one hour. As things currently stand, the price of FTT is exchanging hands at $1.49 and boasts a market cap of roughly $510 million.</p>

The California-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> was recently issued an official notification by the SEC stating that they were being investigated for the Earn product, wallet service, and exchange operations.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Asserts No Rules Were Broken</h2>
<p>During the course of the 14-minute video, CEO Brian Armstrong emphasized that the company was ready to defend their position in court, however, they are open to a &#8220;true dialogue to a workable path forward&#8221; for the larger crypto sector. While speaking about the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-and-crypto-market-tank-over-secs-action-on-coinbase/">Wells Notice received</a> last month, Armstrong was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Wells Notice at this stage, when there is not a clear rulebook, is not constructive and it&#8217;s not good for America.</p></blockquote>

<p>Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal provided a list of a few pointers to demonstrate the company&#8217;s compliance with the securities law. These pointers highlight that the company does not list securities, follows a &#8220;robust process&#8221; as outlined by the SEC, and that it rejects over 90% of the crypto assets during an internal review prior to getting listed.</p>

<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s Staunch Legal Stance</h2>
<p>In a formal, 73-page response to the SEC probe that was released on Thursday afternoon, the attorneys for Coinbase were even more forthright in their statements. In the brief, the attorneys from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell who represent Coinbase argued that the commission&#8217;s case against Coinbase &#8220;will fail as a matter of fact and law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident comes on the heels of a <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-sec-chair-reprimands-crypto-firms-on-securities-law/?utm_source=cgtelegram">new video</a> dropped by SEC Chief <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gary-gensler/">Gary Gensler</a> where he warns U.S. customers of the risks associated with crypto platforms. Coinbase filed a petition with a federal court earlier this week in an effort to compel the SEC to state whether or not it intends to develop new regulations for digital assets. Lately, the financial watchdog has made a concerted effort to address what it views as lack of compliance on the part of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> platforms and their intermediaries.</p>

In its latest </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://polygon.technology/blog/whats-happening-on-polygon-zkevm?utm_source=metrics-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog"><span style="font-weight: 400">performance report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for April, Polygon said key trends in the zkEVM protocol stayed elevated for the month with more than 300% growth rate.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In April, the daily avg gas on Polygon <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/zkEVM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#zkEVM</a> was 7X cheaper than Ethereum Mainnet, even during periods of peak network activity.</p>
<p>Want to know which growth metrics were +300% this month?</p>
<p>Follow the thread<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447-1f3fd.png" alt="👇🏽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/9A3R4I9yiA">pic.twitter.com/9A3R4I9yiA</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Polygon (@0xPolygon) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygon/status/1651609978568941568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The protocol reported that as of April 24, the total number of unique active wallet addresses topped 50,000 on its zkEVM Mainnet Beta. The protocol also noted that the total transactions on the high performance Zero-Knowledge platform also soared with a total of 95.25 ETH worth approximately $177,000 generated in fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Polygon was built to help in <a href="https://coingape.com/vitalik-buterin-claims-l2-importance-in-lieu-of-urgent-need-for-scalability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaling Ethereum</a> and since inception, it has played this role and has received a lot of recognition from the industry. While Polygon is adjudged to be a more cheaper protocol compared to its underlying Layer-1, the zkEVM is designed to be a much enhanced version of the protocol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the report, the Polygon zkEVM protocol costs 7X less than what the current Ethereum protocol charges its users within the same time span. The impressive performance is encompassing and covers every measurable aspect of the zkEVM mainnet.</span></p>
<h2><b>Harsh Verdict: is Polygon the Best L2?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides the zkEVM, there are other prominent Layer-2 protocols on the Ethereum mainnet, all of which have impressive network statistics and performance markers. Swaying away from self reporting to a more independent analytics outfit, L2Fees, </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-zksync-era-polygon-zkevm-exchange-1inch/"><span style="font-weight: 400">by comparison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Polygon zkEVM protocol was ranked as the 5th best Layer-2 in terms of fees charged for both token sending and swapping respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Polygon zkEVM ranks below Loopring, zkSync Lite, Boba Network and Arbitrum One in terms of approximate fee charged. While the underlying technology powering the powering these respective L2s differ, the ranking is evident that Polygon’s zkEVM still have a lot of evolution to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The underlying performance of the protocol, however, has shown promise for the Polygon ecosystem as a whole. With partnerships spanning beyond Starbucks to other Web2 giants, Polygon remains a delight of many with a very promising future.</span></p>

As part of a long-term strategic partnership spanning multiple years, this new initiative will lend assistance to Polygon and its rapidly expanding ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Google &amp; Polygon Team Up</h2>
<p>As part of the collaboration, Google, an industry leader in cloud computing will update its Blockchain Node Engine to include support for Polygon, which is a layer-2 solution on Ethereum. As <a href="https://coingape.com/google-launches-node-hosting-service-with-support-ethereum/">reported</a> earlier on CoinGape, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/solana-sol/">Solana</a> and Ethereum are the only blockchains that are currently supported by Google&#8217;s Blockchain Node Engine, which is a streamlined mechanism for developers to access and employ blockchains on Google&#8217;s servers.</p>

<p>While speaking about the partnership, Ryan Wyatt, President of Polygon Labs was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today&#8217;s announcement with Google Cloud aims to increase transaction throughput enabling use cases in gaming, supply chain management, and DeFi.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This will pave the way for even more businesses to embrace <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> technology through Polygon&#8221;, he further added.</p>
<p>In addition, Google Cloud will be expanding its infrastructure to support Polygon&#8217;s newly launched <a href="https://coingape.com/polygon-unveils-layer-2-zkevm-network-matic-price-rally/">zkEVM</a>, a much-needed scalability solution for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/">decentralized applications (Dapps)</a> that harnesses <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/zk-rollup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZK-rollups</a> to perform off-chain computations. By the end of the third quarter, Google Cloud will also assist creators in deploying app-based blockchains that were built with Polygon technology on its servers.</p>
<h2>Matic Price Poised To Rise?</h2>
<p>In light of this crypto news, both the Polygon community and the larger <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">crypto market</a> have reacted positively to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://polygon.technology/blog/google-cloud-and-polygon-labs-join-forces-to-provide-developer-tools-and-enterprise-infrastructure-to-accelerate-growth-across-polygon-protocols?utm_source=google-cloud-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>. Market participants are of the opinion that this may eventually result in a bullish scenario for the MATIC token as it sees more impending utility from the growing number of nodes, apps and user accounts being created.</p>
<p>In fact, startups backed by Polygon Ventures &#8212; a fund that invests in companies built on Polygon &#8212; will be eligible for Google Cloud&#8217;s newly announced Web3 startup program and receive credits to use towards hosting software on Google Cloud&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>As things currently stand, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price of MATIC</a> is exchanging hands at $0.063, which represents a gain of 0.35% over the past 1 hour in contrast to a drop of 6% recorded over the last 24 hours. Additionally, it should be noted that MATIC’s technical analysis (TA) indicators at CoinGape’s price tracker presently recommend a sell position, advising “sell” at level 13 and a “buy” at level 3 by its moving averages.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shared a recent insight into what is expected from crypto firms calling for comprehensive regulation. In a recent message with an accompanying video illustration posted on his official Twitter handle, Gensler said the securities law in the US cares more about <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/just-in-sec-chair-reprimands-crypto-firms-on-securities-law/" title="Just In: SEC Chair Reprimands Crypto Firms On Securities Law"></a></p>

In a </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1651624244445421591?t=d8Xh7HOcQ9SrXw4iYN7m4A&amp;s=19"><span style="font-weight: 400">recent message</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with an accompanying video illustration posted on his official Twitter handle, Gensler said the securities law in the US cares more about what something is, and not what one calls it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The SEC Chairman has been accused of leading the Commission with his regulation by enforcement tactics, a system that has been called out by both lawmakers and leaders in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Despite these criticisms, Gensler is unfazed, and maintains that the current securities laws in the US are sufficient to guide the nascent Web3.0 world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarifying the misconception about most crypto assets receiving the tag of securities, Gensler said the definition of securities as given by Congress features 30 different things including stocks and investment contracts. The Investment Contract entails putting funds in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Intermediaries for investment contracts are required to comply with securities laws &amp; register with <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, many crypto platforms are contending that their investment contracts are something else.</p>
<p>The law cares about what something actually is, not what you call it.</p>
<p>&mdash; Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1651624244445421591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The top regulator said the intermediaries for these investment contracts which also includes exchanges need to come under the securities laws.</span></p>
<h2><b>Dissenting Views on the SEC Chair Position</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond the video message that has just been shared, the position of the SEC Chair is not a new one, and there are a </span><a href="https://coingape.com/gary-gensler-grilled-on-timeline-of-ftx-probe-in-congress-hearing/"><span style="font-weight: 400">lot of oppositions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to his claims that the current securities laws are sufficient for the crypto exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the rationale is that the major maker of what constitutes a security is the Howey Test which was developed decades ago. Market leaders are advocating the development of a whole new law that will be flexible and fitting for the nature of innovation that are embodied by blockchain and their attendant innovations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase, the largest crypto trading platform in the US has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-slaps-a-lawsuit-to-compel-the-sec-to-respond-to-rulemaking-petition/"><span style="font-weight: 400">dragged the SEC to court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for failure to provide clearer regulatory guidelines for the industry. While many have hailed the exchange for taking such proactive stance, there has been a growing call for the removal of Gary Gensler with the US Lawmaker </span></p>

It would no longer be considered a disposal for tax purposes when digital assets are used in DeFi transactions. Instead, a taxable disposition will take place once the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> are economically sold off through a transaction that is not related to DeFi.</p>
<h2>UK Tax Dept Aims DeFi Lending &amp; Staking</h2>
<p>In accordance with current regulations, DeFi transactions may be viewed as disposals and accounted as sales or gifts by crypto lenders or yield generators like liquidity providers even when the asset&#8217;s ownership remains unchanged.</p>

Ted Cruz Reveals Bitcoin Investment Strategy, Declares Ultra-Bullish Outlook</a></strong></em></p>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-taxation-of-decentralised-finance-involving-the-lending-and-staking-of-cryptoassets/the-taxation-of-decentralised-finance-defi-involving-the-lending-and-staking-of-cryptoassets--2">document</a> that was used for the consultation, this can result in &#8220;tax outcomes that do not reflect the underlying economic substance&#8221;, as well as a tax liability resulting from a &#8220;transaction in which no gain has been realized in a form that can be used to meet the liability&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Growing Scrutiny Over Crypto Failures</h2>
<p>Recent failures in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/?utm_source=menubar">crypto market</a>, such as the closure of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX exchange</a>, bankruptcies of crypto lending giants like BlockFi &amp; Celsius, were cited as the primary reasons for the authority&#8217;s increased scrutiny in the industry. While speaking on recent crypto news of financial failures, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been a highlighted specific risks including cyber risks and other technical risks, as well as increased dependencies between traditional and decentralized financial systems and a lack of backstops in periods of market stress.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The need to determine and record the market value of assets at each step in the transaction may also give rise to a disproportionate administrative burden.&#8221; HMRC further outlined.</p>
<p>According to the document, even though the proposed framework is aimed at decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/staking/">staking</a>, it is also unequivocally applied to centralized finance (CeFi), which offers similar services often through intermediaries. The consultation will be available for a total of eight weeks before coming to an end on June 22.</p>

While <em>timing the market</em> is a bad strategy, the Bitcoin market has some advantages such as on-chain historical data depicting exact days and patterns after which massive BTC price rallies can be expected.</p>
<p>BTC price fell 10% last week after surpassing the $30,000 psychological level, which signals the start of the &#8220;<em>overheated bull phase</em>&#8221; as bulls takeover bears. The recent <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> rally from $20,000 was actually supported by Bitcoin <a href="https://coingape.com/5-on-chain-indicators-signals-bitcoin-entering-bull-market-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entering the bull market cycle</a> in January and <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-to-hold-above-200-wma-this-time-on-chain-data-and-analysts-predict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossing the key 200-weekly moving average</a> (WMA) in March.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-selloff-heres-why-bitcoin-ethereum-price-are-falling-sharply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent declines in the Bitcoin price</a> are due to profit-taking by traders in the perpetual futures markets, with open interest falling. The &#8220;long squeeze&#8221; caused massive liquidations, giving investors an opportunity to &#8220;<em>buy the dip</em>.&#8221; Traders also took profits as the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH price</a> jumped over $2,000 after the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shanghai-harfork" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shanghai upgrade</a> on April 12 and <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-enables-eth-withdrawals-beth-redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance opened Ethereum withdrawals</a> on April 19.</p>

<p>Traders have again started opening long positions and spending activity of whales remains higher. Typically, price rallies occur during whale spending activity with at least 20% of total coins being moved, but <strong>Spent Output Value Bands</strong> indicate whale spending activity rose above 40%. In fact, whales with over 10k BTC had a spending activity of 25%, the first time since the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> fallout. This coincides with many <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-bitcoin-price-dormant-whales-awaken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dormant whales waking up</a> after 8–10 years.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Begins Bull Run</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price currently trading in the $28k-30k range, with volatility rising as the bull market starts. The short-term cost basis or the <strong>realized price</strong> is at $24,000, indicating the key support level for this bull market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-146435" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/27205227/Bitcoin-Realized-Price-UTXO-Age-Bands.png" alt="Bitcoin Realized Price - UTXO Age Bands." width="666" height="420" /></p>
<p>Traders wait for two key events before a rally can potentially start, <strong>Friday&#8217;s monthly expiry</strong> and the <strong>U.S. Fed rate hike decision</strong> on May 2. This could be the last rate hike by the Fed before it looks to cut the funds rate from September.</p>
<p>While the global market keeps an eye on the <strong>U.S. debt ceiling crisis</strong>, Republicans are actively working to increase the debt ceiling amid risks of a recession. The US dollar is also weakening, which will likely increase BTC prices.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin-halving-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin halving</a> to happen in April 2024, the BTC price is <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-ceo-cz-downplays-post-halving-bitcoin-price-prediction-by-chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely to surpass $135,000</a> and probably we will never see BTC below $20,000 again.</p>

While the CBDC, also dubbed the Digital Euro is yet to be launched, Hansen said should it be launched, it will exist in three different forms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He gave these predictions following his participation in a roundtable featuring the Digital Euro. As he noted, the CBDC will exist first as a Central Bank </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ecbs-governing-council-member-argues-that-cbdcs-and-traditional-fiat-can-go-hand-in-hand/"><span style="font-weight: 400">alternative to cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and as a tokenized bank deposit. Additionally, the Digital Euro will take the form of a <a href="https://coingape.com/stablecoins-are-they-really-stable-time-as-the-most-valuable-asset-they-can-be-pegged-to/">stablecoin</a> or regulated e-money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Hansen, despite the efforts of the government to ensure a proper development of its CBDC, the private sector is better equipped to deliver the much needed payment solution involving stablecoins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With many nations, numbering up to 110 now deeply involved in CBDC research and development, the EU is hoping to stay on top of this next level payment innovation. After the bloc’s Parliament </span><a href="https://coingape.com/eu-debates-mica-crypto-law-before-vote-heres-timeline-for-implementation/"><span style="font-weight: 400">passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) Bill earlier this month, the region has earned the tag of one of the most proactive regions tilted to innovations bothering the Web3.0 ecosystem.</span></p>
<h2><b>Potential Timeline for Digital Euro Launch</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the proactive engagement in research and consultation from the European Central Bank (ECB), there is no decision on whether or not it will proceed with the development of the Digital Euro just yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hansen also commented on this, noting that the Digital Euro will “enter the broader political arena towards the second part of this year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Specifically, the said the EU wide negotiations at the Commission level will resume this year with a crucial decision on whether to proceed with the project now on the horizon. According to the Circle Chief, there has been confirmation that crucial aspects of the proposed CBDC such as its holding limits and other features are bound to be decided politically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to earlier </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ecb-president-borderless-digital-euro/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Coingape, ECB President, Christine Lagarde has reiterated time and again that there is a need for a borderless Digital Euro. The industry enthusiasm is high, and all eyes are fixed on the next steps from the EU.</span></p>

Although the huge drop in the regional bank’s stock price catapulted a Bitcoin price jump on Wednesday, the volatility remains high. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> is set to announce its interest rate decision when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets between May 1-2, 2023. Hence, the crypto market could remain volatile in the days to come, as the financial markets expect the central bank to finally show signs of relaxing it’s monetary policy.</p>

<p>A majority of the S&amp;P 500 companies have been beating expectations, on the back of cost cutting measures like mass layoffs. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg led Meta, which is also heavily invested in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web 3.0</a> space with the Metaverse ambition, sacked 10,000 employees in 2022 besides plans to layoff another 21,000 until November 2023. This led to a rising number of high income professionals wanting unemployment benefits, which the Fed will be closely looking at.</p>
<h2>End Of Fed Rate Hikes?</h2>
<p>According to Fundstrat advisor opinion on Yahoo, the upcoming FOMC meet will affect the last rate hike measures due the need for easing financial conditions. The massive surge in unemployment claims from employees with above $200,000 pay could trigger what could be a ‘dovish hike’. A 25 bps hike in the May Fed meeting could be followed by easing of financial restrictions, the advisors <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-end-rate-hikes-inflation-230345811.html" target="_blank">said</a>. Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of respondents to the CME FedWatch Tool <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank">expect</a> the central bank to raise interest rate by 0.25%, from the current target rate of 4.75 to 5% range.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the US Dollar Index (DXY) is currently at a three month low at 101.41. Hence, going by the inverse correlation between DXY and <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a>, the top cryptocurrency could be on a path to further rise in the lead up to the Fed meeting, especially so if Fed Chair Jerome Powell expresses a dovish stance after a 25 bps hike.</p>

Binance currently has Dogecoin listed with USDT and BUSD trading pairs.</p>
<p>The move by Binance is expected to push DOGE price above $1 in a sudden rally as it leads the market when it comes to Dogecoin trading. Traders didn&#8217;t immediately respond to Binance&#8217;s DOGE/TUSD pair listing.</p>
<h2>Binance Adds Dogecoin TUSD Trading Pair</h2>
<p>According to an official <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-adds-doge-tusd-usdt-ars-wbtc-usdt-trading-pairs-23630cd14227410fae3543c6effad115" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> on April 27, Binance will add Dogecoin with TUSD trading pair. The trading for the DOGE/TUSD trading pair will open at 08:00 UTC on April 28. In addition, Binance has also added USDT/ARS and WBTC/USDT.</p>
<p>Further, the crypto exchange announces that it will enable the Binance Spot Grid for the DOGE/TUSD and WBTC/USDT trading pairs within 2 days of opening trading for the pairs.</p>
<p>TrueUSD team took to Twitter to reveal yet another effort by Binance to boost the market presence of TUSD stablecoin. After the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/busd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BUSD</a> crackdown by the U.S. regulators, Binance has switched to the lesser-known TUSD. The exchange now only offers zero-fee trading in the TUSD pair, after it <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-ends-zero-free-bitcoin-trading-after-btc-price-26k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended zero-fee Bitcoin trading</a> for all other pairs last month.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Binance dominates the crypto market in terms of trading volumes. DOGE/USDT on Binance accounts for 20% of total trading volume, four times that of DOGE/USDT on OKX and DOGE/BUSD on Binance. In the perpetual market, Binance dominates with 25% of trading volume on DOGE/USDT pair.</p>

<p>The DOGE/TUSD is expected to boost Dogecoin&#8217;s overall trading volume. It will help increase liquidity and DOGE price. Traders can anticipate Dogecoin price to surpass $1.</p>

However, Hong Kong which is aiming to become a new crypto hub for the globe will be issuing an advisory for the banks regarding cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2>Hong Kong To Frame Crypto Easy Rules?</h2>
<p>According to Hong Kong Monetary Authority <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/insight/2023/04/20230427/" target="_blank">release</a>, the institution has had discussions with banks and clarified that there is no such legal and regulatory requirement that prohibits banks from providing banking services to virtual assets (VA).</p>
<p>It added that Banks have been informed to cling to a “risk based approach” at the time of managing customer due diligence (CDD). It is advised to avoid unnecessary procedures and desist from adopting a “one-size-fits-all” approach to dismiss crypto related applications.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority mentioned that as the pandemic comes to an end, several companies are keen to relocate and open bank accounts in the country. It is estimated that the banks might face an increase in demand for accounting opening applications. However, it is also expected that the banking institutions might reject applications due anti-money laundering (AML) reasons. <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/bitcoin-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Bitcoin News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<p>However, it is advised to the banks to differentiate in the level of risks involved to users and then apply proportionate CDD rules.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price recovered from the $19K level to regain the $30K level amid the banking crisis. BTC price is up more than 74% on the year to date (YTD) basis. It is expected that Hong Kong’s Central Bank advisory will lead investors seeking regulatory clarity to enter crypto.</p>

<h2>Cardano Witnesses Flash Surge</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardano Price</a> witnessed a sudden spike flashing bullish sentiments amid the recent market dump.

ADA is trading at an average price of $0.407, at the press time.</p>
<p>As per the data, its 24 hour trading volume jumped by a whopping 106% to stand at $533 million.

<p>In the latest post, Cardano Foundation invited all stake pool operators (SPOs) to take part in an on-chain poll experiment. It is reported that this will help in shaping the future of Cardano.</p>
<p>The Cardano Foundation has named the on-chain poll for SPOs as Voltaire. It is being explained as the transition to a fully decentralized and self-sustaining network. However, at the time of completion of implementation, polls will be put to the consideration of delegated representatives (DReps). This will have an influence proportional to the amount of support they received.</p>

The Bitcoin NFTs or Bitcoin ordinals are digital assets inscribed on Satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ordinals took the crypto world by storm, reviving the NFT market and Bitcoin miners from the financial crunch in the bear market. <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Bitcoin</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> Ordinals was launched this year as a result of the 2021 </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Bitcoin</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> protocol upgrade &#8220;Taproot&#8221; to allow a unique digital signature on </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2>OKX Introduces Bitcoin Ordinals on the Platforms</h2>
<p>The second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume OKX has upgraded its OKX Wallet and NFT Marketplace, enabling users to view and transfer Bitcoin (BTC) ordinals on the platforms.</p>
<p>With the Bitcoin ordinals integration, OKX became the first multi-chain platform to support this capability. OKX Wallet now currently supports BTC taproot addresses on the browser extension, with mobile version coming soon. Customers can import their BTC wallets and view their Bitcoin ordinals through a single wallet, in contrast to managing separately via a Bitcoin-only wallet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to move fast to welcome the ordinals community and give them an easy way to store, manage, and soon mint ordinals within our wallet services. I hope this integration helps bring more people in to play with this new utility and discover new possibilities on top of Bitcoin,&#8221; said OKX chief marketing officer <span class="xn-person">Haider Rafique.</span></p>
<p>The development follows the Bitcoin Punks NFTs launch on OKX NFT Marketplace last month. OKX enabled users to buy ordinals with ETH.</p>
<p>Interstingly, the OKX NFT Marketplace will soon allow its users to mint and trade Ordinals on its platform. It will enable users to create, buy, and sell Ordinals cheaply and more easily.</p>

<p>OKX President and OKCoin CEO Hong Fang took to Twitter to share the exciting developments. She revealed that OKX is bringing many Ordinals features to the OKX Wallet. Hong Fang also said, &#8220;12 years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto sent their last message.&#8221;</p>
