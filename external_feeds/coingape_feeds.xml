There are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum which have risen significantly since their inception but are still significantly lower than their highs, as are other popular digital currencies. Here&#8217;s how to get started investing in cryptocurrency, as well as the major risks you should be aware of.</p>
<p>This guide will explain crypto trading strategies and familiarise you with crypto trading platforms and applications, trade components, trading styles, and the role of technical and fundamental assessment in developing a comprehensive trading strategy. Notably, as per the data, there are currently over 300 million cryptocurrency users across the globe.</p>
<h2>Investing in Crypto: Beginners</h2>
<p>If you are Beginner and planning to investing in <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">cryptocurrency</a>. Though Bitcoin is the most well-known digital currency, there are thousands of others. Cryptocurrency investment can take many forms, from purchasing cryptocurrency directly to investing in cryptocurrency funds and companies. This guide will explain crypto trading strategies and familiarise you with crypto trading platforms and applications, trade components, trading styles, and the role of technical and fundamental assessment in developing a comprehensive trading strategy. Notably, as per the data, there are currently over 300 million cryptocurrency users across the globe.</p>
<h2>Guide to invest in Crypto</h2>
<p>There are many different methods of trading cryptocurrencies. To begin trading cryptocurrencies, one must first gain an understanding of the subject. It is also critical to understand the risks involved, as well as the laws that may apply depending on one&#8217;s jurisdiction, and steps are needed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Know what you&#8217;re investing in</h3>
<p>This is very basic steps to understand what you are investing in, just as you would for any other investment. When you are investing in cryptocurrency, it is important to thoroughly examine the annual report of cryptocurrency you are planning to invest in.</p>
<h3>Volatility of the market</h3>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Cryptocurrency prices</a> are as volatile as an asset can be. They could fall in seconds on nothing more than a rumour that turns out to be false. That can be advantageous for sophisticated investors who can execute trades quickly or who have a firm understanding of the market&#8217;s fundamentals, how the market is trending, and where it may go. It&#8217;s a minefield for new investors who don&#8217;t have these skills or the high-powered algorithms that guide these trades.</p>
<h3><strong>Choose Appropriate cryptocurrency exchange </strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">After understanding about all the pros and cons as a beginner you need to choose the appropriate the crypto exchange. The best crypto exchange on the market include <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>, eToro and Gemini. All three of these services have a straightforward user interface and a wide range of altcoins to pick from.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To open your crypto account, you’ll need to mention your personal identifying information. The information includes your address, date of birth, Social Security number (in the United States) and email address, among other things known as Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Add money in your account</h3>
<p dir="ltr">After creating an account, you must deposit funds into the crypto-trading account in order to purchase cryptocurrencies. You can transfer funds from your bank account to your crypto-trading account online. It does, however, necessitate linking both accounts. Furthermore, depending on the policy, you may be required to wait before purchasing digital coins.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Choose appropriate Cryptocurrency to trade</h3>
<p>The vast majority of cryptocurrency investors invest in Bitcoin and Ether. Trading with technical indicators is possible, however, because these cryptocurrencies move more predictably than smaller altcoins.</p>
<p>Altcoins are popular among cryptocurrency investors. Small mid-market cap cryptos have more upside potential than large-market cap cryptos, despite being riskier.</p>
<h3 id="contentRef_6" dir="ltr">Store your cryptocurrency</h3>
<p dir="ltr">After you have made your purchases, the most important part is storage. Crypto exchanges are not backed by any formal institution, and they most certainly do not have your typical insurance policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They also have to worry about being hacked. As a result, you must securely store your account and asset codes. It is usually a good idea to keep your newly purchased coins in a crypto wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Selecting a right method to trade</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Build a better strategy for increasing profits by utilizing various theories. Furthermore, you can get some crypto expert opinions that can be useful before expanding your cryptocurrency investment. Instead of blindly following anyone&#8217;s advice, one should always start with small investments and carefully study the market.</p>

The payouts, which The Block staff members were previously unaware of, might compromise the crypto news organization&#8217;s reputation and raise questions about its coverage of SBF, the now-defunct FTX, and its trading firm, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>.</p>
<h2>SBF Funds $43Mn To CEO</h2>
<p>The Block claims that from 2021 to this year, Michael McCaffrey, the ex-CEO of the crypto news website, obtained three loans totaling $43 million from SBF. The first loan was made in 2021 for $12 million to buy out other investors in the media organization, at which time McCaffrey assumed the role of CEO.</p>

<p>The second was for $15 million in January to fund day-to-day expenses; while the third was for $16 million earlier this year for McCaffrey to buy private real estate in the Bahamas.</p>
<h2>The Block&#8217;s CEO Resigns</h2>
<p>However, in light of this exposé, The Block&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, Michael McCaffrey, has resigned from the post. Bobby Moran will now be heading the news media website with immediate effect. In his official <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://medium.com/the-block-crypto/ceo-transition-e2700caed741" rel="nofollow">statement</a>, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>No one at The Block had any knowledge of this financial arrangement besides Mike. From our own experience, we have seen no evidence that Mike ever sought to improperly influence the newsroom or research teams</p></blockquote>
<p>According to The Block, McCaffrey will not only leave his position as CEO but also as the company&#8217;s board; which will now comprise of three members. The firm is currently looking to add two more people to the extended group to join Moran.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a title="FTX News: Kevin O’Leary Claims He Can’t Call SBF Guilty Unless He’s Tried" href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-kevin-oleary-claims-he-cant-call-sbf-guilty-unless-hes-tried/" rel="bookmark">Kevin O’Leary Claims He Can’t Call SBF Guilty Unless He’s Tried</a></em></p>
<p>The Block&#8217;s editorial leadership was taken aback by the news, and according to insiders, they are furious that McCaffrey failed to reveal such a significant financial arrangement with Bankman-Fried and Alameda, especially given that they are still covering the effects of <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<h2>About The Block</h2>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.theblock.co/" rel="nofollow">The Block</a> was established in 2018, and McCaffrey took the helm as CEO in 2020. The Block became 100% employee-owned with McCaffrey owning a majority stake in April 2021 after he arranged a buyout of the company&#8217;s investors.</p>
<p>The company, which is not profitable, previously raised nearly $4 million through convertible notes from venture capital firms like Greycroft, Pantera, BlockTower Capital, and Bloomberg Beta.</p>

However, his trip to the U.S. from his current residence at Bahamas can lead to an arrest, as per few experts.</p>
<h3>FTX Ready To Testify</h3>
<p>This week, a Senate Banking Committee hearing on <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy</a> was scheduled, but Bankman-Fried infamously missed the deadline to respond to the committee&#8217;s invitation to come and testify. Bankman-Fried later agreed to testify before the House committee after California representative <a href="https://coingape.com/chairwoman-maxine-waters-bankman-fried-subpoena-definitely-on-the-table/">Maxine Waters threatened to subpoena</a> him.</p>

<p>But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th. <a href="https://t.co/KR34BsNaG1">https://t.co/KR34BsNaG1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; SBF (@SBF_FTX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1601186246990401537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Will SBF Be Arrested?</h2>
<p>However, according to Braden Perry, a former senior trial attorney for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, he doesn’t see SBF to be stepping on U.S. soil anytime soon. He further states that,</p>
<blockquote><p>I still think he will testify remotely and not in the U.S. If he walks through the door Tuesday, I’d be surprised.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perry has stated that there is a possibility that Bankman-Fried will be taken into <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/custody">custody</a> by the United States if he enters the country.  He further adds that,  the former CEO of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> is of course should be worried about being taken to jail at any time upon landing in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The fact of the matter is that the Southern District of [New York] could arrest him based on probable cause based upon a complaint, and then they could pursue a grand jury indictment.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New Charges On SBF</h2>
<p>As earlier <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-do-kwon-sbf-genesis-terra-luna-crisis/">reported</a> on Coingape, the federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also now looking into whether Bankman-Fried manipulated the prices of the cryptocurrencies <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ust/">TerraUSD</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/luna/">LUNA</a> to benefit FTX and his <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda</a> hedge fund.</p>

However, during this fall, the token price has retested the pattern converging trendlines multiple times, indicating the trades are respecting this technical and should also meet its potential target after pattern completion.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin price will remain in a bear trend until the wedge pattern is intact</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Graph price faces high supply pressure at the $0.0664 mark.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the Graph is $428 Billion, indicating a 202% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/aF3za16q.png" alt="Graph Token" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the falling wedge pattern reflects the loss of bearish momentum as the prices turned down from the resistance trendline fail to achieve deeper correction as before. Thus, a bullish breakout from the overhead resistance will complete this pattern and trigger a direction price rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming to the current price scenario, the Graph token price showed an 11% jump earlier today. With a high volume spike, the long bullish candle tried to breach the weekly resistance of $0.0664. However, the intense supply pressure from above undermined these gains and pulled the price back below the mentioned resistance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three weeks, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> has shown numerous rejection candles at the $0.0662 resistance, indicating the sellers are actively defending this level. Thus, if the selling pressure persists, a potential bearish reversal may plunge the price to $0.0525 support.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the buyers manage to surpass the $0.0664 resistance, the prices could price 14% to revisit the patterns resistance trendline.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>MACD: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal lines rising gradually indicate the gradually increasing bullish momentum. However, these slopes below the neutral line reflect that the price action is still under the seller&#8217;s control.</span></p>
<p><b>EMAs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 20-and-100-day EMAs act as two dynamic resistance which assist sellers in prolonging the ongoing downfall.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graph Token Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.0662</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.0664 and $0.0766</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.058 and $0.025</span></li>

It is close to three months now since the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ethereum-merge/">Ethereum Merge</a> has been executed in September 2022. Contrary to market expectations, the Merge upgrade did not bring any price rise in the top 2 cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the big whales have in recent weeks started to accumulate more ETH, which could mean positive momentum ahead.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Exchange Supply At 4 Year Low</h2>
<p>While the Ethereum price is at its lowest range in the last one year, the exchange supply percentage is abysmally low currently. This could be both a good sign and bad sign for ETH in near future. If the exchange supply goes on to decline further from the current level, it could lead to further price drop for the cryptocurrency. Already, the last one year saw a price decline of around 75% for the cryptocurrency. On the flip side, the low exchange supply could potentially be a bullish signal for ETH. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/delirium-over-ethereum-7132">Santiment Insights</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The more the supply of Ethereum (ETH) on exchanges declines, the better of a case that can be made that we are nearing a bottom.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As of writing, Ethereu (ETH) price stands at $1,275, up 2.07% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the market value to realized value (MVRV) points towards a bullish environment. The MVRV among long term addresses that held ETH for more than a year displays high unrealized losses. Looking at the trading pattern in last seven years, it is possible that there could be an upside movement in ETH price from the current level of losses. A large section of investors have incurred 50% or more in percentage losses on their ETH investments.</p>

This sideways rally reflects indecisiveness among market participants and a need for an external push to resume prior recovery. Thus, a breakout from either level of this range will trigger a directional rally for this memecoin.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shiba Inu coin price is currently trapped in a no-trading zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily-RSI slope below the neutral line indicates the sellers have the upper hand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $87.5 Million, indicating a 0.96% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/Pt9uBYRY.png" alt="TradingView Chart" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z3Rq3snQ/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-japan-new-deadline-customer-funds/">FTX crypto exchange</a> crash, the Shiba Inu coin price showed sustainability above the $0.0000082 mark. On November 22nd, this memecoin managed to bounce back from this support and triggered a new recovery cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the price rally was backed by decreasing volume, and numerous long red candles indicated weak bullish momentum. Eventually, the intense selling pressure above the $0.00000961 price turned the prices sideways and created a narrow range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shiba Inu price has resonated between the $0.00000960 and $0.0000082 levels over the past two weeks, reflecting a no-trading zone. Furthermore, the coin currently trades at the $0.00000921 mark, and ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market helps to prolong this consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the new traders looking for entry opportunities should wait for the coin price to break either range level.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the price action displaying weakness in bullish momentum, a breakdown from the support level is higher, which may plunge the Shiba Inu coin to $0.0000083.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a daily candle closing above $0.0000960 may resume the bullish recovery 13% higher to $0.0000104.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index(daily):</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which reflects the speed and magnitude of the coin’s recent price, indicates a bearish outlook as its slope move below the neutral line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the 20-and-50-day EMAs offer dynamic resistance to coin price and keep the trend under selling control.</span></p>

<h2>Arthur&#8217;s Top Four</h2>
<p>According to Arthur, it&#8217;s in these bear markets, serious investors need to hold on to assets which not only appreciate in value when the market turns green, but also generate yield as a token holder.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a title="Bitcoin Price Crash! Arthur Hayes Makes Bold Price Prediction" href="https://coingape.com/arthur-hayes-bold-price-prediction-for-bitcoin/" rel="bookmark">Bitcoin Price Crash! Arthur Hayes Makes Bold Price Prediction</a></em></p>
<p>He picks four of his preferred cryptos which he further categorizes into two sections: &#8220;Reserve Assets&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Super-Powered Assets&#8221;. Under Reserve Assets, he picks the number one cryptocurrency by marketcap, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> following it. The two other cryptocurrencies which make it to this Super-Powered Assets are LOOKS and GMX.</p>
<h2>Key Is Yield Generation</h2>
<p>Arthur emphasizes that while Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum can help him in capital appreciation when the bull market takes over, its tokens like these, that would generate him <a href="https://coingape.com/education/apr-vs-apy-difference-what-does-it-mean-in-crypto-why-it-matters/">yield</a> &#8212; which neither of the above two coins does at the moment.</p>
<blockquote><p>If there are cheaply priced protocols where I get the return profile of Bitcoin and Ether plus yield from the actual usage of the service, happy days!</p></blockquote>
<h2>Lucrative DeFi Projects</h2>
<p>He further states that, many of the DeFi projects got &#8220;shellacked during the two downward waves of the 2022 crypto credit crunch&#8221;, thus making way to get into such projects at a much cheaper valuation and price.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a title="Arthur Hayes Calls BitMEX Funds “SAFU” Due To This New Feature" href="https://coingape.com/arthur-hayes-calls-bitmex-funds-safu-due-to-this-new-feature/" rel="bookmark">Arthur Hayes Calls BitMEX Funds “SAFU” Due To This New Feature</a></em></p>
<p>Arthur justifies his rationale by saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>A 20% per annum yield means I should only invest in projects with a P/F ratio of 5x or lower. Everyone will have a different hurdle rate, but that is mine. I could purchase Bitcoin and or Ether, but neither of these cryptos pays me enough yield.</p></blockquote>
<p>In his <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptohayes.medium.com/pemdas-4362df99a509" rel="nofollow">blog</a>, Arthur further emphasized on the fact that, Bitcoin&#8217;s price &#8220;might&#8221; have bottomed out at $15,900 and it&#8217;s times like these that make investing look risky, although rewarding.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">Some people even claim, &#8220;The metaverse is already here&#8230; and it’s called <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home">Fortnite</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525"><strong>Fortnite&#8217;s &#8220;Metaverse&#8221;</strong></h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Fortnite boasts a fantastic virtual hangout environment with a video game going on around it that&#8217;s more accessible than anything that requires a VR headset, such as Meta&#8217;s Horizon Worlds. It&#8217;s completely free and available on every gaming device and phone in the world.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Fortnite began as a game about building barricades to withstand swarms of enemies. Since adding a battle royale mode (in which 100 players drop onto an area and fight until only one remains) in 2017, the game has become a smash hit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130688" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09203222/fortnite-6.jpg" alt="Fortnite metaverse" width="1920" height="1080" /></p>
<p style="color: #252525">Without much fanfare, Epic Games began building virtual spaces in the gameplay for their players to hang out and socialize. The VR space within Fortnite gameplay matured gradually and steadily, one feature after another.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">As a player, you can simply explore the vast (VR) area, which includes cities, islands, bright forests, deserts, and more. You can go &#8220;fishing,&#8221; or you can jump into a car with a working radio station and just drive around the region, or you can do the same with a boat in any of the map&#8217;s massive lakes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130689" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09203311/fortnite-4.jpg" alt="Fortnite metaverse " width="1920" height="1080" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #252525"><strong>Virtual Music Concerts</strong></h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Epic Games has been setting the stage for music concerts in its &#8220;metaverse.&#8221; In 2019, Fortnite sent shockwaves through the gaming industry after it hosted EDM producer Marshmello for a live in-game concert. After the huge success of Marshmello&#8217;s concert, it hosted Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, and millions of players tuned in.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525"><strong>Fortnite&#8217;s Appeal</strong></h3>
<p style="color: #252525">What makes Fortnite unique and capable of bringing people together unlike any other game before is that it is completely free to play. No payment is necessary to join, and you can simply hang out from a PC, Android phone, or gaming console.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">As of now, Fortnite isn’t just a game but a virtual universe where millions of people are hanging out. It has convinced millions of people, to choose to hang out, catch up with friends in-game, and have fun without ever bothering too much about fancy gears.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">And everything works out because the ultimate goal, regardless of what you do, is to have fun. Nobody is claiming that Fortnite will transform dating, fitness, or business meetings, as others (companies building metaverses) have promised.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Sometimes it feels like nobody noticed its &#8220;metaverse,&#8221; as they didn&#8217;t have any fancy VR or AR headsets to boast about or a CEO telling the world that &#8216;they are going to change the world.&#8217;</p>

This is evident from the fact that popular football tokens &#8211; Portugal and Argentina &#8211; have hardly converted match results into profitable price for the respective tokens. In this context, even the euphoria around the Quarter Finals failed to raise interest among traders in the Argentina Fan Token (ARG). A day before the World Cup&#8217;s most important contest Argentina Vs Netherlands so far, the Messi team&#8217;s fan token traded in low volumes.</p>

<h2>Will Messi Performance Change Fortunes For Argentina Fan Token?</h2>
<p>Since the start of the World Cup, the Argentine Football Association Fan Token (ARG) has only dropped constantly from a peak it reached on November 18, when the tournament opener was played. It was only before the World Cup began that the popular fan tokens saw a massive price rise. Experts are blaming it on less than par results from the top teams so far. However, historical data suggests that this has been the case all the time for cryptocurrencies whenever the tournament was underway.</p>
<p>Despite the Lionel Messi factor, the Argentina team fan token is displaying less than expected interest in terms of trading. In the last 24 hours, ARG trading volume fell by a significant 23.36%. The ARG token price also dropped in the lead up to the match. As of writing, ARG price stands at $2.59, down 2.27% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/argentinefootballassociationfantoken/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Portugal National Team Fan Token (POR) is also down by about 2.61% in the last 24 hours. On Saturday, Portugal with clash with Morocco in the second quarter final match.</p>

The proposal will enable Terra Rebels to get 937,500,000 LUNC tokens worth $150,000 from the community pool for Rebel Station development. It will allow the LUNC community to separate from Terraform Labs (TFL) and Do Kwon. However, the community now contemplates whether it would benefit LUNC.</p>
<h2>Proposal 11030 By Terra Classic Developer Terra Rebels</h2>
<p>Terraform Labs announced plans to <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-rebels-announces-proposal-separate-tfl-do-kwon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end support for the Terra Station</a> wallet to focus on LUNA-specific cross-chain &#8220;Station&#8221; wallet as part of the latest developments. Terra Classic developer Terra Rebels were asked to make costly L1 changes to the blockchain before December 15.</p>
<p>Considering that impossible to complete within the time, Terra Rebels announced <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://station.terrarebels.net/proposal/11030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 11030</a> to become independent of TFL and Do Kwon. It was actually the last stage in the Terra Classic Revival Roadmap.</p>
<p>Terra Rebels also announced ending support for Terra Station, <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-rebels-transfers-terra-station-support-to-terracvita/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making TerraCVita manage the Terra Station</a> with support from TFL.</p>
<p>Some believe the community should wait to vote as <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Jared_TFL/status/1600943396612608000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TFL&#8217;s Jared communicated with TerraCVita</a> to share API.Terra.Dev data that could have TFL to continue support Terra Station with TerraCVita. Also, it prevents $150,000 in LUNC that Terra Rebels requested for its Rebel Station infrastructure and assets.</p>
<p>The voting ends in the next 6 days. Until now, the proposal has 95% votes supporting it as 12 validators including StakeBin and Vegas Validator have voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; for the proposal. &#8220;Crypto King Burn And Build&#8221; and &#8220;Classy&#8217;s Crypto Sphere&#8221; have also favored the proposal. It should be noted that Terra Classic developer Vegas is also a lead signer of the proposal and other validators are yet to vote.</p>
<h2>Could the Proposal Impact LUNC Price?</h2>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) price could see some impact if the proposal is passed by the community. LUNC price may dive to $0.00010 as suggested by experts.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-latest-updates-dec-8-terra-classic-price-soars-6-ustc-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNC Price rallied over 6% yesterday</a> but has failed to capitalize on the rally, reversing earlier gains. Currently, the LUNC price is trading at $0.000171. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000168 and $0.000176, respectively.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-130680" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09194458/Screenshot_20221209_194405.png" alt="heatmap of cryptocurrency prices" width="1200" height="675" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Graph and Chain are the biggest gainers today, where the GRT price surged 9.44% to reach the $0.06786 mark, while XCN price increased 7.07% to $0.03904 in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, Synthetix and Toncoin tokens are top losers, with SNX price at $1.89, down 2.98%, while TON price at $1.83 is down 1.21%</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-130681" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09194543/Screenshot_20221209_194419.png" alt="btc" width="1200" height="356" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-bottom-at-this-level-prediction-for-2023/">Bitcoin price</a> is currently in a short-term sideways trend, wobbling between $17300 and $16800 levels. It&#8217;s been more than a week since the price wavers in a narrow range, creating a sense of uncertainty in the crypto market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, in a range movement, a safe entry will be when the price breaks either range level and grab a directional rally on the same side. However, the BTC price entered this consolidation when its breached $16800 resistance on November 30th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/YklyU2AN.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the price hovering above $16800 flipped support is trying to sustain at higher levels. However, in response to Bitcoin’s 2.3% price jump yesterday, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> jumped above the neutral line, indicating the underlying growth in bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BTC price currently trades at the $17228 mark, but new traders looking for entry opportunities can enter naer the $16800 mark as support buying or after the breakout of $17300.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130682" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09195030/Screenshot_20221209_194435-e1670595647897.png" alt="eth" width="1200" height="372" srcset="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09195030/Screenshot_20221209_194435-e1670595647897.png 1200w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09195030/Screenshot_20221209_194435-e1670595647897-300x93.png 300w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09195030/Screenshot_20221209_194435-e1670595647897-768x238.png 768w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09195030/Screenshot_20221209_194435-e1670595647897-150x47.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to market uncertainty, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-prediction-range-breakdown-signals-longer-correction-for-eth/">Ethereum price</a> follows a similar range movement resonating between $1300 and $1220. This altcoin has tested both mentioned levels multiple times, indicating the traders respect the range set-up and should do the same for its potential target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ETH price currently trades at $1285 with an intraday gain of 0.44%. However, the long-wick rejection attached to the daily candle as it retests the $1300 resistance suggests a high possibility of bearish reversal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/rVEqaSMs.png" alt="Ethereum price prediction" width="1946" height="1110" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential reversal from $1300 will set the altcoin to chase $1220 support and thus prolong the consolidation phase for a few more sessions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, a daily candle closing below $1220 will accelerate the selling pressure and plunge the price to the $1158 mark. Conversely, if the prices break overhead resistance, the investor may witness an uptrend resumption of $1420.</span></p>

During periods in which the price of the stock was aggressively rising, the price of bitcoin also rose, however, in a range that was relatively lower. Given this scenario, significant changes in the NASDAQ stock market could create an impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies in the short term.</p>
<h2>NASDAQ On The Brink</h2>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/6393014da60e9b7fa21dbbf7-Bitcoin-Correlation-with-Stock-market-Nasdaq-is-at-a-sensitive-point-above-trend">data</a>, the NASDAQ has been above the trend risk support as can be seen from the image below. This trend line has prevented the prices from further declines and has supported it since 2010. However, in the coming weeks, the market would be deciding on the reaction to this trend line.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130661" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09182011/Fsoepud_7bf39d62b2d205fffc4db72bf3065f67dc571fbde9436d413656e65b26cbb02d.png" alt="" width="1280" height="632" /></p>
<p>There have been five instances in the past where this trend line has acted as support for the market.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-100k-in-2024-data-says-so/">Will Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Hit $100K In 2024? Data Suggests So</a></em></p>
<p>In spite of the fact that this trend line has the potential to put an end to the current downward trend and serve as the starting point for a market recovery; the trend line&#8217;s support, if in case broken, will indicate that the current downtrend is extremely strong and that the market still has more room to fall.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mimicking NASDAQ?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, is also currently resting on support at a trend line as can be seen from the figure below.</p>
<p>Given the association between the <a href="https://coingape.com/how-will-bitcoin-btc-react-if-stock-market-maintains-this-trend/">stock market and Bitcoin</a>, there is possible anticipation of a reversal in the cryptocurrency market if the stock market is supported here. If the stock market is not supported, then analysts expect a continuation of the downward trend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130672" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09183755/TAri03MI2_31e847d7fd790a27dcf2f60242baa4ae459b04a295110df58ba7aec857e29551.png" alt="" width="1280" height="718" /></p>
<p>After the end of 2021 and continuing into the middle of 2022, the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> climbed and dropped in a manner comparable to equity prices.</p>
<p>A comparison of the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to that of the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq 100 is presented in the following chart (NDX).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130674" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09184210/BTCSPXNDXjpg-f5908aebedb94967becbc0f4752ad1ca.png" alt="" width="750" height="335" /></p>
<h2>BTC Mining Woes</h2>
<p>Apart from the stock market correlation, which can pull the price of Bitcoin down, the number one cryptocurrency by marketcap also faces the brunt of a severe bitcoin mining crisis due to the ongoing bear market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate, mining difficulty &amp; possible <a href="https://coingape.com/genesis-bankruptcy-crypto-brokerage-could-be-next-after-blockfi/">bankruptcies</a> of mining firms may lead to a dump in BTC price for the short term.</p>

Earlier, CZ strongly criticized <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/kevin-oleary/">Kevin O’Leary</a> for defending Sam Bankman-Fried in a recent interview. Stating that FTX was involved in misappropriating customer funds, he mentioned that Binance exited FTX investment around 1.5 years ago. CZ said SBF was threatening to go to extraordinary lengths over Binance&#8217;s withdrawal from his company.</p>

<h2>SBF: No Need To Lie</h2>
<p>In his reaction to CZ&#8217;s claims, SBF said the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> CEO was lying about the buyout situation. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1601191713519079424" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a> saying there was no need for CZ to lie about it now. SBF claimed that CZ threatened to walk away from the deal at the last minute with conditions. With the actions, the FTX team was more confident about not wanting Binance on its list of investors. Interestingly, SBF mentioned &#8220;You won,&#8221; in a reference to the Binance CEO.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You won, CZ. There&#8217;s no need to lie, now, about the buyout. You threatened to walk at the last minute if we didn&#8217;t kick in an extra $75m.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reacting the turn of events, CZ said &#8220;No one won,&#8221; stating that the whole situation was not a competition.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sam, not that it matters now. You also can’t force us to sell if we don’t want to. Also, we have the veto right to block any further fundraising you were doing. Never used or mentioned it. It was never a competition or fight. No one won. 1/2</p>
<p>&mdash; CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1601204210611425280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> expressed his willingness to testify before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services next week. Although he had previously said it was doubtful to appear for the testimony on December 13, he now said he would testify despite limitations in terms of facts and information.
