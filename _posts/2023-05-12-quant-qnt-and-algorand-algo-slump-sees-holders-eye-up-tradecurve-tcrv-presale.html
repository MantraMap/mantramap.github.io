<p>Investors and traders who diversify their holdings consistently will typically pick up cryptocurrencies such as Quant (QNT) and Algorand (ALGO) with the goal of getting the most out of the blockchain space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through diversification, investors can get a lot more exposure in their portfolios to different projects and can support developers as well to disrupt a specific industry. As of recently, however, both of these cryptocurrencies have begun to decrease in value, and as such, investors have begun to turn to Tradecurve.io, a hybrid-exchange which is set to change the landscape of the financial markets and cryptocurrency exchanges as we know it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we will discuss each project to see what one we believe will perform best.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quant (QNT)</p>
<p>Quant (QNT) published an article where they went over how the Banking Giant Citi predicted $4 trillion to $5 trillion of tokenized digital securities and $1 trillion of distributed ledger technology would be in circulation, and half could be using third-party DLT-linked models.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Quant (QNT) CEO Gilbert Verdian will appear at the Financial Times Live's FTCrypto event with the Bank of England's Tom Mutton on May 9.</p>
<p>As a result, the overall community behind Quant (QNT) shared some level of excitement, but this did not lead to an increase in its value.</p>
<p>Specifically, as of April 27, 2023,&nbsp; Quant (QNT) traded at $110.93. Within the last 24 hours, Quant (QNT) saw a decrease in its value by 3.2%. In the last 30 days, Quant (QNT)'s overall decrease was at 6.7%. With all of this in mind, investors are worried about the future of Quant (QNT).</p>
<p>Algorand (ALGO)</p>
<p>The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at the Algorand (ALGO) Foundation, John Woods, went over how anyone can get POAPs at the Consensus 2023 event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Algorand (ALGO) Developers page showcased AlgoKit, which enables users to set up their development environment within 10 minutes and deploy their first smart contract with ease.</p>
<p>When we go over the value of the Algorand (ALGO) cryptocurrency, as of April 27, 2023, Algorand (ALGO) traded at $0.182166.</p>
<p>Within the last 24 hours, Algorand (ALGO) decreased in value by 5.3%. In the last 30 days, Algorand (ALGO)&rsquo;s overall decrease has been at 9.4%. This has also left investors worried about the future of Algorand (ALGO).</p>

<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) Presale continues Bullish Outlook</p>
<p>Tradecurve.io is being developed as a hybrid exchange that will bring together some of the best elements that investors and traders love in both Centralized and Decentralized exchanges. Tradecurve&rsquo;s platform allows users to create an account by simply registering their email address, users then connect their DeFi wallet, deposit funds and can instantly begin trading. All users have full control over their private keys and will not need to complete a KYC procedure.</p>
<p>The Tradecurve platform aims to raise $20 million in the presale and is looking towards onboarding 100,000 clients within the first three months of its launch. This makes it a major player in the Web3 space that is competing with the likes of Binance, Coinbase and Kraken.</p>
<p>Tradecurve native utility token TCRV is currently in presale trading at $0.01, analysts predict that TCRV will climb in value by 100x when it launches. Tradecurve&rsquo;s smart contract has been audited by CyberScope and an internal KYC was completed by AssureDeFi to provide full transparency to customers of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only 40% of the total TCRV supply will be available throughout the presale and with many experts tipping Tradecurve to become the next 100x token now is a great time to get involved.&nbsp;</p>
