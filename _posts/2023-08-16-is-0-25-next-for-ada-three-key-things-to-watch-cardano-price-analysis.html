With buyers absent, Cardano cannot reverse the downtrend. Key Support levels: $0.25 Key Resistance levels: $0.28 1. Key Support Lost Unfortunately for ADA holders, the price did not manage to hold above the key support at 28 cents. This has now turned into resistance, and the current momentum is favoring sellers. 2. Bearish Momentum Intensifies [&#8230;]
