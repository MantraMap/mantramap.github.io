The scammers posed as members of U.S. law enforcement agencies and tricked the victims into transferring money to them for &#8220;safekeeping.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>FBI Says It Has Seized Bitcoin From Scammers Overseas</h2>
<p>The U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut and the Acting Special Agent in Charge of the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced Friday that bitcoin and other digital assets have been seized in connection with a fraudulent scheme targeting the elderly. They detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>An investigation of a fraud scheme targeting vulnerable victims has resulted in the forfeiture of approximately 151 bitcoins, as well as other digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The case is being investigated by the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. At the time of writing, the value of the allegedly seized bitcoin totaled approximately $3.5 million.</p>
<p>The fraud, which occurred in approximately October 2020, involved overseas individuals pretending to be members of U.S. law enforcement agencies. They targeted &#8220;vulnerable victims, including first-generation U.S. citizens and elderly persons,&#8221; the authorities said. Through phone calls, they told the victims that their identity had been compromised. After gaining the victims&#8217; trust, the scammers requested transfers of money for &#8220;safekeeping&#8221; with the promise of returning the funds plus interest. The announcement details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once the overseas individuals had access to the victims&#8217; money, they moved the money through multiple bank accounts and converted the money to digital currency in the form of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Law enforcement investigators traced the victims&#8217; money through the various accounts and identified a digital wallet holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that had been purchased with the victims&#8217; money,&#8221; the announcement adds. The authorities noted that the overseas scammers remain at large.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office has been granted &#8220;a civil asset forfeiture seizure warrant for the digital wallet,&#8221; the announcement clarifies, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office used the civil asset forfeiture procedure because the digital assets constituted the proceeds of wire fraud.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Mango Markets Manipulator Arrested, Detained</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Friday that it has charged Avraham Eisenberg with &#8220;orchestrating an attack on a crypto asset trading platform, Mango Markets, by manipulating the MNGO token.&#8221; The regulator noted that the crypto token was offered and sold as a security.</p>
<p>The defendant is a 27-year-old U.S. citizen who is facing &#8220;parallel criminal and civil charges&#8221; brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), respectively, the SEC added. The CFTC filed a civil enforcement action against Eisenberg on Jan. 9. He has been arrested and detained at MDC Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The securities watchdog explained that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/solana-based-defi-protocol-mango-markets-loses-117-million-in-hack-exploit-allegedly-revealed-in-projects-discord-in-march/">beginning</a> on Oct. 11, 2022, while living in Puerto Rico:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eisenberg engaged in a scheme to steal approximately $116 million worth of crypto assets from the Mango Markets platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>He allegedly &#8220;used an account that he controlled on Mango Markets to sell a large amount of perpetual futures for MNGO tokens and used a separate account on Mango Markets to purchase those same perpetual futures,&#8221; the regulator said.</p>

<p>In addition, Eisenberg allegedly made a series of large purchases of the thinly traded MNGO token to artificially raise the token&#8217;s price relative to USD Coin (USDC), the SEC continued, adding that the price of MNGO perpetual futures on Mango Markets subsequently increased. According to the securities regulator:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eisenberg used the increased value of his MNGO perpetual futures position to borrow and withdraw approximately $116 million worth of various crypto assets from Mango Markets, effectively draining all available assets from the Mango Markets platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC charged Eisenberg with &#8220;violating anti-fraud and market manipulation provisions of the securities laws.&#8221; The regulator is seeking &#8220;permanent injunctive relief, a conduct-based injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Axie Infinity&#8217;s Native Token AXS Climbs 62% Despite Continued Decrease in Monthly Players</h2>
<p>The non-fungible token-based online video game Axie Infinity once had millions of monthly players, with a peak of 2.78 million in Jan. 2022, according to activeplayer.io <a href="https://activeplayer.io/axie-infinity/">statistics</a>. With Jan. not quite over, the last 30 days indicate an average of 432,001 players to date. During Dec. 2022, there were 468,805 players, a low not seen in over two years, since Nov. 2020.</p>
<p>Axie held an average of two million monthly players for eight consecutive months between Oct. 2021 and May 2022. After May, the average monthly player count dropped to 958,044, or 1,202,210 fewer players than the previous month. Over the next four months, Axie&#8217;s monthly player count remained above 700,000, but in November 2022, it slipped to 556,058.</p>

<p>The last month of 2022 and the first month of 2023 also saw dismal numbers.

<p>Two-week statistics show <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/AXS/">AXS</a> is up 67% against the greenback. On Jan. 22, 2023, AXS was trading at prices between $8.95 and $11.84, gaining 24% on Sunday afternoon at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. AXS is the 42nd largest crypto market capitalization, with a valuation of around $1.31 billion.</p>
<p>Despite the recent lift, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/AXS/">AXS</a> is still down from its $164 per unit high on November 6, 2021, and is down 93% since that day. The play-to-earn (P2E) game Axie Infinity&#8217;s player count is significantly lower than some of the top played games today. For instance, activeplayer.io shows that Overwatch 2&#8217;s active number of monthly players was around <a href="https://activeplayer.io/overwatch-2/">23 million</a> in the last 30 days and 23 million during Dec. 2022.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Mobile Live Player had <a href="https://activeplayer.io/call-of-duty-mobile/">58,502,111</a> average monthly players in the last 30 days and 58,001,154 during Dec. 2022. In comparison, Axie Infinity&#8217;s player count is a small fraction of these games with very high monthly player counts. Specifically, Axie&#8217;s Dec. 2022 average monthly player count represented 0.81% of Call of Duty&#8217;s average monthly player count.</p>

The transaction minimum, aimed at reducing exposure to digital assets, will be introduced by the financial institution in February.</strong></p>
<h2>Bank Working With Binance Sets $100,000 Transaction Minimum for Crypto Traders</h2>
<p>A bank serving some clients of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, will only process customer transactions exceeding $100,000, starting from the first day of February. The new minimum will be imposed as part of the lender’s decision to limit its exposure to digital-asset markets.</p>
<p>“One of our fiat banking partners, Signature Bank, has advised that it will no longer support any of its crypto exchange customers with buying and selling amounts of less than $100,000 as of February 1, 2023. This is the case for all of their crypto exchange clients,” Binance said in a statement shared with Bloomberg on Saturday, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a result, some individual users may not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to buy or sell crypto with/for USD for amounts less than 100,000 USD.</p></blockquote>
<p>The measure concerns retail traders with accounts serviced by Signature and the exchange assured customers it’s actively seeking a new partner for SWIFT transfers in U.S. dollars. SWIFT is the most widely used global system for interbank transfers.</p>
<p>Only 0.01% of Binance’s monthly users are serviced by Signature Bank and no other banking partners are impacted, the crypto company pointed out through a spokesperson. Card payments and non-USD transfers will not be affected.</p>
<p>The news comes after in December the New York-based Signature Bank revealed it plans to shed up to $10 billion in deposits from digital-asset clients as it’s pull back from the crypto industry. The move was announced in the aftermath of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">collapse of FTX</a>, one of Binance’s main competitors which filed for bankruptcy protection in November amid liquidity issues.</p>

<p>Traditional financial companies have been gripped by contagion fears during a turbulent year for the crypto space, with falling prices and a number of crashes. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silvergate-capital-incurs-loss-of-1-billion-in-q4-of-2022/">Silvergate Capital</a>, the parent company of California-based Silvergate Bank which deals with crypto transactions, saw its shares losing 40% after customers withdrew over $8 billion of digital-asset deposits in Q4, 2022.</p>
<p>Signature’s shares fell 64% last year, the report notes. Its decision comes after the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a warning regarding risks associated with crypto assets. Business models focused on crypto-related activities or exposed the crypto-asset market raise safety and soundness concerns, the regulator said in a statement released in early January.</p>

While the veracity of these proof-of-reserve lists and asset dashboards is debatable, they do provide some insight into the large sums of cryptocurrency held in custody by major exchanges. For example, Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, manages $66 billion in crypto assets, which is more than 6% of the entire cryptocurrency economy&#x2019;s net value of $1 trillion.</strong></p>
<h2>An Inspection of 5 Proof-of-Reserves Lists That Provide Insight into Large Cryptocurrency Holdings</h2>
<p>It has been more than 80 days since <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coindesk-up-for-sale-investors-circle-crypto-news-publication-amidst-genesis-bankruptcy/">Coindesk</a> published a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">story</a> about Alameda Research&#x2019;s balance sheet, which showed the quantitative trading desk owned a large amount of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-contract-deployer-unlocks-192-million-ftt-exchange-tokens-questionable-tokenomics-highlights-red-flags/">ftx token (FTT)</a>. Then, on Nov. 6, 2022, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-binance-dumping-all-ftx-tokens-on-its-books-ceo-cites-recent-revelations/">revealed</a> that his exchange would be selling its FTT holdings. Since then, FTT has lost considerable value and FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection five days later on Nov. 11. At that time, and prior to FTX&#x2019;s failure, it was challenging to monitor the exchange&#x2019;s reserves as executives kept things very opaque. This situation has led exchanges to release proof-of-reserve lists and there has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/proof-of-reserves-are-at-best-incomplete-at-worst-misleading-and-deceptive-says-crypto-analyst-martin-hiesboeck/">criticism</a> from crypto industry <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/krakens-jesse-powell-takes-aim-at-newly-launched-proof-of-reserve-lists-por-audit-requires-cryptographic-proof/">members</a> over specific types of lists and how they are audited.</p>
<p>Additionally, Paul Munter, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x2019;s (SEC) acting chief accountant, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-sec-heightens-probe-into-auditors-servicing-crypto-exchanges/">stated</a> that the SEC is closely monitoring proof-of-reserves (POR). Despite the complaints, the available proof-of-reserve lists provide some insight into what entities hold and, to a certain extent, they help improve market stability because people can monitor the holdings. The following is an examination of five different centralized crypto asset exchanges and their holdings in crypto assets as of Jan. 22, 2023, according to <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/entities">nansen.ai&#x2019;s exchange list</a>. Nansen features a dashboard for 18 different centralized crypto exchange platforms.</p>
<h3>Binance</h3>
<p>Binance is the largest with <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/binance">$66 billion</a> in digital assets held in reserves by the crypto exchange giant. On Jan. 22, the largest crypto exchange by trade volume held 486,427 bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), worth $11.1 billion. In terms of stablecoins, Binance holds $13.2 billion in tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) and $13.3 billion in BUSD.</p>

<p>Additionally, Binance holds 4.7 million ether, worth $7.6 billion, and another $7.6 billion worth of binance coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>). The exchange also holds more than $13 billion worth of other crypto assets that are too numerous to name. If Binance&#x2019;s stash was included in the top ten crypto assets by market cap, it would rank in the fourth position.</p>
<h3>Okx</h3>
<p>Nansen&#x2019;s dashboard list shows that the crypto exchange Okx holds <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/okx">$7.6 billio</a>n in crypto assets. $3 billion of the funds are held in tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), and the exchange also holds 97,656 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, worth $2.2 billion.</p>

<p>25.95% of Okx&#x2019;s assets are held in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), or a balance of 1.2 million ether, worth $1.9 billion, using current exchange rates for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>. Additionally, Okx holds roughly 294 million usd coin (USDC) as well.</p>
<h3>Crypto.com</h3>
<p>Crypto.com manages around <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/crypto.com">$3.83 billion</a> on Jan. 22, and its holdings currently include 44,208 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, worth just over $1 billion. The exchange also holds 514,763 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, which is worth roughly $833 million on Sunday.</p>

<p>Nansen&#x2019;s Crypto.com dashboard further shows that the trading platform holds 17.28% of its holdings in shiba inu (SHIB). Crypto.com&#x2019;s SHIB holdings include around 55.2 trillion SHIB, or $663 million worth of the meme token. The trading platform also manages around 585 million usd coin (USDC) and 2.1 billion cronos (CRO), worth around $167 million.</p>
<h3>Bitfinex</h3>
<p>The digital currency trading platform Bitfinex holds <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/bitfinex">$8 billion</a> in crypto assets on Sunday, Jan. 22, 2023. 54.29% of Bitfinex&#x2019;s holdings are in bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), or around 191,654 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, worth $4.36 billion today. 28.15% of Bitfinex&#x2019;s assets are kept in unus sed leo tokens (LEO), or around $2.2 billion worth of LEO.</p>

<p>The exchange also holds 466,014 ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), worth $756 million, on Jan. 22. Additionally, Bitfinex manages 331 million tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) and 0.64% of Bitfinex&#x2019;s assets, or around 126 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, are held in reserves.</p>
<h3>Huobi</h3>
<p>Huobi holds around <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/huobi">$3.17 billion</a> on Jan. 22, and 30.91% of the assets are in the exchange coin, huobi token (HT). The exchange manages 196 million HT, which is worth roughly $980 million today in USD value.</p>

<p>Huobi also holds 617 million tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) and 9 million tron (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>), worth $596 million. 12.13% of Huobi&#x2019;s assets are held in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, 5.35% is stored in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, and 13.35% of Huobi&#x2019;s assets are alternative crypto assets too numerous to name. $7.7 million worth of the value derives from the 57.58 million HUSD that Huobi holds, which is 30.66% of the HUSD supply. While HUSD was once a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, HUSD is now trading for $0.13 per coin.</p>

<h2>The 5 Exchanges Hold $88.6 Billion or 8.6% of the Crypto Economy&#x2019;s Current USD Value</h2>
<p>All five of the aforementioned cryptocurrency exchanges hold $88.6 billion in crypto assets combined. The combined value of all five of the exchange&#x2019;s reserves equates to 8.6% of the current $1 trillion crypto economy.</p>
<p>74.49% of the $88.6 billion is held on Binance, and the rest is dispersed among Okx, Crypto.com, Bitfinex, and Huobi. The trading platform with the largest exchange token coins is Bitfinex, with its stash of $2.2 billion worth of LEO. Out of the five mentioned exchanges, Binance holds the most Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) with its cache of 486,427 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>

Some of the coin trading platforms are working with sanctioned Russian banks, the regulatory body announced in a report.</strong></p>
<h2>Ukrainian Financial Authorities Target Russian Crypto Exchange Websites and Wallets</h2>
<p>The State Financial Monitoring Service (SFMS), a unit of Ukraine’s financial intelligence, has issued a special <a href="https://fiu.gov.ua/pages/dijalnist/funkcional/news/Informuvannya-pro-rezultati-roboti-derzhfinmonitoringu-za-2022-rik.html">report</a> on the results of its operations in 2022. Besides its peacetime activities such as combating money laundering, the agency revealed it has contributed to the country’s defense effort as part of the ongoing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/war-spurs-crypto-activity-in-russia-and-ukraine-chainalysis-reports/">conflict</a> with Russia.</p>
<p>In the document published this week, the watchdog announced its employees have joined forces with colleagues from the Ministry of Digital Transformation and leading Ukrainian crypto experts. Together, they were able to identify Russian crypto exchanges associated with Russian financial institutions placed under sanctions, including Russia’s largest bank, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-sber-bank-aims-for-blockchain-integration-with-ethereum-and-metamask/">Sber</a>.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian financial regulator did not specify the exact number of these platforms or their domain names but emphasized that the aim was to fully block them.</p>

<p>Also, working closely with crypto service providers in Ukraine and abroad, the SFMS introduced a mechanism for the &#8220;blocking of crypto wallets of the Russian Federation.” It’s unclear whether it means Russian wallets in general or those linked to the government in Moscow.</p>
<p>The state service reminded that last year it turned to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, suggesting actions “to curb the aggression of the Russian Federation in the virtual assets market” and prevent peer-to-peer transactions for users of various Russian banks and payment systems.</p>
<p>“Other practical measures related to the blocking of Russian crypto assets and operations of Russian residents have been implemented,” the agency added without elaborating. It has been cooperating with the financial authorities of almost 140 countries on the matter while severing ties with regulators in Russia and Belarus.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Engaged in Regional Initiative to Prevent Money Laundering Through Crypto</h2>
<p>The SFMS also noted it’s involved in cooperation between Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova — countries with a steadily growing crypto market and mining sector — focused on reducing money laundering through digital assets. The project is being realized with assistance from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/unhcr-launches-blockchain-payment-solution-to-support-ukrainians-displaced-by-war/">UN</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/osce-trains-uzbekistan-law-enforcement-to-track-and-seize-crypto-search-dark-web/">OSCE</a>.</p>
<p>The report coincided with a statement by Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ukraine-to-be-best-crypto-jurisdiction-with-new-tax-rules-digital-minister-says-in-davos/">promising</a> that the country will become “the best crypto jurisdiction in the world” once it finalizes its regulatory framework for the industry.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Ukraine established itself as a leader in crypto adoption in Eastern Europe and has been accepting <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-donations-pour-in-after-ukraine-government-asks-for-bitcoin-ether-17-million-raised/">crypto donations</a> since the start of the Russian invasion. Its parliament <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ukrainian-parliament-adopts-amended-virtual-assets-law/">passed</a> a law “On Virtual Assets” last February and has been preparing respective amendments to the Tax Code.</p>

The latest round brings to $7 million the amount of capital that the fintech has now raised via this funding round.</strong></p>
<h2>Kwara&#8217;s Client Base</h2>
<p>Kwara, the Kenyan fintech targeting the financially excluded, has reportedly raised a $3 million seed extension and has signed a digital solutions distribution agreement with an organization representing Kenyan cooperatives. The fintech, which more than doubled its client base in 2023, said it hopes to fund its growth with the capital raised.</p>
<p>According to a Techcrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/16/kenyan-fintech-kwara-raises-3m-seed-extension-signs-deal-to-reach-over-4000-credit-unions/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFJg4z2tYjyhsiYz1ptzbai1o7NhX6bx06da3462gEN5At__CDQPMKX4TwCH5WzrOb1bRYvbuG3C59TIC-kzJ3HYxijAa0uaCTx2B1_Era2pK9IbGlOiH2neEIcRaRAlFISg3Zsvg41bg4T9CEDAb1D0kZm23hnBkjMm3jgZxzwj">report</a>, existing investors participating in the startup’s seed extension round include DOB Equity, Globivest, and Willard Ahdritz. Also joining the fintech’s latest funding round were One Day Yes and Base Capital. The chief financial officer of Revolut, Mikko Salovaara, is reported to have joined this round.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Better Access to Additional Services</h2>
<p>Commenting on the timing of the fintech startup’s agreement with the Kenya Union of Savings &amp; Credit Cooperatives (KUSCCO), Kwara co-founder and CEO Cynthia Wandia reportedly said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We think we’ve barely scratched the surface in the Kenyan market. And so, we are just going to be really investing in products and services that deepen our relationship here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before the fintech’s latest capital raise, Kwara <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/kenyas-fintech-kwara-lands-4-million-in-seed-round-from-breega-softbank-to-build-neobank-for-credit-unions/">raised</a> $4 million in a seed round that was backed by Breega, Softbank Vision Fund Emerge, Finca Ventures, and New General Market Partners. The latest round brings to $7 million the amount of capital that Kwara has now raised via this funding round.</p>
<p>Through its neobank app, Kwara hopes to give members of KUSCCO&#8217;s partner unions improved access to additional services. The same app also makes it possible for users to directly deposit funds into their respective credit union accounts, the report said.</p>

The Russia-linked platform, which tried to occupy space vacated by the busted Hydra, is believed to have conquered up to a fifth of the illicit market before the hack.</strong></p>
<h2>Solaris Allegedly Taken Over by Darknet Marketplace Called Kraken</h2>
<p>Solaris, a major marketplace for drugs and other illicit products, has been targeted in a hacking attack carried out by a similar enterprise, Kraken, not to be confused with the well-known cryptocurrency exchange with the same name.</p>
<p>After in April last year law enforcement authorities shut down Hydra, the former leader in this business, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/germany-shuts-down-hydra-market-seizes-servers-and-bitcoin/">seizing</a> its servers in Germany and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/alleged-hydra-administrator-dmitry-pavlov-reportedly-arrested-in-russia/">arresting</a> an alleged operator in Russia, Solaris managed to gain between 20% and 25% market share, according to estimates quoted by Elliptic.</p>
<p>This week, the blockchain forensics company reported that since Friday, Jan. 13, those who visited the onionsite were being transferred to Kraken. The latter claimed to have taken control over the infrastructure, Gitlab repository and source code of Solaris and blocked its bitcoin wallets.</p>
<p>Kraken is another player in the dark web space and, like Solaris and Hydra, is targeting the Russian-language segment of the underground market. The illegal trading platforms are suspected of having other ties to Russia as well.</p>

<p>For example, Solaris is believed of have used the services of one of the Russian &#x201C;patriotic&#x201D; hacker groups. The pro-Kremlin Killnet is known for launching distributed denial-of-service (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DDoS</a> ) attacks on Ukraine after Russia invaded the country in late February, 2022.</p>
<p>This isn&#x2019;t the first attempt to breach Solaris. Ukrainian-born cyber intelligence expert Alex Holden claimed to have hacked into the marketplace, according to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ukrainian-steals-bitcoin-from-russian-darknet-market-donates-to-charity/">report</a> in December, and getting hold of some of the bitcoin sent to dealers using the site and to its owners.</p>
<p>Helped by his cybersecurity company, Holden said he specifically targeted a wallet used for crypto exchange transactions and was able to divert 1.6 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The cryptocurrency was later donated to a Kyiv-based charity.</p>
