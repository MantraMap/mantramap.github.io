<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC chairman has asked US lawmakers for an additional $72 million in funding to protect investors from the crypto market.</em></li>



<li><em>This money is used to add dozens of full-time employees to its list.</em></li>



<li><em>Gensler cited &#8220;the wild west of crypto markets&#8221; that were &#8220;rife with non-compliance&#8221;.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/19/sec-chair-gensler-cites-wild-west-of-crypto-in-case-to-increase-agencys-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coindesk</a>, US SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has proposed $72 million in additional funding for the agency to protect investors from market participants&#8217; disadvantage, including the cryptocurrency industry.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1320.png"><img decoding="async" width="770" height="513" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1320.png" alt="SEC Chairman Asks For An Extra $72M To Strengthen Investor Protection In Crypto" class="wp-image-204195" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1320.png 770w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1320-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1320-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1320-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" title="SEC Chairman Asks For An Extra $72M To Strengthen Investor Protection In Crypto 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Speaking before Wednesday&#8217;s US Senate Appropriations Committee, Gensler cited the &#8220;wild west of the crypto market&#8221; as &#8220;fraught with non-compliance.&#8221; In this case, legislators and agencies must expand protections for investors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We’ve seen the Wild West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset class,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Gensler said in his prepared remarks.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In his opinion, he is seeking an additional $72 million to add dozens of full-time employees to his roster. The SEC chairman argued that a bipartisan bill approved last week to fund the SEC $2.364 billion for the fiscal year 2024 is just enough to &#8220;support currently authorized personnel levels &#8220;due to inflation&#8221;.</p>



<p>The SEC employed 4,685 people in 2023, with about half focused on enforcement and inspection tasks, according to data Gensler shared in his comments. The additional funding will help the agency add 170 positions to its teams, in addition to providing full-year financing of employees recruited by 2023, potentially bringing the total number of full-time employees. SEC time is equivalent to 5,139 employees.</p>



<p>Gensler revealed that the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division launched 750 enforcement actions in fiscal year 2022, resulting in $6.4 billion in fines and frustrations. Some enforcement actions have targeted crypto companies, making the SEC notorious for taking a &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; approach.</p>



<p>The SEC chairman defended this approach, saying that the SEC has been talking to the market regularly through enforcement actions since the 1960s,<br>to answer a question from an audience member at the National Press Club earlier this week.</p>

<p>The data shows that this wallet address sent 200 ETH to Coinbase exchange 5 hours ago. It currently needs to be determined what the purpose of this wallet is. Since July 30, 2015, this number of tokens has increased in value from $62 to $377,600 today.</p>

<p>This development makes users more worried about the negative information that may happen to the second largest cryptocurrency in the world, Ethereum.</p>



<p>As previously updated, early yesterday, there was a giant whale participating in the Ethereum Foundation IC0 that sent all 61,200 tokens to the exchange, leaving the community bewildered.</p>



<p>Many people are inclined to speculate that whales may be about to release their goods when they know in advance that some information is coming to this cryptocurrency. These inferences are based on the volatile market situation caused by the tightening measures taken by US regulators towards the crypto market, especially the SEC.</p>



<p>But there is also a more positive inference that this whale wants to make a profit of $10,000 per day when participating in the staking service with his massive amount of coins.</p>

<p>The Ethereum token is noted to be in a state of uncertainty. On June 21, Ethereum price broke out of the descending resistance line (dashed line), reaching as high as $2,029 on July 14. This high indicates a break out of the resistance area. $1,900, this is a very important level.</p>



<p>However, shortly after hitting a high of $2,029, Ethereum fell. It is currently trading inside the $1,900 area, potentially confirming it as support.</p>



<p>Predicting the future ETH price depends on whether the token breaks out of the channel or bounces. In the event of a crash, ETH can drop to $1,790.</p>



<p>Conversely, if the price bounces, it could lead to a rally to new yearly highs and potentially hit the next resistance at $2,500.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inheriting the victory from the Court&#8217;s ruling in the dispute with the SEC, Ripple (XRP) is still recording an impressive increase to become the most popular token, surpassing even Bitcoin.</strong></h5>

<p>The native token of the Ripple payment system has recently increased by around 6% in the last 24 hours and continuously increased by more than 73% in the past 7 days, reaching the highest level among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.</p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s win with the SEC prompted several exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp, to re-list XRP, leading to an increase in investment, trading volume, and open interest for futures contracts.</p>



<p>In a recent report, smart data portal Kaiko revealed that open interest for altcoins is outpacing Bitcoin (BTC). When measuring the change in open interest since last week, XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by an impressive 50%.</p>

<p>Smaller cryptocurrencies are also up on the day. XLM, the token of the Stellar network adjacent to Ripple, is up 24%. Previous tokens that have been hit hard by the SEC&#8217;s battle with the electronics industry are Cardano&#8217;s ADA, up 12%, and Solana&#8217;s SOL, up around 20%, while the popular dogecoin memecoin (DOGE) is up 8% in the last 7 days.</p>

<p>In an unexpected turn, XRP now accounts for a significant<a href="https://coincu.com/203431-bitcoin-overthrown-xrp-takes-command-claims-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 21%</a> of the total global crypto trading volume, thus outstripping BTC and ETH. As a natural consequence, other altcoins have also experienced increases in their trading volumes. Currently, XRP is reaching new heights in trading, reaching levels not seen in the past 15 months.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, BTC is mostly trading steadily around $30,000. Ether (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market value, is also down on the day at $1,900. Cryptocurrency investors have shifted their focus to smaller, riskier tokens due to the strong performance of so-called altcoins as BTC stalled.</p>



<p>Notably, BTC dominance, which measures bitcoin&#8217;s share of the total market capitalization of crypto assets, has dropped to 49.8% from a high of 52% at the end of June, according to TradingView. This is near a one-month low.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Electric carmaker Tesla&#8217;s (TSLA) bitcoin holdings remain at $184 million.</em></li>



<li><em>Elon Musk&#8217;s company did not buy or sell any bitcoins for the fourth consecutive quarter in Q2 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>The company initially purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoins in early 2021, with CEO Elon Musk boosting the bitcoin price by saying the company would accept bitcoin as a means of payment for their cars, which Musk eventually withdrew.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Tesla said its gross profit margin fell in the second quarter from three months earlier, hurting the electric-car maker&#8217;s efforts to boost sales through discounts.</p>



<p>For the second quarter, Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.91, compared with consensus analysts&#8217; estimate of $0.8, according to FactSet and the revenue of $24.9 billion beat analysts&#8217; estimates of $24.2 billion.</p>



<p>The company reduced its digital asset holdings from $218 million to $184 million in the fourth quarter of that year. Tesla has since maintained that level in the last quarter of 2022 and the first three months of 2023. The net worth of its digital assets at the end of the quarter was $184 million. At the end of the second quarter, the Bitcoin price was around $30,400, up from about $28,500 at the end of the first quarter.</p>

<p>Tesla hasn&#8217;t bought or sold any bitcoin since the second quarter of last year, when it sold more than 30,000 Bitcoins, or about 75% of its Bitcoin holdings, for $936 million.</p>



<p>The company initially purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in early 2021, with CEO Elon Musk boosting the bitcoin price by saying Tesla would accept bitcoin as a means of payment for their cars. But that was eventually withdrawn, citing market concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FCA CEO emphasizes that the size of crypto companies does not influence regulatory approval.</em></li>



<li><em>Only 42 out of over 300 crypto firms have managed to register with the agency.</em></li>



<li><em>The FCA maintains strict anti-money laundering standards and turned down applications from major crypto firms to ensure clean markets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is resolute in its approach to granting regulatory approval for crypto companies, regardless of their size, according to CEO Nikhil Rathi.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1311-1024x682.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1311-1024x682.png" alt="FCA CEO Slams Largest Crypto Firms, Pledges to Uphold Anti-Money Laundering Standards" class="wp-image-204153" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1311-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1311-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1311-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1311-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1311-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1311.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="FCA CEO Slams Largest Crypto Firms, Pledges to Uphold Anti-Money Laundering Standards 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Rathi made this <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/94b4afeb-7201-4735-9ac5-f340d97d1d8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> during a recent hearing with the Treasury Select Committee. The FCA, responsible for registering and overseeing crypto firms operating in the country, has implemented stringent anti-money laundering requirements. While over 300 applications have been received since the register opened two years ago, only 42 firms have <a href="https://coincu.com/128377-revoluts-cryptoasset-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully registered</a> so far.</p>



<p>Rathi highlighted the FCA&#8217;s firm stance by mentioning that they have rejected applications from some of the world&#8217;s largest crypto firms in the past 18 months. The FCA&#8217;s primary objective is to ensure compliance with money laundering standards, and if companies fail to demonstrate their adherence, their applications are turned down. Rathi clarified that the <a href="https://coincu.com/184018-fca-wants-to-promote-crypto-supervision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FCA</a>&#8216;s actions are driven by a commitment to maintaining clean and transparent markets rather than being anti-innovation.</p>

<p>In addition, Rathi cautioned against considering a firm&#8217;s size and market share when evaluating registration applications. He advocated for regulators to focus on making robust decisions based on compliance and standards rather than favoring larger companies. The agency aims to create a level playing field for all participants in the crypto industry, regardless of their size.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the U.K. is expected to introduce a new authorization regime for crypto firms. This regime would require all companies operating in the country, including overseas firms targeting local customers, to obtain a license. The passing of the new markets bill in June has empowered the FCA with greater regulatory powers to oversee the crypto industry and safeguard consumer protection. Further crypto regulations are anticipated as the industry continues to evolve.</p>



<p>In anticipation of these changes, the FCA has already <a href="https://coincu.com/200049-fca-announces-strict-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> warnings to firms marketing qualifying cryptoassets to U.K. consumers. These firms are advised to ensure compliance with the financial promotions regime, especially as it expands to include qualifying cryptoassets in October 2023.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1312.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1312.png" alt="FCA CEO Slams Largest Crypto Firms, Pledges to Uphold Anti-Money Laundering Standards" class="wp-image-204158" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1312.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1312-300x167.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1312-768x427.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1312-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="FCA CEO Slams Largest Crypto Firms, Pledges to Uphold Anti-Money Laundering Standards 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the crypto industry continues to gain prominence, the agency remains dedicated to maintaining robust regulatory oversight to protect investors and uphold market integrity. The FCA&#8217;s commitment to fair and consistent regulation ensures that companies operating in the U.K. adhere to high standards, irrespective of their size, fostering a safer and more transparent crypto environment.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Elon Musk&#8217;s tweet mentioning dog-themed cryptocurrency Dogecoin caused a 4% price surge in minutes.</em></li>



<li><em>DOGE&#8217;s price reached $0.0724 before retracing some gains, trading around $0.070 at press time.</em></li>

<p>Musk, known for expressing his fondness for Dogecoin, shared a humorous image of the Scooby-Doo cartoon character and playfully wrote, &#8220;DOGE ftw (DOGE to win).&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Following Musk&#8217;s tweet, DOGE&#8217;s price surged from $0.0684 to as high as $0.0724. However, the token later retraced some of its gains and was trading slightly above $0.070 at press time, still reflecting a 2% increase over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Shiba inu coin (SHIB), the second largest dog-themed cryptocurrency after DOGE, also experienced a price increase but has mostly retraced that move.</p>



<p>In the competitive world of meme coins, there is currently a race among investors to identify the meme coin with the highest growth potential. Surprisingly, the current leader is not Dogecoin or Pepe Coin (PEPE), both of which have previously enjoyed significant success.</p>



<p>PEPE, inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, surpassed competitors like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu at various points. It quickly gained attention and achieved a market capitalization of $1.8 billion shortly after its launch. However, PEPE&#8217;s momentum has declined recently, leaving early holders disappointed.</p>



<p>Similarly, Dogecoin, once a star in the meme coin space, has encountered a rough patch. Its market value has become unpredictable, fluctuating without a clear trajectory. The future of Dogecoin remains uncertain, despite hopes for a market recovery.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/196082-elon-musk-purges-scam-memecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk</a>&#8216;s comments about cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, have historically had a significant impact on the market. Last week, his mention of an AI-focused venture caused a surge in artificial intelligence-related tokens.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308-1024x683.png" alt="Dogecoin Pops Up Over 4% After Elon Musk&#039;s Interesting Tweet" class="wp-image-204143" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1308.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Dogecoin Pops Up Over 4% After Elon Musk&#039;s Interesting Tweet 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Interestingly, Musk&#8217;s recent comments about Dogecoin come just ahead of Tesla&#8217;s second-quarter earnings report. In the previous year&#8217;s Q2 report, Tesla announced the sale of some of its Bitcoin holdings. Investors will be keen to see if Musk&#8217;s remarks have any influence on Tesla&#8217;s cryptocurrency-related decisions this time around.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/202503-bitmex-introduces-guilds-social-trading-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitMEX</a> will continue as a Premium Partner and Official Cryptocurrency Trading Partner of the renowned soccer club. This collaboration has already yielded remarkable results for both parties and will pave the way for further achievements in sports, business, and charitable initiatives.</p>



<p>Under the renewed partnership, BitMEX&#8217;s logo will no longer appear on the sleeves of AC Milan kits as MSC Cruises takes over as the new Premium Partner. However, BitMEX&#8217;s role as the Official Cryptocurrency Trading Partner remains intact. The previous partnership, worth approximately 5 million euros per season, is expected to undergo some adjustments in the new deal.</p>



<p>The collaboration between BitMEX, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, and AC Milan, one of soccer&#8217;s iconic names, aims to leverage the popularity and global reach of the club. BitMEX seeks to enhance its brand presence and expand into new markets by tapping into the passion and loyalty of millions of AC Milan fans worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC now registers BlackRock, Fidelity, and six other companies&#8217; Bitcoin ETF applications.</em></li>



<li><em>Countdown begins for the SEC decision on approving or rejecting these <em>applications</em>.</em></li>



<li><em>Market surveillance and investor protection standards key factors in SEC&#8217;s evaluation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1681666605179195392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> several prominent names, including BlackRock and Fidelity, to the Federal Register as applicants for a Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund).</strong></h5>

<p>This marks the beginning of the countdown for the SEC to make a decision on the approval or rejection of these six Bitcoin ETF applications.</p>



<p>The registered ETFs include <a href="https://coincu.com/195477-blackrock-to-expand-more-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>&#8216;s iShares Bitcoin Trust, <a href="https://coincu.com/202622-fidelity-fires-up-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a>&#8216;s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, Bitwise&#8217;s Bitcoin ETP Trust, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and Valkyrie&#8217;s &#8220;BRRR&#8221; Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p>While the <a href="https://coincu.com/202973-sec-now-acknowledges-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> released public comment documents on <a href="https://coincu.com/203690-bitcoin-etf-may-not-bring-the-new-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETFs</a> last week, the official review process begins with the confirmation of the applications. The SEC review period typically lasts for 45 days but can be extended up to 240 days.</p>

<p>Historically, the SEC has rejected spot Bitcoin ETF applications, citing concerns related to anti-fraud and investor protection standards. However, many experts believe that the inclusion of market surveillance mechanisms could increase the chances of approval for these ETFs. With BlackRock&#8217;s application, in particular, there is optimism for a higher approval rate, although the SEC has signaled that the path to approval remains challenging.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199820-nasdaq-named-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nasdaq</a>, where BlackRock proposed to list its ETF, has stated its intention to address concerns by collaborating with Coinbase, the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange, to monitor trading in the underlying Bitcoin market. Similar surveillance arrangements have been proposed by CBOE Global Markets in their filings.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the first Bitcoin futures ETF was approved in October 2021, contributing to the surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price to an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. Spot ETFs track the price of the cryptocurrency directly, while futures-based ETFs follow the price of Bitcoin futures contracts.</p>
