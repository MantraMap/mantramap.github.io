<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/circle-1b-reserve-competition/">Circle Relies on $1B Cash Reserve to Fight Competition</a></p>
<p>Prominent Stablecoin issuer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle</a> is demonstrating its commitment to adaptability and resilience as it faces renewed competition from unexpected players.</p>
<p>As non-crypto giants such as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal Holdings Inc</a> (NASDAQ: PYPL) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/paypal-paypal-usd-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enter</a> the field, Circle’s CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jeremy-allaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Allaire</a> revealed in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-10/circle-usdc-stablecoin-issuer-says-1-billion-cash-to-counter-paypal-binance?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Bloomberg that the company is relying on a substantial cash cushion exceeding $1 billion to weather the storm while addressing a decline in the market share of its stablecoin.</p>
<h2>Circle Reserve and USDC Market Share Slump</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the year, Circle&#8217;s USD Coin (USDC) was riding high with a circulation of approximately $45 billion. However, that figure has since plummeted to around $26 billion. This downward trajectory stands in stark contrast to the growth of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, during the same period.</p>
<p>Jeremy Allaire reiterated that various &#8220;tail-risk events&#8221; in the crypto industry have had an impact on USD Coin’s adoption. He highlighted that the fall of Terra, Binance&#8217;s conversion shift, the FTX crisis, and regional bank failures all led to Circle&#8217;s difficulties.</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles, Circle&#8217;s revenue production model has proven resilient, particularly through interest income generated by assets backing the stablecoin, such as dollar deposits and short-term Treasuries. Circle is now in a position to gain from rising interest rates.</p>
<p>Circle&#8217;s financial performance in the first half of the year reflects its resilience. With $779 million in revenue, Circle surpassed its total revenue of $772 million for the entire preceding year.</p>
<p>In addition, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached $219 million, outpacing the $150 million achieved in the previous year. Bolstered by a substantial cash reserve exceeding $1 billion as of June, Circle is well-equipped to forge ahead with its strategic plans.</p>
<p>Allaire emphasized that the vision for Circle&#8217;s future is grounded in the mainstream adoption of stablecoins, envisaging them as the financial medium of the Internet era. He views PayPal&#8217;s recent announcement as just the initial step in this journey.</p>
<p>He expects a greater range of financial services companies and online payment firms to enter the stablecoin arena, increasing competition and accelerating the sector&#8217;s progress.</p>
<h2>The Future Ahead of Circle</h2>
<p>Circle revealed that it is actively pursuing partnerships to promote the adoption of USD Coin. The company is also enhancing transparency by sharing financial reports and collaborating with Deloitte as an auditor.</p>
<p>The company said it is also looking into partnerships for greater adoption of its USDC. However, Circle&#8217;s approach focuses on collaboration without adopting the white-label model used by competitors such as Paxos Trust Co.</p>
<p>Even as the Federal Reserve considers decreasing interest rates, Allaire remains bullish about Circle’s prospects, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/circle-usdc-reserves-us-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noting</a> that historically, a low-rate environment has boosted crypto activity.</p>
<p>Circle’s development of new revenue sources, like the recent launch of a crypto wallet service following the acquisition of CYBAVO in 2022, demonstrates the company’s dedication to innovation and diversification.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/vc-andreessen-horowitz-zero-knowledge/">VC Firm Andreessen Horowitz Delves into Crypto Tech Research, Unveils New Tools to Bolster Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a></p>
<p>Venture Capital (VC) giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/a16z/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreessen Horowitz</a> has unveiled two new tools aimed at improving the core tech behind some of today&#8217;s biggest blockchains. That tech is the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zero-knowledge</a> (ZK) technology.</p>
<p>In line with this, it introduced ‘Lasso’ and ’Jolt’ on Thursday, which are essentially a pair of open-source software projects that are based on the Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge, or SNARKs.</p>
<p>ZK protocols are designed in a way that allows one party to verify the truth of a statement to another party without disclosing anything beyond the fact. The technology is very essential to ZK-rollups, a prevalent Layer 2 scaling solution within the blockchain domain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it may seem that this move by a16z signals the firm&#8217;s intent to actively partake in the development of some of the core tech that powers the companies it backs with its venture dollars. And on a broader scale, might also be an indicator that venture firms are beginning to exert more control over the companies they fund.</p>
<h2>Lasso and Jolt in Details</h2>
<p>According to a16z research papers, the two new tools are a far more effective approach to SNARK. That is in the sense that they are faster and more easily understandable for developers.</p>
<p>Lasso, which is a16z&#8217;s main innovation, proposes a “<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/introducing-lasso-and-jolt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lookup argument</a>” method to speed up ZK systems. About Lasso, the team wrote in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Lasso introduces a streamlined approach to verifying SNARKs, avoiding tedious hand-optimized circuits by performing lookups against massive structured tables.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The team has released code for Lasso under an open-source license. And that means that outside developers may also use it in their own projects.</p>
<p>Jolt, on the other hand, introduces a type of zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that uses Lasso. As of press time, Jolt is still just a research paper. However, a16z confirms that it has forward plans to also release a version of it in code soon. That is, also under an open-source license.</p>
<h2>What Does Andreessen Horowitz Aim to Achieve with Its New Tools?</h2>
<p>It is a known fact that most of the companies in a16z&#8217;s portfolio rely on ZK tech. So, by directly contributing to this technology, the firm is ultimately helping its clients to be successful. More so, open-source contributions undoubtedly boost its reputation, especially among developers and builders. Therefore, with the new tools, a16z may have put itself in an advantaged position over its counterparts when it comes to leading deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-curve-5m-recovery-hack/">Binance Labs Supports Curve Finance with $5M Investment to Aid Recovery from Recent Hack</a></p>
<p>Binance Labs, the investment arm of the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, has committed a substantial $5 million investment in Curve DAO Token (CRV). The strategic move comes as a response to a recent security breach that rattled the Curve ecosystem. Binance Labs said in its <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$5m-in-curve-dao-token-crv-and-supports-curve-deployment-to-bnb-chain-4372009526169554266" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> on August 10 that the investment demonstrates its commitment to shaping the future of the decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) sector.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to support Curve&#8217;s native token, CRV, which serves as a utility token that regulates all the activities in the Curve protocol. The DeFi platform is renowned as the largest stableswap and the industry&#8217;s second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX). With this infusion of funds from Binance Labs, the protocol can further strengthen its foothold and ensure that the platform is tightly packed with security features that make it impenetrable to hackers.</p>
<p>Curve faced a setback due to a vulnerability in its underlying programming language, Vyper. Cybercriminals exploited this vulnerability on July 30, losing $73.5 million from its stable pools. However, the DeFi platform has since recovered around 73% of the stolen funds worth around $52.3 million. The platform recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/curve-finance-bounty-exploiter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> a $1.85 million bounty hunter seeking to expose the hacker who claimed he was smarter than the protocol in an on-chain message on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m refunding you, not because you can find me. It&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t want to ruin your project. I&#8217;m smarter than all of you, f**k!!,&#8221; reads the message.</p>
<h2>Curve Finance Receives Support from Binance Labs after Hack</h2>
<p>The DeFi platform has now received financial support from Binance Labs to help recover from the attack. The injection of $5 million from Binance Labs transcends a simple financial transaction, it represents a collaborative effort focused on strengthening Curve&#8217;s security infrastructure and aiding the protocol in recovering its stability. This investment is not solely aimed at addressing vulnerabilities but is geared toward amplifying the platform&#8217;s functionalities.</p>
<p>Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs, referenced the attack while noting that the platform had significantly impacted the adoption of the DeFi apps in 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi, it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Given the recent events that have impacted the protocol, Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration. We view this cooperation as a starting point and look forward to working together to propel the growth of the DeFi ecosystem further.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Curve to Deploy on BNB Chain</h2>
<p>As part of the collaboration with Binance Labs, Curve plans to explore BNB Chain. According to the announcement, the DeFi protocol, which currently operates across several chains, will expand its protocol to the BNB ecosystem. The move will further propel the growth of the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;BNB Chain has earned a significant presence in DeFi and is well positioned to deploy Curve&#8217;s current and future products on its chain. We look forward to collaboratively fostering innovation and growth across the DeFi ecosystem,&#8221; said Michael Egorov, founder of Curve.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gemini-xrp-deposits-xrpl/">Gemini Opens XRP Deposits after Announcing Support for XRPL</a></p>
<p>Following the court&#8217;s ruling earlier last month on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> vs Ripple case, cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a> announced on Thursday that it has now added the support of XRPL and its native digital asset <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a>. According to the announcement, XRP is now available for trading on the company’s API/FIX and ActiveTrader applications for USD pairs. Additionally, the company announced that the Gemini Mobile App and website users can trade XRP pairs in USD, GBP, EUR, CAD, SGD, HKD, and AUD. The announcement was welcomed by the XRP and Ripple community as it means enhanced liquidity for the digital asset.</p>
<p>“Adding XRP Ledger to our list of supported crypto networks is an important step on our mission to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom,” Gemini noted in the <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-adds-support-for-xrp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange, however, noted that XRP can only be stored in its exchange wallet before it is made available for the Gemini Custody. The company additionally advised its users that they must upgrade to the latest version of its mobile app to deposit XRP.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Be sure to update your Gemini mobile app to version 23.808.0 to deposit XRP</p>

<p>&mdash; Gemini (@Gemini) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1689634983609057280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Market Implications for Gemini Listing Ripple-backed XRP</h2>
<p>The support of XRPL and XRP on the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange is a mutual benefit that extends the interaction of both communities. Notably, XRP is globally traded and adopted by a wide range of institutional investors tapping Ripple&#8217;s cross-border payment infrastructure like On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), and RippleNet. According to the latest crypto market data, the XRP digital asset has a market capitalization of approximately $33.4 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of about $1.147 billion.</p>
<p>Gemini exchange, on the other hand, is available to over 70 countries through regulated means and has facilitated over $200 billion in traded volume. The company has several products in the market including staking, credit card, eOTC, and custody for institutional investors. The company has made strategic partnerships along the way to help accelerate the mainstream adoption of digital assets. Among the companies in Gemini’s portfolio as partners, there are Samsung, Nifty Gateway, and Brave, among others.</p>
<p>As a New York-based crypto company, Gemini is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) to provide its services. With millions of crypto traders already using Gemini exchange and XRP offering deep liquidity, experts believe the integration is strategic for their future growth prospects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the announcement did not have a major positive effect on the XRP price in the past day. According to market data provided by Coingecko, XRP price trades around 63 cents, down approximately 5.1 percent in the last week. Nevertheless, XRP price has gained approximately 83 percent YTD fueled by regulatory clarity and several listings.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bittrex-24m-sec-exchange/">Bittrex Agrees to Pay $24M to Settle with SEC for Failing to Register as National Securities Exchange</a></p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) counted another win against the cryptocurrency market on Thursday after digital asset exchange Bittrex agreed on a $24 million settlement for allegedly listing unregistered securities in the name of crypto assets trading. However, the SEC noted that the defendants agreed on the settlement under the condition that the former neither admits nor denies the allegations. Nonetheless, the SEC counted it as a win after a recent blow in the Ripple case, which the agency intends to appeal.</p>
<h2>SEC vs Bittrex Litigation</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, the United States SEC filed a complaint against the Bittrex crypto exchange and its former CEO William Shihara for allegedly operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The SEC highlighted that Bittrex has earned at least $1.3 billion from 2017 through 2022 by charging transaction fees from investors.</p>
<p>The SEC further complained that Bittrex and Shihara, who was the company’s CEO from 2014 to 2019, coordinated with crypto issuers to first delete from public channels certain problematic statements that the exchange believed would lead to regulatory scrutiny. As a result, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-78" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that the exchange chose profits over investor protection.</p>
<p>Having been cornered without further argument based on existing laws, Bittrex and Bittrex Global agreed to pay a joint disgorgement fee of about $14.4 million, prejudgment interest of $4 million, and a civil penalty of $5.6 million, thereby bringing the total penalty to about $24 million. Notably, the settlement is subject to the court’s approval</p>
<p>“Today’s settlement makes clear that you cannot escape liability by simply changing labels or altering descriptions because what matters is the economic realities of those offerings. I am grateful to the SEC staff for aggressively pursuing non-compliance in the crypto industry, resolving this matter, and bringing additional relief to harmed investors,” Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>The US SEC has already filed similar complaints against several crypto exchanges including Binance US and also Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN). However, the SEC has been accused of overstepping its mandate as some argue that the crypto market is not under its jurisdiction.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we announced that crypto asset trading platform Bittrex Inc. and its co-founder and former CEO, William Shihara, agreed to settle charges that they operated an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.</p>
<p>&mdash; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1689741781481504768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market in the United States is expected to experience heavy regulatory onslaught from several agencies including the Fed, SEC, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>, FDIC, and OCC. Notably, Congress too has made swift progress in regulating the crypto industry more so the stablecoins market in a bid to ensure a safe adoption of the digital dollar, which in turn helps the greenback retain its status as the global reserve currency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/india-sign-documents-crypto/">India Launches Open Competition to Build Web Browser Using Crypto to Digitally Sign Documents</a></p>
<p>India is looking to launch a new web browser that allows people to digitally sign documents using crypto tokens. According to an official <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1947243" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) launched the Indian Web Browser Development Challenge (IWBDC) to build the app.</p>
<p>The press release explains that the IWBDC is an open competition to inspire tech enthusiasts, developers, and innovators looking to build the browser. The announcement also expects that the browser would come equipped with tight security and data privacy protection.</p>
<p>“Proposed browser would also focus on accessibility and user-friendliness, ensuring built-in support for individuals with diverse abilities. Moreover, the browser envisions the ability to digitally sign documents using a crypto token, bolstering secure transactions and digital interactions,” reads the announcement.</p>
<p>The browser is expected to fully support Web3 and similar functionalities. The MeitY has also announced a $400,000 prize for the winner and has set the submission deadline for July 1, 2024.</p>
<h2>Crypto in India</h2>
<p>India has tried repeatedly to ban cryptocurrency in the country but has not had much success. While there is no direct ban on cryptocurrencies in India, the unregulated nature suggests that authorities oppose the widespread adoption of digital assets in the Southeast Asian country. There are also no official guidelines for using crypto and no government-backed recourse for problems arising from crypto investment and related issues.</p>
<p>Last year, India launched the Digital Rupee, a crypto version of its national currency, after initially proposing the asset in 2017. Now, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is hoping that the Digital Rupee would help significantly with cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>The RBI has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/india-rbi-central-banks-digital-rupee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged nearly 20 central banks</a> all over the world, seeking ways through which the central bank digital currency (CBDC) will support cross-border payments. According to RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, India is a vibrant market for trade and receives a large number of cross-border payments from citizens working in other countries. However, there have been setbacks.</p>
<p>Das explains that access to the United States dollar is an increasingly difficult problem for traders in most countries looking to import goods. He states that while India has no shortage of dollars, many other countries have these problems and are affected by the scarcity.</p>
<p>The RBI Governor explains there is a market for the Digital Rupee as a tool for cross-border payments since many popular options have seen reduced patronage because of the increased adoption of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Using the Digital Rupee, the RBI Governor assures that cross-border transactions and payments will be cheaper, easier, and much faster. India hopes to counter the dependence on USD and make the Digital Rupee the preferred cross-border payment option instead of Bitcoin and other digital assets.</p>
<h2>India’s Economy</h2>
<p>Last month, Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/goldman-sachs-india-2075/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> India would become the world’s second-largest economy by 2075. The firm states India will overtake large economies like Germany, China, and Japan.</p>
<p>Goldman’s India economist Santanu Sengupta also added that India’s dependency ratio would become one of the lowest sometime in the next 20 years. A dependency ratio compares the number of a country’s working population with its dependent sector.</p>

<p>The "enhanced" registration requirements will be effective from January 1, 2024.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/france-crypto-firms-mica-regulation/">France Modifies Regulatory Requirements for Crypto Firms to Align with MiCA Regulation</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/france-crypto-firms-mica-regulation/">France Modifies Regulatory Requirements for Crypto Firms to Align with MiCA Regulation</a></p>
<p>In a bid to conform to the recently finalized Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, France has just revised its requirements for crypto firms. The country&#8217;s financial regulator AMF <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/news-publications/news/digital-assets-amf-amends-it-general-regulation-and-its-policy-dasp-light-enhanced-registration-and#xts=607212&amp;xtor=RSS-3&amp;type=RSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> this on Thursday, as countries in the European Union (EU) stand in line to implement the new rule which will take effect in about one and a half years.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, France already has a seemingly robust licensing regime for crypto firms. Therefore, it has been a place of high interest to many firms looking to register ahead of implementing MiCA. That is considering that firms that have duly registered under the current licensing regime may not have any need to be MiCA-compliant when the rule takes effect.</p>
<h2>MiCA Regulation: How&#8217;s the AMF Preparing?</h2>
<p>According to AMF, the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; registration requirements will be effective from Jan. 1, 2024. And, it will be mandatory for &#8220;new players&#8221; that may want to offer any digital assets services. About the old players, however, the regulator said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a reminder, DASPs that obtained a simple registration before Jan. 1, 2024 benefit from a &#8220;grandfather&#8221; clause and continue to be subject to the framework applicable before this date.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Per the AMF, the amendment to its rule covers diverse areas that seek to ensure that digital asset service providers conduct their businesses in good faith. Its revised rule, for instance,  bans crypto firms from using client assets without their express permission. Also, it requires that digital asset service providers issue clear and non-misleading information about their operations. That is as it pertains to their pricing policies, custody provisions ( proper differentiation between client assets and own assets), and security and control systems. And, lastly, the amended rule also seeks for these firms to establish systems for managing conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-approval-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and Hex Trust are registered with the AMF, they were recently joined by Societe Generale&#8217;s crypto division which recently bagged the license as well.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-q1-2024-revenue-growth/">Alibaba Records Impressive Fiscal Q1 2024 Revenue Growth of 14%</a></p>
<p>Chinese e-commerce giant, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</a> (HKG: 9988) has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/alibaba-baba-earnings-report-q1-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> remarkable revenue and financial results for its fiscal Q1 2024 ending June 30.</p>
<p>With a 14% year-on-year increase in revenue and a surge of more than 2.5% in pre-market trading for its US-traded shares, Alibaba continues to demonstrate its resilience and strength in the ever-evolving online marketplace.</p>
<h2>Alibaba Revenue Outperforms Expectations in Q1 2024</h2>
<p>Alibaba’s strong second-quarter performance was highlighted by its healthy revenue results of 234.16 billion Chinese Yuan ($32.29 billion). This is significantly above Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of 224.92 billion Yuan, representing a 14% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>Not only did Alibaba outperform in terms of revenue growth, but its net income also increased significantly. The net income attributable to common shareholders was 34.33 billion Chinese Yuan, exceeding the expected 28.66 billion Yuan. This translates to an impressive 51% year-on-year increase in net income.</p>
<p>Such remarkable growth in net income reflects the effectiveness of Alibaba’s strategic decisions, operational excellence, and ability to capitalize on emerging trends in the e-commerce sector.</p>
<p>Alibaba&#8217;s impressive Q2 performance is not merely a stroke of luck but a result of the company&#8217;s unwavering commitment to innovation, strategic expansion, and relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>One of the pivotal factors behind Alibaba’s remarkable Q1 2024 performance lies in its strategic integration of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI). The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-ai-image-generation-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction</a> of a new AI image generation model dubbed Tongyi Wanxiang has not only elevated productivity but also fostered an environment of creativity for businesses across the spectrum.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/freshippo-presence-china-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion</a> into new business verticals has played a significant role in bolstering its Q1 2024 results. Alibaba&#8217;s dedication to long-term growth and its emphasis on innovation-driven solutions have instilled confidence in investors, propelling the company to unprecedented heights.</p>
<h2>Alibaba Navigates through Stormy Waters</h2>
<p>Alibaba has long been a prominent player in the world of online commerce, but recent times have presented the corporation with unusual problems.</p>
<p>Since December, when China relaxed its rigorous pandemic controls, the country&#8217;s economic trajectory has been a mixed bag, leaving Alibaba to navigate through an environment that has both surprised and confounded investors. The anticipation of a robust economic rebound clashed with the reality of sluggish domestic consumer demand, presenting Alibaba with a complex set of circumstances to navigate.</p>
<p>To address the shifting landscape, Alibaba announced significant organizational changes in March. The company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-split-6-groups-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would split into six distinct business groups as a strategic move to enhance flexibility and potentially raise outside funding.</p>
<p>This restructuring also grants select business groups the opportunity to go public, a move that could inject fresh capital into specific segments of the conglomerate. Notably, Alibaba has already disclosed its intention to publicly list its cloud computing division, a pivotal step in capitalizing on the growing demand for cloud services.</p>
<p>In the midst of these changes, Alibaba is also undergoing a shift in leadership. The impending <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-co-founder-eddie-wu-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">departure</a> of current CEO and Chairman Daniel Zhang in September marks the end of an era.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fireblocks-bitforge-security-vulnerabilities/">Fireblocks Uncovers BitForge: Series of Security Vulnerabilities Affecting Crypto Wallets</a></p>
<p>It was discovered through a recent study carried out by Fireblocks that many crypto wallets are at risk of being drained due to a security flaw that exchanges do not know about. Fireblocks dubbed the security flaw BitForge. It is a series of vulnerabilities affecting wallets using multi-party computation (MPC) technology that allows multiple parties to control and manage cryptocurrency holdings. These security threats have never been identified, and have impacted several major <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-a-crypto-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto wallet</a> providers, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>, WaaS, Zengo, and Binance.</p>
<p>BitForge can enable attackers to drain wallets without the knowledge of users or vendors. The potential draining of numerous retail and institutional investors&#8217; wallets, with no immediate solution available, could lead to increased apprehension within the crypto industry. Thus, it becomes imperative for crypto exchanges to swiftly address the issue.</p>
<p>Addressing the problem proactively is essential, as attempting to resolve it once it starts happening might prove challenging because the whole draining process could be completed within seconds.</p>
<p>Pavel Berengoltz, co-founder of Fireblocks, emphasized the significance of web3 technologies collaborating with security experts with extensive knowledge to stay ahead of vulnerabilities. He <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fireblocks-researchers-uncover-vulnerabilities-impacting-dozens-of-major-wallet-providers-301897357.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As decentralized finance and Web3 continue to gain popularity, the need for secure wallet and key management providers is evident. While we are encouraged to see that MPC is now ubiquitous within the digital asset industry, it is evident from our findings &#8211; and our subsequent disclosure process &#8211; that not all MPC developers and teams are created equal. Companies leveraging Web3 technology should work closely with security experts with the know-how and resources to stay ahead of and mitigate vulnerabilities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Numerous other crypto wallet providers have also been affected by this series of vulnerabilities. As a result, Fireblocks has introduced a BitForge checker to help exchanges and other wallet providers know if they are exposed.</p>
<h2>Coinbase, Zengo, and Binance Have Addressed the BitForge Security Issue</h2>
<p>Coinbase, Zengo, and Binance expressed gratitude to Fireblocks for identifying and responsibly disclosing the security issues before any losses occurred. Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer for Coinbase, shared his thoughts on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We would like to thank Fireblocks for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue. While Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation. Setting a high industry bar for safety protects the ecosystem and is critical to the broader adoption of this technology.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The three exchanges mentioned that they have fixed the issues, assuring their customers about the safety of their services. They also emphasized the importance of partnering with security experts so as to stay ahead of potential security issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-beta-signature-docs-drive/">Google Announces Open Beta for eSignature Feature in Google Docs and Drive</a></p>
<p>Google has unveiled an open beta of its eSignature feature for the Google Workspace. The feature is available for Google Docs and Google Drive users.</p>
<p>According to an official <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/08/esignature-google-docs-google-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>, Google has been alpha testing eSignatures in Google Docs since June last year. The testing involved dragging and dropping signatures and dates, as well as requesting signatures after resolving all comments and suggestions. Google was also experimenting with monitoring contract progress and also tracking the status of pending signatures and contracts. All of these features are now available to users.</p>
<p>The blog post also announces a few more features that would be available a little later this year. Users would see an automatic audit trail report for all completed contracts, and a multi-signer feature that allows people to request signatures from multiple users. Furthermore, requesting an eSignature from a non-Gmail user will also be possible, in addition to initiating an eSignature on a PDF file in Google Drive. According to the blog post, some Google Workspace editions will be able to test the eSignature sometime in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The new Google eSignature feature comes long after other platforms have introduced similar options for users. For instance, Dropbox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-snares-hellosign-for-230m-gets-workflow-and-esignature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> workflow and eSignature company HelloSign for $230 million in 2019 and integrated the feature. Now called Dropbox Sign, the feature allows users to exchange and sign documents within Dropbox. Adobe Acrobat also has a similar feature.</p>
<p>There’s also DocuSign, the California-based eSignature company that offers basic integrations with several platforms, including Google Drive, Evernote, Microsoft 365, and Dropbox. On specific plans, integrating Microsoft Dynamics, NetSuite, Salesforce, Sugar CRM, and Microsoft SharePoint is also possible. In June, DocuSign <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/docu-shares-docusign-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> strong earnings of $661 million for fiscal Q1 2024, beating the expected $642 million.</p>
<h2>Google eSignature Follows Other Product Announcements</h2>
<p>Last week, Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-upgrade-assistant-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Google plans to upgrade its Google Assistant feature using artificial intelligence. According to reports, the company is working on a “supercharged” assistant powered by large language model (LLM) technology.</p>
<p>The new Google Assistant would support enhanced conversations and make user interactions a lot more engaging. By using LLM similar to generative AI chatbots like Bard and ChatGPT, users will experience a more advanced assistant with more solutions and tools to solve problems and perform the assistant’s role.</p>
<p>Google is also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-ai-tool-journalists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developing</a> an AI-powered tool for journalists. Also using LLM technology, Google is creating a tool to help journalists and media personnel write news articles. Reportedly, Google has already pitched the tool to a few news organizations, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and News Corp.</p>
<p>Called Genesis, the new tool can create a news copy using details provided by the journalists. The tool is also expected to create these articles by relying on current affairs. However, reactions to Genesis have been broadly polar. While some believe it should be applauded, others say that Google is treating news writing with levity. Some journalists also believe employers will begin to cut journalist roles in favor of Genesis.</p>
