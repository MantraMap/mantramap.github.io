Solana (SOL) Sees Minor Gains
<p>The market hasn&rsquo;t been favorable to Solana (SOL) over the past years, and the cryptocurrency is way below its all-time high of $260 in 2021. However, it&rsquo;s understandable that the bear market has had its toll on many other altcoins. Solana (SOL) is looking to restore its value, and the cryptocurrency has been nearly 4% higher in the last 24 hours. The project has been bearish since the 8th of May this year, and the recent pumps could signify a change in direction moving forward. </p>
<p>In addition, Solana (SOL) is still one of the leading blockchain systems offering the best environment and conditions for projects to build and thrive. While Solana (SOL) sees some minor gains, hinging toward price recovery, Uwerx is a project that started on a promising note, with the best performance so far in its ongoing presale. </p>
