May is looking up for Polygon (MATIC) price as it is seen to be in the green zone for two consecutive days. Polygon bulls have picked up steam and momentum in the new month after bears held the prices down since mid-February. Despite Polygon&#8217;s countless innovative partnerships and bullish news events, its native token remained bearish for most of the 2023 first quarter. And BTC&#8217;s impressive price movements in April were still not enough to awaken Polygon bulls, as bears remained adamant and unmoved. However, Polygon (MATIC) bulls remain resilient in their new show of strength in May.

The cryptocurrency markets, which experienced a major rally in BTC price and some altcoins in April, were met with bearish sentiments as the &#8220;Sell in May&#8221; narrative trooped in.
