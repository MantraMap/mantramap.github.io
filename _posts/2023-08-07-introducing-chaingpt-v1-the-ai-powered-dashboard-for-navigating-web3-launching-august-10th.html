<p>With a vision to unite all of the ChainGPT products into one intuitive, user-friendly interface, and enable an engaging AI-powered experience for all Web3 participants, ChainGPT will be releasing the highly-anticipated V1 web application to the public.</p>
<p>Starting on August 10, at 12:00 pm UTC, every participant of the crypto, blockchain, and Web3 space will have access to the most sophisticated AI with on-chain and off-chain capabilities to date.</p>
What is the ChainGPT V1?
<p>Acting as an AI powered operating system of fundamental tools for traders, investors, researchers, developers, and everyone in between, the ChainGPT V1 is a dashboard that encompasses the full suite of ChainGPT products including the NFT Generator, smart contract auditor, and chat assistant, with its ecosystem components including the ChainGPT DAO, the staking modules, and API access that will facilitate a new generation of informational management and discovery for all in the crypto and blockchain space. The ultimate hub for Crypto AI Tools.</p>
What are some of the V1 Features?
<p>Loaded with all of the individual products ChainGPT has released over the last few months, the V1 web app has a rich set of functionality that builds on previous versions of ChainGPT.</p>
<p>AI Chatbot Already deployed throughout a multitude of Web3 communities via Telegram and Discord, the ChainGPT AI Chatbot has already become a staple as an interactive, dynamic database for engaging and entertaining users. With the release of the V1 the Chatbot is receiving an upgrade with new capabilities &amp; bug fixes that supersede its predecessor beta version. Its capabilities now extend across a much broader range of sources for gathering live Web3 news and insights. It will be able to conduct much deeper, more granular market analysis through the application of technical indicators (such as the RSI and EMA) to aid traders and investors in their research. It has been tuned to track all major launchpad and IDO platforms, providing a more holistic view of the startup landscape. Initially having a surface level set of assets that were limited in scope, the upgraded chatbot has been plugged in to service over 5,000 coins/tokens (and will be constantly expanding).</p>
<p>As it pertains to the bug fixes, all minor and major points of friction for the users have been mended. Response times have been compressed, accuracy has been calibrated for higher contextual fidelity, and error potential has been minimized.</p>
<p></p>
Master Dashboard
<p>User experience with slow, clunky and disorganized applications has kept many away from participating in the world of Web3; ChainGPT decided to approach this problem head on and was able to construct what might be the most complete AI interface in the industry.</p>
<p>Integrating every $CGPT application, while being able to neatly package the visual elements without disrupting its aesthetics, the V1 dashboard is transforming user accounts into AI-powered Web3 operating systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Automated AI Newsfeed
<p>Staying up-to-date in the fast paced crypto, blockchain, and Web3 space has been notoriously challenging, until now.</p>
<p>The first (and only) of its kind, ChainGPT&rsquo;s automated AI newsfeed has been developed from the ground up to deliver the most complete informational experience. Scanning the entire internet, the ChainGPT AI newsfeed aggregates all the leading trusted outlets and social sources, digests the information, and produces succinct summarizations in an comprehensive manner.</p>
<p></p>
Prompt Marketplace
<p>An AI is only as useful as the prompt that it is given. Quickly becoming one of the most sought after skills in the greater tech industry, prompting is a form of vernacular art; in fact prompts have become a digital asset class of its own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catering to the evolving demands of AI communities, the V1 dashboard is equipped with its own prompt marketplace, becoming a focal point for the exchange of generative AI ideas. Users will be able to buy, bell, &amp; trade prompts with the expansive $CGPT community; effectively adding a vector for users to monetize their skills.</p>
<p></p>
AI NFT Generator
<p>ChainGPT released the first ever AI NFT Generator on June 1st, with already over 4,500,000 NFTs generated! In the evolving landscape of digital art, ChainGPT's AI NFT Generator stands out as an avant-garde tool, seamlessly melding technology with artistic expression. With just a simple text prompt, this groundbreaking generator harnesses the power of advanced AI to bring to life high-quality NFT collections, ranging from distinctive single pieces to vast galleries of up to 10,000 NFTs, all within an astonishing 30 to 60 seconds. Offering unparalleled versatility, it supports a myriad of platforms including BNB Chain, opBNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and Ethereum. While individual NFT creation and minting are graciously offered for free, those aiming to craft expansive 10,000 NFT collections can easily do so under the umbrella of ChainGPT's Freemium or Paid plans. The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator is not just a tool&mdash;it's a revolution, redefining the boundaries of what's possible in the world of NFT creation.</p>
<p></p>
AI Powered Solidity Smart-Contracts Auditor &amp; Generator
<p>Navigating the intricate realm of Solidity smart-contracts just became remarkably intuitive with ChainGPT's cutting-edge AI models and tools. Whether you're looking to birth a new contract or rigorously assess an existing one, ChainGPT simplifies the process. Users can effortlessly generate tailor-made smart-contracts by merely articulating their requirements, eliminating the technical jargon and complexities traditionally associated with such tasks. Similarly, auditing a contract is now as straightforward as presenting its code to ChainGPT's AI. This innovation heralds a new era, making the creation and assessment of Solidity smart-contracts more accessible and efficient than ever before.</p>
Membership and Access
<p>The V1 release will be engaging a three tier membership system based on what applications and the degree of access that users desire to have.&nbsp;</p>

Restricted from the more advanced applications, the free plan provides limited access to five of the core applications including the General AI model (chatbot), the news feed, the Ask Crypto People app, Single NFT Generation, and participation in the prompt marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
