<p>The year 2022 has been a major source of stress for cryptocurrency investors, notably holders of Hex Coin (HEX) and Solana (SOL). The recent downward price movements of Hex Coin (HEX) and Solana (SOL)&nbsp; have unnerved investors who purchased these currencies. Both currencies had a good start, but things don't seem good for the future. Flasko, a new rival currency, is emerging as a cryptocurrency with great potential in the coming days.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Presale Draws Attention From Hex Coin (HEX)</p>
<p>Hex Coin (HEX) is a game-changing digital asset that promotes itself as a premier blockchain CD. Hex Coin (HEX) was first launched on the Ethereum network, and its price has climbed dramatically since its creation, with an annual percentage return of almost 40%.</p>
<p>The Hex Coin (HEX) cryptocurrency uses a hybrid consensus process based on the Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms. Despite a market valuation of $7.56 billion, the average daily trading volume is around $5.46 million. This indicates a dramatic decline in the number of investors. Hex Coin (HEX) is trading at only $0.03, which isn't appealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) Investors Are Worried</p>
<p>Solana is another cryptocurrency that is having trouble right now (SOL). Solana (SOL) intended to develop a smart contract operating at the layer one level. It was also looking forward to establishing a scalable and quicker blockchain, which might give a superior throughput compared to the present Bitcoin (BTC) network.</p>
<p>Despite the merits of the Solana (SOL) concept, it was trapped in a market downturn. As a result, the cost of one Solana (SOL) token keeps falling. At the time of writing, one Solana (SOL) token is worth $13.69. In 2021, that same token was worth about $260.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Will See Incredible Growth In 2023</p>
<p>Flasko, an upcoming NFT platform, will allow users to invest in luxury beverages, including champagne, wine, and whiskey bottles backed by fractionalized NFTs secured by the underlying physical assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flasko will not only be convenient for people who are unable to afford luxury wines and spirits but will also play a pivotal role in helping up-and-coming brands to launch their products on their platform and get exposure through the Flasko platform.</p>
<p>Regarding figures, Flasko is currently in its second stage of the presale and costs only $0.125 per presale token, with predictions of hitting $5 by February 2023 by crypto experts. Flasko is set to become the fastest-growing cryptocurrency of 2023 as whales flooded to purchase Flasko tokens as the presale began.</p>
