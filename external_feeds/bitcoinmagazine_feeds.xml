    </figure><h2>Natural Gas Prices At The Waha Hub</h2><p>Approximately <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53499">70% of Mexico’s natural gas imports</a> are supplied by U.S. pipelines. Therefore, it is common for natural gas contracts in Mexico to be <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/pipeline-natural-gas-exports-to-mexico-rising-as-infrastructure-comes-online/">linked to locations in the U.S.</a> where pricing is determined, such as the Waha hub, Henry hub and Houston Ship Channel.</p><p><a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Texas-Natural-Gas-Prices-Sink-Close-To-Zero.html">The Waha hub is one of the most important pricing point for natural gas in Mexico</a>, in part because each of the Wahalajara pipelines jointly operated by Carso Energy and Energy Transfer <a href="https://tppetconnect.energytransfer.com/ipost/TPP/capacity/design-capacity-for-intrastates">are designed</a> to <a href="https://pipelines.energytransfer.com/ipost/CTP/capacity/design-capacity-for-intrastates">transport</a> and sell over 1 billion of cubic feet of natural gas per day to Mexico’s state-owned Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) power plants.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gob.mx/cre/documentos/precios-de-gasolinas-y-diesel?idiom=es">natural gas price index for the Mexican market</a>, known as the IPGN, is <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/mexicos-cre-to-publish-natural-gas-prices-for-six-regions/">calculated with the Waha benchmark price by</a> the Comisión Reguladora de Energía (CRE), a government energy regulatory commission. Carso Energy’s transport income generally benefits from higher prices at the Waha hub. The CRE uses the Waha benchmark to calculate a daily reference price for natural gas used by CFE, which helps determine the price of natural gas <a href="https://elcapitalino.mx/nacion/cfe-principal-factor-para-el-crecimiento-de-carso-energy/">sold to the CFE by Carso Energy</a>, including the midstream costs of transportation and other fees associated with importing natural gas. The <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/cfe-alliances-driving-mexico-natural-gas-infrastructure-growth-as-imports-cool-off/">CFE is one of the largest customers of natural gas in Mexico</a> and by the end of next year, the CFE is expected to generate <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-generate-65-energy-2024-lopez-obrador">65% of Mexico’s power</a>. Selling natural gas to the CFE can become extremely profitable during severe weather events in Texas, due to <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-embroiled-us400-million-legal-dispute-goldman-sachs">heavily-inflated spikes</a> in the Waha benchmark price.</p><p>Severe weather events aside, the Waha hub has been plagued with takeaway capacity constraints, causing record low prices in the Waha benchmark of natural gas that have <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53919">consistently fallen below the Henry hub</a> in Erath, Louisiana. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) primarily uses the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_fut_s1_d.htm">Henry hub price for natural gas futures</a> contracts. Physical supply and demand dynamics at the Waha hub can have effects that influence the Henry hub and NYMEX natural gas futures. The Wahalajara pipelines had been <a href="https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/article/14180425/us-gas-exports-to-mexico-to-rise-with-wahalajara-completion">expected to help narrow the steep Waha hub discount</a> to the Henry hub, however, the Waha benchmark still went <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Texas-Natural-Gas-Prices-Sink-Close-To-Zero.html">negative 20 times in the last three years</a> due to other factors that <a href="https://btuanalytics.com/natural-gas-pricing/can-el-paso-south-pipeline-save-waha-from-negative-outright-pricing/">remain an issue</a>.</p><p>Negative pricing at the Waha hub can occur when there is an <a href="https://aegis-hedging.com/insights/waha-basis-forces-affecting-price-aegis-reference">oversupply of natural gas and not enough pipeline capacity to transport the gas</a>. When this happens, producers may be forced to pay buyers to take their natural gas in order to avoid having to entirely shut down production. This can lead to negative pricing, which can present a number of challenges for Waha pipelines.</p><blockquote><p>“Waha is in the Permian basin, and is characterized as a market that is perpetually long supply, and needs to trade at a discount to its marginal demand market. That demand market is almost always outside of the Permian basin. Therefore, basis is determined by the amount of excess gas that needs to be moved to another location. The relative abundance or scarcity of this egress capacity influences Waha basis greatly…</p><p>“On a daily basis, wind generation directly competes with natural gas. As new wind (and solar) farms are constructed, renewable energy sources are taking a larger share of total generation. If renewables generation grows faster than load (demand for power), then gas demand generally suffers.”</p><p>–<a href="https://aegis-hedging.com/insights/waha-basis-forces-affecting-price-aegis-reference">“Waha Basis: Forces Affecting Price,” AEGIS Reference</a>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>Bitcoin Mining Competes With Natural Gas Pipelines</h2><p>Low prices reduce the incentive for producers to sell natural gas in the Waha market, which in turn can lead to lower throughput volumes for the Wahalajara pipelines. Shale oil wells in the Permian Basin <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-25/to-manys-dismay-permian-produces-more-gas-and-condensate-instead-of-oil-and-profits/">have become extremely gassy</a> — producing more <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=A#ass_diss_nat_gas">associated natural gas</a> as they age and oil production falls. This results in increased exploration for shale oil, which <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-are-setting-billions-of-dollars-on-fire-11578652210">results in more gassy wells</a> and an oversupply of natural gas. As prices stay low, or go negative, it becomes more profitable to waste natural gas by either venting it or flaring it.</p><p>Venting methane is harmful for the environment as it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/12/climate/texas-methane-super-emitters.html">a potent greenhouse gas</a> that traps <a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight">80 times more heat than carbon dioxide (CO2)</a> over a 20-year period. Flaring is better than venting, but is only <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/flaring-emissions">92% efficient</a>, meaning that 8% of all flared methane still escapes into the atmosphere. </p><p>Bitcoin mining is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/12/23-year-old-texans-made-4-million-mining-bitcoin-off-flared-natural-gas.html">nearly 100% efficient</a> at <a href="https://www.weforum.org/videos/this-start-up-catches-waste-methane-to-power-data-centres">mitigating methane emissions</a>, so it's <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-are-setting-billions-of-dollars-on-fire-11578652210">more ecologically sound and profitable to mine Bitcoin</a> with methane from stranded Permian Basin wells than it is to waste it. Bitcoin miners can even be used to <a href="https://www.satoshiaction.io/orphaned-wells">reduce fugitive emissions from abandoned oil wells</a> once the wells are no longer productive. Ultimately, this all means there is less incentive to build expensive infrastructure to transport Permian natural gas to the Waha hub where it may sell for practically nothing.</p><p>This is a major problem for operators of the Wahalajara pipeline system. Midstream companies such as Carso Energy and Energy Transport grow profits by increasing the volume and value of transported natural gas. The oil and gas industry has concluded that costs have to rise because <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-25/to-manys-dismay-permian-produces-more-gas-and-condensate-instead-of-oil-and-profits/">the current cost structure is unsustainable</a> as losses for natural gas explorers <a href="https://ieefa.org/articles/ieefa-update-bankruptcies-multiply-fracking-sector">continue to mount</a>.</p><h2>Bitcoin Mining Competes With Natural Gas Peaker Plants</h2><p><br>To make matters more challenging for the oil and gas industry, research indicates that using large, flexible loads, such as those favored by Bitcoin mining operations, can have a net <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4347220">decarbonizing effect</a> on grids over the long term. This is believed to happen when loads balance fluctuations in variable renewable generation, which in turn <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032114005504">facilitates higher penetrations of renewable resources</a> when those power sources are available.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Brad Jones, the former interim CEO of ERCOT, has <a href="https://youtu.be/gKnRfDeFgr0">publicly affirmed that Bitcoin mining</a> has already played a major role in bringing renewables into the Texas grid, by supporting the financials of solar and wind facilities, and providing a balancing effect between consumers and excess generation that would otherwise be negatively priced or curtailed.</p><blockquote><p>“For many years, ERCOT had been looking for loads of scale that could respond in a demand responsive way that can help us balance our grid... It's here now. And it's a great thing for helping us to manage the grid. Helping us to manage our resources. Bitcoin has the nature of really turning down when prices begin to rise, in a way that we can give that power back to other consumers. And at the same time, as we bring more and more renewables into the state, it becomes a driver of more renewables. Because right now if we bring in all the renewables that are signed up to want to come to our state, there will be a significant depression of pricing during the day. By having Bitcoin there to assist, to stabilize those prices throughout the day, it's going to drive more renewables into our system. And that's good for Texas.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1614634614504493056">Brad Jones</a>, former Interim CEO of ERCOT</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, research suggests that demand-response programs are competitors to traditional, flexible-generation plants and, by proxy, the natural gas companies that provide fuel to those plants.</p><blockquote><p>“Widespread adoption of demand response may not be viewed favourably by all participants in the power market. In particular, if the capacity value, or the availability in times of need, of demand response is significant, owners of peaking plants will likely see their capacity factors decrease as demand response takes over some or all of the responsibility for regulation, load following and ramping… This will have a significant impact on the potential for generator owners to recover their investment, possibly leading to the decommissioning of otherwise operational plants. Such a scenario would clearly be greatly opposed by operators of flexible generators, even though it may present an efficient solution for the system as a whole."&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.098">Benefits And Challenges Of Electrical Demand Response: A Critical Review</a>”</p></blockquote><p>If flexible demand response can lead to the decommissioning of flexible generation, there would obviously be fewer potential buyers of natural gas during periods of peak demand. As variable renewables continue to increase market share within ERCOT, Carso Energy and Energy Transfer would have <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/sb1751-would-hurt-bitcoin-miners-but-who-does-it-benefit/">good reason to view demand-response programs that Bitcoin mining operations participate in as competitors to peaker plants</a> that reliably buy and consume natural gas.</p><p>Of course, natural gas peaker plants are necessary when solar and wind aren’t available, enabling miners to continue mining during those hours. On the surface, this would appear to make Bitcoin miners and natural gas companies close allies. However, if oil and gas executives concur with Jones and the research above, there would be <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/sb1751-would-hurt-bitcoin-miners-but-who-does-it-benefit/">a motive</a> for oil and gas companies to negatively color the public’s perception of Bitcoin’s participation in ERCOT demand-response programs. Natural gas may be maintaining its market share within ERCOT as renewables grow, but the industry would rather increase its market share and eliminate competition to secure its long-term future.</p><figure>

In testimony at a committee meeting in March, Berkshire Hathaway was the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/13/texas-power-natural-gas-cost-senate-bill-6/">lone supporter of the bill</a>. <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Texas-To-Incentivize-Gas-Fired-Peaking-Units.html">Energy analysts</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-energy-idea-is-a-bad-fit-for-texas-c21655a3">The Wall Street Journal have criticized</a> the plan as being bad for Texas, due to it being costly and undermining competition from solar and wind. <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB7/2023">Senate Bill 7</a> adds <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/05/texas-senate-grid-natural-gas-energy-legislature/?ref=hashrateindex.com">oversight requirements to ERCOT for peaker plants</a> and provides allowances for plants that will operate at a loss when severe weather isn’t observed.

Worse, it stymies miners in their efforts to make the Texas electrical grid more resilient in emergency situations by arbitrarily limiting Bitcoin mining’s participation in ancillary and demand-response services to 10%, which the industry likely already exceeds.

For example, <a href="https://archive.is/pk9qx">Energy Transfer raked in $2.4 billion during the February 2021 blackout of Winter Storm Uri</a>, by using natural gas as a peaking asset — storing it when the price is low, and selling when demand skyrocketed. </p><p>Exporting natural gas to Mexico during a severe weather event in Texas can be even more profitable for the Wahalajara pipeline operators, since the Mexican price might be even higher — especially If ERCOT were more reliant on natural gas peakers. During the 2021 Texas winter blackouts, the price of natural gas in Mexico <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-embroiled-us400-million-legal-dispute-goldman-sachs">skyrocketed to 100 times normal prices</a>.

Today, LFLs are providing and profiting from ancillary services that natural gas peaker plants would have previously dominated.

In fact, LFLs <a href="https://finbold.com/texas-bitcoin-miners-resume-operations-after-shutting-down-due-to-high-power-demand/">helped balance the grid and avoid blackouts during the summer heat wave of 2022</a> and <a href="https://finbold.com/bitcoin-miners-returned-enough-power-to-heat-1-5-million-homes-during-texas-blizzard/">during Winter Storm Elliot</a>, over Christmas of 2022 — freeing up over 3,000 megawatts of spare capacity on the grid. This success was forecasted by ERCOT a few weeks prior to Winter Storm Elliot, in a report that heralded Bitcoin miners <a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf">as beneficial to balancing the grid during extreme weather events</a>.</p><figure>

It was filled with disinformation and fallacious reporting about the role of demand response that has since been <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/the-absurdity-of-the-nyts-latest-bitcoin-hit-piece">thoroughly debunked by the Bitcoin Policy Institute</a>. Dance’s reporting contradicted the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/demand-response">U.S. Department of Energy, which views demand response favorably</a>. It also conflicted with <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1645550345265852418">earlier endorsements of demand response from The New York Times</a>, going back at least to 2007. </p><p>Here is a selection of previous endorsements from the Times:</p><blockquote><p>“Across the United States, several thousand businesses and residential customers are ceding control of their electrical systems during moments of unusually high demand. And they are getting paid to do it. The system, based on a concept called ‘demand response,’ is one of the latest ways that Internet technology is being applied to manage over-stretched U.S. power supplies better.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04iht-rbogcut.1.8184549.html">Demand Response Technology Shaves Peak Energy Consumption By Remote Control</a>,” The New York Times, November 7, 2007</p></blockquote><p>In 2009, The New York Times <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/dimming-the-lights-to-meet-demand/?searchResultPosition=1">reported that demand response had been endorsed</a> by the Obama administration’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, Jon Wellinghoff.</p><blockquote><p>“The Obama administration, Congress and the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, Jon Wellinghoff, have all focused on reducing peak demand. Mr. Wellinghoff has called demand response the ‘killer application’ of the smart grid.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/dimming-the-lights-to-meet-demand/?searchResultPosition=1">Dimming The Lights To Meet Demand</a>,” The New York Times, April 17, 2009</p></blockquote><p>In 2010, in its “Energy And Environment” section of the paper, the Times continued to extol the benefits of demand response to its readers.</p><blockquote><p>“This concept, called demand response, has gained traction in utility circles. In essence, it involves paying users to make small sacrifices when there is an urgent need for extra power (the ‘peak’). The utility can then rely on cutting some demand on its system at crucial times and, in theory, avoid the cost of building a new plant just to meet those peak needs… For farmers, however, this process isn't easy. Workers must be dispatched to turn the pumps on and off, and there is a risk of crop damage.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/business/energy-environment/24idaho.html">Why Is A Utility Paying Customers?</a>,” The New York Times, January 23, 2010</p></blockquote><p>Again, later in 2010, the Times reiterated the Obama administration’s positive view of demand response.</p><blockquote><p>“…[Wellinghoff] sees consumers as active parts of the grid … stabilizing the grid by adjusting demand through intelligent appliances or behavior modification, known as demand response; and storing energy for various grid tasks. He thinks consumers should get paid to provide these services.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/business/energy-environment/29iht-rbogferc.html">Making The Consumer An Active Participant In The Grid</a>,” The New York Times, November 29, 2010</p></blockquote><p>The newspaper even quoted environmentalists who wanted Texas to adopt more demand response.</p><blockquote><p>“Environmentalists argue that the strains on the grid should spur Texas to work on energy-saving strategies. In particular, they are pushing a program called demand response, in which businesses and consumers are paid to reduce power at times of high demand, like late summer afternoons. Colin Meehan, a clean energy analyst with the Environmental Defense Fund in Texas, said in an e-mail that Texas had ‘so far only taken very small steps’ on demand response.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/business/energy-environment/electric-grid-in-texas-faces-multiple-challenges.html">Electric Grid In Texas Faces Multiple Challenges</a>,” The New York Times, December 22, 2011</p></blockquote><p>The Times continued to praise demand response throughout the Obama administration, almost as if it was doing the administration’s job to promote the technology.</p><blockquote><p>“But balancing the grid involves more than just increasing capacity. Perhaps the state’s most promising conservation tool is ‘demand response,’ … The programs, which are voluntary in Texas, can take many forms… Demand response ‘probably deserves more focus and attention,’ said Doyle Beneby, the president of C.P.S. Energy, a municipally owned utility that has not taken a position in the capacity market debate. ‘In Texas, it could be a big part of the solution.’”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/with-strain-on-electric-grid-a-push-to-prioritize-conservation.html?searchResultPosition=1">With Strain On Electric Grid, A Push To Prioritize Conservation</a>,” The New York Times, January 23, 2014</p></blockquote><p>And yet, Dance’s hit piece against Bitcoin mining single-handedly reversed the Times' position on demand response. Dance wrote the following passage, which makes demand response sound like an evil scheme for flexible customers to defraud retail customers:</p><blockquote><p>“Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets. They can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their electricity at a premium when prices spike and even be paid for offering to turn off. Other major energy users, like factories and hospitals, cannot reduce their power use as routinely or dramatically without severe consequences.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">The Real-World Costs Of The Digital Race For Bitcoin</a>,” The New York Times, April 9, 2023</p></blockquote><p>It all begs a long list of questions: Why did The New York Times spend months researching an article that distracts readers from serious environmental issues, only to focus on a technology that is only responsible for an infinitesimal <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/ghg/comparisons">0.14% of global emissions</a>? Why did it ignore a December 2022 ERCOT study that showed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/applied-direct-response-ercot-study-shows-bitcoin-mining-is-beneficial-to-the-texas-grid/">large flexible loads, such as those favored by Bitcoin mining operations, were beneficial</a> to the Texas grid?

    </figure><p>Very little about the hit piece makes any sense. Is it a coincidence that <em>The New York Times </em>attacked Texas Bitcoin mining at just the right time that it could benefit one of its largest shareholders?</p><blockquote><p>“The point is, Slim doesn’t have to interfere at all. I know from experience that publishers do intervene in the editorial process, as is their prerogative.

However, it would fit an ongoing pattern of The New York Times <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/20/el-chapo-or-carlos-slim-who-is-more-dangerous">protecting Slim’s business interests</a> in addition to patterns of alleged, <a href="https://www.thegrayladywinked.com">calculated, systemic bias and distortions</a>. Whether these are all coincidences, or something more, may be up for debate. However, editors of the Times seem more than willing to sacrifice the newspaper’s remaining shreds of journalistic integrity for whatever motivates them to run such hit pieces. </p><p>More and more readers, on the other hand, are beginning to distrust mainstream media and it doesn’t help when the largest shareholders of media companies are positioned to reap profits from the reporting.

The event will bring together tech innovators, Bitcoin enthusiasts and industry leaders to discuss the latest advancements in the Bitcoin industry. The conference is dedicated to providing a platform for diverse views and opinions to build a strong Bitcoin community that focuses on solving real problems and finding solutions. Speakers at the conference will represent various spheres of society, from academics to engineers to politicians.</p><p>Brandon Green, Director of Events at BTC Inc., believes that bringing political speakers to the conference is about more than just highlighting the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin in the political sphere. "We believe that by engaging with politicians who are open to the idea of Bitcoin, and furthering their understanding of Bitcoin at the conference, we can create champions for the industry in Washington and beyond," he says.</p><p>Among the political figures who will be speaking at the conference are Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Governor Ridwan Kamil of West Java, Congressman Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida, former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, and former Congressman and White House Senior staff David McIntosh.</p><figure>

She will share her views on Bitcoin’s role in the financial industry and her co-sponsoring of the Financial Innovation Act of 2021, which calls for a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.</p><p>Governor Kamil oversees a population of over 50 million people and is a visionary leader who believes in embracing innovation for humanity's benefit. He is working with U.S. entities to bring education and adoption of Bitcoin to Indonesia and is at the forefront of these initiatives.</p><p>Congressman McHenry is committed to increasing access to financial tools and has already championed the passage of landmark legislation like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Congressman Donalds, on the other hand, is a champion for education reform, criminal justice reform, and has been a staunch critic of central bank digital currencies and financial surveillance. Former Congresswoman Gabbard is sure to bring valuable insights to the discussions on the role of Bitcoin in shaping the future of the country. David McIntosh, as a former Congressman and White House Senior staff, champions pro-Bitcoin legislation at both state and federal levels, maintaining Bitcoin as a safe alternative to inflate the U.S. dollar.</p><p>The Bitcoin 2023 Conference promises to be an exciting event for Bitcoin enthusiasts and industry leaders alike. With diverse views and perspectives represented by the speakers, the conference will provide a unique opportunity for attendees to learn and engage with leading experts in the field.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwODY3NDQ1MjI3OTg4NjYy/bitcoin-airline-miles-frequent-points-fly-top-photo.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NjQ3Nzk5NzcxNTM5MjUw/b23---political_speakers_press.png" height="310" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mawson Infrastructure Signs Agreement For 24MW Ohio Facility That Will Come Online In Q3 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[The site could potentially bring Mawson’s capacity in the area up to 290MW and increase deployable hash rate to 1.0 EH/s]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/mawson-infrastructure-signs-agreement-for-24mw-ohio-facility</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/mawson-infrastructure-signs-agreement-for-24mw-ohio-facility</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mawson Infrastructure Group]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 18:42:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMzUxMjcwOTg2MTYzNzc5/mining-pick-axe.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The site could potentially bring Mawson’s capacity in the area up to 290MW and increase deployable hash rate to 1.0 EH/s</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Digital infrastructure provider <a href="https://mawsoninc.com/">Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc.</a> (Mawson) has signed an agreement for a new site in Corning, Ohio, with an initial capacity of 24MW.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230501005454/en/Mawson-Infrastructure-Group-Inc.-Signs-New-24MW-Site-in-Ohio---Full-24MW-Online-in-Q3-2023">press release</a>, the site, signed on a long-term lease, has an additional 26MW of potential capacity upside, subject to further infrastructure investment, which would take the total site to 50MW. <br><br>The site is expected to go live in Q3 2023 and will initially host 12 modular data centers (MDCs) and 7,056 miners.

Trader and art dealer Steven Hay has even suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-ordinal-collection">the government of El Salvador release an official Ordinal art collection</a> to potentially raise money to fund its proposed Bitcoin City or otherwise accelerate Bitcoin adoption.</p><p>Unfortunately, this suggestion seems to lack an on-the-ground Salvadoran perspective and, in my view, is a blatant attack on El Salvador’s Bitcoin objectives.</p><p>El Salvador turned to Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/stop-drinking-the-elites-kool-aid">because of the qualities that make it sovereign money</a>, one that is not beholden to foreign powers or organizations. While a couple of the leading value propositions for using Bitcoin in El Salvador are to attract private, foreign investment and to spur tourism, the promise of hard money that is unconfiscatable, uncensorable and resistant to manipulation is why El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender. </p><p>However, Ordinals do not provide any of the hard money benefits of Bitcoin.</p><h2>NFTs On Bitcoin Are As Bad As NFTs Elsewhere</h2><p>The Bitcoin community has seen recent, vivid examples demonstrating that NFTs are bad investments. </p><p>For example, a Malaysian investor who bought <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20">Jack Dorsey’s first tweet NFT</a> for $2.5 million <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bought-29-mln-nft-jack-dorsey-tweet-finds-few-takers-2022-04-14/">struggled to find bids when he later tried to sell it</a>. Even El Salvador President Nayib Bukele<a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1452160674856116229?lang=en"> appeared to recognize the lack of real value in NFTs</a> as he auctioned <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/1402507224916836352?s=u_a">his tweet announcing the country’s Bitcoin Law approval in its legislative assembly</a> — the NFT was never sold and Bukele did not pursue the endeavor any further.</p><p>Numerous <a href="https://twitter.com/nvk/status/1619667314944925697?s=20">maximalists</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arekkusudes/status/1650600273365336064?s=20">Salvadorans</a> have been discouraging Bitcoin NFTs because they believe that folks who get rug-pulled could suffer significant financial harm. For many of these critics, defending Bitcoin’s social layer and calling out potential scams is essential to keeping the Bitcoin network secure. </p><p>There are several key elements that critics consistently bring up, which could demonstrate that Bitcoin NFTs on the Ordinal protocol are grifts and no different than NFTs on other protocols. These are as follow:</p><ol><li>The hype around NFTs is arbitrarily assigning exaggerated values to things that are not inherently scarce.</li><li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/402PaymentReq/status/1621845134496210944?s=20">Ordinal protocol cannot actually track individual satoshis</a> as <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html#:~:text=Ordinals%20are%20a%20numbering%20scheme,tracking%20and%20transferring%20individual%20sats.">claimed by the creators and promoters of the protocol</a>.</li><li>The Bitcoin protocol is unaware of the inscriptions or Ordinals, so none of it is verifiable by the network.</li><li>There are debatable concerns on the impact of inscription activity on storage resources of node runners. </li><li>The NFTs scams are a significant distraction from the integrity of Bitcoin’s primary purpose.</li><li>Finally, the intellectual dishonesty that markets Ordinals as “art investment” that will increase in value over time.</li></ol><p>Taking the above elements into account, an El Salvador Ordinals buyer risks purchasing an expensive, low-quality, reproducible image that’s likely to decrease in value. While there is a valid argument that the marketplace will decide whether it wants such a digital product, critics point out that people should be aware of the inherent grift of the NFT space and the similarities to promotions of Ordinals.</p><p>To paraphrase the creator of <a href="https://timechaincalendar.com/en">Timechain Calendar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Meditation_Man">TC</a>, who has spoken on this topic in several Twitter Spaces conversations that I’ve heard, “A blockchain makes a very poor database. It only works in Bitcoin because it is only verifying the truth about Bitcoin transactions.” </p><p>Another Bitcoiner, <a href="https://twitter.com/HodlMagoo">Magoo</a>, has opined in similar Twitter Spaces that adding engineering complexity to the Bitcoin timechain or any software is congruent with increasing possible attack vectors. These attack vectors can appear not only in the network itself but also in the social layer. As such, Ordinals have the potential to manifest attack vectors in each of these layers. It has encouraged people to focus their energy on an activity that Bitcoin was not designed or optimized for.</p><h2>Ordinals Contradict Proof Of Work</h2><p>While the CEO of BTC Inc (which operates Bitcoin Magazine), <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey">David Bailey</a>, has argued that <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey/status/1626523168801189896">Bitcoin NFTs on the Ordinals protocol are compatible with Nakamoto consensus</a>, they are antithetical to Bitcoin because their marketing suggests that they will increase in value, and that violates the concept of proof of work. </p><p>In the same line of thought, Hay proposed that a government Ordinal collection would be all benefit and no risk, implying that it’s easy money — but the principles behind proof of work demand that money should not be easy to generate through natural law. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/saifedean">Saifedean Ammous</a> wrote about this topic in several sections of his book “The Bitcoin Standard,” emphasizing that creating hard money requires an effort to provide value and benefit to the market and society. Ordinals are a high-time-preference activity based on easy money and speculation; therefore, encouraging El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption acceleration by releasing an Ordinals collection is peak fiat mentality.</p><h2>Salvadorans Don’t Need Ordinals</h2><p>El Salvador has a rich pool of artistic talent, including musicians, actors, filmmakers, dancers, folklorists, writers, architects and visual artists. Those Bitcoiners eager to help the country with its adoption will do well to support the existing artist community by promoting them and paying for their crafts by using bitcoin. </p><p>As a starting point, Bitcoiners can go to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294476-d7126187-Reviews-Mercado_Nacional_de_Artesanias-San_Salvador_San_Salvador_Department.html">National Artisan Market</a>, where people can find paintings, indigo-dyed apparel, hammocks and sculptures. Bitcoiners can also provide opportunities to digital artists, such as graphic designers, through contracts for working on web projects, apps and in print, and they can support digital content creators by giving value-for-value tips for their published works.</p><p>Ultimately, Salvadorans are <a href="https://www.canal12.com.sv/noticia/principal-preocupacion-de-el-salvador-es-la-economia-segun-encuesta/">more concerned about improving their day-to-day situations</a> than collecting JPEGs on mobile phones. The everyday Salvadoran demands that their government focus on security, infrastructure, public transit, traffic, health and education. Therefore, issuing an NFT collection is far from what Salvadorans value.</p><p>Given that El Salvador has had <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-one-year-later">relatively positive success with its Bitcoin adoption</a>, it’s easy to forget that its current government had a rough start and faced much criticism with its formal Bitcoin adoption launch.</p><p>Many criticized the government’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-fixing-chivo-bitcoin-wallet">release of the Chivo wallet</a> over insufficient accompanying education and the technical challenges experienced by some users. The primary recipient for much of this negative feedback was not the government itself, but Bitcoin as a whole, thereby hindering Bitcoin adoption. </p><p>Heading into Bitcoin’s second anniversary as legal tender in El Salvador, some of the negative perceptions created around Bitcoin are finally beginning to fade. But if the government were to release a Bitcoin NFT collection, that would only rewind the progress made.</p><p>The government must not promote Ordinals or NFTs, as many perceive them as scams. El Salvador needs to generate confidence and trust, and when Ordinals, <a href="https://cryptomode.com/the-significant-decline-in-nft-marketplace-activity-shouldnt-surprise-anyone/">like NFT projects of the past</a>, inevitably crash, El Salvador cannot be associated with them. Unfortunately, any negative perception about Ordinals would lead to reputational damage for the country, which is precisely where the attacks on Bitcoin adoption continue. </p><h2>The Bitcoin Mission is Clear</h2><p>Despite being inundated with all of the Ordinal noise, it is refreshing to see folks like South Africa’s <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi">Bitcoin Ekasi</a> work toward the Bitcoin mission with absolute clarity. In a recent tweet, the Bitcoin Ekasi team said it is <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1647575965827047424?s=20">“not here to have fun” but to change the world</a>. There is a real chance of failure for groups like Bitcoin Ekasi due to these distractions from the primary mission of adopting the hardest money in the world. With that same level of clarity, El Salvador must remain undeterred from these attacks.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Jaime García</em><em>.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jonathan Buck, founder of JB &amp; GS Mining GmbH, a German bitcoin mining hosting company.</em></p><p>In April 2022, the Central African Republic (CAR) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">adopted bitcoin as legal tender</a>, becoming the second nation in history to do so. However, just a year later, <a href="https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/currency/digital-currencies/7956294/car-to-drop-crypto-as-legal-tender">the nation reversed its decision</a>. But what are the reasons behind <a href="https://www.jbgsmining.com/en/post/central-african-republic-drops-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">this failure in the CAR</a>?</p><h2>Challenging Economic Conditions</h2><p>The CAR, one of the poorest countries in the world, faces numerous obstacles, such as political instability, inadequate infrastructure and food shortages. </p><p><a href="https://www.wfp.org/countries/central-african-republic">In the 2018 Human Development Index, </a>the CAR ranked second to last, with around 79% of its 4.7 million residents living in poverty. More than three million people in the country <a href="https://www.concernusa.org/story/central-african-republic-crisis-explained/">are reported to require humanitarian assistance while more than 85% of the population lacks electricity</a>. </p><p>One of the significant barriers to the success of the Bitcoin project in the CAR was surely the country’s limited internet access. With only about <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=CF">10% percent of the population having access to the internet</a>, widespread adoption of digital currencies was highly unlikely.</p><p>While Bitcoin has been helping to bank the unbanked globally, the digital currency alone cannot solve all of a country's underlying infrastructure problems. And while Bitcoin can be resilient off the grid, the lack of basic amenities such as electricity and internet in CAR likely hindered the spread and usability of Bitcoin there.</p><h2>Skepticism And International Concern</h2><p>The introduction of bitcoin as legal tender in CAR was met with skepticism, partly due to the country’s close ties with Russia, raising suspicions about its potential plans to <a href="https://african.business/2022/10/technology-information/is-central-african-republics-crypto-push-linked-to-russia">use cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions</a>. </p><p>The United Nations also warned that developing countries like the CAR could <a href="https://www.globalgovernmentfintech.com/un-agency-warns-on-crypto-in-developing-nations/">face high risks and costs associated with cryptocurrencies</a>.</p><p>And, ultimately, the economic benefits promised by the proponents of Bitcoin in the CAR never materialized. Ambitious projects, such as building a “<a href="https://sango.org/#cryptoCitySection">Bitcoin city</a>,” failed or never began, further dampening enthusiasm for the digital currency experiment.</p><h2>A Larger Trend?</h2><p><br>Despite the disappointment in the CAR, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been gaining traction in other African countries. For example, countries such as Nigeria and South Africa have seen a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abubakarnurkhalil/2023/03/01/nigerian-election-and-naira-crisis-is-fueling-bitcoin-adoption/">significant increases in bitcoin adoption</a>, with millions of users now buying, selling and trading digital assets. In these countries, the growth of the cryptocurrency industry has been driven by factors such as the high inflation rate of local fiat currencies; an increasing number of young, tech-savvy individuals; and a growing number of businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method.</p><p>In the end, the failure of bitcoin as legal tender in the CAR can be attributed to the nation's challenging economic conditions, skepticism surrounding its motives, limited access to technology and unfulfilled peripheral promises. </p><p>But despite this failure, other African countries represent some of the world’s most promising, growing epicenters of Bitcoin adoption. If anything, this failure in the CAR highlights the importance of developed environments and good-faith intentions for the successful adoption of Bitcoin, at least for the first handful of countries that hope to be successful.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jonathan Buck.

    </figure><p>Oftentimes, when you hear about the “American dream,” you think of a heart-warming success story. The entrepreneur who made millions. Or the immigrant family that changed the trajectory for their children. And while these inspiring stories do exist, there are many others who came to America hoping for a better life only to be met with countless obstacles that hindered them from achieving their American dreams.</p><p>Modern-day monetary policy runs on fluctuating interest rates and inflation. Many people are not aware that the U.S. dollar, which was founded on a gold-reserve system, has not only been off of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/01/25/the-gold-standard-ended-50-years-ago-federal-debt-has-only-exploded-since/?sh=7286f7301e17">gold standard</a> for over 50 years, but is now “backed” by the United States military and <a href="https://faculty.georgetown.edu/imo3/petrod/define.htm">petrodollar</a>. The amount of control that the United States government has on those living in poverty is astronomical. Because of these limiting restrictions, among other factors, the American dream has become much harder to achieve. </p><p>However, Bitcoin can help change this negative cycle.</p><p>Natalie Brunell burst onto the Bitcoin scene in 2021. She was born in Poland and immigrated with her parents to America as a young child. Growing up with a family that was determined to build a new life in America, the value of hard work and a healthy amount of skepticism was ingrained into Brunell for as long as she can remember. </p><p>With over ten years of experience in the media sector, she took a risk and started her own <a href="https://talkingbitcoin.com/podcast">Bitcoin podcast</a>. Since then, <em>Coin Stories</em> has been wildly successful and influential in highlighting power players in the Bitcoin space. </p><p>Her story is inspiring and welcoming to anyone interested in getting started on their Bitcoin journeys. </p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what specifically drew you to it?</strong></p><p>I first learned about Bitcoin in 2016 from a group of friends while working as a local news reporter covering breaking and investigative stories in Sacramento, California. I didn’t understand Bitcoin’s technological innovation or the mission of Bitcoin’s proponents to address systemic issues in our financial system. In fact, I equated it back then to investing in stocks.</p><p>Luckily, I bought a little bit and held through my first bear market. I also pitched a story about Bitcoin to my news outlet and ended up reporting on a local Bitcoin ATM. I was fascinated by this emerging technology, but my station was not keen on covering more stories on it, so I let it go as a reporting assignment.</p><p>It wasn’t until a few years later when my mentor told me to read <a href="https://saifedean.com/tbs"><em>The Bitcoin Standard</em></a>&nbsp;that I began my journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Saifedean Ammous’s book changed my perspective on money and sparked my idea for the <em>Coin Stories</em> podcast, which ultimately changed my career and my life. </p><p>What drew me to Bitcoin was the idea of removing the state’s monopoly on money and creating an opportunity for our economy to be rebuilt on a sound monetary unit that is immune to manipulation. I envision a world where money is based on value rather than proximity to politics and power.</p><p><strong>What made you leave your traditional media job to pursue Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>Ever since I was a young girl, I aspired to become a broadcast journalist. My family immigrated from Poland to Chicago when I was five years old. My family always had the news on at home because the programming helped my parents learn to speak English and kept us informed about current events both overseas and in our new home country. My idol growing up was Barbara Walters.</p><p>I always believed in journalists as watchdogs, not government lap dogs. My parents grew up under a communist regime and were always skeptical of both central authority and media propaganda. I’m grateful for that upbringing because it caused me to question everything around me and made me a more determined reporter.</p><p>I spent more than ten years working in mainstream news media and became disillusioned by the increasing bias I saw on various networks. I was fortunate to be able to cover in-depth investigative pieces in my last TV correspondent position that were not politicized, but the industry around me was moving in the direction of partisanship, censorship of alternative views and prioritization of access to politicians rather than pursuing and demanding accountability.</p><p>When preparation meets opportunity, that’s “luck.” I had the communication skills and media training (preparation) and the market had a growing demand for knowledge (opportunity). Bitcoin offered me an opportunity to leave mainstream media in October 2021 to develop my podcast and promote Bitcoin education. I decided to bet on myself and see if I could build a business doing something I believed would ultimately impact the world more than my news reporting. I have never felt more fulfilled by what I do and I am propelled by a sense of duty to help people understand our financial system and the benefits of Bitcoin, a revolutionary fix for our money.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you (such as your close friends, etc.)?</strong></p><p>I respond with, “I know; I was there once, too.” Being skeptical and critical is a good thing, it means you’re not easily persuaded or sold on the latest fad. It means you think for yourself. That’s already a win. I try to meet the person where they are. One of my mentors, Jeff Booth, has an excellent question to pose to skeptics and newcomers to Bitcoin. That question is: “If technology is supposed to make things cheaper and easier to produce, why is the cost of living around us continually going up?”</p><p>It’s a simple but powerful question that drives at the heart of the problem in our monetary system: inflation.</p><p>Every year, it gets more and more difficult to afford a home, a college education and retirement. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and we’re all working harder for currencies that are worth less and less. This isn’t a natural phenomenon of our existence. It is the synthetic outcome of the state monopoly on money, and it impacts every aspect of our lives.</p><p>When I do engage with friends on the topic of Bitcoin, I encourage them to note the various crises they're hearing and reading about, or perhaps even experiencing directly. Most people have a sense that things are really challenging at the moment, that we seem to be moving in the wrong direction. Once that groundwork is laid, I can spark their curiosity about why Bitcoin offers such a powerful alternative.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>I released the first episodes of my podcast at the Bitcoin 2021 conference. I attended the event on a media pass and brought my best friend, Paula, along for company because I didn’t know anyone personally in Bitcoin. My intention was to meet fellow Bitcoiners and try to ask individuals I admired to appear on the show, with no intention of building a career in the space.</p><p>I had never attended industry conferences and was taken aback by the size and number of attendees. But it was hard not to notice a massive gender gap in that audience. In fact, nowhere was it more apparent than when you looked at any conference restroom area: there would be a queue of men stretching around a corner on one side, and a vast, empty expanse on the women’s side. </p><p>I began to think more deeply about why women were so underrepresented in this industry. As we know, finance, engineering and computer science are all male-dominated fields that organically intersect with Bitcoin, so it makes sense that a male audience would discover this amazing technology before a female audience. Social media also tends to perpetuate a "crypto bro culture" that obscures the global community of Bitcoin pioneers doing brilliant, wholehearted work. Bitcoin is an inherently multifaceted technology that takes time and effort to understand, and even requires some reeducation around money in general. I believe that all newcomers to Bitcoin, and women in particular, including my closest friends, who are already busy industry leaders and smart investors, need trusted and approachable guides to help navigate around these barriers.</p><p>I saw this imbalance as an opportunity to grow the space and connect with these newcomers. Ever since that first conference, I have been determined to become a resource for ordinary working people, and especially women, to learn more about Bitcoin and how our global economy works. </p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone. Bitcoin is a tool of freedom and prosperity for every gender, age, race, language, cultural background, and political affiliation. Bitcoin levels the playing field and can bring us all together in cooperation. I am passionate about educating other women about Bitcoin because I want them to have a seat at the table of this financial revolution and empower themselves and their families for the long run. We often feel the most comfortable learning from and engaging with people who look and sound like us. If I can serve as a welcoming voice for new women in the Bitcoin space, I see it as an honor. I love being a woman, I love learning from and connecting with other women, and I am so proud to be a woman in Bitcoin. Discovering Bitcoin is incredibly empowering, and we need to continue building a supportive, inquisitive community for that journey.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

According to <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-04-28-Introducing-Crypto-Transfers-for-Venmo-Customers">the announcement</a>, more than 50% of its cryptocurrency-using customers chose Venmo due to its safety, security and ease of use, while more than 74% of customers have continued to hold their cryptocurrency in their Venmo account over the past year.</p><p>The transfer process is designed to be simple and can be done in a few steps via the Venmo app. Customers can navigate to the Crypto tab, view their assets, tap the Transfer arrows and choose to send bitcoin to a Venmo account, or by entering a recipient’s wallet address to send to PayPal or another external wallet. Customers can also tap Receive to display their unique bitcoin address QR code, which can be shared with other people.</p><p>Venmo is quick to note that cryptocurrency transfers cannot be canceled or reversed, which is something that can be difficult for new Bitcoin users to get used to, but eliminates chargebacks and other complications presented by fiat rails. </p><p>“Crypto transfers will be rolling out to Venmo customers over the coming weeks starting in May 2023,” Venmo said in a press release. “We’re excited to connect Venmo’s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead.”</p><p>Being one of the largest mobile finance applications in the United States and a first step into bitcoin for many, this update now introduces users to the ability to take self-custody of their bitcoin, an <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-self-custody-and-financial-sovereignty">essential step in realizing the full properties bitcoin</a> entails.

Some perceived the move as a mere extension of the NFT culture, which incentivizes making quick money on pump-and-dump schemes.</p><p>But this controversy has now sparked new debates. Regardless of our differences of opinion on “NFTs on Bitcoin,” the implementation of Ordinals is providing us with an opportunity for education. It helps us deeply examine Bitcoin's core values and our roles in the network.</p><p>What is Bitcoin? What is it meant for? Bitcoin was invented as peer-to-peer digital cash. In its white paper, its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">described</a> Bitcoin as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.”</p><p>Bitcoin’s trust-minimized transactions enable censorship resistance. Many of those who criticize Ordinals are Bitcoin loyalists. They see Bitcoin’s base layer as something to be used strictly to settle monetary transactions and they oppose any move to extend beyond this original use case.</p><p>Also, concerns have been raised by Ordinal critics regarding these non-monetary transactions taking up Bitcoin’s limited block space, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-records-largest-mined-block-to-date-4-mb-block-containing-nft-causes-unease-among-small-block-supporters/">as inscriptions can be large files</a>. Some are worried that an increased cost of running a full node could reduce the ability for users to participate in this network and maintain Bitcoin's decentralization.</p><p>(Additional possible implications and concerns around inscriptions are detailed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-implications-of-bitcoin-inscriptions">here</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space?utm_source=Bitcoin+Magazine&amp;utm_campaign=c63022d3c9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2023_02_27_07_32&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f7d45fbb67-c63022d3c9-43389605&amp;mc_cid=c63022d3c9&amp;mc_eid=20005d9db2">here</a>.) </p><p>So, is using Bitcoin’s foundation outside of monetary transactions bad or harmful for Bitcoin?</p><p>There is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">nothing within the Ordinal protocol that violates Bitcoin’s specified consensus</a>. Also, there are no rules that restrict users to monetary transactions. Bitcoin is permissionless in that everyone is allowed to use it in a way that they wish to use it. This includes adding data to transactions and using them as a database for JPEGs. As some have pointed out, this isn’t at all that new:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1619692068519149568"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>But just because we can do it, should we do it or encourage others to do it? </p><p>Now, this question takes us into a moral dimension. And exploring it might help us understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals.</p><h2>Impulse For Creation </h2><p>Technically, Ordinals are built on Bitcoin, working within its consensus rules. So, they can be seen as a part of the Bitcoin project. But is this true? Let’s examine. </p><p>All technologies are created by human beings, with a vision and philosophy behind them. The question we should ask is whether the impulse that led to the creation of Ordinals aligns with Bitcoin philosophy, or diverges from it. </p><p>In an interview with CoinDesk, Rodarmor <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/bitcoin-community-erupts-in-existential-debate-over-nft-project-ordinals/">spoke about</a> the vision behind Ordinals. He said that he wished it to be a fun art project and also something that can encourage people to learn more about Bitcoin. For instance, he made the point that, in order to use Ordinals, users are required to run their own full nodes and suggested that this would help people get interested in doing so, which would be good for Bitcoin.</p><p>Rodarmor also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/ordinals-creator-views-his-bitcoin-centric-creation-as-digital-artifacts-not-just-nfts/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKPFWLeMiAfRdYa7lSKXnsMABHcmKnbZXRv_jvdSxtToI61pPpBLF80USOl1yzLJltWsncHNZAwZdPr3fXB1Qg7Hv8k9ICJT83XXhW7l5mEzDrhwU_A9VLIGQwaOva90sh8bmJay8TG8yUj4a4-tePySR4Es50-GWmqfJORkw6vZ#:~:text=Ordinals%2C%20a%20Bitcoin%2Dbased%20NFT,no%20idea%20it%20would%20explode.">noted</a> that, with the creation of Ordinals, he tried to fulfill an unmet market demand from NFT collectors, and it seems that this playful way of experimenting on Bitcoin did respond to those desires. The project has attracted many users, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ordinal-inscriptions-surpass-1-million-mark-miners-collect-4-7m-in-fees-as-bitcoin-nft-trend-continues/">producing</a> over one million inscriptions incorporated into transactions less than three months after its debut.</p><p>Certainly, market demands drive the development of technology. Many protocols and apps were created to please and satisfy the desires of consumers. Yet, there was something other than simple commercial interests at work behind the invention of Bitcoin.</p><p>The impulse for Bitcoin didn’t come from market demand. It arose somewhere else, outside of business and profit motives. Bitcoin is the holy grail of cypherpunks, a community of activists connected by ​​an<a href="https://lists.cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/"> electronic mailing list</a> who had long advocated for free speech and privacy protected by the use of strong cryptography. </p><h2>The Vision Of The Cypherpunks</h2><p>Who are the cypherpunks? In his 2015 essay, titled “The Moral Character Of Cryptographic Work,” Phillip Rogaway, a professor of computer science, <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf">described</a> them as “cryptographers with ethics,” noting that they brought major shifts in the approach to scientific work that had previously been detached politically and divorced from the moral dimension.</p><p>Cypherpunks aim to actively develop technology in a way that is aligned with human values and priorities. For instance, Rogaway regarded Julian Assange as a representative of the value of cypherpunks and listed WikiLeaks as an example of the projects that revitalized the moral impulse in cryptographic work.</p><p>Rogaway <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf">articulated</a> the philosophy that informs their work:</p><blockquote><p>“Cypherpunk cryptography has been described as <em>crypto with an attitude</em>. But it is much more than that, for, more than anything else, what the cypherpunks wanted was crypto with <em>values</em>. And values, deeply felt and deeply embedded into our work, is what the cryptographic community needs most. And perhaps a dose of that cypherpunk verve.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a part of the free software movement. It is guided by a vision of technology which can empower individuals and change the world. Richard Stallman, the godfather of the GNU/Linux operating system, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m37s">defined</a> free software as “free” in the sense of freedom, “libre” in French, and not in terms of price; software that respects users’ freedom.</p><p>At the core of Bitcoin is this value of individual freedom. It is this value that one cannot put a price tag on, that has been repeatedly threatened. </p><p>We have seen that during <a href="https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained">the block size debate</a> (centered on disagreements around the best methods of scaling for Bitcoin) that took place between 2015 and 2017. The proponents for a larger block size argued that they wanted Bitcoin to become a payments network. They wanted it to become faster, with large transaction volumes that could compete with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. As a series of proposals to change Bitcoin’s consensus emerged over time, the conflict <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-first-major-bitcoin-civil-war">quickly escalated into a civil war</a>.</p><p>During the heat of this scaling dispute, Amir Taaki, who was one of the first developers to work on Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7rXKS_SiVE&amp;t=3785s">recognized</a> that this divide was really based on a difference in values. He pointed out that the efforts to push large block sizes were a hijacking of Bitcoin's original vision, rooted in ethics. </p><h2>Bringing Love Into Computing</h2><p>Bitcoin was created by the commitment of cypherpunks to their fellow human beings — what they saw as their moral obligation to secure the right of liberty for all. With the birth of Bitcoin, love was brought into computing. This love as a moral force began to revitalize the market, moving capital dynamically toward the emancipation of humanity.</p><p>From Cypriots to Argentinians, bitcoin <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/22/the-blockchain-and-the-rise-of-networked-trust/">has become</a> a safe haven for those whose money has been debased by rampant hyperinflation and/or bank deposit confiscation. While attacks on journalists and whistleblowers intensify in many countries, Bitcoin <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/08/20/wikileaks-bypasses-financial-blockade-with-bitcoin/?sh=468e46997202">offers</a> a form of asylum for <a href="http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150323/1019901312.html">dissidents of the West</a>. </p><p>Bitcoin is freedom money. Yellow Vest protesters occupying the streets of Paris <a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@cryptoewp/yellow-vests-and-buy-bitcoin">recognized</a> Bitcoin as a critical linchpin for their financial revolution. When the government became authoritarian, Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-fueled-canada-trucker-convoy">provided</a> a rail for the Canadian trucker “Freedom Convoy” to continue its non-violent, civil disobedience in the fight against medical mandates.</p><p>And now, a nation state has joined this currency of resistance. In September 2021, El Salvador <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034838909/bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-tender-official-currency-cryptocurrency">made bitcoin legal tender</a>. Led by President Nayib Bukele and his policy of economic liberty, a small, impoverished nation with a <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">population of about 6.5 million</a> began to liberate itself from the dictatorship of the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Now, a new game is on that is much more fun and grand than the one played by the new kids on the block with their pokémon cards. By challenging the banking monopoly, Bukele opened up a free market contest, in which Salvadorans can now actively engage in taking back a future that had been stolen from them. </p><p>As the economy is being regenerated, human beings come alive. Bitcoin now inspires our love for creation. With the resurgence of arts and freedom of expression, we are now seeing a new renaissance. Beauty and magnificence that are demonstrated by ordinary people now extend beyond galleries of digital art collectibles and auction rooms. This is now reviving the culture that can transform our society. </p><h2>The Value Of Freedom</h2><figure>

Over the 14 years of its existence, the heart of the Bitcoin network, beating every 10 minutes, has continued welcoming newcomers, regardless of their backgrounds, religions, nationalities, genders or political views.</p><p>​​This heart that preserves everyone’s freedom is open to everyone. It does not dictate how Bitcoin’s base layer should be used and what content should belong there. </p><p>The creation of Ordinals has brought our attention to the non-conventional ways that we can use Bitcoin. We can pay for the available block space and use it as storage for arbitrary files, the function that could be served by other trust-minimized systems, such as <a href="https://opentimestamps.org/">OpenTimestamps</a>. Or we can choose to hold this scarce space for monetary transactions only.</p><p>Nakamoto paid homage to the sacred heart of Bitcoin that embraces each, single person. By spending tireless hours engaging in his or her labor of love, he or she paid for the whole of humanity and reserved this precious tiny space that keeps us all free. </p><p>Inspired by this selfless act of this mysterious creator, developers joined hands to ensure everyone’s access to this sanctuary. Some then became devotees of liberty. Bitcoin Maximalists remain vigilant, ready to throw out money changers who are trying to enter this temple, from shitcoiners to random JPEG posters.</p><p>We all are given freedom as our intrinsic value when we are born. This value of freedom is priceless. It cannot be secured by economic incentives alone. It demands the conscience of each person and his or her principles to defend it.</p><p>Cypherpunks write code. Can we sovereign individuals uphold their ideal and share this gift of liberty as the unalienable right of all people? </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nozomi Hayase.

    </figure><p><a href="https://preturnio.com/">Preturnio</a>, a full-text search engine for the Bitcoin blockchain, has been introduced, allowing users to scan for Bitcoin transactions that include readable text.</p><p>Preturnio is a platform that allows for the search of plain text within any coinbase transaction, text-based ordinal inscription or OP_RETURN script since the genesis block. All data in the Bitcoin blockchain is stored natively in hexadecimal format, and Preturnio offers search results that are converted to a readable format. OP_RETURN is a unique opcode in the Bitcoin scripting language that enables data to be embedded in a transaction output without the need to spend any bitcoin. <br><br>This was added to the Bitcoin protocol in 2014, primarily to allow for the creation of simple, low-cost and secure timestamping services. OP_RETURN has been useful in various applications, including digital signatures, notarization and proof of ownership. The recently launched <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">Ordinals</a> project has created a significant debate on the topic of immutable data time stamped onto Bitcoin. </p><p>“Regardless of where you stand on this issue,” the <a href="https://preturnio.com/docs">docs page</a> of the website states, “the fact remains that there is a ton of plain text buried in the Bitcoin blockchain so Preturnio was created to make searching for this text easier and more enjoyable.”</p><p>Preturnio searches in three areas where plain text can be found quickly: inside a coinbase transaction, inside an OP_RETURN script, and inside a text or HTML based ordinal inscription. Preturnio searches every block mined since the genesis block to locate a match inside a transaction for the text/pattern the user is looking for. The website offers various search options, with the interface designed to be as user-friendly as possible, according to the docs page. Users simply enter the text they are looking for and click the search icon or press ENTER. They can search for a single word, a phrase or just about any set of characters.</p><p>The Preturnio docs include search examples. The platform offers different types of searches, including searching for a single word or a phrase. Preturnio will return results for any transaction that contains that phrase or part of it. To match on an exact phrase, enclose the query in double quotes (“”). The website only does a literal search when enclosed in these quotes. “This is important to remember,” the website adds. “For search phrases with more than one word, Preturnio will only return for transactions with all words in the phrase - if a transaction contains one of the phrase words but not all, it won't be included in the search results.”</p><p>Preturnio aims to offer simple and effective search features that will make finding the right information embedded into Bitcoin faster and more convenient.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNDAxMTQ0NTc1MDc1ODcz/border-wallets-seed-phrase-recovery-top-photo.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Insight Honed Since $5 BTC, Tuur Demeester Is Ready For Bitcoin 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tuur Demeester, a macroeconomic analyst who has offered insight into Bitcoin since 2012, will bring his unique insight to Bitcoin 2023.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/tuur-demeester-analysis-at-bitcoin-2023</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/tuur-demeester-analysis-at-bitcoin-2023</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tuur Demeester]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 14:23:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NTQ3MTU5MDIzODU0NTk4/tuur-demeester-1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Tuur Demeester, a macroeconomic analyst who has offered insight into Bitcoin since 2012, will bring his unique insight to Bitcoin 2023.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>Tuur Demeester has a self-described “out of the box” approach to macroeconomic analysis, and it’s one that has made his insight into Bitcoin’s unprecedented potential sought after by institutions (in 2021, Demeester’s bitcoin alpha fund Adamant Capital was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockstream-to-launch-finance-division">sold to Blockstream, where he is now an advisor</a>) as well as individuals (Demeester’s is ranked as the <a href="https://hive.one/c/bitcoin">third “best Bitcoin Twitter account to follow”</a> by social media analyst Hive.One).</p><p>Combining deep research into historical patterns, an academically-rigorous approach and a willingness to embrace new innovation, Demeester’s outlook on how Bitcoin fits into our wider world has been remarkable for its consistency and prescience for more than a decade.</p><p>He first recommended BTC as an investment to readers of his newsletter in 2012, when it was priced at $5. In 2013 (with <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/bitcoin+price+june+2013">bitcoin priced around $100</a>), <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/interview-with-tuur-demeester-1371692092">he told Bitcoin Magazine</a>:</p><p>“I think bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies are the greatest investment opportunity of our day and age. First of all because bitcoin has all the qualities to make for an ideal money, to a greater extent than any digital or tangible commodity on the planet. Second, in contrast with traditional fiat money, bitcoin is designed for the internet; it’s open source, it’s mobile, fast, and it allows for personal privacy. Third, because we are approaching a bankruptcy event in the developed economies, both in banks and governments, I think that bitcoin, as a discrete and nonconfiscatable currency, will benefit greatly from the capital flight that will ensue.”</p><p>As more people around the world have realized Demeester is right about this nascent digital currency, his own perspective has continued to grow. In the introductory note to Adamant’s landmark research paper from 2019, “<a href="https://casebitcoin.com/docs/TheBitcoinReformation_TuurDemeester.pdf">The Bitcoin Reformation</a>,” Demeester made the case that bitcoin was not merely a new kind of money, but represented a fundamental shift with few precedents in history.</p><p>“In the past I’ve drawn parallels between bitcoin and the early petroleum industry, the search engine wars, the domain name markets, the growth of P2P file sharing, and internet protocols,” he explained. “But I kept feeling that I was failing to fundamentally grasp the magnitude of the epoch in which bitcoin functions as a catalyst. It wasn’t until I studied the era around the Protestant Reformation that I felt I’d found a potential blueprint of sufficient scope.”</p><p>Demeester continues to develop one of the most sought-after perspectives in Bitcoin and now he’s preparing to share that perspective at the upcoming Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami.</p><p>“I have a new report, ‘<a href="https://unchained.com/how-to-position-bitcoin-boom">How To Position For The Bitcoin Boom</a>,’ which I’m happy to talk about in Miami,” he told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview about the event. “I can’t say much as to the content right now, but rest assured it will be bullish on bitcoin. In general, my aim is always to inspire people to think for themselves by providing good source information and perspectives that they hadn’t considered before.”</p><p>Of course, today’s global, macroeconomic climate is one that will produce a lot of compelling Bitcoin content at the largest annual event dedicated to showcasing it. And this year is one that is bringing some of Demeester’s earliest insights about Bitcoin to fruition.</p><p>“It’s hard to predict the very short term, but my view for 2023 is that quantitative easing will make a comeback, and hence that we’ll see a surge of new inflation, in particular in rising commodity prices,” he said. “That is enormously bullish for bitcoin, because it’s one of the few true inflation hedges out there.”</p><p>The event will also be a chance to reflect on the progress Bitcoin is making as a technology, independent of BTC’s value relative to fiat currency or the erosion of the legacy financial system. With an outlook that has experienced numerous bear and bull cycles, Demeester is optimistic about how the current environment will produce more advanced and resilient Bitcoin projects.</p><p>“In bear markets, developers, entrepreneurs, politicians and other Bitcoin actors tend to take their time working on projects because they know that announcements — no matter how impressive — will generally see very little interest,” Demeester said. “I expect a huge amount of exciting announcements to come out in 2023, even though I can’t yet predict where exactly they will come from. I’m expecting serious progress in nation-state adoption, in Lightning technology, in bitcoin mining and in the use of bitcoin as a financial performance benchmark, and in bitcoin-backed mortgages.”</p><p>Finally, Demeester — a veteran of Bitcoin events, big and small, in bear markets and bull markets — is looking forward to checking in with the Bitcoin 2023 attendees who he’s known throughout his long and expansive career in the space, as well as meeting the new ones who will help take that journey into the future.</p><p>“I look forward to catching up with friends, some of whom I haven’t met in a long time, and also of course to meet new people,” Demeester concluded. “Bitcoin conferences like Bitcoin 2023 are so fun because they gather Bitcoin people from all around the world together in one place.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NTQ3MTU5MDIzODU0NTk4/tuur-demeester-1.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners Releases Venture Industry’s First Bitcoin-Native Startup Ecosystem Research]]></title><description><![CDATA[The report examines the growth of the industry and highlights the discrepancy between bitcoin’s dominance and the level of investment bitcoin startups receive.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tvp-releases-venture-industrys-first-bitcoin-startup-ecosystem-research</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tvp-releases-venture-industrys-first-bitcoin-startup-ecosystem-research</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Startups]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[VC]]></category><category><![CDATA[Venture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzYwODg2MzE2MTE1MzQ4/draper-moon-rocket-bitcoin-studio-demo-pitch.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The report examines the growth of the industry and highlights the discrepancy between bitcoin’s dominance and the level of investment bitcoin startups receive.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a> (TVP), an Austin-based venture capital firm focused on Bitcoin, has released the venture industry's first Bitcoin-native startup ecosystem research.

The report also highlighted the misallocation of capital for Bitcoin startups and the gap in institutional venture capital for founders focused on the Bitcoin tech stack and ecosystem.</p><p>Christopher Calicott, TVP’s managing director and founding partner, commented in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine that “Bitcoin — the first, best, and only truly decentralized ‘crypto’ asset — is becoming a platform at an accelerating pace. Despite its consistent market capitalization dominance, venture capital into Bitcoin startups in 2022 only represented about 1.3% of invested capital sector wide. TVP intends to change that.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Hongumart, a frontline healthcare worker.</em></p><p>Bitcoin is often praised for its innovative design, its resistance to censorship and corruption and its potential to revolutionize the global financial system. </p><p>But beyond these practical aspects, Bitcoin also has a deeper philosophical dimension. In this vein, Bitcoin can be seen as an expression of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics">pure mathematics</a>," a manifestation of the beauty and elegance of mathematical logic and principles. </p><p>Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independent of any real-world applications. Pure mathematicians are interested in logic, basic principles and the properties and structures of abstract objects, and their findings may originate from practical problems or be put to use for practical solutions, but they are working from a more philosophical viewpoint than applied mathematicians are.</p><p>One way that Bitcoin expresses pure math is through its use of algorithms and protocols. Bitcoin relies on a set of rules and procedures that are defined by mathematical equations and functions. These rules and procedures govern how transactions are validated, how new bitcoin are created, how the network reaches consensus and how the system adapts to changing conditions. These algorithms and protocols are transparent, deterministic and verifiable. They ensure that Bitcoin operates in a consistent and predictable manner, regardless of human intervention or manipulation and are ultimately independent of any specific real-world environments or attempts at disruption. </p><p>Another way that Bitcoin expresses pure math is through its use of cryptography. Cryptography is the science of encoding and decoding information using math and it is considered by many to be one of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/about-pure-math/what-is-pure-math#:~:text=Finance%20and%20cryptography%20are%20current,is%20applied%20in%20significant%20ways.">most powerful applications for pure mathematics</a>. Bitcoin uses cryptography to protect the privacy and security of its users and their transactions. For example, Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography to enable users to generate unique digital signatures that prove their ownership of their bitcoin. It also uses hash functions to create cryptographic puzzles that miners have to solve in order to add new blocks to the blockchain. These cryptographic methods are based on well-established mathematical theories and assumptions.</p><p>Bitcoin is more than just a currency or a technology. While it is essentially open-source software, its application of pure mathematics also makes it a form of art and expression that showcases the beauty and power of this philosophical field.</p><p>By using mathematical logic and principles to create a decentralized and secure system, Bitcoin demonstrates how mathematical concepts developed purely for their philosophical merits can be applied to solve real-world problems and challenges. By using mathematical techniques and methods to protect the privacy and security of its users, Bitcoin shows how math can be used to enhance human rights and freedoms. By using mathematical symbols and representations to encode and manipulate information, Bitcoin reveals how math can be used to communicate and create meaning. </p><p>Bitcoin is an expression of pure mathematics that appeals to both the rational and the aesthetic aspects of human nature. It challenges us to think critically and creatively about the nature and role of money, information and trust in our society. It invites us to appreciate the beauty and elegance of mathematical logic and principles that underlie its design and operation. It inspires us to explore the possibilities and potentials of pure math in our world.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Hongumart.

Bitcoin might be most closely related to the Fedwire Funds Service which only settles about 200 million transactions per year compared to Bitcoin’s trailing 1-year figure of 98.5 million transactions.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1540011820332769281"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1540011820332769281">Link to embedded tweet.</a></em></p><p>As it stands today, the Bitcoin network is on pace to settle $3.5 trillion worth of change-adjusted value over the course of 2023, for costs of just $198 million, an equivalent fee rate of 0.006% for the average transaction. While average transaction costs are obviously skewed by the largest transfers in the data set, we can look at the median transaction settlement value and account for the median transaction fee, and still see that on-chain bitcoin transactions are a tremendously efficient way to send and receive value in a trustless manner over the internet.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Despite bitcoin’s extreme efficiencies as a global immutable settlement network, it remained unideal for minuscule and instantaneous transfers, as the 10-minute block interval target adds a latency to the settlement of transactions. This is okay for large sums of money, evidenced by the incumbent financial system, where net settlement of funds between financial intermediaries often don’t finalize for days or weeks on end — think MasterCard or Visa settling their books on a net basis with a banking institution like JPMorgan. </p><p>However, the need for a sound internet money that could settle instantaneously for nearly no cost was still there. With the advent of the Lightning Network, the latency involved with sending a bitcoin transaction, particularly for micropayment settlements, has all but vanished. This has brought about a whole new use case for bitcoin, as the monetary medium is now finding itself being inserted into the tech stacks of web applications and services across the globe.</p><p>As a refresher and overly simplified description, the Lightning Network works by node runners doing an on-chain transaction to open up payment channels with other nodes. This adds liquidity to the network and creates a network of channels when enough users open channels to one another. Lightning payments are sent from one node and hop across other nodes who have enough liquidity in their channels until the payment reaches its intended destination.</p><p>By doing one on-chain payment to open a channel, funds on the Lightning Network are able to move with less friction and settle without waiting for 10-minute periods between blocks for each transaction, until the channel gets closed with another on-chain transaction. These channels allow for lower fees as payments only pay to hop across nodes that have liquidity in their channels.</p><p>With a refresher on the technical workings out of the way, let’s take a look at the costs of the Bitcoin settlement stack compared to current retail settlement options like credit cards and focus on the massive efficiency gains of the Lightning Network in particular. Shown below, we compare the upper- and lower-bound costs of legacy payment processors to the median settlement cost of a Bitcoin on-chain transaction — median fee paid divided by median transaction volume — and the Lightning median fee rate percentage for sending the equivalent of 1 BTC. </p><p>We acknowledge that the comparison between the median cost of a bitcoin on-chain transaction to legacy payment processing costs isn’t quite an apples-to-apples comparison because credit card processors allow for near instantaneous payments to be made (but not settled!). That being said, this is where the vast efficiencies of the Lightning Network come into play.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The two charts above demonstrate how much more cheaply the Lightning Network is settling payments when compared to credit card processors.</p><p>Yes, legacy payment processors facilitate the transfer of trillions of dollars a year, which dwarfs the Lightning Network’s settlement volume. As a side note, it isn’t possible to quantify the transfer volume of Lightning like it is with on-chain transactions. Given the relative size of the Lightning Network, it is vital to remember that the network has continued to grow exponentially, while facilitating instantaneous transfer for near-to-no cost, all the while growing ever more connected. </p><p>In addition to cheaper settlement, the Lightning Network is also facilitating payments 60,000% to 140,000% more efficiently than credit cards.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While it may be a bit of a stretch to directly compare the median lightning payment fee to that of a multinational credit card processing firm, particularly given the minuscule micropayments of many Lightning transactions, the nature of public Lightning channels and transactions means that this technology is very capable of scaling to accommodate much larger transactions if/when needed. There is already indirect evidence of this happening with the average size of public channels pushing all-time highs in both BTC and USD terms at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Final Note:</h3><p>First enabled by the Segwit soft fork in 2017, the Lightning Network has gone from a conceptual idea to a flourishing global ecosystem in the span of less than six years. Reminiscent of the early days of the internet, Lighting Network nodes and user participation has gone from niche hyper-technical software developers to the edge of mainstream adoption in a short amount of time.</p><p>While the Lightning Network may not be headline news, the technology enabled by Lightning — the ability to direct a digitally native bearer asset in a trustless manner across the internet for nearly no cost — is an extremely significant development in the history of payment networks, and it is the first to do so in an open and decentralized manner. </p><p>We are extremely bullish on the continued development and adoption of the Lightning Network, and think that the advent of a common open-standard for sending and receiving internet-native value instantaneously for extremely low costs may be the killer app that brings bitcoin to a billion people.</p><p>It’s helpful to compare the early days of the internet to where Bitcoin is in its lifecycle. Looking at the growth of the two networks below can give us a small glimpse into where Bitcoin and Lightning may be heading as adoption increases.</p><p>How the internet started:</p><figure>

The cases could potentially have major impacts on the future of Bitcoin and open-source software development.&nbsp;</p><p>Eleven of the developers being supported by the Fund will file their defense on April 26. <em>Tulip Trading Limited v. Bitcoin Association For BSV &amp; Others</em>, in which the developers are named, stems from an alleged hack in February 2020 that resulted in the loss of 111,000 bitcoin that Wright claims to own. In February 2021, Tulip Trading issued a “Letter Before Action” announcing its intention to take legal action against certain Bitcoin developers to recover the allegedly lost bitcoin.</p><p>Should the UK courts rule in Tulip Trading’s favor, open-source developers could be considered fiduciaries to users of software that they have contributed to, even in projects without any formal assumption of duty or compensation for costs and associated risks.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rebel Money, a visual artist who focuses on Bitcoin themes and advocates for other artists in the space.</em></p><p>For centuries, the traditional art market has been dominated by established auction houses and galleries, where works of art are sold for millions of dollars. Despite its longevity, the art market has been criticized for its opaqueness, exclusivity and the difficulties faced by new collectors when navigating its intricacies. In fact, it has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/art-market-we-know-could-thing-past-anders-cederholm-nielsen/">been described as</a> "the most corrupt industry in the world." </p><p>Given that Bitcoin was designed to counter large, corrupt monetary policies, many wonder if it can also disrupt the shady and unscrupulous practices of the art world. If so, how might Bitcoin achieve this transformation?</p><h2>Closed Source</h2><p>From an artist's perspective in the traditional art world, comprehending the intricate economics of selling their artwork and where the funds end up is a daunting task. Unfortunately, artists are often left in the dark about the financial aspects of their craft, which can be disheartening and even exploitative. </p><p>There appears to be a deliberate effort to infantilize the artists, depriving them of a comprehensive understanding of the financial transactions involving their work, and rendering them vulnerable to manipulation by powerful intermediaries in the industry. Art galleries are not immune to such practices, as they take advantage of the complex processes involved in the purchase of artworks, which typically requires the involvement of multiple intermediaries such as banks, auction houses and art dealers. </p><p>This can create a sort of sleight of hand, making it easier for galleries to obscure the actual sale value of artwork, and resulting in the artist being kept in the dark about the true value of their work. </p><p>The murky economic model applies not just to artists but also for new collectors trying to navigate the market. Large galleries often change prices depending on who they are selling to, which can make it difficult for new collectors to acquire pieces. This tactic allows galleries to maintain control over who owns the art, limit the supply and ensure that the art will not end up in the secondary market, leading to a <a href="https://mises.org/wire/cantillon-effects-why-inflation-helps-some-and-hurts-others">Cantillon-style effect</a>.</p><p>In addition to the challenges faced by new collectors, museums and prestigious collectors often have access to special work and can pay less for pieces. Having their names associated with certain pieces can also boost the value of the artwork. For example, the Guggenheim has <a href="https://qz.com/103091/high-end-art-is-one-of-the-most-manipulated-markets-in-the-world">reportedly received discounts of 30% or more</a> for certain pieces because of their association with the museum. </p><p>These pricing tactics and exclusivity practices can leave new collectors feeling frustrated and unable to acquire pieces, no matter the cost. Even celebrities like Daniel Radcliffe, known for his role in the “Harry Potter” movies, have been turned down when trying to acquire pieces. <a href="https://observer.com/2012/02/harry-potter-and-the-boring-art-fair-story/">Radcliffe told Time Out London</a> that, in 2012, he attempted to purchase a Jim Hodges piece but was told, "No, we’re waiting for a more prestigious collector to take that."</p><p>While it may be tempting to assume that large auctions at industry giants such as Sotheby's or Christie's are fair and open, the reality is that the price of art at auction can still be manipulated. Despite the seemingly-transparent nature of auctions, there are still ways for insiders to control the outcomes. One example is the practice of "<a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-auction-house-buzzwords-new-collectors">chandelier bidding</a>," where an auctioneer takes extra phantom bids from non-existent bidders in order to artificially inflate the price of a piece. This technique is used to create an illusion of competition, driving up the price and creating a sense of urgency among bidders. In addition to chandelier bidding, collectors may also bid on lots simply to raise the bidding temperature, even if they have no real interest in the accompanying piece, in order to protect the value of their existing collection. </p><p>As a result, auction prices may not always reflect the true market rates, and may instead be influenced by these behind-the-scenes tactics.</p><h2>Can Bitcoin Fix This?</h2><p>The use of Bitcoin in the art world has the potential to address the issues of corruption and inequality in the industry. Bitcoin offers a more efficient and transparent transaction mechanism, eliminating the need for multiple intermediaries and enabling immediate payment for artists after the sale of their artwork.</p><p>However, the human layer of Bitcoin adoption in the art world is complex. While Bitcoin has the potential to be a powerful tool for good, it can also be misused by those with malicious intentions. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has the ability to incentivize ethical behavior in the art world. As Bitcoin is not subject to inflationary pressures, it reduces the exploitation of artists in revenue sharing and eliminates the need for potentially-questionable practices.</p><p>Bitcoin auction sites such as <a href="https://scarce.city/">Scarce.City</a> and <a href="https://plebeian.market/">Plebeian Market</a> have recognized the gap in the market and are leveraging Bitcoin's capabilities to create a more ethical approach to art sales. By charging lower fees and offering a transparent bidding process open to all, these companies aim to disrupt the traditional gallery and auctioneering worlds. With direct payments to artists and collectors after the auction, the use of Bitcoin in the art world could bring more fairness and transparency to the industry.</p><h2>P(ower)2P(ainters)</h2><p>And Bitcoin's disruptive potential extends beyond just providing a more efficient and transparent means of buying and selling art. It has the power to fundamentally change the traditional art world's structure by offering a decentralized, peer-to-peer relationship between artists and collectors. This shift is crucial because it enables artists to have direct relationships with their collectors, rather than relying on galleries to control access to their work.</p><p>In the conventional art market, the artist's relationship with the collector is often non-existent, and it is the gallery that dictates who gets to collect the artwork. However, with Bitcoin, artists have the opportunity to create beautiful and meaningful relationships with their collectors, as both parties navigate and learn from each other. This relationship-building process is facilitated by the fact that Bitcoin enables transactions to occur directly between artists and collectors, without intermediaries.</p><p>The emergence of digital art collectibles, such as Counterparty tokens, Ordinals and Rare Pepes, has further amplified this effect. With these digital art collectibles, artists can easily send their pieces to collectors around the world and reward them with additional sub-assets in the future. This new dynamic empowers artists to grow their work organically as their relationships with their collectors develop.</p><h2>Fake Rares</h2><p>Counterfeiting and the forgery of artworks have plagued the art industry for centuries and continue to be major concerns for galleries, auction houses and collectors. In fact, the Fine Art Expert Institute's report suggests that the market for fake artworks is worth approximately <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a12108723/fake-art-how-to-avoid-scams/">$6 billion per year</a>. Moreover, in some categories of artwork, the percentage of fake artworks may <a href="https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/more-then-half-of-art-is-fake">reach as high as 70%</a>. To make matters worse, <a href="https://www.insider.com/cases-of-faked-and-forged-artwork-2019-1">some experts suggest</a> that up to 20% of art pieces displayed in museums around the world could be counterfeit.</p><p>The rise of Bitcoin presents an opportunity to combat art forgery and counterfeiting through its immutable ledger. This technology can provide a transparent and secure platform for art sales, addressing the issue of authenticity and provenance. By embedding tokens in physical art pieces or digital art, these assets can be tracked transparently from owner to owner, ensuring that the buyer is purchasing a piece of authentic art.</p><p>This method of tracking art pieces has significant potential to mitigate the risk of forgeries and counterfeits in the art market. It also offers art collectors and investors a transparent way to purchase art pieces with confidence, knowing that they are genuine and have a reliable provenance. Furthermore, it may discourage counterfeiters from creating fake artworks altogether, as their creations can be easily detected and traced back to the source, leading to legal consequences. As such, Bitcoin can play a pivotal role in reducing the circulation of fake art, ensuring that the art industry remains a safe and secure place for art collectors, investors and enthusiasts.</p><h2>1494 All Over Again</h2><p>More and more art and artists are being drawn to Bitcoin every day. This is not a surprise, as creators are primed for adoption of Bitcoin. Artists know that proof of work and energy transmutation have always been a part of the alchemical process of painting. Selling artwork for sats is an artist's way of mining.</p><p>With greater adoption, Bitcoin principles such as leveraging open-source information, emphasizing transparency, remaining borderless and promoting decentralization will influence the traditional art market through the nuts and bolts of the network and, perhaps more importantly, the culture and behavior surrounding it.</p><p>It gives artists and collectors new tools to sell art and forge relationships directly. While there will always be a role for the gallerist, transparency is the basis for growth in Bitcoin art, and building off of it can create a more ethical and creative ecosystem.</p><p>In 1494, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/10/04/162296423/the-accountant-who-changed-the-world">invention of double-entry accounting</a> ushered in a new era of human prosperity and a golden age of artistic expression.

The filing follows a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2022/petn4-789.pdf">July 2022 petition</a> from Coinbase asking the SEC to use formal rulemaking to provide guidance for the crypto sector. Coinbase claims that the SEC has not yet responded to its petition, so it has filed the legal challenge to compel the SEC to respond either positively or negatively to its request.</p><p>The Administrative Procedure Act requires the SEC to respond to Coinbase’s rulemaking petition “within a reasonable time.” If the SEC decides not to respond, Coinbase will have the right to challenge that decision in court. Coinbase does not seek to dictate the SEC’s response, only to require that the agency responds at all, according to a<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-takes-another-formal-step-to-seek-regulatory-clarity-from-sec-for"> statement released by the company.</a></p><p>Coinbase and other crypto firms are facing potential regulatory enforcement actions from the SEC, even though the agency has not stated its position on the application of the law to the crypto sector. Coinbase asserts that regulatory clarity is long overdue for the industry, and that new rules would be “a critical step to giving the public notice about what activities they can and cannot engage in.”</p><p>Coinbase said it recognizes that clear rules are needed for the industry and has asked for rules to be developed. The exchange’s decision to challenge the SEC is an attempt to compel basic rulemaking, according to the firm. Coinbase added that it will continue to take every step available to seek regulatory clarity until the industry gets that clarity. </p><p>Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase Paul Grewal said in <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1650655478014410753?s=20">a statement on Twitter</a> that “The crypto industry, and its users need clear laws and rules to follow that are built for a new technology. Enforcement actions based in inapplicable securities law aren’t the answer.”</p><p>Coinbase has faced regulatory hurdles in the past, leading to it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/americas-largest-bitcoin-exchange-is-considering-leaving-the-country">potentially seeking</a> to move out of the United States. The exchange also <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sec-sue-coinbase-lend-yield-product">halted plans</a> to launch a lending product following warnings from regulators.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine Books Releases “The Philosophy Of Bitcoin"]]></title><description><![CDATA[Álvaro D.

María’s hit Spanish Bitcoin book has been translated into English for an entirely new audience.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin Magazine Books, the book publishing branch of BTC Inc., has announced the release of "The Philosophy of Bitcoin" by Álvaro D. María in English. The book was originally published in Spanish in 2022 as "La Filosofía de Bitcoin" and received much attention for its unique exploration of Bitcoin's disruptive nature to civilization. Ellen Sullivan, the publisher of Bitcoin Magazine Books, said that it's a great privilege to work with Álvaro and to deliver his groundbreaking work to English-speaking readers. "We plan to honor that commitment with a launch that we hope will be heard around the world. Everyone, Bitcoiners or not, should read this book."</p><p>"The Philosophy of Bitcoin" delves into the nature of Bitcoin and its political implications. The author, Álvaro D. María, with his unique background in philosophy and law, analyzes its innovations and explains why institutions are being challenged as a result of Bitcoin's emergence. In the book, he argues that Bitcoin is comparable to other revolutionary technologies like gunpowder or the internet. Through a deep philosophical exploration, readers will learn how Bitcoin is changing the way we think about money, power, and the role of the State in society.</p><p>According to María, "Bitcoin redefines the right to property by making it absolute and poses a new challenge to states, opening the door to new political forms by changing the current bargaining power. If gunpowder accelerated the passage from the Middle Ages to the Modern Age, Bitcoin will help accelerate the passage to the Information Age."</p><p>"The Philosophy of Bitcoin" is available now in the <a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books">Bitcoin Magazine Shop</a>, and Álvaro D. María will be signing copies of his book at <a href="http://b.tc/conference">Bitcoin 2023</a> at the Book Signing Booth. This is a unique opportunity for readers to meet the author and delve deeper into the ideas presented in his book. Bitcoin Magazine Books is committed to bringing high-quality, thought-provoking literature about Bitcoin to a wider audience. "The Philosophy of Bitcoin" is the latest addition to their growing catalog of Bitcoin-related books. They are excited to share this book with their readers and look forward to continuing to publish more works that explore the fascinating world of Bitcoin.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1OTUy/the-thinker-bitcoin-philosophy.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine Launches El Salvador Cover Edition Ordinals Giveaway]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoiners will have the opportunity to show how much they disrespect banks and love Bitcoin while potentially earning a Cover Edition ordinal.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-magazine-launches-el-salvador-cover-ordinals-giveaway</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-magazine-launches-el-salvador-cover-ordinals-giveaway</guid><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[Print Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[Inscriptions]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 14:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDkxNTM0MzY1NDY3NjU0/image1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bitcoiners will have the opportunity to show how much they disrespect banks and love Bitcoin while potentially earning a Cover Edition ordinal.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

Here’s an essential guide to understanding money and its role in today’s economic system.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Money is something that most of us take for granted, as we use it daily to buy goods and services. We constantly transact in money, think in money and strive to earn more of it. However, few genuinely understand what money is, and even those who do often perceive it in very different ways. </p><p>Some say that money is a form of energy that can be transformed and exchanged. Others see it as a technological tool that facilitates trade and commerce. Still others argue that money is a social construct shaped and governed by cultural norms and values. All these views can be correct since the concept of money is much deeper than the way it is commonly framed. </p><p>Our perspectives on money shape our views on how we use it. Money assumes various forms, spanning physical tender, precious metals, bank deposits, credit and, more recently, bitcoin. The most recognized form of money today is physical tender, encompassing coins and paper notes, which are distributed by the government. </p><h2>So, What is Money? </h2><p>Money is, first and foremost, a means to transact, to purchase goods and services. This function is commonly referred to as a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a>. It is a good you acquire not for its own sake but merely as a <em>means</em> to purchase another good.</p><ul><li>✅ Money is a market good, a good you acquire in order to acquire other goods. For this to happen, the market (sellers) must accept it as a medium of exchange.</li><li>❌ Money is not a consumption good, goods that directly satisfy consumer wants and needs. (Examples: a shirt, a pair of shoes, bread, cola, etc.)</li><li>❌ Money is not a capital good, which are physical assets that an organization uses to manufacture products and services that consumers will use later — e.g., machines, tools, vehicles, buildings, etc.</li></ul><p>How we conceptualize and understand money has evolved over time, and different schools of thought have emerged regarding its nature and function. </p><p>Karl Marx would say that money is the product of a commodity economy, where the source and nature of money are based on the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-theory-of-value.asp">labor theory of value</a>, while Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian school of economics, defined money as the relative ability for goods to be sold in a given market at a given time and price — a good’s “salability.” The most salable good is the good chosen to facilitate indirect trade based on the lowest rate of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp">declining marginal utility</a>. </p><p>Proponents of the Austrian school would say that the supply of money is either extremely durable in relation to current production — as it was under the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/gold-standard">gold standard.</a> Another view is that money is determined exogenously by a government authority — a position often taken by many of today’s economists, educated in a largely Keynesian paradigm. In recent history, the choice has been either gold or government.</p><p>The global economy has undergone significant changes since money’s last fleeting connection to gold ended in 1971. The fiat standard has enabled central banks to print money with complete discretion, leading to inflation and currency devaluation. Digital money ushered in novel opportunities for enhanced global trade and investment while intensifying competition and economic uncertainty. The shift to untethered money has brought forth a plethora of advantages and disadvantages, which shape today’s economic landscape.</p><h2>Why Do We Need Money? </h2><p>Money is necessary for a society that wants to trade, as it facilitates exchange and allows us to meet our basic survival needs — like shelter, food and clothing — and enables us to live within specific security and safety standards.</p><p>Without the invention of money, people would still be using barter or keeping ledgers of credit and debt. Barter works well when the needs and supplies of two parties match, as they can simply exchange these items directly without any monetary medium.. This is called the coincidence of wants or the double coincidence of wants.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTY4OTcyMTk4OTc0/coincidence-of-wants.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>It’s immediately apparent that a barter economy restricts the ability to trade, as it requires people to possess goods (preferably non-perishable) that they are willing to swap. They must also find other people who want the goods you own, and lastly, you must want the goods they possess. The coincidence of wants does not support a scalable monetary system. </p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTgyNjYyNDA3ODEw/barter-doesn_t-scale.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The solution is for society — or the market — to agree on an efficient good that will enable the exchange of products and services between all market participants. Money removes the necessity to find a particular person to barter with while offering a market to exchange your goods or services for a common medium of exchange. You will use that medium to buy what you need from others who also accept it as money.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTkwNzE1NDcwOTEw/money-as-a-medium-of-exchange.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>By providing the optionality, money is the best natural mechanism to save for the future. It allows economies to thrive by increasing trade and commerce; modern economies could simply not exist without money. </p><p>With little access to money, our freedoms and time are limited as we are forced to spend most of our time working to obtain the money necessary to cover the basic necessities. Having access to more money is empowering, as it allows us to make more informed decisions about the hours we need to work and the goods and services we consume — the neighborhood we live in, the car we drive, the restaurants we eat at and even the healthcare we choose.</p><p>It also provides beneficial opportunities for our children, as parents can afford better food, better education and a better way to pass on their wealth, assuming that the money can hold its value through time — which is one of the three universally accepted functions of money. </p><h2>Functions of Money </h2><p>Money has taken different forms over the years, from gold and silver to glass beads in Africa or wampum used by Native Americans. What’s remained constant across continents and throughout history is that money must perform the following three functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.</p><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange"><strong>Medium of exchange</strong></a>: Money serves as a medium of exchange when it allows people to trade goods and services easily without resorting to barter. This simplifies transactions and makes commerce more efficient.</p><p>As an intermediary between the products or services people want to trade, money is a suitable medium of exchange. “[money] is not acquired for its own properties, but for its salability.” – “The Bitcoin Standard,”<em> </em>Saifedean Ammous.</p><p>2.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account"><strong>Unit of Account</strong></a>: Money provides a standard measure of value, enabling people to compare the worth of different goods and services. A consistent price allows people to measure the market value of goods, services, economic activities, assets and liabilities. The price is what indicates the measurement of a good’s market value relative to other goods on the market.</p><p>When goods, services, assets or salaries are quoted in a recognizable unit of account, it allows buyers and sellers to quickly determine if a trade is worthwhile. Prices expressed in a unit of account lets market participants decide to operate complex tasks, accumulate capital or engage in economic calculations.</p><p>3.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value"><strong>Store of Value</strong></a>: Money serves as a store of value, allowing individuals and organizations to save and store wealth through time, without its value deteriorating. Current expectations of future supply and demand for an asset drive the ability of something to be a good store of value.</p><p>A store of value must be a durable good with limited supply issuance. Consumption goods such as milk and capital goods like machinery or cars are poor stores of value because they can perish, corrode, depreciate or lose value over time.</p><p>Andreas Antonopoulos, a long-time Bitcoin educator, argues that technology and network systems in the modern era may have given rise to a darker side of money. He introduced a fourth function:</p><p>4.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyK4P7ZdOK8"><strong>System of Control</strong></a> (external link): Money as a system of control refers to how money can be manipulated to serve political agendas. This has turned financial services companies into deputies of the system. As deputies, they get certain perks, such as never going to jail, but this has come at the expense of corruption and economic exclusion.</p><p>When money is used as a system of control, it corrupts its other functions, including its ability to serve as a medium of exchange and store of value. Money abused in this way works to the advantage of corrupt politicians and dictators, as it ensures that political dissent can be censored very effectively by limiting transactions or blocking purchases.</p><p>In the 20th century, governments monopolized the issuance of money and continually undermined its use as a store of value, creating a false narrative that money is primarily a medium of exchange. Money that doesn’t store value into the future results in a society that concerns itself less about the future.</p><p>Sound money, in contrast, is defined as money with a purchasing power determined by markets, independent of governments. Market participants, left to their own devices, naturally select a monetary medium that best fulfills the three functions of money. To achieve this status, it needs to have strong monetary properties. </p><h2>Properties of Money</h2><p>There are six widely accepted properties of money and it has been this way for centuries. So long as an item has these properties, it’s a good candidate for becoming money. Whichever monetary candidate records the highest score against these properties is likely to be used as the de facto unit of trade. </p><h3>Standard properties: </h3><ol><li><strong>Durable</strong> — Money must be durable to be passed around and used repeatedly without the danger of wear and damage and the consequent depreciation of its value.</li><li><strong>Portable</strong> — Money should be easy to transport, physically or digitally, so that it can be transferred in trade. Cash and gold are portable in small quantities, yet more significant amounts can be challenging to move over long distances or through border controls. </li><li><strong>Divisible</strong> — Money must be capable of being divided into smaller parts. For example, a $10 bill can be exchanged for two $5 bills without diminishing its (combined) value. A cow or a stone, on the other hand, is not divisible. </li><li><strong>Fungible</strong> — Money should be completely interchangeable: one dollar should always be equal to another dollar, the same way two $5 bills are interchangeable with one $10 bill.</li><li><strong>Scarcity</strong> — Scarcity, or limited supply, is another essential property of sound money. Computer scientist Nick Szabo defined scarcity as “unforgeable costliness,” meaning the cost of creating something cannot be faked. If money is too plentiful, it loses value over time as more units can and will be created, and more will be required to purchase a good or service.</li><li><strong>Verifiable</strong> — Money should be a verifiable record accepted as a medium of exchange to pay for goods and services or to repay a debt in a specific country. It should be easy to recognize and hard to counterfeit; otherwise, it would lose value for payment purposes and would be rejected by vendors.</li></ol><p>Each of these properties underpins the functions of money, encapsulated by Erik Yakes below as well as in his <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-dimensions-of-money">series on the dimensions of money.</a> Clearly, owning a scarce good that’s durable is a good means of storing value through time. But that’s not enough to make something money; it also has to be desirable, or acceptable and portable if it is to be used in exchange for other goods and services. Once this is achieved, it can become a unit of account so long as it’s divisible and fungible. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Since the invention of digital money, three additional monetary properties can be considered, including established history, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/uphill-battle-bitcoin-ban">censorship resistance</a> and programmability, which have significantly impacted how we perceive and use money in the digital age.</p><h3>Additional Properties: </h3><ol><li><strong>Established history</strong> — The Lindy effect suggests that the life expectancy of certain non-perishable entities, such as technologies or ideas, is directly related to their current age. In essence, the longer these entities have survived and remained relevant, the greater their chances of continued existence into the future. This longevity indicates resistance to change, obsolescence or competition, which increases their chance of survival over time.</li><li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong> — Decentralization ensures that nobody, nowhere, can have their money confiscated or blocked from usage. Censorship resistance is a relatively new monetary property for those who want to be sure their wealth is untouchable.</li><li><strong>Smart/Programmable</strong> — Typically refers to blockchain technology systems which allow certain conditions to be met before money can be spent. It’s a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program. </li></ol><p>Money does not need to be “backed” by anything; it only needs these properties to have value. </p><p>The idea that money must be backed by something only exists because paper money was once redeemable or “backed by” gold, where intrinsically useless fiat money piggybacked onto gold’s valuable properties.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin promises to be the next step in the evolution of money. It’s built upon the same properties that once made gold the de facto monetary medium for centuries, only it’s been enhanced with the additional properties of extreme portability and fungibility — those very properties that allowed fiat to usurp gold during the last century.</p><p>Unlike gold and fiat, bitcoin is built for the digital age. Its supply is strictly regulated by its code and enforced by those who use it. It’s a system of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-a-world-of-rules-without-rulers">rules without rulers</a>, that allows transactions to be transmitted globally in mere seconds and settled within minutes without incurring the exorbitant expenses and approval typically associated with traditional financial systems.</p><p>For the first time in history, we have a monetary system based on a distributed, immutable technology that is transparent, objective, programmable and well suited to move economic value across time and space without relying on a trusted intermediary and the issuance by central banks. Satoshi Nakamoto created peer-to-peer electronic cash that would not require trust in third parties for transactions, and its supply could not be altered by any other player. </p><p>It’s often said that gold is the king’s money, and fiat is government money. If so, then bitcoin is undoubtedly the people’s money. </p><p>Read more &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin</a></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Many who theorize about money believe that the connection to a commodity at its origin is the real reason any money could initially gain value, or hold that the support of rulers is what establishes monetary value; proponents of those arguments therefore believe that money is a creature of the state. </p><p>Money has a considerable history and has evolved numerous times. The last significant evolution marked the end of the gold standard and ushered in the beginning of fiat money. The state — via central banks — eventually destroyed two critical properties of money: soundness and sovereignty. These are the properties that enabled value to be passed down through generations. </p><p>The emergence of Bitcoin should be viewed within this scheme of things. As a medium of exchange, a global unit of account, a store of value, an international and online method for settlement, it’s conducive to individual sovereignty.</p><p>Bitcoin emerged as an alternative to government restrictions on individuals who transfer money and as an alternative to the state’s control over the money supply. As long as those premises continue to exist, then demand for bitcoin will continue to increase.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk2ODU0NTU1MjgxOTkwNzE4/what-is-money-feature-image.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTY4OTcyMTk4OTc0/coincidence-of-wants.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTgyNjYyNDA3ODEw/barter-doesn_t-scale.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTkwNzE1NDcwOTEw/money-as-a-medium-of-exchange.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NjA3ODk1ODY0OTYy/unnamed.png" height="376" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NjE0MzM3NzkxMDM4/currency-properties.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unit of Account: A Comprehensive Guide]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unit of AccountUnit of account is the thing that measures the value of goods and services.

It's an essential function for something to be [or become?] money. In simple terms, it is a standard measure of value, a common scaling system through which the value of products can be calculated and compared.</p><p>Countries typically have distinct units of account, identified as the national or regional currency, such as the euro (EUR) or the British pound (GBP). At the same time, internationally, the U.S. dollar (USD) is the unit of account that is mainly used for global invoicing and setting prices internationally. </p><p>Unit of account is one of money’s three universally agreed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">functions of <em>money</em></a> that Bitcoin Magazine is reviewing; the other two are <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/store-of-value"></a></em> and <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/medium-of-exchange"></a></em>.</p><h2>What is a Unit of Account</h2><p>A unit of account is whatever forms the standard measure for comparing prices with incomes or assets; it allows money users to assess the value of money and is the common denomination for transfer value across different types of goods and services. When a unit of account is defined by the same measure or denomination (such as a specific currency), it’s easier to compare the value of various assets and transactions. </p><p>Having a standard measure makes it easier to determine the value of two different items, such as the price of a house and a car. Knowing the car’s cost and the house’s price makes budgeting and transactions easier to assess.</p><p>It also allows us to process mathematical operations, such as calculating profits, losses and income, giving numerical values to what we produce, trade and consume.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Typically, what we identify as a unit of account is money — in recent times, backed by governments and national currencies. It’s what we use as a standard measure for all our daily transactions.</p><h2>Money as a Unit of Account</h2><p>Money as a unit of account is also used to measure a country’s economy. For example, the American economy is measured in U.S. dollars, the Chinese in yuan and so forth. Internationally, things tend to be simplified with the U.S. dollar as a unit of account, making it easier to compare different economies.</p><p>Money is the standard measure used in economics and financial markets to establish how much people can borrow or lend, and keep track of their assets’ value. Applicable interest rates are also calculated in the same unit of account.</p><p>Finally, money is also used to calculate the net worth of individuals, businesses and organizations of different types, including the monetary value of their assets. </p><h2>Essential Elements of a Unit of Account</h2><p>To gain acceptance as money by the market, a good typically goes through a three-stage process: starting as a store of value, progressing to a medium of exchange and finally becoming a unit of account to establish its quantifiable monetary value.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">

    </figure><p>We’ve seen that a unit of account is used as a standard unit of measurement for the market value of goods and services and to be salable. For a good to be defined and credible as a unit of account, it must have the following properties:</p><p><strong>Divisibility</strong>: As a unit of account, money must be divisible into smaller units to facilitate transactions, express the value of goods and services more accurately and effectively, and compare various items’ values more easily. </p><p><strong>Fungible</strong>: Fungibility is an essential characteristic of a unit of account and occurs when two units of the same currency are interchangeable. Hence, the value of one unit of account is identical to another of the same kind. One dollar bill, for instance, has the same value as another dollar bill. Often seen as a property of a medium of exchange, its importance lies in its function rather than its classification.</p><h2>How Does Inflation Affect the Unit of Account?</h2><p>Inflation doesn't make the Unit of Account (UoA) function worse; however, price instability does make it challenging to compare the worth of goods and services over time. The unit of account serves to facilitate the understanding of supply and demand dynamics in the economy, but its reliability is severely eroded by inflation. </p><p>As a result, market participants may struggle to make informed decisions regarding consumption, investments and savings. </p><h2>What Makes a Good Unit of Account?</h2><p>Money that is divisible, and fungible makes a good unit of account. Money not impacted by inflation would make an even better unit of account. People often argue that we should have a type of money that's measurable, stable and constant, like the metric system.</p><p>If the unit of account was standardized like the metric system, it would be much easier to accurately and consistently assess the value of goods and services over time. However, value is subjective and shifting, and the world’s circumstances differ over time, so there cannot be any guarantee that value is always represented in the same way. </p><p>While we will never have a type of money that becomes as measurable as the metric system, we can have money that has a preprogrammed, inelastic supply and is detached from the real-world value of things.</p><h2>Bitcoin as a Unit of Account</h2><p>If a type of money has the primary properties discussed, is accepted globally and is also censorship resistant, it’s potentially the best unit of account ever created. </p><p>Bitcoin, however, is still relatively new and has a lot of maturing to do before it can be recognized as a consistent unit of account. Since Bitcoin has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins, it is not subject to the same inflationary pressures of traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed ad infinitum by central banks. This should provide a level of predictability and certainty for businesses and individuals when assessing the value of goods and services, making long-term financial planning easier and more reliable.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of inflationary pressures on the unit of account would also promote more responsible economic decision-making by governments and businesses. Since the temptation to print more money to fund government programs or stimulate the economy would be removed, policymakers would have to find other ways to manage economic growth, such as through innovation, productivity and investment.</p><p>In addition, If bitcoin were to become the global reserve currency, it would promote greater international trade and investment by eliminating the need for currency exchanges and mitigating the risk of currency fluctuations. This would make it easier and less expensive for individuals and businesses to transact with one another across borders, facilitating greater economic cooperation and growth worldwide.</p><p>Overall, a unit of account not impacted by inflation would offer a stable foundation for the global economy, enabling businesses and individuals to plan for the future more confidently while promoting more responsible economic decision-making and international trade.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MzA0MTc3NjU2ODM4/unit-of-account-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5NTQ0Njk1ODI1NDE0/scales.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is a Store of Value?

This term is used to describe a mechanism that enables individuals to preserve their wealth without experiencing any loss in value over time. </p><p>It is one of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">three functions of <em>money</em></a><em> </em>that Bitcoin Magazine is exploring; the other two are <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a></em> and <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/unit-of-account"></a></em>.</p><h2>What is a Store of Value</h2><p>A store of value is an asset, a currency or a commodity that can be trusted to hold its value over time; ideally, it doesn’t bear much risk. Traditionally, people who are less tolerant to risk will invest in a store of value with an enduring lifespan, a stable demand and low volatility. </p><p>Fiat currencies are weak stores of value since they depreciate over time due to inflation. Commodities like bitcoin, gold and a collection of other monetary metals have good store-of-value attributes because they are relatively limited in supply and do not deteriorate over time, thereby maintaining their value.</p><p>Salability is the critical property that allows something to be freely used as money and defines a physical good or asset that can be quickly sold. To have salability, money must be divisible (scale dimension), transportable (space dimension) and durable (time dimension). When an asset possesses salability across time, we have a good store of value because it can be trusted to maintain its value into the future.</p><p>One benchmark often used to understand the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold happened to match the price of a high-quality men’s suit. This principle is known as the “gold-to-decent-suit ratio,” and its roots can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the price — defined in gold — of a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Another example is the price of one barrel of oil in fiat versus gold. In 1913, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=rwtc&amp;f=m">one barrel of oil cost $0.97</a>, while <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/energy">today it’s about $80</a>. In contrast, <a href="https://onlygold.com/gold-prices/historical-gold-prices/">one ounce of gold would buy 22 barrels of oil in 1913</a>, while it buys roughly 24 today — showing barely any difference in the gold price (good store of value) versus a big depreciation of the fiat currency (bad store of value).</p><h2>Why do we need a store of value?</h2><p>Money is an essential tool for trading goods and services, but it is also important to have a good store of value to save and secure a better future for ourselves and our families. While fiat currencies are suitable as a medium of exchange, they are not reliable stores of value, as they lose value over time due to inflation, historically around 2-3% per year.</p><p>In extreme cases, such as in Venezuela, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> has led to astronomical rates of inflation, making these fiat currencies very poor stores of value. While these examples serve as outliers, rising inflation levels are becoming more common in modern times, leading to a natural mechanism to save for the future and to find ways to beat 2-3% inflation rates.</p><p>It’s important to have a reliable store of value to secure the value of our hard-earned money over time. As poor stores of value, fiat currencies are thought to discourage people from saving or even earning money in the first place. </p><h2>Is money a good store of value?</h2><p>In the modern age, we use “fiat” currencies,, the term derived from the Latin word “fiat” meaning a decree or an arbitrary order; it’s basically a promise of what a value could be. Such a concept was established when governments’ paper or minted money could be redeemed for a set amount of a physical commodity. Since then, the term fiat has remained, even though currencies aren’t backed by commodities or possess any intrinsic value of their own. </p><p>While fiat currency has many properties that identify it as money, it’s a poor store of value since it isn’t linked to physical reserves, such as gold or silver. The result is that fiat currencies gradually lose value due to inflation or suddenly in the event of hyperinflation. </p><p>Fiat currencies are considered soft money because they are too dependent on a government’s price stability targets — generally focused on price stability, with general prices increasing at 2% per year — instead of allowing the market to naturally decide prices. This approach leads governments to gradually siphon off the value of the money while increasing the price of everything else in the process.</p><h2>Essential Elements of a Store of Value</h2><p><br>During its evolution as money, an item will develop through three different phases, starting with a <em>store of value</em> before becoming a <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a></em> and eventually a <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/unit-of-account"></a></em><em>. </em>The three dimensions of the most salable goods are across time, space and through scales.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>A store of value is the most salable good, one that has the ability to preserve its value over time.</p><p>To possess the function of a store of value, a salable good should be scarce; it must have a limited supply compared to other goods. It should also be durable so that it can be used repeatedly without losing its functionality. </p><ul><li>Scarcity: a good that’s limited in supply relative to other goods and to the demand for it. Computer scientist <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/nick-szabo">Nick Szabo</a> defined scarcity as “unforgeable costliness,” meaning the cost of creating something cannot be faked. If money is too plentiful, it loses value over time as more units can and will be created, and more will be required to purchase a good or service.</li></ul><ul><li>Durability: this property refers to the ability of a good to maintain its physical and functional properties over time. This means that the currency should be able to withstand wear and tear and remain in circulation for a long period without deteriorating or losing its value.</li></ul><ul><li>Immutability: Immutability is a desirable and new property of money because it ensures that once a transaction is confirmed and recorded, it cannot be altered or reversed. </li></ul><h2>What's a good store of value?</h2><p>Many different assets can serve as a store of value, but defining the best is constantly debated among investors and largely depends on market dynamics and investors’ preferences. It is worth noting that certain assets may lose their store-of-value status over time. A prime example of this is silver, which experienced a decrease in its store-of-value functionality as its supply increased due to its growing use in industrial applications rather than its traditional use as a monetary metal.</p><h3>Bitcoin</h3><p>Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations, bitcoin increasingly became a store of value as investors and more people realized its potential worth as a new monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-discovery-of-bitcoin-is-a-puzzle">discovery of digital, sound money</a> and is a scientific revolution that is proving so far to not only be a store of value but also a means to increase value. </p><p>Bitcoin is becoming a significant force in the economy because it meets the requirements of a store of value better than any other form of money.</p><ul><li>Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies. This limited supply gives it a scarcity value, making it a valuable asset to hold and store wealth.</li></ul><ul><li>Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring that it remains a reliable store of value over time.</li></ul><ul><li>Immutability: once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or reversed. This immutability is a critical feature of Bitcoin because it ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns.</li></ul><h3>Precious Metals</h3><p>Precious metals like gold, palladium and platinum have long been good stores of value due to their perpetual shelf life and industrial use cases. They are relatively limited in supply which makes their value appreciate relative to fiat money. Bitcoin is even more limited in supply than gold and precious metals and has <a href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-vs-gold/">appreciated in value against gold</a> since its inception.</p><p>Physically storing large quantities of gold is expensive and challenging. For this reason, investors often choose to invest in digital gold or gold stocks, which are subject to counterparty risks. Gemstones like diamonds and sapphires are useful too as they are easier to store and transport.</p><h3>Real Estate</h3><p>Real estate is one of the most common stores of value due to its tangibility and utility. Over time, its value tends to increase, at least this has been the case since the 1970s. Before then, real estate and land kept pace with prices, having real returns around ~0% over longer periods (subject to wars and crashes, etc). Despite temporary downfalls along the way, it remains stable, offering physical land or construction owners a sense of safety when investing in it.</p><p>Real estate can be any physical property like land or a home that can be used as a primary residence, a vacation home, or a commercial property to rent or sell. The downside of real estate is that it’s not liquid or censorship resistant. This lack of liquidity can be problematic for property owners who require access to cash quickly and can be subject to government intervention or legal action. </p><h3>Stock Market</h3><p>Buying stocks on the NYSE, the LSE and the JPX markets has proved to be a good investment over time because they have increased their worth over the years: Stocks have been decent stores of value. However, they may experience high volatility and depend highly on market forces and economic movements, which makes them similar to fiat currencies.</p><h3>Index Funds/ETFs</h3><p>Index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are another way to get exposure to the stock and equity markets and provide an easy way for investors to diversify their portfolios. </p><p>Over a long time, such markets have also proved to increase in value, making them good stores of value. ETFs are also more cost- and tax-efficient than similar mutual funds. </p><h3>Other stores of value</h3><p>People can get creative with their favorite stores of value that sometimes match their passions or interests. For example, fine wines, classic cars, watches or art can be good stores of value as their worth typically appreciates over time.</p><h2>What’s a bad store of value</h2><h3>Perishable items</h3><p>Perishable items are goods that expire and lose value over time, gradually becoming worthless. </p><p>Food makes for a poor store of value, as it has an expiry date. A ticket to a concert or for transport becomes worthless after the expiry date, and are also considered perishable.</p><p>Therefore, they are not considered a good store of value.</p><h3>Fiat money</h3><p>We mentioned that fiat currencies do not retain their value over time, as the chart below shows.</p><p>It is mainly due to inflation that they lose value because every year, the price of goods and services tends to rise compared to the dollar and other fiat currencies. As a result, currencies consistently lose purchasing power.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Cryptocurrency</h3><p>Cryptocurrency alternatives to bitcoin are very similar to speculative stocks, with even higher risks since most have short lifespans and almost all lose value versus bitcoin over the long term. </p><p>Cryptocurrencies with longer lifespans prioritize functionality over security, scarcity and censorship resistance, making them poor stores of value, considering their poor economic propositions and weak use cases.</p><p>According to research conducted by <a href="https://twitter.com/alphaazeta/status/1641534991556288532">Swan Bitcoin</a>, altcoins have proven to be a bad investment. The study analyzed 8,000 cryptocurrencies since 2016 and found that 2,635 of them had underperformed versus Bitcoin and a staggering 5,175 of the cryptocurrencies no longer exist.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Speculative Stocks</h3><p>Speculative stocks are small-cap assets, also called penny stocks, that trade at less than $5 per share. They are not considered good stores of value because they are highly speculative. </p><p>Due to their high volatility and low market caps, they can quickly and suddenly increase a lot or lose all of their value. They are considered risky investments and certainly do not make good stores of value. </p><h3>Government bonds?</h3><p>For a long time, government bonds like U.S. treasuries were considered great stores of value simply because governments backed them. However, negative interest rates applied for years have highly affected the economies of big countries like Japan, Germany and other European countries, making government bonds unattractive for the average investor. Some bonds are meant to protect beneficiaries from inflation such as I-bonds and TIPS. However, they are still government-led and rely on the Bureau of Labor Statistics to accurately calculate the inflation rate (which it may choose, or be influenced, not to do).</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>​​To sum up, a store of value tends to maintain or increase its purchasing power over time, depending on the law of supply and demand, which can also be used to determine whether or not something might be a good store of value. </p><p>Many still regard bitcoin as an experiment. However, its relatively short life has proved that it offers all those properties typical of money and is a good store of value. The next challenge will be to prove that it can also be a unit of account.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MTM4Mjg0NTQ1OTQ3/store-of-value-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MTk3ODc3MjE2MjYy/gold-to-decent-suit-ratio.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MjM4OTQ3ODQxOTQ3/unnamed-2.png" height="337" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MjUwNDkwNTY1NjM4/unnamed-3.png" height="425" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is a Medium of Exchange?

Barter is not suitable as a means to exchange goods and services in an economic system larger than a tribe or family; barter was unsuitable for expanding societies that needed a more efficient method to exchange goods and services. </p><p>Hence, about 2,600 years ago, a new and more sophisticated medium of exchange emerged in Lydia — a region recognized as modern Turkey — and materialized with stamped coins to face the challenges of barter and facilitate trade.</p><p>A medium of exchange is an intermediary item that is widely accepted to facilitate the trade of goods and services between two parties. It is one of money’s three universally agreed functions, along with store of value and unit of account. A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> is any asset that maintains its value over time without depreciating. A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a> is a standard monetary unit that measures the market value of goods, services, economic activities, assets and liabilities. </p><p>Bitcoin Magazine takes you through the significance of money and its different spectrums. After exploring <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">what money is</a> and what underlines its value, we now dive into its primary functions, starting with the medium of exchange.</p><h2>What is a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>A medium of exchange is an intermediary instrument that facilitates the buying and selling of goods or services. In remote times, shells, whale teeth, salt, tobacco and other objects that occurred rarely in nature were employed. Nowadays, currencies are the most common media of exchange as they’re suitable intermediaries between the products or services people want to trade. Still, currency needs to possess specific properties.</p><p>The first medium of exchange coin was created by the Lydians, who hailed from Anatolia in modern-day Turkey. The coin was made of a gold and silver alloy to certify weight and purity and was stamped with images of merchants, landowners or other well-known entities.</p><p>While gold and other metals had likely already been used as a medium of exchange, the Lydians first issued official standardized coins that could be accepted as an intermediary good with a set value recognized as money. They thereby economized on the assaying of the unstamped coins, cutting out some transaction costs in dealing with monetary metals.</p><p>In our modern economies, governments must ensure that their currencies are made widely available to the public, that they are not easy to counterfeit and that they are available in sufficient quantities to satisfy public demand.</p><h2>Why Is a Medium of Exchange Needed?</h2><p>A medium of exchange allows us to trade more efficiently by solving the barter problem, often referred to as the coincidence of wants — a term used to describe an instance where I have the item that you want and you have the item that I want. The mental burden of having to find this exact scenario over and over again in order to trade is considerable, and an impediment to a growing economy. </p><p>Imagine I have a battery and want to trade it for some medicine. I would have to find someone with medicine who is in need of a battery and then negotiate a trade, which can be a complicated endeavor. A medium of exchange makes trade more accessible by allowing people to trade goods indirectly for other good</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDAyOTkzMDc2MTIz/unnamed-1.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>As the primary purpose of a medium of exchange is to facilitate transactions between parties, to be effective a medium of exchange must be recognized and accepted by all parties. Here, the concept of a medium of exchange converges with the purpose of a good store of value since its stability allows owners to store it for an extended period with relatively low risks as an investment.</p><h2>Money As a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>Money serves as the most efficient medium of exchange that eliminates the issue of the coincidence of wants commonly associated with barter, allowing individuals, companies and systems to transact with ease.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc4OTc2MTQ5NTMwNTIz/medium-of-exchange.png" height="692" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>As an intermediary tool, money enables buyers and sellers to participate in the market as equal players, leading to fair trade and increased production efficiency. This is because money helps producers to identify what goods or services to produce and the optimal pricing model for them. Likewise, buyers can plan their purchases based on predictable and stable pricing models.</p><p>When purchasing a product or service, buyers typically bid according to the asking price, which in turn allows producers to determine the variety and quantity of items to be produced. However, if consumers are unable to accurately value a product or service, it can lead to difficulties in budget planning, potentially resulting in a chaotic economy due to the challenges of estimating demand and supply.</p><h2>Essential Elements of a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>An item or system must possess certain properties that facilitate efficiency and functionality to be a suitable medium of exchange. It’s not necessary for an item to be backed by a commodity or any other asset to become money. Instead, it must evolve to become the most salable good following an evolutionary process that starts with being recognized as a store of value before being a medium of exchange and eventually becoming a unit of account.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The three dimensions of the most salable goods are across time, space and through scales.</p><p>To possess the function of a medium of exchange, a salable good should be easily transported and accepted over long distances, and be used in indirect exchange for trade rather than for direct consumption.</p><p>Such a function can be achieved through two key properties: wide acceptability by the public and portability, which makes it easy to move over large distances.</p><h2>What Makes a Good Medium of Exchange</h2><p>The aforementioned properties make any item or system a good medium of exchange. Also, a good medium of exchange should hold value over time and be censorship resistant other than serving its purpose as an intermediary for exchanging goods or services between two parties.</p><p>In the case of currencies serving the purpose of money, they are only as good as the governments that issue them. Political instability, rampant inflation and government malfunction inevitably affect the value and stability of a nation’s currency.</p><h2>Digital Evolution</h2><p>The digital era has brought new opportunities to develop an innovative monetary system based on protected cryptography and distributed networks that ensure decentralization. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/nick-szabo-on-bitcoin-2021">Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency</a> that can be regarded as a good medium of exchange, possessing all the essential criteria that make trade transactions easy, fast and secure. It’s already proved to be a good store of value and, since it owns the properties necessary to be a good medium of exchange, it also has the potential to become a unit of account.</p><p>One key advantage of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is its ability to settle transactions quickly. Bitcoin transactions are confirmed and settled every 10 minutes on the blockchain, making them faster than traditional banking methods, which can take days or even weeks to complete. This speed is especially important for businesses that require fast and efficient payment processing.</p><p>Another important feature of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is the efficiency of its Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second-layer solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that enables instant and low-cost transactions between parties. With the Lightning Network, market participants can conduct microtransactions without having to wait for confirmations on the blockchain, making it a highly efficient solution for small transactions.</p><p>It also provides extra properties like censorship resistance to better protect the people who live under authoritarian governments, and absolute scarcity, since its total supply moves closer to the maximum 21-million amount with every new block mined. Bitcoin’s revolutionary system may disrupt the status quo and its limitations, but it’s still in the infancy stage and like anything so innovative, it will take time to catch on.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Society has evolved throughout the centuries, as have its monetary systems, which have adapted to its expanding size and economy. Despite the complexity of global commerce being made more efficient by the internet, many challenges, like online security and privacy, still need to be overcome. While these challenges are unique to the modern era, evolution is inherently part of the nature of trade. </p><p>The methods and means of trade are in a perpetual state of change and development, keeping up with technological advancements and the evolving needs of society. Despite these changes, the properties that underpin trade remain constant. As the trading landscape transforms, the fundamental properties of wide acceptability, portability, value preservation and, more recently, censorship resistance are required for a tool to function well as a medium of exchange, and they have remained unchanged over time. </p><p>Therefore, as trade continues to evolve, the importance of these underlying properties will continue to be crucial in determining the success and stability of any economy. The good that best satisfies these properties should emerge as the dominant medium of exchange, but this evolution can take time.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MDYzOTI3OTI0NjM1/medium-of-exchange-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDAyOTkzMDc2MTIz/unnamed-1.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc4OTc2MTQ5NTMwNTIz/medium-of-exchange.png" height="692" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Seized Bitcoin Stack Could Be Bulgaria's Golden Ticket]]></title><description><![CDATA[After seizing 213,000 bitcoin in 2017, Bulgaria now has an opportunity to become one of the wealthiest countries on earth.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-future-for-bulgaria-seized-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-future-for-bulgaria-seized-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[government seizure]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[u.s. dollar]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin price]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ahmed Botan]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">After seizing 213,000 bitcoin in 2017, Bulgaria now has an opportunity to become one of the wealthiest countries on earth.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Ahmed Botan, a marketing professional with a focus on Bitcoin-based projects.</em></p><p>Bulgaria, a small country located in Southeast Europe, nestled between Romania and Greece, is set to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world. </p><p>The reason for this is its possession of 213,000 bitcoin, which its authorities seized from a group they labeled as criminals in 2017. According to the <a href="https://www.coininsider.com/bulgarian-government-owns-3-billion-usd-bitcoin/">South East European Law Enforcement Center</a> (SELC), the group hacked the Bulgarian customs agency’s computers and made changes to the system so that their partner companies could import goods while avoiding paying taxes on them.</p><p>Immediately following the crackdown, the bitcoin seized was worth about $500,000, however, it would now be worth closer to $6 billion dollars, as of April 2023. While the <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=02b41baf-5f0d-4696-a580-5aba28b2a8ca">details around the BTC seizure are unclear</a>, and it is not totally clear whether the country still holds that bitcoin or what it plans to do with the stack if it does, the potential of a nation like Bulgaria holding this much BTC is worth exploring.</p><p>As the value of bitcoin is, in the view of many, set to go up a lot higher still in the coming years, Bulgaria could stand to become very wealthy.</p><h2>The Rising Price Of Bulgaria’s Bitcoin</h2><p>While the future price of bitcoin is impossible to predict, there are some prominent examples of experts explaining why they are confident Bulgaria’s bitcoin holdings will grow exponentially in value. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Croesus_BTC">Jesse Meyers</a>, the COO of Onramp Bitcoin who holds an MBA from Stanford University, <a href="https://jessemyers.substack.com/p/bitcoins-full-potential-valuation">has predicted that the bitcoin price will hit $10 million in the coming decades.</a> Ark Invest CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/CathieDWood?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Cathie Wood</a> has predicted <a href="https://milkroad.com/predictions">bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2030</a> in a bullish scenario. Similarly, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes">Arthur Hayes</a>, co-founder of BitMex <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/arthur-hayes-thinks-bitcoin-can-still-hit-1m-this-cycle/">believes that bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2026</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the former CTO of Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">Balji Srinivasan</a>, has predicted that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-coinbase-cto-makes-2m-bet-on-bitcoin-s-performance">bitcoin would hit $1 million by June 15, 2023</a>, wagering $2 million to that effect.</p><p>While most people don't believe that the bitcoin price can reach $1 million by then, anything is possible. For example, if there was an extended banking crisis and hyperinflation of the U.S. dollar, as predicted by Srinivasan, who knows how valuable Bulgaria’s bitcoin stack will become?</p><p>For instance, shortly after Srinivasan’s bet (although this was certainly unrelated), several nations, including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya and more <a href="https://www.newsafrica.net/article/is-it-time-for-africa-to-ditch-the-us-dollar-in-international-trade-deals">began moving away from using the U.S. dollar in their trades</a>, With the Kenyan president warning citizens to <a href="https://winepressnews.com/2023/03/28/kenya-president-tells-citizens-to-get-rid-of-holdings-of-us-dollar-as-nations-dump-the-dollar-and-begin-to-embrace-petroyuan/">get rid of their dollar holdings</a>.</p><p>The United States government has measures in place to prevent further bank runs, like the Federal Reserve's <a href="https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2023/03/fred-adds-bank-term-funding-program-data/#:~:text=This%20program%20was%20launched%20on,in%20connection%20to%20this%20program.">$25 billion bank-term funding program</a> (BTFP) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) openness to cover all deposits.</p><p>I think, if the FDIC decides to insure all deposits, that will be enough to deter true bank runs, but it’s clear that the U.S. dollar is not as strong as it used to be. And that opens the door for a decentralized, global monetary unit like bitcoin to rise.</p><p>As a result, if Bulgaria holds onto its BTC stash, it could amass more value relative to the holdings of other countries around the world and become one of the world’s richest.</p><h2>So, What Will Bulgaria Do With Its Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bulgaria could use future bitcoin gains to invest in its economy, but it will have to pay off national debts first. As of 2022, Bulgaria’s <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/bulgaria/national-government-debt">national government debt reached $20 billion</a> in 2022.</p><p>By 2030, if the bitcoin price hits $1 million and it still holds its seized, 213,000 BTC stash, its holdings could be worth $213 billion.</p><p>After paying off its debt, Bulgaria could use the funds generated from selling the 231,000 BTC to invest in various industries, such as technology or real estate. Moreover, the Bulgarian government could use the funds generated from the sale of its bitcoin to improve the country's infrastructure, education and healthcare. By investing in these essential sectors, Bulgaria could attract foreign investment, and this would further boost the country's economy.</p><p>Bulgaria has a significant opportunity to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world if it HODLs its bitcoin and sells some at the right time. But it seems wise for the country to keep a significant portion of bitcoin in reserve in perpetuity, as fiat currencies like the dollar continue to deteriorate.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ahmed Botan.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Source Node, a former sales account manager with a background in training and industrial-organizational psychology.</em></p><p>When I pitch Bitcoin to a relative, to a friend or to a complete stranger in the bathroom stall next to me, they will inevitably ask, "How is this benefiting you? Are you going to make money from me buying bitcoin?" </p><p>In one sense, the honest answer is yes, but my main objective is actually to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eightfold-Path">alleviate suffering</a>. </p><p>Will any single investor buying bitcoin make my bitcoin increase in value? Not unless I'm convincing a hyper-rich <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-america-should-ban-crypto-regulation-economy-finance-china-england-trading-currency-securities-commodity-gamble-11675287477?mod=article_inline">communist sympathizer</a> like Charlie Munger to hop onboard. The average investor buying $1,000-worth of BTC is not going to change the price of bitcoin. In fact, even a very wealthy investor allocating $100 million may not significantly change the price of bitcoin. In that sense, I am not benefiting directly from convincing individuals to buy bitcoin at all.</p><p>However, given the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/an-objective-look-at-bitcoin-adoption">early stage</a> of adoption that we are currently experiencing, the asymmetric upside of investing in bitcoin today has the potential to turn a relatively-small investment into life-changing financial security. For this reason, the motivation to pitch Bitcoin to people I care about is greater now than it will be in the future. The potential future which Bitcoin enables for myself and for society is the primary driving force behind my participation in the network. The prospect of living in a world of abundance, voluntary behavior and geopolitical cooperation is becoming more achievable by the block. I wish to benefit from the transition to that world and I wish for those whom I love (as well as random strangers I encounter) to benefit from it as well. </p><p>I know I am not the only one who holds this view. It seems to be a natural inclination for nearly every Bitcoiner to compulsively <a href="https://ibb.co/HtjG941">pitch</a> Bitcoin to their friends, relatives and acquaintances. Unfortunately, I have seen many people become exhausted with these pitches. This exhaustion seems to slow down adoption more than support it, which indicates to me that some of what I have to share regarding sales may be helpful.</p><p>Every Bitcoiner who crosses the threshold into this <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-as-a-human-resources-department">decentralized organization</a> brings with them a unique profile of knowledge, skills and interests. I have always had a passion for the discipline of sales. But as a third-generation salesman on my father’s side, I am frequently disgraced by the state of the trade. The word “salesman” often conjures up visions of a pushy vacuum peddler on your doorstep, a slippery used car dealer or an overpaid executive who is better at golf than he is at demonstrating the product that his company manufactures. This is not the vision I have of sales as a vocation or as an art.</p><p>Illustrated broadly, everyone is engaged in sales. Most sales people know this. There is nothing invasive about representing oneself in a conscious manner, sharing a vision and educating in a way that caters to individual differences. Sales is about influencing the perspectives of others to motivate behavioral change. Nowhere in that process does a salesperson have to sacrifice honesty, integrity or reputation.</p><p>Throughout this article, I will refer to anyone we might be pitching Bitcoin to as a “customer.” This isn’t meant to be cold and impersonal, but rather an illustrative metaphor. There are tools which can assist us in developing an effective approach to discussing Bitcoin with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-needs-a-marketing-department">prospective customers</a>. </p><p>The following information is a summary of what I have found to be effective in pitching Bitcoin and my best attempt at describing the attitudes which have supported the greatest success stories. </p><h2>The Outer Strategy</h2><p>The Bitcoin sales cycle is long. Bitcoin isn’t just sold once, it’s sold continuously every moment that a person chooses to hold it. Bitcoin is conceptualized and utilized differently by each participant in the network based on their unique needs and lifestyle choices. Due to the longevity and complexity of a proper Bitcoin pitch, I have found that “<a href="https://challengerinc.com/the-challenger-books/">The Challenger Sale</a>” model is especially well suited for selling Bitcoin.</p><p>“The Challenger Sale” by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson outlines research on sales performance across many industries and outlines <a href="https://www.impactplus.com/blog/the-5-types-of-sellers-of-the-challenger-sale">five basic types</a> of salespeople. The salespeople who consistently outperformed their counterparts, during strong as well as weak economic conditions, fell under the category that the book is named after. These sales people had certain traits in common and in my observation, many Bitcoiners exemplify these traits as well. I will touch on the research findings briefly, but if you want a deeper dive into nuances of the topic, I would recommend picking up a copy of the book.</p><p>“Challengers,” as they are differentiated from their counterparts, frequently hold a unique <a href="https://www.hope.com/">view of the world</a>, they love to debate, they are not afraid to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/op-ed-why-bitcoins-toxic-maximalism-makes-sense">push</a> the customer and they have a deep understanding of the customer’s business. From my interactions with Bitcoiners over the years, I see these qualities very frequently. Challengers also tend to find themselves in teaching roles, which is reflected through the many books and podcasts created as Bitcoin educational tools. </p><p>The challenger is well read on every aspect of the sale and can preempt arguments against their points of view. Achieving this degree of intellectual karate may lead you toward reading about economics, engineering, psychology, history, philosophy, spirituality, physics and ecology. In order to approach a topic holistically, one must understand the foundations, the arguments and the counterarguments. Be ready not just to agree or disagree, but to provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning if required. </p><p>Every person you interact with will have a different path to understanding Bitcoin. Certain key pieces of information will ignite a fire of interest in one person and have no effect on another. Learn to find these key areas of interest through practice and repetition. As a general tip, I have found that pitching Bitcoin to people close to my own age is more effective than trying to sell across generational gaps. Studying <a href="https://postimg.cc/rRLtZjdw">integral theory</a> is helpful with the process of understanding customer value systems as well.</p><p>There is a critical balance to be achieved regarding debate and pushing the customer. When you are pushing the customer, keep the conversation friendly. It is possible to chip away at someone’s defenses with humor and creativity rather than by annoying or humiliating them. Emotional intelligence is required to find the right balance between pushing, pulling and resting. </p><p>It’s important to be up front about bitcoin’s performance over the short term and the long term. It is your job to carefully gauge the customer's risk tolerance and conviction in the face of volatility. If you get the impression that someone is buying just because they trust what you are saying, tread carefully. Unless the person you are speaking with understands how to responsibly self custody and to avoid trading on leverage, you may want to dissuade them from buying in large amounts. If your customer bites off more than they can chew and gets burned, it will take them even longer to benefit from Bitcoin.</p><p>Customers who walk away from a conversation having learned something valuable are much more likely to pick up the phone and call that salesperson back. However, there is a difference between being a source of knowledge and being a firehouse of unsolicited opinions. Sometimes, the best way to start a teaching discussion is to ask some questions. Effective teaching is not a forceful process. It is your job to pique the interest of whoever you are speaking with so that they begin to request further information. Try to avoid going on <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sperg%20out">extensive monologues</a> and maintain engagement from whoever you are speaking with.</p><p>Tailoring a pitch to a grocery store cashier or to a hedge-fund manager will be very different discussions. These approaches are unique for each individual, but there are two primary categories: One approach is bottom up (related to price inflation) and the other is top down (related to central banking and market forces). Both begin with a discussion around the dollar and how it functions. Most people will dismiss Bitcoin as pointless until they understand the problem it is solving. When discussing the <a href="https://saifedean.com/the-fiat-standard-chapter-1">fiat problem</a>, I have found that speaking rationally about poorly-aligned incentives is generally more effective than launching into a verbal summary of “The Creature From Jekyll Island.” </p><p>The corporate media has been fairly effective at turning the word “Bitcoin” into something scary. Most of the time, I don’t even say the word “Bitcoin” until I get a clear sign of engagement. Open-ended questions are an effective way to gauge the level of understanding you’re cooperating with. For example,“How much do you know about Bitcoin?” or, “If I provided you with infinite funds, describe how you would attack the Bitcoin network or stop people from using it.” Leave room for the customer to <a href="https://www.runn.io/blog/never-split-the-difference-summary">disagree with you</a> and take their disagreement as a positive step in the debate process.</p><p>The ability to transcend political discussions makes controlling the direction of the conversation much easier. Money supersedes politics and the discussion can always be returned to the banking system. I continuously maintain that whatever political issue may be irritating the customer, it will only get worse until the money is fixed. Any effort to fix a societal problem without fixing the money is like using a bucket to throw water out of a ship without addressing the hole causing the ship to sink. </p><p>Remember to be measured in your approach. You don’t have anything to prove to anyone. Don’t forget what is most important to you and don’t get caught up in the desire to be right or to prove someone else wrong. When you’re laying on your deathbed, you won’t be kicking yourself for failing to orange pill a relative at Thanksgiving, but you might regret burning a bridge with someone you love over an unnecessary argument.</p><h2>The Inner Game</h2><p>Book smarts and creative problem solving are important tools, but when it comes to sales, the most critical skill to develop is emotional attunement. An effective salesperson will accurately read the emotional tone of the conversation in real time and adjust their approach as needed. There are a number of skills involved in this form of emotional intelligence, the most important of which is learning to accurately read and interpret <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/non-verbal-communication">nonverbal communication</a>. </p><p>In my experience, the primary impediment to emotional attunement is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Earth">egotistical dysfunction</a> on the part of the salesperson. The ego is critical to human functioning and is not to be vilified, but it should not be running the show either. The degree to which a salesperson can relate to a prospective customer is a question of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiSsxVM0B-U">spiritual development</a> more than business acumen. Nothing is more attractive or conducive to building trust than authenticity and honesty. In order to live with authenticity, we are required to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61315.The_Presence_Process">face discomfort</a> and integrate the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/179FNB8TC1KikVhii4kEgQ?si=2e625aa1d6e5405a">aspects of ourselves</a> that we reject. Without understanding your own intentions, you cannot understand the intentions of others. </p><p>Present yourself in the most transparent way possible. Deceitful action and hypocrisy are repulsive to the human spirit. The fiat system has a way of holding us hostage in situations which pressure us to compromise our values. As a result, we find ourselves alienated from our true intentions and separated from authentic relationships. Bitcoin enables us to liberate ourselves from these discouraging moral concessions, if we wish to do so.</p><p>Regardless of the behavior of those struggling to maintain a broken system, Bitcoiners can choose to persevere in equanimity. This temperament can only serve to vaporize phony criticisms of Bitcoin with the light of truth. Maintaining the higher ground will depend on a certain degree of personal and collective purification. Admit your faults and shortcomings without any reservation as soon as you perceive them. Striving to prove others wrong is a silly game which benefits no one. Striving to be effective in <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-argue-win-every-time-gerry-spence/1111811437">achieving your goals</a> is a worthwhile undertaking.</p><p>If you let your ego enter the Bitcoin sales pitch, you are more likely to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Agreements">take criticisms personally</a> and the conversation will drift into alienation. If you approach the discussion honestly and <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/what-is-nvc">compassionately</a>, you will create an ally rather than an enemy. I have often encountered a tremendous amount of resistance in conversations about Bitcoin and returned to that person months later to find that they have internalized much of what I said. </p><p>If the conversation remains respectful, you can walk away and let the orange marinade do its work. This is especially true as bank failures and inflation continue to draw attention to the issue at hand. Very few people are ready to change their minds in a single conversation. In fact, my recommendation would be to forego the intent to change anyone’s mind, but rather to provide information so that your acquaintance can reach their own conclusion. </p><p>When anger enters a discussion about Bitcoin, your customer will fail to see the countless hours of research you have applied to understanding the topic. If you get rattled by their questions or comments, they will only see fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you strike a condescending tone, you run the risk of pushing them away from Bitcoin rather than compelling them to learn more about it. If you feel animosity arising, take a step back and breathe.</p><p>Another common sales pitfall worth avoiding is “trash talking the competition.” It might be tempting to attack fiat currencies, stocks, bonds, altcoins or gold. Attacks like this exhibit weakness. Handling objections with grace develops confidence in the person you are speaking with. People are often very emotionally attached to their investments. Attacking them will cause the customer to double down and become much less open to hearing what you have to say. I do not denounce anyone for making certain investments, but I will gladly explain why bitcoin is likely to be superior in comparison to other assets.</p><blockquote><p>“It is only against the big waves that (a surfer) is required to use all his skill, all his courage and concentration to overcome; only then can he realize the true limits of his capacities. At that point he often slips into a superconscious state and attains his peak. In other words, the more challenging the obstacle he faces, the greater the opportunity for the surfer to discover and extend his true potential. The potential may have always been within him, but until it is manifested in action, it remains a secret hidden from himself. The obstacles are a very necessary ingredient to this process of self-discovery. Note that the surfer in this example is not out to prove himself; he is not out to show himself or the world how great he is, but is simply involved in the exploration of his latent capacities. He directly and intimately experiences his own resources and thereby increases his self-knowledge.”&nbsp;</p><p>–Timothy Gallwey, “<a href="https://mentoringgroup.com/books/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf">The Inner Game Of Tennis</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The above quote is no excuse for misleading unsuspecting financial refugees. Clown coins, vaporware and moral hazard should be dismissed resolutely. Those who support such misguided activities should be discredited mercilessly. However, all of this can be accomplished without losing your cool. Holding on to hate will not benefit you in any way. Always be ready for your detractors to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:3-4&amp;version=NIV">switch to your side</a>. There is no need to make it harder for them to do so by treating them in a cruel manner. </p><p>I have found it helpful to frame all forms of “altcoin” investing as gambling behavior. In this way, I can view these choices through the lens of <a href="https://drgabormate.com/book/in-the-realm-of-hungry-ghosts/">addictive compulsion</a> rather than stupidity or some other judgmental interpretation. I do not enable addictive behavior by accepting excuses, but I do not criticize it either. The road out of addiction is often barricaded by trauma and maladaptive assumptions. Harsh judgment does not assist in dissolving these barriers, but rather reinforces the separation between the real world and the addict.</p><p>The only reason I am able to write this article is because I have broken every suggestion in it at one point or another and witnessed the results. I may continue to break these recommendations in the future, but I maintain a continuous practice of humility, compassion and patience. Self judgment stifles growth more than it fosters it. If you punish yourself for behaving differently than you would like, your actions will become contrivances; like a child who is constantly afraid of their <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111209.Unconditional_Parenting">parent’s scorn</a>. This will likely counteract any efforts you apply toward living with more authenticity. </p><p>Acting out of a genuine desire to enhance life will help you to root into a more authentic lifestyle. That type of authenticity is magnetic. Look inward at your reservations and intentions. If you are trying to orange pill others to convince yourself of Bitcoin’s value or to prove yourself to the world, you will be better served by reserving your opinions until you no longer have these insecurities. If you are beyond the need for approval, your rate of success will increase dramatically. Act on the truth that you know. Unlike Bitcoin, you don’t need consensus for validation.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Source Node.

    </figure><p>My husband and I decided to become Bitcoin educators because we passionately believe that Bitcoin is a money standard everyone should know about. However, it can be very discouraging sometimes when most people see us as religious, cult evangelists who they should avoid or only politely tolerate. </p><p>But then, out of the blue, I’ll experience amazing conversations with people who are ready to hear what we have to say. They are just waiting to find someone to discuss Bitcoin who can help them understand it better.</p><p>This article describes three such encounters I’ve had in unexpected places. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1339572-when-the-student-is-ready-the-teacher-will-appear-when">As the saying goes</a>, (slightly modified), “When the student is ready, the teacher (me) will be sent to them.”</p><h2>One: GoDaddy Tech Support</h2><p>A few months ago, when my husband Scott and I were just starting our financial-literacy- and Bitcoin-focused organization <a href="https://www.freemarketkids.com/">Free Market Kids</a>, we had a lot of trouble getting our website to work correctly. I spent hours with tech support through various service providers. During this incident, I called GoDaddy support and was instructed to reboot my computer. </p><p>While we were waiting for the computer to do its thing, instead of sitting on the line in silence, I began to chit chat with the support guy about where he was located, the weather, etc. Pretty soon, we were asking each other about our work and life experiences. </p><p>He asked, “So, what is Free Market Kids?” </p><p>“Well, we teach people about Bitcoin and money with our board games,” I answered.</p><p>“Bitcoin!” Sighing deeply, he continued, “I sold mine years ago.” </p><p>He explained that, early on, he had been persuaded by his friend to mine Bitcoin. When the price went up, he got excited and sold all his bitcoin because he needed the cash for something. </p><p>“And now,” he lamented, “I’m watching the bitcoin price go up like crazy, and I can’t believe I blew my chance!”</p><p>I asked him what he knew about Bitcoin, aside from what his friend told him to do. </p><p>“Very little,” he replied. </p><p>So, I explained the fundamental properties of Bitcoin to him and pointed out that he could always get back in. Thirty minutes later, long after my computer had rebooted and the original issue was resolved, we finally ended the call.</p><p>I was so excited about the conversation I went to tell my husband about it. </p><p>“I thought you were on GoDaddy support?” Scott asked.</p><p>“I was!” I responded excitedly.</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><h2>Two: The Veterinary Office</h2><p>In preparation for some conferences we were attending, I designed a company t-shirt. Unfortunately, the first batch didn’t turn out well, so I decided to wear it around the house. Remembering a veterinarian appointment at the last minute, I rushed out with our dog, forgetting that I was sporting our company shirt.</p><p>After getting checked in and ushered to a tiny exam room, I sat down to wait with my elderly standard poodle, Ava, panting by my side. Moments later, the door opened, and the vet tech walked in, clipboard in hand. He looked at me without saying anything and squinted his eyes. </p><p>“Uh, do I have something on my face?” I thought, feeling a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>Then he broke the awkward silence and said, “Bitcoin, huh?”</p><p>“Yes?” I answered tentatively, looking down at my shirt.</p><p>“I have some questions for you!” he boomed. “Someone told me that bitcoin will go to zero. What do you think?” </p><p>“Uh, right… What do you know about Bitcoin in general?” I responded.</p><p>“Not much,” he admitted.</p><p>We chatted about Bitcoin, and he had endless questions. I watched the pen in his hand hover over Ava’s chart, but we didn’t talk about that patient, panting dog for a long time.</p><p>The vet visit that was supposed to take 20 minutes ended up taking an hour and a half.</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><h2>Three: The Jewelry Store</h2><p>I went to a jewelry store to replace a broken necklace. Once again, I was wearing our company shirt and running errands. Two ladies stood behind the counter. While one was packing up my purchase, the other eyed me intently, leaned toward me, and whispered, “My brother is into cryptocurrency, but I don’t understand it. I know the economy is going to sh*t, but I don’t have a million dollars to invest in bitcoin.” </p><p>She continued, her eyes filled with tears, “I’m a single mom, and I’m scared of what’s going to happen.” </p><p>She looked tired, discouraged and very concerned.</p><p>“You don’t need a million dollars to invest in bitcoin,” I answered. “You can start with very small amounts, $1 or $5.” </p><p>We chatted for a long time, and I hugged her before we said goodbye. </p><p>“There’s a reason we met today,” I told her. “Reach out to me any time!”</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><p>And, oh, maybe I should wear our company shirt more often!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tali Lindberg.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Steven Hay, a writer, former trader and art dealer.</em></p><p>I’m a long-time Bitcoiner, preparing to travel and hopefully relocate permanently to El Salvador in 2023. Like many Bitcoiners, I wish to be a part of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/what-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-brought">amazing changes</a> happening in this country. And I’d like to share an idea which I strongly believe has the potential to accelerate those changes.</p><p>Similar to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">volcano bond concept</a>, this idea employs Bitcoin-linked assets to raise funds for the building of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-released-model-of-bitcoin-city">Bitcoin City</a>, or any other worthy project. Unlike bonds, however, these relatively-straightforward assets impose no legal or financial obligations upon the nation. They are simply created and then sold on the free market.</p><p>My idea revolves around something many of you have heard of: Bitcoin Ordinals. This new protocol, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals">launched in January 2023</a>, allows for the creation of “Bitcoin NFTs” linked to single satoshis. Known as “inscriptions,” these special satoshis are bound to data which is permanently embedded within Bitcoin’s blockchain. This data can take the form of images, text, video, etc.</p><p>Mere months after its creation, this new form of digital asset has already received considerable investment, with <a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces">at least $21 million in volume traded over the six major marketplaces</a> and additional trades conducted over the counter.. Galaxy Research<a href="https://www.galaxy.com/research/whitepapers/bitcoin-ordinals-inscriptions-5-billion-nft-market/"> estimates</a> that the Ordinals market will grow to $4.5 billion in total value by 2025. This figure may well prove to be conservative — especially if the government of El Salvador becomes an official participant in this space.</p><p>Already, renowned luxury goods makers like Bugatti and Asprey are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bugatti-and-asprey-announce-bitcoin-inscriptions">involved</a> in Ordinals. If private companies are expected to achieve millions of dollars in sales in this new market, how much more could a sovereign state achieve? As the Ordinals market matures and begins to attract mainstream investment, it seems certain that collections of historical significance will reach valuations which reflect their importance and rarity.</p><p>My suggestion is that the government of El Salvador continue to successfully implement new ideas by releasing an official Bitcoin Ordinals collection. Perhaps such a collection might comprise art or photography which highlight the country’s natural beauty, architecture and culture. Alternatively, it might feature scans of official documents relating to the new Bitcoin laws or Bitcoin City plans. Such inscriptions might confer certain benefits to their owners, such as discounts on government service fees. The purchase of a governmental inscription might even form part of a future El Salvadoran <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-citizenship-by-investment">citizenship by investment</a> (CBI) program. The possibilities are virtually endless.</p><p>Furthermore, I believe that the potential upsides are high while the risks are low and manageable. I believe that the goodwill of Bitcoiners and the world’s interest in El Salvador’s rapid improvement will lead to a great demand for what might be called its “national digital art treasures.” If the technical and creative aspects are handled correctly by the relevant professionals, I believe that such an endeavor can only bring great benefits to the people of El Salvador and to the global Bitcoin community.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Steven Hay.

    </figure><p>Through a partnership with exchange eToro, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/twitter-to-add-bitcoin-investing-in-partnership-with-etoro">Twitter recently added</a> the ability for users to invest into assets with $Cashtags, which also expanded the number of financial assets that users can see real-time prices for when using the feature. The partnership covered $Cashtags representing a wide range of instruments on the eToro platform, including bitcoin. Users can now click through to the eToro platform to see more information on the asset and have the option to invest. The $Cashtags feature has seen widespread adoption with reportedly more than 420 million searches for $Cashtags since the start of the year. $BTC (bitcoin) ranked in the top five most-searched for $Cashtags.</p><p>In an interview with a spokesperson for eToro, when asked about the vision and goal behind this partnership, they stated that “the goal of the partnership is to help people feel comfortable taking ownership of their financial futures by increasing engagement with and the accessibility of financial news and education.” <br><br>“Twitter has become a crucial part of the retail investing community — it’s where millions of ordinary investors go every day to access financial news, share knowledge and converse,” the individual speaking on behalf of the company said.</p><p>Keeping in mind the goal of providing access to financial information and education, “we hope we’re able to introduce investors to new and/or different tactics to diversify their portfolios,” the spokesperson explained.<br><br>According to eToro’s spokesperson, Twitter users have a young demographic, who typically have a longer investing timeline, similar to the user makeup of eToro's platform.</p><p>When asked about further integration with Twitter and bitcoin acceptance for Twitter Blue, eToro’s spokesperson did not provide any specifics but mentioned that they are always looking for ways to innovate and develop new products and partnerships. They confirmed that in partnership with Twitter, they hope to introduce more educational resources about bitcoin and other financial assets to their users through this partnership, but for now, eToro is focused on making the $Cashtags partnership a success. <br><br>eToro’s spokesperson said that the company believes that the future of investing is social investing and fostering dialogue in large networks, and that the inherent short form and ease of messaging on Twitter appeals to today’s investor. “Twitter is a space for conversation, where networking and interesting financial dialogue take place, eToro is a financial services provider built on the belief that social investing is the part of the future and that we can all do better by investing together and fostering dialogue in large networks,” they reiterated.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MjQwNDMz/bitcoin-price-market-analysis.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Culture War Won’t Win Mass Adoption]]></title><description><![CDATA[Prominent Bitcoiners, many of whom advocate “lifestyle maximalism,” may be hurting adoption by leaning in one political direction.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-bitcoin-culture-skew-right</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-bitcoin-culture-skew-right</guid><category><![CDATA[Influencers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Libertarians]]></category><category><![CDATA[Progressives]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Trey Walsh]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMzA4MDI5NDE1NjYzMTM3/aa-btc-2.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Prominent Bitcoiners, many of whom advocate “lifestyle maximalism,” may be hurting adoption by leaning in one political direction.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Trey Walsh, the senior director for youth programs at the MassHire Metro North Workforce Board in Somerville, Massachusetts.</em></p><p>Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has caught the world by storm, leaving many stumped by its continued adoption and growing number of use cases, and leading many others to continually dismiss it or manufacture cultural and political narratives about it to satisfy their own agendas. </p><p>We will never know the true intentions behind the creation of Bitcoin due to the pseudonymity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, but it is widely believed that Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and a widespread distrust of traditional financial institutions. Since 2008, this distrust of financial institutions, our political system and global organizations such as the World Bank and World Economic Forum has arguably continued to grow, while Bitcoin gains steam and interest continues to pique in its direction. </p><p>As more and more folks begin to notice Bitcoin, they also tend to notice what I consider to be Bitcoin’s “social layer” — and in this context, I’m referring to the range of social and cultural norms and values that have emerged among its users and biggest voices. </p><p>Every movement — in this case, a technological and monetary revolution — has a social layer and culture. Bitcoin is a complex and evolving phenomenon, with many nuances, but I would argue it is one that has been dominated, at least in the context of the United States, by those on the political right — ranging from those with far-right wing, fringe ideologies to Libertarians to mainstream Republicans. </p><p>This dominance resonates for liberal democracies throughout the West, but as an American, I will focus on the U.S. While Bitcoin users and holders may vary greatly across the social, cultural and political spectrums, many of Bitcoin’s biggest proponents and greatest public figures would identify most often with the political right and are predominately white men. </p><p>This is a value-neutral statement; an observation of the current demographic and ideological camp of prominent Bitcoiners. However, many people I know have been “turned off” from Bitcoin because they don’t see their values represented in the community. Those from marginalized groups, the LGBTQ+ community, progressives and many others can become distracted and outright dismiss Bitcoin as one of the fringe or radical ideas that have come from prominent Bitcoiners or prominent conservative politicians who express support for Bitcoin. </p><p>I would perhaps be saying the same thing if prominent Bitcoiners were arguing for far-left, fringe ideas as well. It doesn't help that many in the mainstream media have associated Bitcoin with <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/far-right-extremists-raise-millions-cryptocurrency-bitcoin/">white supremacy fundraising</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/crypto-mining-could-hinder-battle-against-climate-change-white-house.html">escalating global warming concerns</a> and a range of other biased attacks. But in any case, I believe that, for Bitcoin adoption to grow, Bitcoiners — and, in particular, prominent Bitcoin educators, public figures, etc. — must focus on the ideals, values and benefits of Bitcoin for <em>everyone</em>. In doing so, we may build the greatest and most diverse coalition of people fighting for a cause that our nation or world have ever seen. This coalition and community should have their values rooted in the fundamentals and spirit of Bitcoin, not merely in what has been viewed as mainly conservative ideology. </p><h2>This Progressive’s Bitcoin Battle</h2><p>Speaking from my own experience, when I really began to study Bitcoin in the spring of 2021, the first place I went to to learn more and get recommendations on who to follow, which books and resources to read, etc., was Twitter. Prior to my journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I viewed crypto as something for “crypto bros,” number-go-up technology and generally something I didn’t personally align with as a progressive and nonprofit professional. </p><p>Thankfully, I soon discovered folks like Alex Gladstein, who spoke of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/alexgladstein">Bitcoin’s human-rights-promoting qualities</a>, and Willy Woo, who spoke of <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/willy-woo">Bitcoin on-chain research</a>. Soon after, I purchased “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and was captivated by the history and the argument for the economics of Bitcoin and explored more concepts in Austrian economics. I was sold on the benefits and arguments for Bitcoin, and since then I have read countless other books and articles that have deepened my knowledge and conviction for Bitcoin. </p><p>At the time, I peripherally understood that the Bitcoin community and many of its main proponents in the West and United States leaned Libertarian. Once you go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and are convicted enough to label yourself a Bitcoiner, it's hard not to accept some Libertarian-leaning arguments and become skeptical of our current system. Bitcoin is, after all, the separation of money from state, and decentralized to the point that it is censorship resistant and holds firm to many economic principles sought after by the Austrian economic camp. </p><p>As I continued to trek through a wide variety of content from Bitcoiners, I noticed many seemed to be focusing a lot of time and energy on things that had little to do directly with Bitcoin and much more to do with a disdain for progressives, vaccinations and the LGBTQ+ and trans communities, and the promotion of gun culture, a carnivore diet, many far right, anarcho-capitalist ideals and more. </p><p>For me, as a progressive, it was distracting and at times deeply infuriating. Surely everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and I personally am a bit of a free-speech maximalist, but many of these folks have prominent Bitcoin podcasts, books or articles, and have professed that they want to increase Bitcoin adoption and have the world move toward a Bitcoin standard. One such interaction early on convinced me to explore the cultural/political side of Bitcoin more, as I felt it posed a significant threat to increased adoption and was much more likely to be co-opted by political factions, partisanship and nefarious actors. </p><p>I was following Ammous on Twitter. I have since been blocked so, unfortunately, I am unable to quote the exact tweets, but he was tweeting about a carnivore diet, the benefits of this and the risks of veganism, etc. As a vegan and Bitcoiner, I responded, as I believe “thought leaders” in the space should be exposed to a wide variety of views and the experiences of their audiences and others in the community. I was respectful, but responded stating that I am a vegan and I grow weary of associating Bitcoin so strictly with any diet or lifestyle, as he was arguing, and also associating particular diets with a “fiat” mindset, as he has in countless talks, articles and his book “The Fiat Standard.” He responded by stating that, because I was vegan, I was malnourished and he seemed to have a distaste for my presence in the community of Bitcoiners. Now, with his book being the first that I read in the space, it was a bit shocking to see how quickly he attacked a view that dissentented from his own. Surely, Bitcoin is for everyone and that community is going to have a diverse set of opinions and perspectives, right? </p><p>This is just one example of many that I have witnessed. I’m not here to harp on toxic Bitcoin Maximalism, personal stories of silly, unkind interactions on a social media app, but there are questions to be asked about when and why this community evolved into its current form, dominated by right-leaning ideology, while the general population of crypto and bitcoin investors is actually quite diverse politically, ideologically, racially, etc. </p><h2>When Did Bitcoin Become Associated With The Right?</h2><p>For that, I would refer you to Jameson Lopp’s recent article, “<a href="https://blog.lopp.net/history-of-bitcoin-maximalism/">A History Of Bitcoin Maximalism</a>.” As I mentioned, I began studying Bitcoin in early 2021 — so much of this culture and evolution occurred prior to my time in the Bitcoin social space. But it’s worth noting that, circa 2018 and on, “Bitcoin Maximalism” as many know of it today really gained steam and transformed into what Lopp calls “lifestyle maximalists,” who are focused on things such as a carnivore diet, conservative Christian identities, “traditional” values, weightlifting, guns, etc. This was further amplified by COVID-19, with lockdowns, government intervention, vaccines, etc. This exists to this day, but is slowly evolving with the understanding that more diverse voices are entering the space, such as progressives and environmentalists who see the humanitarian and positive environmental benefits that Bitcoin offers. </p><p>As I’ve stated, I personally identify as a progressive, but my intention is not to have progressive voices (which span a wide variety of perspectives and opinions, I should add, for those who have cast all of “us” as the same) be the dominant voices, but rather for the Bitcoin social community to reflect a more inclusive body of constituents, regardless of their political/lifestyle choices, which can all agree on the fundamentals of Bitcoin: the non-partisan, freedom money tool. </p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone, and its loudest champions and voices with the largest audiences should keep this in mind if they profess themselves to be Bitcoin Maximalists, freedom maximalists, seeking a bitcoin standard, seeking mainstream adoption, etc. I would ask these folks (many of whom I respect): What do you value more? Bitcoin education and its increased adoption to create a better world, or your audience-capture bent towards “lifestyle maximalism”?</p><p>Since Bitcoin is for everyone, we all must be aware of the diversity of views and identities out there. If you’re immediate rebuttal is, “Well, stop trying to make Bitcoin political,” or, “If someone’s opinion gets in the way of someone getting bitcoin, then they don’t deserve it anyway,” ask yourself two things: Do you come from the “dominant” position within the outspoken Bitcoin community (right leaning and/or libertarian)? And what is your opposition to helping onboard folks to Bitcoin who may be turned off by views they consider fringe or off putting? </p><p>I fear many prominent Bitcoiners are not taking seriously enough this “social layer,” as a factor in Bitcoin’s global adoption and ultimate success, exclaiming things like, “Bitcoin has already won,” “you can’t stop Bitcoin,” “everyone gets bitcoin at the price they deserve," etc. </p><p>As great as a technology is and can be, one that all us Bitcoiners see endless possibility and hope for humanity in, I do worry that we are at a critical point — one that I believe will succeed ultimately, by the way — where culturally, the Bitcoin community must broaden its horizon, become more inclusive and mainstream with its narratives, or else adoption could slow or stop altogether. I know that many media outlets will not stop their false tirades against Bitcoin, but the community doesn’t help itself if prominent Bitcoiners continue to obsess over diets, anti-vaccine takes, patriarchal traditional values, attacking and dismissing anyone that doesn’t agree with their political perspective as “brainwashed by the fiat machine.” </p><h2>Bitcoin And The ‘Climate Crisis’</h2><p>One such example that many prominent Bitcoiners are adamant about refuting is climate change or the “climate crisis.” As a progressive, vegan and environmentalist, I am deeply concerned about the data-supported climate change that we are seeing and I do see this as a crisis that is in need of creative solutions (<a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/can-bitcoin-mining-save-the-environment">many of which, I think, can be found in bitcoin mining</a>). </p><p>I do believe there is much to be debated in terms of <em>addressing </em>this issue, but the fact of the matter is, the majority of Americans believe <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/15/poll-climate-change-americans-congress">climate change is happening</a> and that more should be done to address this. However, many prominent Bitcoiners have argued there is <a href="https://twitter.com/MartyBent/status/1645488341062676480?s=20">no climate crisis</a>, and some in fact have argued that more <a href="https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1647361326153342976?s=20">carbon is good for our planet</a>. </p><p>While I believe that much of the rhetoric from Bitcoiners combating the notion of a climate crisis is in response to governments who may be taking harsh stances against fossil fuels, which could put the stability of grids at risk or force reliance on other nations’ energy sources, this type of rhetoric can turn away large portions of the population. With increased attacks on Bitcoin from politicians like Elizabeth Warren and news outlets such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">The New York Times</a>, it’s important for Bitcoiners to set the record straight while also putting forth arguments that many Americans can grasp and understand from their political worldviews. </p><p>In fact, many environmentalists who support Bitcoin see huge potential in bitcoin mining and its ability to utilize more renewable energy sources, and more focus on this argument from folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/thetrocro">Troy Cross</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jyn_urso">Margot Paez</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten">Daniel Batten</a> is helping the mainstream audience see Bitcoin as a potential tool in the renewable energy transition. </p><p>Folks arguing against labeling our climate change as a “climate crisis” are free to express their views, but must also understand the effect this may have on increasing Bitcoin adoption among a population that predominantly believes climate change is real and that we must do more to address fossil fuel/carbon emissions. </p><p>The fact of the matter is that the average American does not care about the Bitcoin white paper, best practices for privacy, the Bitcoin block size or most of the “lifestyle maximalism” takes. And I believe many will be among the last to realize the importance of Bitcoin because they have a fairly stable currency, comfortable living standards, etc. </p><p>But what people can start to gravitate toward are what all of us gravitated toward from the beginning: Bitcoin is a great savings account, it protects human rights globally, it has a fixed supply so it’s deflationary, it’s easy to use and send domestically and globally and you can own it in self custody — no bank IOUs and no trust! </p><p>With our focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin, we may begin to move past and beyond its political, partisan takes and into mass global adoption. </p><h2>The Road To Mass Adoption</h2><p>As we’ve seen, there is evidence to suggest that support for Bitcoin from the general population is more varied across the political and identity spectrums than one might think if they only pay attention to Twitter, mainstream media articles and the loudest voices. As many know at this point, social media is a poor indicator of where the majority of people lie on issues. Social media tends to bring out the most extreme views — for instance, those from the far right and far left — creating arguments that generate engagement rather than true representation of the diverse community that tends to lean toward a moderate view. </p><p>I would argue that Bitcoin, just like many other issues in our world, has been co-opted by political extremes and by “lifestyle maximalists,” and that the road to mass adoption is in ensuring that we explain the fundamentals of Bitcoin that appeal to the masses, rather than the co-opted fringe views that have little or nothing to do with Bitcoin. </p><p>This is not about censoring views or speech, but rather about encouraging those Bitcoiners in positions of power and influence to keep in mind the diversity of our population and the hope for Bitcoin’s mass adoption. In politics and in life, those in positions of power often engage in rhetoric and topics that are actually a distraction from the real issues average citizens face. As folks continue to wake up to this reality, as inflation grows, the state of our economy continues to erode, more folks continue to ask questions — the same questions being asked after the 2008 financial crisis. Why is wealth inequality so high? Why are my savings dwindling and affording things is growing harder by the year? Do politicians even care? </p><p>As the distrust in government and financial institutions continues to grow, we have a real opportunity to present folks with the alternative and the hope that Bitcoin brings to our world — a tool that separates money from the State; doesn’t require trust; is verifiable and decentralized through the blockchain, miners and full-node operators; and provides people with savings that won’t erode over time to reward their hard work. </p><p>Bitcoin is non-partisan, and I don’t think fringe arguments from Bitcoin “lifestyle maximalists” that go against majority-held beliefs and opinions help Bitcoin’s continued widespread adoption. Luckily, more folks in the Bitcoin community are waking up to this, and more diverse opinions and perspectives are flooding into the Bitcoin community to truly represent the masses, the everyday citizen. Bitcoin is for everyone, and the more that the Bitcoin community reflects that, the closer we will be to mass adoption. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Trey Walsh.

    </figure><p>Bitcoin Magazine has announced the launch of its new book publishing branch, Bitcoin Magazine Books. The venture aims to provide readers with educational literature on Bitcoin, its impact on global economies and its role in shaping the world's financial future. As the adoption of Bitcoin increases, the need for accurate and informative resources becomes crucial in understanding the complex topics surrounding Bitcoin and navigating the rapidly evolving landscape.</p><p>The launch of Bitcoin Magazine Books is marked by the release of two new publications, "Hidden Repression" by Alex Gladstein and "A Progressive's Case for Bitcoin" by C. Jason Maier. These publications are not just for Bitcoin enthusiasts, but for anyone interested in global economic and political developments.</p><p>"<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/hidden-repression">Hidden Repression</a>" by Alex Gladstein addresses how the world's monetary system exploits the weak and how citizens in the global south are turning to Bitcoin as a way out. Gladstein states, "I’m delighted to be working with Bitcoin Magazine to publish Hidden Repression, which seeks to illuminate the true nature of the world financial system and how, at its core, it remains a mechanism of the powerful stealing from the weak."</p><p>"<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/a-progressives-case-for-bitcoin">A Progressive's Case for Bitcoin</a>" by C. Jason Maier presents a well-researched and thoughtful case for the value of Bitcoin, grounded in fact and avoiding sensationalism and hype. Maier hopes to combat some of the misinformation that people often hear about this new technology, stating, "Bitcoin is our best chance to make the world more just, equitable and peaceful, and it is critically important that more people fully understand it."</p><p>Both books are available for purchase from the Bitcoin Magazine store for $29.99, and they will also be available for purchase at the upcoming <a href="http://b.tc/conference">Bitcoin 2023 Conference</a> in Miami on May 18-20. The authors will be present at the conference's general admission days, where they can sign the books at the Book Signing booth.</p><p>Bitcoin Magazine Books aims to publish high-quality books that offer readers valuable insights into Bitcoin's role in shaping the world's economic future. With the launch of these two new publications, Bitcoin Magazine Books is off to a strong start, and readers can look forward to more exciting books in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNDgzNTg3/bitcoin-to-the-moon.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Orange Pill App Is Accelerating Hyperbitcoinization In Real Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Orange Pill App brings Bitcoiners together, demonstrates demand for adoption to local businesses and propels the bitcoin standard.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/orange-pill-app-joins-bitcoin-in-person</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/orange-pill-app-joins-bitcoin-in-person</guid><category><![CDATA[Meetups]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Merchants]]></category><category><![CDATA[Orange Pill App]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robert Hall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:01:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4MTgwMTQ4ODgzODI2NDc0/20220318_btcfinal_attendingmeetups.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Orange Pill App brings Bitcoiners together, demonstrates demand for adoption to local businesses and propels the bitcoin standard.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner who has an Orange Pill App profile.</em></p><p>The team over at <a href="https://www.theorangepillapp.com/en">Orange Pill App</a> is breaking new ground toward Bitcoin adoption on a peer-to-peer level. But if you don’t know anything about this platform, here is a quick rundown: </p><p>It’s an app available on iOS or Android that helps you find local Bitcoiners in your area. How often have you felt like you are the only Bitcoiner in town? I know I have plenty of time. Wouldn’t it be nice to make new friends that love Bitcoin as much as you do in real life?</p><p>This is what the Orange Pill App is all about: building friendships and building a thriving Bitcoin community one meetup or connection at a time. As of this writing, there are thousands of users.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Users can list their Bitcoin-focused events and attract attendees from their areas. Source: Orange Pill App</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>In addition to helping you to find new Bitcoiners in your area, Orange Pill App is also on a mission to orange pill businesses. How much better would it be if we could spend sats at our local bars, hotels or restaurants? That would be awesome, right?</p><p>It definitely would add some rocket fuel toward the goal of achieving a bitcoin standard. To make this happen, <a href="https://medium.com/@orangepillapp/bridging-the-gap-orange-pill-app-and-btcmap-org-3552f1766339">Orange Pill App has partnered with BTCMap.org</a> to use demand-side pressure to orange pill merchants en masse.</p><p>When this new feature is launched, the app will be able to plug the number of its users into BTC Map to show how many Bitcoiners are in a given area. This data will be shown to business owners so they can understand if there is an active group of Bitcoiners ready to spend sats at their establishments.</p><p>This is a win for small business owners, because they can instantly gain new customers without advertising. Bitcoiners are eager to spend sats and support businesses that accept bitcoin. One thing I understand about Bitcoiners is they are loyal and believe in Bitcoin to the core of their beings.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Users can find Bitcoin-focused events happening near them. Source: Orange Pill App.</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>This is a win for Bitcoin educators as well. Instead of spending valuable time explaining Bitcoin's tenets to each individual business owner, those owners can see the demand with their own eyes. </p><p>And, once one business starts accepting bitcoin and seeing results, word will spread like wildfire among other business owners. It’s all about creating a network effect at the business level.</p><p>The road to hyperbitcoinization will take different methods and vectors to reach the masses. This could be a highly-effective method of orange pilling the people who we need to create a new Bitcoin-based economy!</p><p>My hat is off to the team over at Orange Pill App. I can’t wait to see what else it comes out with in the coming months and years. Remember: stacks friends who stack sats!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

The <a href="https://github.com/civkit/paper/blob/main/civ_kit_paper.pdf">paper</a> was authored by Antoine Riard, Nicholas Gregory and Ray Youssef, who have shared the paper with the Bitcoin developer community for feedback. The Civ Kit combines the Nostr architecture with the Lightning Network, prioritizing “privacy and security through escrowed trades, decentralized identity, moderation, a P2P messaging protocol, and know-your-peer (KYP) oracles for adjudication,” a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine stated. The system aims to support all kinds of trading, including goods and services.</p><p>“The researchers will gradually release code and modules, extensively building on top of the Lightning Dev Kit and Nostr libraries,” the press release explained. “Civ Kit development will bind to the same open-source and transparency standards as Bitcoin Core and libsecp256k1.”</p><p>The Civ Kit's design will emphasize trust and reputation within the marketplace, and the press release described how borrowing and lending can be added by using a universal credit score for all traders calculated by a combination of success of trades (Web-of-Stakes) and Web-of-Trust techniques that act as a “trustless source of truth.” The Civ Kit has been “peer-reviewed by some of the best minds in the Lightning and Discreet Log Contract engineering communities,” the press release said.</p><p>Nicholas Gregory, one of the authors of The Civ Kit, has been involved in developing Bitcoin infrastructure since 2016, and hopes that the initiative will boost Bitcoin's circular economy. He stated, "I truly hope this initiative serves as a unique piece of the puzzle to boost Bitcoin's circular economy, which, if we're honest, has not reached its full potential in 2023."</p><p>Ray Youssef, founder of Paxful and the Built With Bitcoin Foundation, another of the paper's authors, said he is committed to carrying on the work of Satoshi Nakamoto to provide the world with the ability to build unstoppable free markets. <br><br>“The title of the Bitcoin white paper spoke about ‘a peer-to-peer electronic cash system’ — yet the P2P industry is under attack from international powers who feed off centralized fiat currencies and the control they wield,” Youssef said. “At the same time, billions of people have been relegated to non-existence by this failed system. Bitcoin is the solution and we’re not backing down.”<br><br>The team behind the white paper is working to integrate the research into <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-entrepreneurs-introduce-noones-app-aimed-at-empowering-financial-freedom">Noones</a>, a new company dedicated to financial freedom in the Global South.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Frank Kashner, founder of UnChainDemocracy.org.</em></p><p>In 1971, I joined a communist party while working in the factory of the highest-paid General Electric (GE) defense plant in the country. I was repulsed by pictures of our military dropping napalm on Vietnamese children, convinced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/opinion/vietnam-war-necessary.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap">the justifications of our government </a>were lies, and I was drawn to the idea that “the working class” would soon take over the world and create a utopia. </p><p>The group that I joined was split off from the American Communist Party. It <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Say-Want-Revolution-Worker-Student/dp/0578406543">was supposed to be “democratic and centralist</a>.” I quit the group after two months when it tried to give me orders without understanding what was actually happening. I saw that it was all about Centralism without any democracy. But I stayed in the GE factory for 13 years, participating in movements that reformed both the worker’s union and GE.</p><p>But what about “revolution” and who are the “workers”? I did not have a violent bone in my body, and treated the terms “revolution” and “workers” like metaphors, not taken seriously by me or anyone else (including our probable FBI monitors). But the need for dramatic social and political change stayed with me, and my notion of the “workers” grew to include almost everyone who is not a billionaire or flunky. </p><p>Over the years, I have participated in personal, union, community, school, environmental and political reform efforts, always aware that, even though we often won victories, we were shoveling shit against the incoming tide of empire, greed, militarism, autocracy and disintegration. </p><p>In 2017, I met Bitcoin and was entranced by the idea of money that was independent of corporations and governments, that was limited to 21 million, created by solving math problems, guarded by vigilant nodes, decentralized and not rigged by and for the elite. Over this past year, I have learned from the brilliant Bitcoin community, including people like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50157837-the-price-of-tomorrow">Jeff Booth</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Jason Lowery</a>. Bitcoin is a tool of international, non-violent economic revolution against corruption. Bitcoin strikes at the heart of corporate and governmental theft from our families, of our labor, our property and our intellect. </p><h2>Wake Up To Bitcoin</h2><p>This applies to every governmental fiat, debt-based system in the world. In his magnificent book, “<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/statesofdamage/syllabus201516/graeber-debt_the_first_5000_years.pdf">Debt: The First 5,000 Years,”</a> David Graeber shows us how national, debt-based systems always result in inflation, and then in war and revolution. Bitcoin does not replace the need for political organizing and resistance, but I am now convinced that political and economic reform cannot succeed peacefully without Bitcoin. For the first time in history, Bitcoin offers a non-violent path to stable and increasing value of our labor, in all of its forms, for we “workers of the world.” Progressives have been slow to do the work to understand economics and Bitcoin, and to join this movement. To them, I say, “wake up!”</p><p>Many of you reading this have tried to reach friends and relatives about Bitcoin, often without success. For some of them, I have a possibly more compelling message.</p><p><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/statesofdamage/syllabus201516/graeber-debt_the_first_5000_years.pdf">Graeber</a> points out that our economy has depended upon military spending as great as all of the other nations of the world combined. This spending has in turn depended upon the dollar being the global reserve currency. Other nations are now moving away from the dollar. That movement, plus the billionaire wealth gap (grab), plus our current mountain of debt and the resulting inflation, is running out the clock of our economic system. This result follows:</p><p>Our crumbling infrastructure, insurance-dominated healthcare, insufficient housing, schools under attack, racism, misogyny, religious nationalism, an inability to respond to the destruction caused by global warming, and our dissolving social fabric are problems that cannot be solved under our current debt-based economic system. As our economy inevitably declines, every other just cause suffers. If you care about any of those things and the future of our children, then you need to learn about Bitcoin.</p><p>Every government in the world, capitalist and communist, is now deep in debt, the money stolen from current and future generations. They are all unsustainable, economically and environmentally. They are all Ponzi schemes. And like all Ponzi schemes, they depend upon our <a href="https://www.mackinac.org/OvertonWindow">knowledge, belief and acceptance</a> to keep going. Historically, systems that reached high levels of misery and inequality, ended in revolution, war or both.</p><h2>Bitcoin Changes Things</h2><p>For the first time in human history, we have a vehicle that goes to the heart of our financial and economic system. It is increasingly available for both savings and transactions. It steps around police and military batons, guns and tanks, and establishes unimpeachable value for our labor, for our remittances home, for our savings and our retirement. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Lowery posits </a>that Bitcoin can replace much of our over reliance on violent military (non)solutions.</p><p>The corruption of our political systems sits atop patronage and cultural hierarchies, some, centuries old, <a href="https://unchaindemocracy.org/democracy-in-chains-a-review">some modern</a>. The hierarchies, dominating both U.S. political parties, are designed to shield and obscure those responsible (remember <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/style/jeffrey-epstein-little-black-book.html">Jeffrey Epstein and his client book</a>?) and limit participation in organizations for change, including Bitcoin. Our ability to have a say in how we are governed, at the federal, state or city levels, is decreasing as schools and towns face budget shortfalls, in step with the declining value of the money in our pocket. </p><p>Our democracy is under attack. At every level. This decline, as measured by groups that <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/big-picture/Leveraging-big-ideas/flawed-democracy">track freedom</a> worldwide, corresponds to <a href="https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/2021?endYear=1971&amp;amount=100">the U.S. dollar’s decline in purchasing power</a>. The dollar (including the value of our labor) goes down, freedom goes down! Massive strikes, demonstrations and resistance to the disintegrating world order are occurring in other countries, but are poorly covered in our corporate media. </p><p>Teachers, medical and healthcare workers, farmers, machinists, retail workers, transportation workers, the underemployed, the unable to work, of all countries: it is time to unite. We have nothing to lose but the chains of billionaires, their flunkies, their rotten financial and political system and their often cruel or clueless managers. For the first time in history, we have a tool that values our labor and ideas, that steps around their corruption, that enables us to transfer value at the speed of light, to avoid their fees, to make use of stranded and wasted energy.</p><p>Bitcoin is a peaceful, worldwide economic revolution with profound social and political implications. No weapons other than your learning, imagination, courage and participation are required. And you will have to see through all of their propaganda, their fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) aimed to delay, devalue and defeat it.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Frank Kashner.

    </figure><p><a href="https://www.bitstack-app.com/en">Bitstack</a>, a bitcoin savings app in France, has announced a $2.1 million (€2 million) funding round. The funding comes from a range of investors, including Founders Future, Y Combinator and Kima Ventures, among others. The startup will use the funding to expand its product offerings, make strategic hires and finance customer acquisition efforts, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Bitstack will soon offer its users the ability to auto-invest a percentage of their paycheck in bitcoin, send bitcoin between friends and earn bitcoin rewards when spending with the Bitstack Card, the company says.</p><p>Bitstack was launched on the App Store and Google Play in July 2022, and has since onboarded over 25,000 users in France according to the press release. Alexandre Roubaud, CEO of Bitstack, said "We are seeing a rapidly growing interest for Bitcoin in France, with over 50% of Bitstack users being first-time bitcoin buyers." The startup has also seen its number of active users increasing by more than 20% month over month, the press release states.</p><p>Since its launch, Bitstack claims its users have unrealized gains of 30% despite bitcoin’s downward trend in 2022. "Our ambition is to give people a new way to manage their money. At Bitstack, we believe that personal finance can be different, more accessible, more fun and more transparent thanks to bitcoin. With the launch of our new financial services and debit card, we continue our mission to democratize Bitcoin and create a more open financial system," said Roubaud.</p><p>Bitstack states it will open access to its bitcoin cashback debit card, available for free, by the end of 2023. Bitstack cardholders will be able to earn bitcoin rewards on every purchase, along with additional rewards at select retail partners. "Bitstack is democratizing the use of cryptocurrencies by creating an innovative new savings product that fits into everyday life," said Marc Menasé, founder of Founders Future. "We are more than proud to accompany these ambitious entrepreneurs at Founders Future to help them in their development in France and abroad."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNzA1NDk5OTk2NDMyMjUy/orange-pill-bitcoin-adoption.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unchained Announces $60M Series B Fundraising Round]]></title><description><![CDATA[Funding led by Valor Equity Partners and other existing investors will go towards the firm’s expansion and improvement.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-announces-60m-series-b-fundraising-round</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-announces-60m-series-b-fundraising-round</guid><category><![CDATA[multi-signature]]></category><category><![CDATA[fundraising]]></category><category><![CDATA[Custody]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unchained capital]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNTQ5MTIz/technical-bitcoin-development-pixel.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Funding led by Valor Equity Partners and other existing investors will go towards the firm’s expansion and improvement.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, funding will be used to expand Unchained’s client base and improve its suite of financial services.</p><p>Unchained’s collaborative custody model aims to use Bitcoin’s native multisignature capabilities to provide the benefits of self-custody while mitigating risks associated with self-custody. The model allows clients to share control of their bitcoin between private keys they hold themselves and private keys held by Unchained and other financial services companies. The platform currently secures over $2 billion in bitcoin across thousands of keys worldwide, according to the press release.</p><p>Vivek Pattipati, a Partner at Valor who will be joining Unchained’s Board of Directors, described Unchained’s current position, saying that “in the midst of market chaos, Unchained has emerged as a highly trusted provider of Bitcoin custody and financial services through superior technology, risk management, regulatory compliance, and client service.”<br><br>The company has originated over $500 million in bitcoin-collateralized loans since 2017, the press release states, while experiencing zero loan losses. The Unchained trading desk allows clients to buy bitcoin directly to cold storage, and its IRA offering allows clients to hold keys to their bitcoin within tax-advantaged retirement accounts, which the release notes is an industry-first.</p><p>Unchained feels that as bitcoin continues to grow in adoption, there is a tremendous opportunity for products that bridge into the traditional dollar ecosystem around credit, trading, investment and other financial services. “Using this fresh capital investment to expand our reach and suite of services, we hope to enable new entrants to Bitcoin to leapfrog centralized custodians into our safer collaborative custody model,” said Unchained CEO Joe Kelly.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNTQ5MTIz/technical-bitcoin-development-pixel.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item></channel></rss>
