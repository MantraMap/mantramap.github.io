Ankr then airdropped the ankrBNB token to compensate users for the damage.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">It&#8217;s best to create regulatory clarity first around centralized actors in crypto (stablecoin issuers, exchanges, and custodians) because this is where we&#8217;ve seen the most risk of consumer harm, and pretty much everyone can agree it should be done.</p>

<p>Following the fall of FTX, a crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection in November after allegedly abusing billions of dollars in client assets, lawmakers are focused on regulating the crypto business. Prosecutors in the United States charged co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried with fraud and money laundering last week.</p>

<p>According to Armstrong, <strong>stablecoins should be regulated first, then centralized exchanges and custodians</strong>, making room for DeFi to develop.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Regulating stablecoin issuers is a good place to start, because there is broad interest in D.C., and we can get some momentum with a quick win, we don&#8217;t need to do anything fancy or crypto-specific here; stablecoins can be regulated under standard financial services laws by using, for instance, a state trust charter or an OCC national trust charter.</p>
<cite>Armstrong said</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Armstrong predicts a stablecoin law could be passed in the first half of next year by adopting regulatory frameworks </strong>from traditional financial services, freeing up regulators to concentrate on the more difficult tasks of developing a regulatory framework for centralized crypto players and determining which digital assets qualify as securities or commodities.</p>

<p>Bank transfers are being made available to customers in most<strong> U.S. states, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the Single European Payments Arena, commonly known as SEPA.</strong></p>



<p>The firm said on December 20 that its <strong>users would now be able to convert money to cryptocurrency</strong> in minutes on the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Artibrum.</p>

<p>Decentralized exchanges (DEX) include built-in user security, self-custodial wallets, permissionless, immutable protocols, and transparent public ledgers, according to Uniswap, making them a considerably safer alternative to centralized exchanges (CEX).</p>



<p><strong>Depending on the user&#8217;s location</strong>, Uniswap will initially offer Dai, Ether, USD Coin, Tether, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and Wrapped Ether (wETH).</p>

<p>The firm acknowledged that despite the dangers involved, <strong>customers still prefer CEXs and that the onboarding process for decentralized finance (DeFi) has been a significant barrier to adoption</strong>. With no spread costs on USDC, the lowest processing fees in the industry, and immediate access, Uniswap anticipates that its most recent deployment will enhance the onboarding experience.</p>



<p>On December 13, Coincus <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151420-uniswap-declines-in-fees-per-core-developer/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/151420-uniswap-declines-in-fees-per-core-developer/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that Uniswap decreased the developer&#8217;s fee, which was affected by the devaluation of UNI. Additionally, <strong>the firm regulatory council will decide whether to test a “fee switch” on a selection of pools</strong> in the near future.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-signs-extradition-papers/story?id=95621512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News</a>, the former <strong>CEO of FTX SBF has signed an extradition document in the Bahamas and will be handed over to New York </strong>to face prosecution following the collapse of a company once valued at $ 32 billion. He will appear in court again on Wednesday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried signs extradition papers and will return to U.S. to face charges. <br><br>Bankman-Fried had prevaricated on waiving an extradition hearing one day prior. <a href="https://t.co/ZOIYXqwoo5" target="_blank">https://t.co/ZOIYXqwoo5</a></p>&mdash; ABC News (@ABC) <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1605320740055797762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The move was expected, as Bankman-Fried is said to have agreed in principle on December 19 to be extradited to the US, despite earlier reports suggesting that <strong>he wanted to see the indictment against him first.</strong></p>



<p>After the final paperwork is signed, Bankman-Fried is expected to be taken to a private airport by FBI agents and transited to the US on a private flight, where he faces eight charges in the indictment of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p>

<p>As updated in an earlier Coincu News article on December 20, Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal team is currently in <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/152955-sbf-gives-up-opposing-extradition-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussions</a></strong> with federal prosecutors to allow him to be released on bail when extradited to the US.</p>



<p>The agreement would require approval from the federal judge overseeing the SBF&#8217;s case and could include &#8220;<strong>highly restrictive conditions</strong>&#8221; such as home confinement and electronic surveillance, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p>



<p>The charges carry a<strong> maximum sentence of 115 years in prison if convicted on all counts</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1542.png" alt="SBF

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-20/bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius-receives-multiple-bids-for-retail-mining-assets#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, a report filed in court by bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network LLC on Tuesday shows that <strong>the company has received multiple offers to acquire its retail platform and mining business. </strong></p>

<p>Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Celsius&#8217; attorneys told US Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn at Tuesday&#8217;s hearing to include proposals for a retail platform, mining operations and a combination of the two. <strong>Potential buyers include 30 parties</strong>.</p>



<p>Celsius advisers have yet to decide whether to sell the entire crypto lending company, or split it up for sale, or pursue another restructuring plan.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s attorney, Chris Koenig, told the hearing that they plan to work with potential buyers in the coming weeks to improve existing offers and <strong>announce in mid-January 2023 whether they sell or not.</strong></p>



<p>The company&#8217;s interim CEO, Chris Ferraro, told the hearing that Celsius mining has generated positive operating cash flow each month this year. He said the company will continue to expand its mining operations.</p>



<p>As was updated in an earlier Coincu News article, US Bankruptcy Court Judge Martin Glenn <strong>issued an order that crypto lending platform Celsius Network must <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150018-celsius-return-44m-crypto-assets-to-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return approximately $44 million</a> worth of cryptocurrency for users.</strong></p>

<p>As a result, the bankrupt cryptocurrency company <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/150314-celsius-solve-customer-issues-the-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed</a></strong> <strong>reopening withdrawals for some customers</strong>. They are approaching customer recovery in phases. Even so, the amount of money that customers are returned is only a very small part of the damage they suffer from this bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Metamask supports <strong>any network that is compatible with the Ethereum network,</strong> such as the <strong>Binance Smart Chain, Cronos,</strong> and <strong>Avalanche</strong> networks. Users will need to manually add these networks to their wallets based on the documentation given by each network.</p>



<p>The default network for all wallets is the <strong>Ethereum</strong> mainnet. However, users are also able to connect <strong>Metamask</strong> to other blockchain networks, such as <strong>Polygon, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Cronos, Harmony ONE, Velas, HECO, xDAI.</strong></p>



<p>Last month, <strong>ConsenSys</strong> updated its privacy policy, stating that it collects IP addresses and wallet addresses of the wallet users when they use the infrastructure service Infura, which is also owned by <strong>ConsenSys</strong>. <strong>Infura</strong> is the default way for <strong>MetaMask</strong> users to connect to the <strong>Ethereum</strong> blockchain. The company updated its privacy policy following the <strong>Uniswap DEX</strong>.</p>

<p>Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149533-consensys-wont-collect-user-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that ConsenSys was met with a lot of criticism from the community after updating the privacy policy. The company has voiced its commitment to protecting the privacy of its users in its latest announcement with more specific updates. </p>



<p>Accordingly, <strong>ConsenSys</strong> says it does not store wallet account address information when the waller users make a <strong>&#8220;read&#8221; </strong>request through Infura, such as to check their account balance in <strong>MetaMask</strong>. So there is never a problem with linking a wallet account address with an <strong>internet protocol (IP)</strong> address.</p>

<p>Users may borrow stablecoin (MAI) at <strong>0% interest</strong> through <strong>Mai</strong> <strong>Finance</strong>, a zero-interest lending system. Anyone may establish <strong>QiDao</strong> vaults and put down assets to be used as security for loans.</p>



<p>With the overcollateralized stablecoin system known as Mai, loans are always secured by having more value locked than the debt.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On Oct 18th 2022, the blockchain security team at Amber Group discovered a critical reentrancy vulnerability in two Mai Finance’s vaults (SCSEMVT and YCSEMVT), and reported it to Mai Finance.<br><br>We elaborate on the details of our findings<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/yssroFYujx" target="_blank">https://t.co/yssroFYujx</a></p>&mdash; Amber Group (@ambergroup_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/ambergroup_io/status/1605178657919893505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>ChainSecurity</strong> revealed a new type of reentrancy flaw in <strong>Curve</strong> in the middle of <strong>October 2022</strong>. The so-called read-only reentrancy vulnerability enables an attacker to revisit the <strong>get virtual price()</strong> oracle function through a carefully written smart contract and obtain an inflated LP token price in return, opening the door for criminals to benefit. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="941" height="420" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png" alt="Amber Group: Vulnerability In Mai Finance&#039;s Vault Has Been Fixed" class="wp-image-153960" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png 941w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-300x134.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-768x343.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-750x335.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px" title="Amber Group: Vulnerability In Mai Finance&#039;s Vault Has Been Fixed 29"></a></figure></div>


<p>To get the price of an LP token produced from the pegged assets of a stable swap pool, a lending protocol linked with Curve LPs often employs the oracle function offered by <strong>Curve</strong> and named <strong>get virtual price()</strong>.</p>



<p>For the time being, the attacker is free to alter the execution flow any way they choose. What happens if the attacker calls <strong>get virtual price()</strong> once more in the fallback function&#8217;s initial line? The virtual price increases when the quantity of Curve LP tokens is reduced, and the balances are not updated. Then, another batch of underlying assets might be removed, or even some pools could be drained using the manipulated pricing.</p>



<p>The QiDao&#8217;s <strong>YCSEMVT</strong> vault modified <strong>get virtual price() </strong>as one of the sources to estimate the collateral price as a result of becoming one of the targets of the new read-only reentrancy attack.</p>

<p>Ethereum founder <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149564-vitalik-buterin-dissatisfied-coindesks-rank/"><strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong></a> revealed his prognosis for <strong>the crypto sector in 2023</strong> in an interview with Bankless&#8217; David Hoffman, addressing Hoffman&#8217;s rising concerns that the adoption wave of Decentralized applications is now finished and there are less chances for developers in the future.</p>



<p>As a result, Vitalik Buterin outlined three significant unfulfilled potential in crypto that he intends to achieve: <strong>large-scale crypto wallet usage; development of inflation-resistant stablecoins; and increased popularity of Ethereum-based applications.</strong></p>



<p>Vitalik Buterin views<strong> the establishment of a stablecoin</strong> as the process of establishing more crypto wallet infrastructure to make it easy for everyone to use and ensure that the product is capable of taking on billions of users. It will be a revolution for the industry if it is <strong>inflation-resistant, internationally accessible, and robust</strong> to all kinds of conditions that occur, both <strong>on-chain and in the broader macro-economy</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;If we can establish a stablecoin that can actually live in a number of settings, including the growing inflation in the US dollar, it opens up a lifeline for everyone to overcome.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Finally, the Ethereum founder stated that any <strong>technical breakthroughs</strong> that contribute to Ethereum removing login privileges from Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other centralized monopolies will allow Ethereum to finally take over. More market dominance in Internet-based apps.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Imagine being able to log in with Ethereum to work and replace Facebook, Google, and Twitter as the *rulers* of the Internet; isn&#8217;t that a great opportunity?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, it appears that, in the context of &#8220;freezing,&#8221; Vitalik Buterin has more to say about <strong>his aspirations</strong> for the industry in the near future, in an effort to bolster those who are presently working and continue to follow the market.</p>



<p>Not only did the Ethereum founder do an in-depth interview with Bankless, but he also published an article on his own page <strong>in early December 2022</strong> to share his knowledge and advice with the blockchain community regarding the approaching years.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>According to the attorney for XRP investors, the SEC is accusing cryptocurrency companies in order to suffocate the industry.</em></li>

<p>The action against <strong>LBRY</strong> shows the SEC is <strong>actively broadening the definition of disgorgement</strong>, according to <strong>Gabriel Shapiro</strong>, General Counsel of Delphi Labs. It aims to consider all LBC token releases as sales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SEC is radically expanding the concept of &quot;disgorgement&quot; in its case vs <a href="https://twitter.com/LBRYcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@LBRYcom</a> &#8211;treating all distributions of LBC (to employees, to users of the app, etc.) as sales &amp; valuing the resulting benefits of distributions as = profits based on the then-current spot price of LBC <a href="https://t.co/XoIE1TqA9K" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/XoIE1TqA9K</a></p>&mdash; _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) <a href="https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1605177909752184833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In the non-fraud lawsuit against <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147396-lbry-has-been-troubled-with-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LBRY</a>, the XRP attorney is acting abusively. He brought up this as an obvious reference to the SEC&#8217;s strategy of putting an end to cryptocurrency. <strong>Deaton</strong> mentioned the <strong>SEC v. KiK </strong>summary ruling, in which the commission was unsuccessful in obtaining disgorgement.</p>



<p>The SEC is matching the distribution advantages to profits made on the current LBC spot price, it was further said.</p>



<p>Lawyer for XRP holders and <strong>amicus curiae </strong>in the XRP litigation <strong>John Deaton</strong> criticized the SEC&#8217;s stance on the cryptocurrency market. He emphasized the claim made by the commission in its objection that all funds raised by the cryptocurrency businesses were used for operations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SEC is <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4af.png" alt="💯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> being abusive in this NON-FRAUD case and it reflects its overall approach to crypto &#8211; which is to kill it. In Kik after a summary judgement the SEC didn’t get disgorgement. This is about the message the SEC is sending to crypto in general.</p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1605231668012408833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Deaton said that the SEC raised disgorgement after these allegations. According to the XRP attorney, under Liu, it is intended to be offset by proper business costs. The watchdog, however, argued that all of the LBRY&#8217;s funds were put to use.</p>



<p>Earlier, <strong>Stuart Aleroty</strong>, General Counsel of Ripple, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152896-general-counsel-of-ripple-says-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thinks</a> venture capitalists should challenge the SEC instead of waiting for users to get their money back from the collapsed exchange FTX.</p>

<p>Based on information obtained from the Nansen platform, the majority of the priciest items traded on <strong>Polygon</strong> in the previous twenty-four hours were trading cards related to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152401-donald-trump-launches-new-nft-collection/">Donald Trump NFT Collection</a>.</p>



<p>The statistics for each week have shown tremendous improvement as well. As can be seen in the illustration below, approximately <strong>332,000 users</strong> have <strong>created new NFTs or traded</strong> on Polygon blockchain in the past week.</p>



<p>Former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <strong>NFT </strong>made available last week a compilation of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152664-45000-donald-trump-nft-sold-out-within-hour/">45,000 NFTs</a>. The NFTs that were being traded on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153884-polygon-co-founder-aims-to-make-beacon/">Polygon</a> were quickly purchased up until they were sold out.</p>



<p>According to the information provided by OpenSea, the overall volume of the NFT Trump collection is <strong>6332 ETH</strong>, which is equivalent to around <strong>$7.5 million</strong>.</p>



<p>The twelve most costly NFTs have valuations that range anywhere from <strong>28.5k MATIC</strong> to <strong>3.4k MATIC</strong>, which translates to approximately <strong>$22.8k to $2.7k USD</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition, the floor price is <strong>0.344 ETH</strong>, which is equivalent to <strong>$406.74 USD</strong>. This is a fourfold increase in comparison to the original starting price of <strong>$99</strong>.</p>



<p>The reaction on social media suggests that Trump&#8217;s decision may be an attempt to combine the NFT fan contact with political activism in advance of the next presidential election. The most significant gain is accrued by the Polygon Network as a result of Donald Trump&#8217;s NFT collection being released.</p>



<p>In point of fact, both the total number of mints and the total number of users of Polygon OpenSea have reached their greatest point <strong>since November</strong>.</p>
