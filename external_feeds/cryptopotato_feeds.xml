			            <description><![CDATA[Binance's CZ has seen the biggest decline in personal wealth, but SBF and Barry Silbert are reportedly broke. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2022 will go down in history as one of the most atrocious and shocking for the cryptocurrency industry, which saw several major implosions, countless bankruptcies, fallouts, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious &#8211; the massive price declines of cryptocurrency assets, Forbes estimated that several industry participants have lost their billionaire status, while others&#8217; fortunes were wiped out to $0.</p>
<h2>From Terra to FTX &#8211; Crypto Debacles</h2>
<p>The macroeconomic factors have not been kind to the industry, with the massive global inflation running rampant, increasing interest rates, warnings of recessions, and an ongoing war in the middle of Europe, which started in February and is yet to see a conclusion.</p>
<p>However, not everything can be blamed on outside elements. If we look closely, it will be easy to locate numerous industry problems now when many have been exposed. Perhaps it all started with the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-valuable-lessons-from-terras-collapse-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">rapid collapse</a> of the Terra ecosystem when its algorithmic stablecoin lost its parity with the dollar, and snappy investors saw the opportunity to profit by arbitrating UST against LUNA. The result was a $40 billion crash in an instant.</p>
<p>While the debacle of two former top 10 cryptocurrencies is bad enough on its own, it turned out that the industry is quite intertwined. Consequently, many hedge funds and investors began to struggle, leading to multiple bankruptcy filings from the likes of Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, and others.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few months to October, and the situation was finally starting to normalize as investors began to get used to the idea of an extended crypto winter. However, it was all about to change for the worse when it became known that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX had massive solvency issues</a> and had to file for bankruptcy as well.</p>
<p>That was a major blow for the entire industry as FTX, Alameda, and SBF himself were considered among the most prominent industry parties. Yet, it all turned out to be a gigantic lie, in which the founder of both misappropriated user funds and somehow misplaced $8 billion.</p>
<p>As such, the crypto market was in shambles again, with prices falling hard to multi-year lows. Bitcoin came down to under $16,000 just a year after it charted its all-time high of $69,000.</p>
<h2>$116B Gone in a Year</h2>
<p>While the $2.2 trillion gone from the cumulative market cap of all crypto assets could be regarded as quite an adverse development, Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2022/12/24/these-crypto-founders-and-bitcoin-moguls-lost-116-billion-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">estimated</a> that every industry member, company founder, or investor has seen their personal wealth deteriorate as well.</p>
<p>Some of the names are quite expected, given the fact that SBF claimed he had only $100,000 left in his banking account after FTX filed for bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried&#8217;s fortune was once estimated to be over $20 billion &#8211; in fact, that was less than a year ago.</p>
<p>Gary Wang, the co-founder of Alameda and FTX, has also seen his bank account tumble to $0, according to Forbes. Interestingly, though, such is the case with Barry Silbert &#8211; the person behind the crypto giant Digital Currency Group, which has the likes of Genesis, Grayscale, and CoinDesk under its wing.</p>
<p>DCG is reported to have lots of issues, mostly connected to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/troubled-crypto-firm-genesis-owes-geminis-customers-900-million-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">bad debts</a> to and from Genesis, while Grayscale&#8217;s trusts have all seen massive investor outflow.</p>
<p>According to the report, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, has experienced the most significant decline in personal wealth, from $65 billion in March to $4.5 billion now.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Threat actor Ryushi claims to have accessed a database of 400m Twitter users' private info and is offering to sell it exclusively to prevent misuse.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock has disclosed that a threat actor is trying to sell the users&#8217; data of 400 million Twitter customers containing private information about celebrities, politicians, and companies.</p>
<p class="p2">Some of the big names include former U.S. President Donald Trump, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Shark Tank star Kevin O&#8217;Leary, billionaire investor Mark Cuban, and lots more.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Threat Actor Tries to Sell Private Twitter Data </b></h2>
<p class="p2">According to Hudson Rock, the threat actor <a href="https://twitter.com/RockHudsonRock/status/1606644986363400193" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">claimed</a> the data was obtained earlier this year via a Twitter vulnerability. The database contains information about the breached Twitter users, including their emails, account creation dates, and phone numbers.</p>
<p class="p2">The actor, who goes by the name Ryushi, has asked the Twitter <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-fires-top-twitter-execs-assumes-ownership/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">management team</span></a> and its new owner Elon Musk to reach out to specified accounts to strike a bargain for an exclusive buy-out to prevent the wrong people from getting a hold of the data.</p>
<p class="p2">Ryushi told Musk that failure to cooperate would attract GDPR breach fines of up to $276 million, just like Facebook did when over 500 million users&#8217; data was exposed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Twitter or Elon Musk, if you&#8217;re reading this you are already risking a GDPR fine over 5.4m imaging the fine if 400m users breach. Your best option to avoid paying $276 million USD in GDPR breach fines like Facebook did (due to 533m users being scraped) is to buy this data exclusively…,&#8221; the message read.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Users Could Lose Trust in Twitter </b></h2>
<p class="p2">The threat actor further highlighted the consequences of Twitter&#8217;s failure to cooperate. Ryushi explained that selling the data to anyone else would expose celebrities and politicians to crypto scams, phishing, doxxing, and other malicious activities.</p>
<p class="p2">Ryushi pointed out that since Musk was already standing on shaky ground for <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-will-force-twitter-users-to-pay-for-verification-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">changing Twitter&#8217;s policy</span></a>, users could completely lose their trust in the platform when they find out about the breach.</p>
<p class="p2">Meanwhile, some Twitter users are speculating that Ryushi&#8217;s claim of having the private data of 400 million accounts is untrue, but Hudson Rock thinks otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Please Note: At this stage it is not possible to fully verify that there are indeed 400,000,000 users in the database. From an independent verification the data itself appears to be legitimate and we will follow up with any developments,&#8221; the cybercrime intelligence firm stated.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Glassnode data shows a decrease in the 7-Day MA of bitcoin leaving centralized exchanges with only 986.237 BTC getting withdrawn in the past week or so.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybercrimes are increasing both in numbers and sophistication. The latest to find itself on the receiving end was the Bitcoin mining pool, BTC.com, which announced suffering a cyber attack on December 3rd.</p>
<p>The perpetrators siphoned certain digital assets worth $700,000 owned by BTC.com&#8217;s clients and nearly $2.3 million in asset value owned by its parent firm, BIT Mining Limited.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the official<a href="https://btcm.group/news-detail?id=52667" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"> press release</a>, the incident was reported to the Shenzhen law enforcement authorities in China. Some of BTC.com&#8217;s stolen assets have already been recovered.</li>
<li>The authorities launched an investigation last week that kicked off with collecting evidence and have requested further assistance from BIT Mining and coordination with relevant agencies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the wake of discovering this cyberattack, the Company has implemented technology to better block and intercept hackers. BTC.com is currently operating its business as usual, and apart from its digital asset services, its client fund services are unaffected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Specific details regarding the attack vector have not been revealed yet.</li>
<li>Cybercrimes in the crypto space may take many forms, including schemes that promise quick riches, fake airdrops, giveaways on social media, impersonation of genuine cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms, as well as other fraudulent activities that use digital assets as a lure.</li>
<li>Hackers <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-reveals-getting-closer-to-identify-hacker-that-drained-570m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">targeted</a> the cross-chain bridge BSC Token Hub &#8211; blockchain associated with Binance in October this year, making away with $570 million.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The projects are likely to release official roadmaps in January 2023. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DeGods and y00ts &#8211; have announced their departure from Solana and revealed that they would be migrating to Ethereum and Polygon.</p>
<p>The two top NFT projects on Solana anticipate moving to new chains in the first quarter of 2023, according to their respective <a href="https://twitter.com/y00tsNFT/status/1607156616201392128" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">updates</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/DeGodsNFT/status/1607156858019794944" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Twitter</a>. The duo stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The details of the bridge will be released when it&#8217;s ready &amp; tested. This has never been done before at this scale. We want to make sure that it&#8217;s airtight.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Despite a rocky launch in late 2021, NFT profile-picture project DeGods transformed into a true titan across all NFT networks this year. Its digital collectibles went on to become some of the most valuable on Solana.</li>
<li>DeGods acquired a team in the professional basketball league BIG3 &#8211; founded by rapper and actor Ice Cube. The launch of the much-anticipated y00ts project this fall further increased its popularity.</li>
<li>According to Messari&#8217;s recent <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q3-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a>, Solana recorded over 19% quarter-over-quarter growth in NFTs and is now second, trailing only Ethereum with respect to terms of transaction volume and activity.</li>
<li>The network&#8217;s cheap gas and efficiency made it a popular <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/defi-tvl-drops-nft-market-performs-poorly-in-november-dappradar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">choice</a> among NFT developers, which stimulated the growth of numerous successful projects on the platform.</li>
<li>The departures come amidst a rather disastrous year for Solana, especially after being <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/solana-foundation-lost-over-180-million-in-crypto-on-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">caught up</a> in the drama surrounding the failed crypto exchange FTX, which prompted its <a href="https://defillama.com/chains" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">exit</a> from the top ten on DeFiLlama&#8217;s dashboard.</li>
<li>The total value locked (TVL) across Solana protocols fell to $218.16 million.</li>
<li>Repeated encounters with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3-ways-to-mitigate-future-network-outages-solanas-team-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">network outages</a> further added to the skepticism.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, a Reddit post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/zvayhn/degods_yoots_are_leaving_solanas_blockchain_for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">claims</a> that the two projects asked the Solana Foundation for millions to remain on the network. While Polygon reportedly coughed up $5 million to bridge y00ts, the amount Ethereum paid is unknown.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few weeks, we saw a mini-rally that was initiated at the wedge’s lower boundary (shown below); however, Ethereum’s uptrend was halted by the 50-day moving average line significant resistance level. Since the rejection, ETH has seen consolidation in a very tight range. Another bearish leg might soon start unless the price breaks above $1236.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By Shayan</p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>After a sudden crash below the static support level of $1300, the price has consolidated and formed an ascending wedge pattern (shown by the orange trendlines).</p>
<p>Most recently, after a third touch of the lower boundary, Ethereum started an uptrend and reached the 50-day moving average line at $1236. However, the 50-day moving average line aligns with the descending channel’s middle threshold, causing this level to become a major resistance.</p>
<p>Ethereum bulls should expect another uptrend toward the wedge’s upper trendline if the price surpasses this crucial resistance zone. Still, considering the recent price action and weakened bullish momentum, rejection from this level is more likely.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230395" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1386" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-768x416.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-1536x832.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-2048x1109.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETH-Daily-2-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Based on the classic technical point of view, each impulsive price move should be followed by a short-term continuation correction phase. This also applies to Ethereum’s price action. The chart illustrates that the price has dropped sharply and entered a short-term consolidation phase. Meanwhile, an ascending bearish flag pattern has been formed.</p>
<p>The price is currently attempting to exceed the flag’s middle boundary, and if a breakout takes place, a surge toward the upper trendline will become likely. However, as mentioned earlier, the current market structure is not promising for the bulls. Accordingly, the most probable scenario for Ethereum is a short-term consolidation followed by another plummet toward the crucial support level of $1K.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p>The following chart consists of the Transaction Count metric (30-day EMA) and Ethereum’s price. Typically, bearish stages of the market are followed by significantly lower activity from the market participants, resulting in a lower transaction count.</p>
<p>Based on this metric, the market activity level has been on a downtrend since May 2021 and even recorded a new low. Furthermore, as is evident in the chart, each impulsive downtrend in the metric was along with a considerable price decline.</p>
<p>Most recently, the metric experienced a significant plunge indicating a lack of activity. Hence, the price might soon experience another drop to the crucial support level of $1K.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Defrost team said that it is willing to negotiate with the perpetrators, but there're rumors of a rug pull. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DeFi criminals have been observed to cash in on the &#8216;spirit of giving.&#8217;</p>
<p>Decentralized finance protocol Defrost Finance became the latest victim of a flash loan attack on December 23rd that drained funds in the V2. The attacker used the owner key for the second time to exploit V1.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 16px;">According to the Twitter thread by Defrost Finance, the team is currently willing to negotiate with the individuals behind the attack and discuss sharing 20% of the funds in exchange for the bulk of assets.</span></li>
<li>However, Peckshield said it received a &#8220;community intel&#8221; warning claiming that it was actually a rug pull of Defrost Finance. The investigator <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1606276020276891650" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">found</a> that the share price of LSWUSDC was manipulated, which resulted in a $173,000 profit for the hacker.</li>
<li>Further <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1606767457099993088" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">analysis</a> shows the addition of a fake collateral token and a malicious price oracle that was used to liquidate current users.</li>
<li>The loss is estimated to be approximately $12 million.</li>
<li>Typically, in case of a rug pull, the team behind the project goes silent on social media.</li>
<li>Defrost Finance’s core team member Doran, on the other hand, confirmed the flash loan that hit v2 was closed down for investigation. v1 was not impacted by the hack.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We will keep on investigating and all relevant information will be shared with the community. We are thankful to the Defrost community for their ongoing support at this difficult time Our priority remains to recover the funds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>UPDATE: Hours after the exploit took place, the team behind the project said it has recovered all the funds.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The hacked funds have been returned to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DefrostFinance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#DefrostFinance</a>.</p>
<p>The affected users will very soon be able to claim their assets back.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American billionaire and prominent TV personality &#8211; Mark Cuban &#8211; said he wants bitcoin&#8217;s price to go down &#8220;a lot further&#8221; so he could purchase more of it. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also criticized investments in gold, arguing it is not a &#8220;hedge against everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Waiting for a Buying Opportunity</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The billionaire remains a fan of bitcoin, despite the asset&#8217;s massive price decline and the uncertainty around the entire crypto industry. In a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6veLM-T6ZE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">podcast</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, he vowed to increase his BTC exposure should its valuation head even further south:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For his part, the host of the broadcast &#8211; Bill Maher &#8211; displayed himself as a &#8220;gold bug,&#8221; claiming that the precious metal &#8220;never goes away, it&#8217;s worth something, and you can always sell it.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cuban opposed the thesis, saying it is not a &#8220;hedge against everything&#8221; as some people view it. The yellow metal is a &#8220;digital transaction&#8221; and a &#8220;stored value&#8221; just like bitcoin while owning an actual gold bar hides its risks:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;You don&#8217;t own the gold bar, and if everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f*** out of you or kill you and take your gold bar.&#8221;<br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The billionaire made another comparison between the precious metal and bitcoin in 2021, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-and-gold-are-financial-religions-but-btc-is-better-says-mark-cuban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">saying</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> both assets are &#8220;financial religions,&#8221; but the cryptocurrency has more merits as it &#8220;enables the transfer of value locally and globally.&#8221;</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Litecoin is today's top performer, with a substantial 5% increase. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the new week starting, bitcoin&#8217;s price has remained stuck around $16,800 and is actually at the same place it was seven days ago.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also very quiet, with Litecoin emerging as the only notable gainer from the larger-cap ones.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Stays Flat</h2>
<p>Last week began with a price drop of $16,300, which became BTC&#8217;s lowest position in about three weeks. However, the asset recovered its lost ground and returned back to $16,800.</p>
<p>The following days were quite calm, even though the US had to disclose two important stats. The first, an increase in the GDP for the third quarter of the year, pushed the entire stock market south, but BTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-stocks-fall-on-gdp-data-bitcoin-ethereum-hold-on-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">remained resilient</a>.</p>
<p>The second, the PCE inflation data, brought some volatility but was short-lived, and bitcoin went back to $16,800. The weekend saw <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/christmas-watch-will-2023-finally-end-bitcoin-prices-stagnancy-amid-17k/" data-wpel-link="internal">no price movements</a> either, as the trading volumes were down. The only attempt came hours ago when BTC headed for $17,000 but was stopped in its tracks.</p>
<p>As such, the cryptocurrency now trades at precisely the same price spot as it was a week ago. Its market capitalization has stalled at $325 billion, and its dominance over the alts is flat at 40%.</p>

<h2>LTC Pops Up 5%</h2>
<p>Although more volatile in nature, the alternative coins have failed to produce any significant movements as well.</p>
<p>Ethereum is slightly in the red on a daily scale but stands firmly above $1,200 after reclaiming that line earlier this week. BNB, OKB, Dogecoin, Tron, and Shiba Inu have also painted minor losses.</p>
<p>Ripple, Cardano, MATIC, and Polkadot are slightly in the green, on the other hand. Litecoin is the only notable gainer from the larger-cap alts. LTC is up by over 5% in a day and trades close to $70.</p>
<p>LUNC has doubled down on its recent form and has jumped by almost 6% once again to $0.0002.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the cumulative market cap of all crypto assets sits calmly at $810 billion for several days straight.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[This is the second exploit affecting the popular wallet in the past several months.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PeckShield, the blockchain analytics and security company, reported earlier today that some BitKeep wallet users had their funds drained from the platform.</p>
<p>According to the current estimations, the total amount stolen is roughly $8 million in various digital assets.</p>
<ul>
<li>After <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hacktober-finished-with-657-million-losses-from-crypto-exploits/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hacktober</a>, which was the worst month in the crypto industry in terms of hacks and exploits, the attackers seem to be back on the offensive as of now.</li>
<li>The latest to fall victim is the BitKeep wallet, according to Peckshield. The security firm cited a BitKeep official, saying &#8220;several users&#8217; funds were stolen.&#8221;</li>
<li>They blamed it on a hacked APK version previously downloaded. Some Twitter users confirmed it, saying they had received suspicious emails recently about downloading another version of the wallet, which they thought it could be phishing attacks.</li>
<li>PeckShield added that the amount of stolen cryptocurrencies is about $8 billion for now, including BNB, ETH, USDT, and DAI.</li>
