			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The regulatory action against the two biggest crypto exchanges has made it clear: the SEC, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, wants to end the crypto industry. The agency&rsquo;s scare tactics may succeed in the US, but it struggles with the overall market. </p>
<p>The US SEC made its position against crypto known this week when it launched severe regulatory action against Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange, and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange by trade volume in the US. Leading the agency in its crusade is Gary Gensler, a man who has made his views of the industry no secret.</p>
<p>Following the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuits against the exchanges, the market was expected to react severely, and the prices would plunge. However, Bitcoin and the broader market held steady throughout the week.</p>
<p>However, Gensler&rsquo;s SEC made allegations in its suit against Binance, which labelled several popular cryptocurrencies unregistered securities. The SEC listed Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti (COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS).</p>
<p>The agency&rsquo;s naming of these tokens as securities did, however, cause panic in the market and spurred trading platform Robinhood to delist MATIC, SOL, and ADA from its platform come June 27.</p>
Alt-Market Reacts to Robinhood Delisting
<p>Although the market did not react as much as expected during the week, it did see a dramatic plunge on Saturday.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly fuelled by Robinhood&rsquo;s delisting announcement, the crypto alt market saw significant declines. ADA was trading down by as much as 25%, while SOL and MATIC also saw double-digit losses. Amid the dire market conditions, Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com announced it would suspend its institutional exchange service for US customers.</p>
<p>Compared to the broader market, Bitcoin was only trading down only 5% to its lowest level since March and was trading hands at around $25,000.</p>
<p>The market appeared to recover ever so slightly by Sunday morning, but the &ldquo;bloodbath&rdquo; continues.</p>
Did Gary Gensler Offer His Services to Binance?
<p>A surprising report emerged this week amid the chaos when CNBC revealed that Gensler had a series of conversations with Binance officials and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Binance lawyers allege that Gensler offered his services as an advisor to the exchange in 2019.</p>
<p>Although merely reports at the moment, the allegations undoubtedly damage Gensler and call into question his intentions as Chairman of the securities regulator.</p>
The Crypto Industry Will Prevail
<p>The SEC and all its might may continue to slap the industry with a barrage of claims, but it seems unlikely that it will manage to bring the industry down. The agency is certainly doing substantial damage to the US crypto industry, but the crypto market at large will not be taken down.</p>
<p>In light of the recent events in the crypto industry &ndash; recall the spectacular failures of FTX, we cannot live under the illusion that the industry can go on unregulated.</p>
<p>However, the US&rsquo;s approach to this is simply wrong and unproductive and achieves little bar driving crypto off US shores and into the hands of territories which welcome it with open arms.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto.com announced that it would shut down its institutional exchange services customers in the United States in less than two weeks. </p>
<p>On Friday, Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com announced that it would suspend its institutional exchange service for US customers. In a statement provided to media publication Blockworks, the exchange explained that demand is drying up due to the current market conditions in the US.</p>
<p>Although it did not specifically reference the lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, it was undoubtedly the overriding factor in the exchange&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>In a statement, Crypto.com said:</p>

<p>We recently made a business decision to suspend the institutional offering of the Crypto.com Exchange in the U.S. as of 11:59 pm EDT June 21, 2023, due to &ldquo;limited demand&rdquo; from institutions in the U.S. in the &ldquo;current market landscape.&rdquo; Impacted institutional users were given advance notice to support a smooth transition.</p>

<p>The exchange explained that the closure of the US services would not affect its retail trading app, including its crypto derivative product, UpDown Options, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The company further said it could reopen the platform in the future but did not provide more details.</p>
Crypto.com Receives Major Payment Institution Licence in Singapore
<p>The exchange started the month out well after receiving a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license for Digital Payment Token (DPT) services from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p>Securing this license means the exchange can offer DPT services to Singaporean customers.</p>
Crypto.com Arena Not Affected
<p>After the exchange announced shuttering its institutional services for US customers, speculation arose that it might affect the naming rights for Crypto.com Arena. The exchange entered into a naming rights agreement with AEG, the owner and operator of the arena formerly known as the Staples Center, in 2021, Forbes reports.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Twitter and Dogecoin (DOGE), is complicit in the rise to fame of the first meme coin cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Despite the crypto markets being hit by a renewed wave of meme coin speculation in recent weeks, more investors are dumping their Dogecoin (DOGE) bags to participate in other tokens like Uwerx, which have better use cases.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out why investors are taking this ruthless path to participate in the promising presale of Uwerx and recover their lost meme coin-laden portfolio.</p>
Dogecoin (Dogecoin): A Crypto Once Loved By All
<p>Initially developed as a joke by two software engineers, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the first ever meme coin created in 2013. </p>
<p>Elon Musk, nicknamed the Doge Father, has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin (DOGE) and continues to tweet about the meme coin until many investors caught onto the revelation, sending the token&rsquo;s price jumping on many occasions.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency is currently the ninth largest cryptocurrency in the world, having a market capitalization of over $10 billion but has fallen off the good graces of the entire crypto community. Currently having a trading volume of $169.945, 370, and trading at $0.0734, less than 90% of his all-time high price of $0.7316. </p>
<p>In the recent wake of meme coin trading, even degen traders have shifted their attention off</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) to focus more on new meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu(FLOKI), which are currently making all the waves in the meme coin world. Because of this, experts predict the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) to reach a bare minimum of $0.095 in the last quarter of 2023.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): A Token Set To Ride The Wave And Establish Itself As The New Market Leader
<p>Uwerx has been in every investor&rsquo;s mouth for completing their stage 1 and stage 2 presale in a record time of 17 days and 8 days, respectively.</p>
<p>Uwerx platform is treading the least but most rewarding path of utility by offering freelancers a chance to enjoy the web3 community-first ambiance. With 5,000 registered users on the platform, they plan to expand and transform the trillion-dollar freelance economy with their hard-to-beat offerings to freelancers and clients. </p>
<p>They are doing this by offering a wide range of benefits, like flagging a service fee of 1%, which is small compared to the 15% charged by popular freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. Uwerkwill also provide more security and decentralization to the freelancers by allowing them to transact without needing a third party.</p>
<p>Not only is Uwerx focused on creating the best freelance platform there is, but they also plan on rewarding early adopters with a test airdrop of the WERX token after the end of its presale rounds on the 31st of July. After three successful presales, the WERX token sells for $0.041 per token in its stage 5 presale.</p>
<p>Uwerx contract has been certified by top auditing firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network, and its WERX token is currently listed on CoinSniper with pending listings on other platforms like Uniswap, CoinGecko, and CoinMarketCap.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Is Set To Break Into the Bull Market In Style
<p>Liquidity locking for a set period, renouncing contract ownership, reducing taxes to zero, and incentivizing holders are all markers for cryptos that plan on staying for the long term. These qualities will inevitably benefit Uwerx from the hyper-liquidity that will be deployed during the bull market.</p>
<p>Strategic positioning is one of the ways to make the most out of any crypto, starting at the presale phase. You can check out the Uwerx project and join in on the presale before the price goes parabolic with these links:</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Twitter and Dogecoin (DOGE), is complicit in the rise to fame of the first meme coin cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Despite the crypto markets being hit by a renewed wave of meme coin speculation in recent weeks, more investors are dumping their Dogecoin (DOGE) bags to participate in other tokens like Uwerx, which have better use cases.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out why investors are taking this ruthless path to participate in the promising presale of Uwerx and recover their lost meme coin-laden portfolio.</p>
Dogecoin (Dogecoin): A Crypto Once Loved By All
<p>Initially developed as a joke by two software engineers, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the first ever meme coin created in 2013. </p>
<p>Elon Musk, nicknamed the Doge Father, has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin (DOGE) and continues to tweet about the meme coin until many investors caught onto the revelation, sending the token&rsquo;s price jumping on many occasions.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency is currently the ninth largest cryptocurrency in the world, having a market capitalization of over $10 billion but has fallen off the good graces of the entire crypto community. Currently having a trading volume of $169.945, 370, and trading at $0.0734, less than 90% of his all-time high price of $0.7316. </p>
<p>In the recent wake of meme coin trading, even degen traders have shifted their attention off</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) to focus more on new meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu(FLOKI), which are currently making all the waves in the meme coin world. Because of this, experts predict the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) to reach a bare minimum of $0.095 in the last quarter of 2023.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): A Token Set To Ride The Wave And Establish Itself As The New Market Leader
<p>Uwerx has been in every investor&rsquo;s mouth for completing their stage 1 and stage 2 presale in a record time of 17 days and 8 days, respectively.</p>
<p>Uwerx platform is treading the least but most rewarding path of utility by offering freelancers a chance to enjoy the web3 community-first ambiance. With 5,000 registered users on the platform, they plan to expand and transform the trillion-dollar freelance economy with their hard-to-beat offerings to freelancers and clients. </p>
<p>They are doing this by offering a wide range of benefits, like flagging a service fee of 1%, which is small compared to the 15% charged by popular freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. Uwerkwill also provide more security and decentralization to the freelancers by allowing them to transact without needing a third party.</p>
<p>Not only is Uwerx focused on creating the best freelance platform there is, but they also plan on rewarding early adopters with a test airdrop of the WERX token after the end of its presale rounds on the 31st of July. After three successful presales, the WERX token sells for $0.041 per token in its stage 5 presale.</p>
<p>Uwerx contract has been certified by top auditing firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network, and its WERX token is currently listed on CoinSniper with pending listings on other platforms like Uniswap, CoinGecko, and CoinMarketCap.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Is Set To Break Into the Bull Market In Style
<p>Liquidity locking for a set period, renouncing contract ownership, reducing taxes to zero, and incentivizing holders are all markers for cryptos that plan on staying for the long term. These qualities will inevitably benefit Uwerx from the hyper-liquidity that will be deployed during the bull market.</p>
<p>Strategic positioning is one of the ways to make the most out of any crypto, starting at the presale phase. You can check out the Uwerx project and join in on the presale before the price goes parabolic with these links:</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>IC1101 is committed to providing a more immersive, fun, and autonomous experience than the current metaverse. IC1101, named after its astronomical designation, shines with infinite, mysterious light in the vast universe. As one of the largest known galaxies in the universe, IC1101 represents a huge, mysterious, and spectacular existence. It undoubtedly contains endless wonders and unknowns waiting for human exploration.</p>
<p>IC1101 is a mysterious galaxy, a new metaverse project name, and a super immersive multi-dimensional universe platform dedicated to providing a more immersive, fun, and autonomous experience than the current metaverse. Participants will be able to explore the mysterious qualities of IC1101 and discover endless possibilities within it.</p>
<p>Current metaverse projects often have limitations in terms of graphics, immersion, and participant decision-making power. IC1101 aims to solve these limitations and take the realism, participation, and activity of the metaverse world to a new level.</p>
<p>So, can it stand out in fierce competition and become a dark horse? Let us embark on the journey of IC1101 together, explore this mysterious galaxy, and find the answers.</p>
When Adventure Meets Creativity
<p>In the world of the metaverse, a fascinating worldview is particularly important: it not only determines the style of the project and the immersion of the players, but also opens up more imagination space for storytelling. As a galaxy full of wonders and fantasies, IC1101 has a unique and captivating worldview, bringing unprecedented experiences to participants.</p>
<p>The worldview of IC1101 is based on diversity and freedom. Eight major races converge in this galaxy, each with unique appearances and abilities. From appearance to cultural customs, from ideological concepts to social structures, the differences between races in IC1101 are rich and inclusive. In this galaxy, players will be able to explore the blending and mutual influence of diverse cultures, and feel the interaction and cooperation between different races.</p>
<p>IC1101 also provides players with great freedom and creativity. Players can choose their own role identity, create unique appearance and personality traits, and participate in various exciting activities and scenarios, such as driving spaceships to explore unknown planets in the galaxy, discovering hidden cosmic secrets; They can also join teams, collaborate to solve complex puzzles and tasks, and experience the fruits of cooperation and unity. At the same time, players can also trade in the economic market of IC1101, buying and selling various precious resources and items, and developing their own wealth and power.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overall, IC1101 combines elements of science fiction, fantasy, and mystery. Players will find themselves in a colorful and mysterious interstellar world, where every exploration and adventure brings new surprises and challenges. But how will this worldview be realized through technology?</p>
Multi-platform support attracts different user groups.
<p>Overall, IC1101 is an immersive metaverse platform based on a multi-chain architecture that allows users from different public chains to easily connect. Through the introduction of token economics and NFTs, users can have their own digital assets and ownership, and can engage in social and game cooperation to complete tasks, satisfy their desires, and earn rewards.</p>
<p>IC1101's appeal is not just in its technological innovation and diverse universe construction, but more importantly, in its ability to attract different types of user groups.</p>
<p>Before introducing specific products and technologies, it is worth considering who will be interested in the metaverse. We can divide IC1101's audience into two categories, heavy gamers and casual gamers.</p>
<p>The former includes tech enthusiasts and gamers who have some technical expertise and equipment requirements, are interested in immersive virtual experiences, and pursue the ultimate experience; while the latter are more focused on commercial and social aspects, such as enterprises or projects interested in Web3 business models, and players who want to find more social opportunities and new friends in the virtual world.</p>
<p>Based on the needs of different user groups, IC1101 provides two products to meet their expectations: IC1101 World and IC1101 Space.</p>
IC1101 World: A more immersive metaverse world.
<p>IC1101 World is a more immersive metaverse world. In terms of technology and graphics, it is created using the Unreal Engine 5, with outstanding image quality that forms a strong contrast to most of the current metaverse projects made with the Unity engine, which tend to be low-poly in style.</p>
<p>In actual gameplay experience, we can see finely detailed graphics similar to those of AAA games, including finely detailed building details, dynamic blur during movement, and reflection of ripples on the water surface, all of which make players feel fully immersed in a virtual world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In terms of scene design, IC1101 World provides more three-dimensional scenes, including different planets and buildings. Each planet has a unique theme and function, such as planets specifically designed for battles and planets for exhibitions and demonstrations. Different buildings also serve different purposes, such as Sony's music hall, which can be used for music playback and related artist activities.</p>

Different buildings also have different functions, such as Sony's music hall, which can be used for music playback and artist-related activities.</p>
<p>In addition, virtual assets have been mapped more realistically in the IC1101 World, and players can directly view and purchase NFTs in the mall, change outfits, and become a 3D image of the NFT, which also provides possibilities for more collaborative creation.</p>
IC1101 Space: Lower Threshold for Participation
<p>IC1101 World will bring better graphics and a more immersive world to players, but the cost is higher hardware requirements for accessing devices. A well-configured computer may be needed to smoothly enter the metaverse.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is a hardcore gamer or an extreme immersion seeker. For more casual players who want to experience the scenes and interactions of the metaverse, IC1101 provides another option: IC1101 Space.</p>
<p>IC1101 Space can be accessed through a simple browser login, presented in the form of a webpage, making it convenient and fast to use. Although the graphics may not be as detailed as the World version, they significantly lower the barrier to entry, making them particularly suitable for commercial and social users.</p>
<p>In IC1101 Space, players can take on their own roles and participate in online displays and interactions. Compared to traditional social media platforms, IC1101 Space provides richer ways of interaction. In the same scene, players can communicate and greet others, have deeper interactions with organizations, media, and partners they are interested in, bringing them closer together. Immersion is not the first choice for social demand orientation, as it is more important to allow more people to participate in the activities together. IC1101 has achieved this very well.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the user data and scenes of the two versions, IC1101 World and IC1101 Space, are interoperable. This means that users can choose different login methods according to their own needs, but their behavior is visible in both versions, and together they influence the world of IC1101. This versioning method for different user groups can attract more users and provide better experiences for different types of participants. This is relatively rare in current metaverse projects, and many projects may not have considered this layered demand.</p>
<p>For hardcore players and explorers who are looking for ultimate graphics and immersion, IC1101 World provides a more immersive metaverse experience. For casual players who want to participate in metaverse social and business activities, IC1101 Space provides a lower threshold for participation. Whether for technology enthusiasts, gamers, business users, or social users, IC1101 can meet their needs and create new digital experiences and lifestyles for them.</p>
A sense of participation puts the galaxy within reach.
<p>The essence of social interaction is a sense of participation. People are the sum of social relationships, and in many metaverse projects, simple display and gathering are only a one-way and low-interaction social relationships, which cannot give players a strong sense of participation. Over time, players will feel empty and boring, and a rich and fulfilling virtual world seems out of reach.</p>
<p>Therefore, the metaverse also needs to be built around a sense of participation, so that users are willing, good at, and immersed in this virtual world, becoming "digital natives" in the metaverse.</p>
<p>In addition to excellent graphics and sensitive user segmentation, IC1101 is also working on a sense of participation.</p>
<p>Firstly, in terms of social aspects, in IC1101, users can enter with their own NFT digital avatars, and can also use these avatars within IC1101. This way, users can communicate with others in the virtual world through their digital avatars. Through functions such as lobby chat, private chat, friend teaming, community tasks/activities, live streaming, and social media sharing, users can establish emotional connections with others. In addition, users can also enhance friendships by sending friends gifts. These social functions not only allow users to display their digital avatars in IC1101, but also to establish real social relationships with others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, let's delve into the gaming aspect. IC1101 is committed to creating interactive gaming spaces. In the world of IC1101, users can indulge in a wide variety of casual games, enticing more Web2 multi-users to migrate to the Web3 world. With diverse gaming experiences, IC1101 offers users more interactive and entertaining choices, allowing them to have a stronger sense of engagement within the game.</p>
<p>In addition, IC1101 provides a whole new shopping experience. Users can present and sell 2D NFTs purchased on other platforms in a 3D manner within IC1101. Furthermore, brand collaborations are able to bring users a shopping experience beyond reality. By partnering with brands, IC1101 has created a 3D NFT digital mall, offering users a completely new way of shopping and experiencing.</p>
<p>Finally, IC1101 also allows users to participate in scenario decision-making. Users can vote to decide the functions of buildings and scenes implemented in the metaverse world. This way, users can participate in the construction process of the metaverse, express their opinions and ideas, and further enhance their sense of participation in IC1101.</p>
Expert Team
<p>The project members of IC1101 are a group of creative industry experts with an average of 15 years of experience in their respective fields. The team members are located in North America and Asia, and have worked for globally renowned companies such as Dfinity, UBISOFT, Disney, Unity SF, and Konami. They have had long-standing partnerships with top global companies such as Blizzard, EA, Sony, and Amazon, and have participated in the development of many well-known products such as Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Harry Potter, New World, and The Last of Us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The team members have a great passion for the Metaverse project and a deep understanding of it. They are familiar with the concept and development trends of the Metaverse, and are committed to creating an exciting and meaningful virtual experience for users.</p>
<p>The strength and partnerships of the IC1101 team have laid a solid foundation for the success of the project. Their professional knowledge and rich experience will ensure that IC1101 can provide the best technical solutions and continuously drive the development of the Metaverse. The team's goal is to create a realistic and engaging virtual world for users where everyone can experience unlimited possibilities and fun.</p>
SPACE X 3.0: Immerse Yourself in the Advanced Metaverse
<p>Even before its official launch, IC1101 offers a unique opportunity for an early experience that everyone has been eagerly waiting for.</p>
<p>On June 6th, starting at 10:00 AM, IC1101 is hosting a significant event called "SPACE X 3.0" Demo Day, providing a vital chance for those interested in the project. This event will showcase the latest developments of the IC1101 project and allow participants to have a firsthand experience of its remarkable products.</p>
<p>"SPACE X 3.0" Demo Day will take place in IC1101 Space. Participants will enter this metaverse in the form of digital avatars and engage in interactions with others. The event will offer a diverse range of experiences, including airdrops of tokens and real-time PvP competitions.</p>
<p>From the scenes of the event, it's apparent that the inaugural Demo Day has attracted thousands of visitors and garnered support from 30 VCs and 8 media outlets. This demonstrates the convenience, immersion, and engagement that IC1101 provides to its participants.</p>
<p>Beyond the event itself, we are also highly excited about the future of the IC1101 project. Through the showcase at Demo Day, IC1101 will unveil its enormous potential and prospects as a real metaverse to the world, bringing users more innovation and thrilling experiences.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Trading app Robinhood will remove Solana, Cardano and Polygon from its platform come June 27. The move comes after the SEC alleged that several crypto tokens are unregistered securities. </p>
<p>Robinhood Markets Inc. announced today that it would end support for Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) as of June 27.</p>
No Other Coins Will Be Affected
<p>The trading app informed users they would no longer be able to trade the tokens on its platform just days after the SEC labelled several popular cryptocurrencies unregistered securities. The regulator made the allegations in a lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao.</p>
<p>The lawsuit names Cardano, Polygon, Solana, Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti (COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS). The suit also identified the BUSD and BNB stablecoins as securities.</p>
<p>Robinhood limited its delisting to SOL, ADA, and MATIC and said to users that no other coins would be affected and would remain safe on its platform.</p>
<p>It had been reported that the trading app would review its cryptocurrency offerings. On Tuesday, the company&rsquo;s chief legal officer, Dan Gallagher, told Congress that it is &ldquo;actively reviewing&rdquo; the SEC&rsquo;s analysis &ldquo;to determine what if any, action to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallagher, a former SEC commissioner, testified before the House Agriculture Committee during a meeting on digital assets.</p>
SEC Sparkes Chaos in the Crypto Market
<p>The securities agency filed lawsuits against two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges &ndash; Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<p>According to the SEC, Binance mishandled customer funds and deceived investors and regulators about its operations. It further alleged that both Zhao and the exchange failed to restrict US customers from its platform and charged Binance with operating as an unregistered securities exchange.</p>
<p>The agency filed suit against Binance&rsquo;s rival platform, Coinbase, accusing the exchange of acting as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearinghouse. The SEC charged Coinbase for &ldquo;the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a recent blog post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled a roadmap consisting of three significant technical transitions that he believes are vital for ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
Three must-implement transitions
<p>Buterin emphasises that these transitions, namely Layer 2 scaling, wallet security enhancement, and privacy measures, are essential in maintaining Ethereum's decentralised nature and for guaranteeing open and unrestricted access for all users.</p>
<p>Failure to implement these transitions, warns Buterin, could potentially undermine Ethereum's viability as a robust and widely adopted platform.</p>
Layer 2 scaling
<p>The first transition focuses on scaling Layer 2 solutions. Over the past few years, Ethereum has witnessed the emergence of a Layer 2 ecosystem comprising solutions like Optimistic Rollup and Zero Knowledge-Rollup, which have effectively reduced transaction costs. However, as the majority of activities still occur on the main Ethereum network, further maturation and scaling of the Layer 2 space are necessary.</p>
<p>Buterin highlights the potential consequences of neglecting Layer 2 scaling, including skyrocketing transaction fees during market expansion phases or bullish market trends. Such circumstances may lead users to seek centralised alternatives, posing a threat to Ethereum's decentralisation goals.</p>

<p>"The absence of the first transition, Layer 2 scaling, would render Ethereum vulnerable, with each transaction costing $3.75 ($82.48 during a bullish market). This would inevitably drive mass-market products to disregard the Ethereum chain and adopt centralized workarounds," Buterin explained.</p>

Wallet security
<p>The second transition highlighted by Buterin centres around wallet security. Buterin expresses concern that potential security risks may discourage users from storing their funds and non-financial assets on the Ethereum network, driving them towards centralised exchanges as a safer alternative.</p>

<p>"Without the second transition, wallet security, Ethereum's success is compromised as users become hesitant to store their funds securely. This could result in a mass migration towards centralized exchanges," warns Buterin.</p>

<p>To enhance wallet security, Buterin proposes a shift towards smart contract wallets with advanced features such as social recovery, similar to the concept of account abstraction. These enhanced wallets would offer improved security measures and an enhanced user experience.</p>
Privacy
<p>The third and final transition emphasised by Buterin is privacy. He cautions that the absence of robust data privacy measures may discourage users from utilising Ethereum's capabilities fully. To address this concern, Buterin suggests the implementation of stealth address protocols, which would provide privacy features for Ethereum users.</p>
<p>By integrating stealth address protocols, Ethereum would be able to offer enhanced privacy options, attracting users who value anonymity and data protection.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UK&rsquo;s FCA announced stricter crypto marketing rules this week, prohibiting giving away free NFTs and cryptocurrencies to promote digital asset investing. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced tighter advertising rules for the crypto industry, which will take force on October 8. Giving away free NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and cryptocurrencies via airdrops to encourage users to invest in digital assets will no longer be allowed.</p>
<p>Matthew Long, the FCA&rsquo;s director of payments and digital assets, told media publication CoinDesk, that frequently these NFTs and airdrops when used as promotional products, result in consumers buying crypto that they realise &ldquo;can be problematic later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long added that NFTs and airdrops will not be banned, merely promotions involving them.</p>
FCA Classifies Crypto as &ldquo;Restricted Mass Market Investment&rdquo;
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s newly published rules categorise crypto as a &ldquo;restricted mass market investment&rdquo; and will require firms promoting crypto products or services to introduce clear risk warnings. The regulator also said &ldquo;refer a friend&rdquo; bonuses incentivising the public to invest in cryptocurrencies will be banned. The new rules will require a &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period for first-time investors to discourage impulsive crypto purchases. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Research by the FCA reveals that estimated crypto ownership has more than doubled from 2021 to 2022, with 10% of the 2,000 people surveyed indicating that they own cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Sheldon Mills, executive director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said:</p>

<p>It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice.</p>
<p>Consumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk. Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money.</p>

FCA Goes Ahead With Tighter Rules Despite Industry Pushback
<p>The FCA consulted on its proposed marketing rules in 2022 and found that respondents largely disagreed with rules such as banning incentives, blocking new investors from getting non-real-time promotional offers (DOFP) and treating crypto as a mass market investment.</p>
<p>As it stands, only entities that have received authorisation from the FCA can approve their own advertisements. Given that there is no framework currently in place that allows the FCA to authorise crypto firms fully, the government has created a temporary exemption that will enable crypto firms registered with the FCA to comply with its AML requirements to approve their own advertisements starting in October.</p>
<p>The measure, as stated, is only temporary, and eventually, only FCA-authorised entities will be permitted to approve ads. Some industry players, however, caution the requirement may be too restrictive.</p>
<p>The FCA will go forward with the above measures despite industry pushback.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance.US announced on Thursday that it is suspending US dollar deposits, and its banking partners are preparing to halt fiat dollar withdrawals come June 13. </p>
<p>On Thursday, Binance&rsquo;s US arm said it would suspend US dollar (USD) deposits on its platform, while its banking partners have said it will pause fiat dollar withdrawals channels as soon as June 13, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>The exchange said in a tweet it is taking &ldquo;proactive steps&rdquo; as it transitions to a crypto-only exchange for the time being following the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuit earlier this week. The platform said staking, trading, deposits, and withdrawals in cryptocurrency remain fully operational. Binance.US further told its users it maintains a 1:1 reserve for customer assets.</p>

<p>In a notice to customers, the exchange explained why it chose to take this step:</p>

<p>The SEC has taken to using extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics in its pursuit of an ideological campaign against the American digital asset industry. Binance.US and our business partners have not been spared in the use of these tactics, which has created challenges for the banks with whom we work.</p>

SEC Cracks Down on Crypto
<p>This week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appeared to declare all-out war on the crypto industry. The agency kicked the week off by suing Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, alleging the exchange mishandled customer funds and deceived investors and regulators about its operations. It further stated that both Zhao and the exchange failed to restrict US customers from its platform.</p>
<p>The SEC stepped up its attack the next day when it came after crypto exchange Coinbase. According to the agency, Coinbase acted as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearinghouse, charging it for &ldquo;the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the agency came directly after Binance.US by filing a motion in federal court for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of two of its unit - BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services. The SEC alleged that Zhao and Binance&rsquo;s parent company controlled these two units secretly.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Nostra creator Fiatjaf launches the most decentralised social media yet. Built on Bitcoin it enables users to own their content and be able to send microtransactions.</p>
Social media platforms are censored
<p>The social media platforms of today are highly successful, but at what cost? It turns out that Twitter was being used by government to suppress certain conversations that were against their narrative, and Youtube regularly de-platforms anyone who is perceived to not be following their rules. Other social media platforms are in a similar position.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is successful because it cannot be taken down by any government or their agencies. It is for the people to be able to protect their wealth from a banking system that does not serve them.</p>
Fairly rewarded content
<p>Nostr was built on top of Bitcoin, and is the first open protocol that is truly censorship-resistant. ZEBEDEE and Nostr co-creator Fiatjaf have taken this further, and on Thursday launched the ZBD app, which will enable users to have their content fairly rewarded, in that they will be able to keep 99% of the value they created.</p>
<p>The social media features of the new app includes a game-changing development called &ldquo;Zaps&rdquo;. These are tiny micropayments as small as $0.0002, which can be sent to anyone in the world instantly and without censorship.</p>
<p>The messages, profiles, and posts are not limited to any one platform, and can flow across any Nostr-powered app or website, so if one platform is shut down there are many more that can receive the social media.</p>
<p>Also featured on the new app is the ability to be able to send payments through DMs (Direct Messaging), and to earn payments through games, podcasts, music, art, and whatever a user can dream up that might create value.</p>
Empowerment of people
<p>Andr&eacute; Neves, CTO and co-founder of ZEBEDEE said of the launch of the ZBD app:</p>
<p>&ldquo;ZEBEDEE is all about empowering people through open, decentralized technologies. The new social layer within the ZBD app delivers an all-in-one space for people to connect, play, and earn while embracing our core values. We're spicing up the ZBD ecosystem to offer an unprecedented user experience, blending social media, gaming, shopping, and Bitcoin,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the ZEBEDEE PR announcement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To secure early access to this upgrade of the ZBD app, available for iOS and Android, users can sign up at https://zeb.gg/early-access. Or go to zbd.gg and follow @zbdapp on their legacy social media platform of choice.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Australia&rsquo;s Commonwealth Bank introduced new processes to help protect customers from scams associated with making payments to certain crypto exchanges. </p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank in Australia on Thursday introduced new measures to protect customers from possible scam risks associated with making payments to &ldquo;certain&rdquo; crypto exchanges. The bank announced it would decline or hold certain payments to crypto exchanges for 24 hours.</p>
<p>It further said in the coming months, it would introduce AU$10,000 ($6,700) limits in a calendar month, giving the bank time to identify the customer payments to exchanges for crypto purchases.</p>
<p>The bank added that it would closely monitor its new measure&rsquo;s efficacy, saying they are subject to ongoing review.</p>
<p>James Roberts, Commonwealth Bank General Manager of Group Fraud Management Services, said:</p>

<p>Consumer interest in cryptocurrencies has been increasing, and unfortunately scammers globally are capitalising on this trend and masquerading as legitimate investment opportunities or diverting funds into cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>The introduction of 24-hour holds, declines and limits on outbound payments to cryptocurrency exchanges will help reduce both the number of scams and the amount of money lost by customers.</p>

Measures Will Note Eliminate Scam Risk
<p>While the measures will not do away with scam risks, they are designed to reduce customers&rsquo; risk of falling victim to a scam.</p>
<p>Mr Robert further stated:</p>

<p>Customers who make payments to cryptocurrency exchanges are currently facing a significantly higher risk of potentially being scammed.</p>
<p>While these measures will not eliminate the risk of customers suffering losses as a result of a scam that involves a payment to a cryptocurrency exchange, they are part of a range of initiatives designed to help customers reduce their risk of falling victim to a scam.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Deutsche Telekom, the technology giant, has joined the Polygon blockchain as a validator node, signalling its ambitions to become an infrastructure provider in the web3 space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dirk R&ouml;der, the head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom, was quoted by DL News as saying that &ldquo;supporting the Polygon network as a validator is a big milestone in this objective&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
Polygon not a layer 2?
<p>Deutsche Telekom has decided to support the Ethereum ecosystem and its scalability solutions, and Polygon, known as the leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling platform, aligns with that focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Polygon was initially marketed as an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, it has since discontinued that terminology due to concerns about misrepresentation. Polygon is a sidechain, independent from Ethereum for its security, although it commits its transaction history to Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company's assets are secured by a multi-signature wallet controlled by a small group of individuals or entities. Deutsche Telekom also runs validators for other major and minor blockchains, including Ethereum, Q, Celo, Flow, and Energy Web.&nbsp;</p>
Trad telecom company branches into cool new tech
<p>The company's strategy for running validators remains unclear, with R&ouml;der highlighting that blockchain technology presents a valid business case and Deutsche Telekom receives percentages of the rewards.</p>
<p>However, another representative clarified that the company does not stake its own crypto assets but relies on others to do so while taking a cut of their rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some might speculate that Deutsche Telekom's involvement with blockchains could be a marketing strategy to appeal to a younger user base, overall, Deutsche Telekom's foray into node validation demonstrates its commitment to web3 infrastructure and its interest in the Ethereum ecosystem's scalability solutions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It is being alleged by Binance lawyers that Gary Gensler, current chairman of the SEC, offered his services to Binance as an advisor back in March 2019.</p>
Gensler and Binance
<p>With Gary Gensler causing panic and mayhem in the crypto markets as he serves Binance and Coinbase with notice to sue them for alleged misdemeanours such as listing securities and failing to register with the SEC, it comes as quite some surprise to learn that he may have offered his services as an advisor to Binance four years earlier.</p>
<p>It was reported by CNBC that Gensler had a series of conversations with Binance officials and CEO Changpeng Zhao himself in March of that year. It was alleged by Binance lawyers that Gensler was perfectly happy with discussing the role of an informal advisor for the crypto exchange.</p>
Gensler lauds Algorand
<p>This was at a time when Gensler was teaching a blockchain course as a professor at MIT. Gensler appeared to be quite unperturbed with the crypto industry back then, and is on record as saying that most cryptocurrencies are not securities and lauded the technology of Algorand and its founder Silvio Micali, calling it &ldquo;great technology&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Four years later, Gensler, now the chairman of the SEC, includes $ALGO, the native token of Algorand, as one of several &ldquo;securities&rdquo; that both Binance and Coinbase list on their exchanges.</p>
<p>Given the alleged ties between Gensler, Zhao, and Binance, lawyers acting for Binance say that &ldquo;they&rsquo;d asked for his recusal from any actions regarding the company. They say they got no acknowledgement from SEC staff.&rdquo;</p>
A 180 degree change of mind
<p>Gensler&rsquo;s about face on crypto obviously happened once he landed the job as SEC chairman, and it does appear a little odd that he would have such a complete change of mind on the sector.</p>
<p>It probably can&rsquo;t be argued that Gensler was a novice in financial affairs when he was said to be having discussions with Binance. By that time he had spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs as Head of Finance, had served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets for the US Treasury, and had completed a stint as Chairman of the CFTC.</p>
<p>When Gensler levied all of the highly public enforcement actions against some of the most compliant companies in the crypto space, such as Kraken, Paxos, and Coinbase, he must have been fully aware of the consequences of such actions for the crypto market and for all the retail investors in these markets.</p>
Tasked with bringing crypto down?
<p>The actions of the SEC chairman do appear to be designed to cause the maximum turbulence and damage to the crypto industry and must have caused investors to lose some part of their invested funds.</p>
<p>Has Gensler been tasked with destroying the crypto industry in the US? Is this the plan of the Biden Administration? With the crypto industry perhaps being seen as a threat to the US banking system, this might well be a plausible assumption.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">The cryptocurrency market continues to experience significant volatility, with two of the top 100 cryptos, &nbsp;Mask Network (MASK) and ApeCoin (APE), declining. These tokens&rsquo; price fluctuations persist in a negative direction, leaving investors hoping for a potential rebound soon.</p>
<p class="s6">In contrast, the Uwerx presale generates increasing excitement as it maintains an upward trend. This cryptocurrency project aims to make a remarkable contribution to the freelance economy, attracting bullish sentiment from investors. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in these crypto projects recently.</p>
ApeCoin (APE) Is Fueling the Next Metaverse Evolution
<p class="s6">Launched by Yuga Labs in March 2022, ApeCoin (APE) is the backbone for incentivizing and powering activities within the ApeCoin network. Notably, ApeCoin (APE) has emerged as the leading metaverse token in terms of market capitalization.</p>
<p class="s6">A key milestone for ApeCoin (APE) has been the introduction of staking, enabling users to lock a portion of their ApeCoin (APE) holdings and participate in transaction validation.</p>
<p class="s6">With its attractive features, ApeCoin (APE) has garnered significant popularity. Users benefit from low transaction fees, ensuring cost-effective transactions. The network also offers instant transaction processing, enhancing the overall user experience. Moreover, ApeCoin (APE) seamlessly integrates with popular gaming platforms, further driving its appeal in the metaverse space.</p>
<p class="s6">As the metaverse continues to evolve and gain traction, ApeCoin (APE) stands out as a prominent player, fueling the virtual ecosystem and offering a range of benefits to its users. However, ApeCoin (APE) has steadily declined over the last 30 days. As of writing, ApeCoin(APE) is up by 1.5%. However, it is down by 14% in the last 30 days, with its 24-hour trading volume decreasing by 16.86%.</p>
MASK Network (MASK): Powering The Revolution of Social Apps
<p class="s6">MASK Network (MASK) is an encrypted social messaging platform enabling secure crypto transactions and file-sharing. Its native token, $MASK, facilitates crypto transfers, grants access to platform features, and allows participation in community voting. </p>
<p class="s6">Recently, MASK Network (MASK) has been in the news. MASK Network (MASK) recently revealed its 3rd Web3 Social Grant round, collaborating with Gitcoin and offering a $50k matching pool. They have also sponsored Decentralized Social Afternoons to foster a vibrant community. </p>
<p class="s6">In addition, MASK Network (MASK) invested in Telegram's TON, aiming to provide innovative solutions to a broad user base. Furthermore, they received 257,540 ARB tokens from Arbitrum, distributing them to incentivize active community members and support the Mask DAO treasury.</p>
<p class="s6">However, MASK Network&rsquo;s (MASK) price has recently declined. The token is down by 2% as of writing. Its 24-hour trading volume has also slumped by 14.83%.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale Continues to Surge
<p class="s6">Uwerx, an innovative cryptocurrency platform for freelancers and clients, is gaining traction with its exciting services and 1% flat fee. </p>
<p class="s6">Having already secured audit approval from SolidProof and InterFi, Uwerx is currently in its stage 5 presale, moving past stage 1 to 4 within a few weeks while selling millions of WERX tokens. As a result of the rapid success of Uwerx's presale, the Uwerx team adjusted its token allocation, with the presale getting a boosted 57% (427.5 million WERX tokens) of the 700 million total token supply. The team has also announced that the stage 5 presale is set to go live soon. </p>
<p class="s6">Furthermore, the native token, WERX, is currently priced at $0.041, experiencing significant growth from its starting price of $0.005. Industry experts are highly optimistic about the future of the Uwerx token, predicting it to surpass $3 by Q1 2024. </p>
<p class="s6">However, Uwerx is achieving more success in other areas of the project. Excitingly, the anticipated Alpha Version of the platform has been launched, featuring the landing page and sign-in/sign-up pages. Additional features such as login, user dashboard, job posting, job search, and more will continue to be rolled out weekly/bi-weekly. Transition to the Beta version will follow soon, allowing users to test the new platform. Users can provide valuable feedback by emailing feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx has also introduced a new feature called the Uwerx Vault, enabling users to stake their tokens for a preferred duration and earn rewards. As of writing, Uwerx has obtained 5,546 sign-ups and 1,627 and 1,456 followers on Twitter and Telegram, respectively.</p>
<p class="s6">Initially planned to be locked for 25 years after the presale, the developer's liquidity tokens will be locked sooner after 82.8% of the Uwerx community votes in its favor. Details regarding the lock date will be announced shortly. Additionally, 92.8% of the Uwerx community has approved a test airdrop to validate user wallet addresses.</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx team also plans to renounce ownership of smart contracts upon listing on centralized exchanges, highlighting their commitment to decentralization. With the recent price increase, Uwerx is nearing its proposed $0.095 to $0.115 launch price as the presale is set to close on July 31, 2023. So seize the moment to invest in the crypto market&rsquo;s next big thing today and get a 15% bonus on all purchases.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained bearishly on the defensive early in the Asian session as the pair weakened to the 26121.06 area after peaking around the 27402.79 area, representing a test of the 61.8% retracement of the depreciating range from 28473.93 to 25351.92.&nbsp; The pair remains unable to sustain traction above the 27000 figure after being lifted to the 27402.79 area, an appreciation that represented a test of the 27466.83 area.&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 25474.18 area by bears as BTC/USD was pushed lower to the 25351.92 area, its weakest print since mid-March.&nbsp; This move lower also represents a test of the 25309.26 area, a level that represents the 50% retracement of the appreciating range from 19568.52 to 30825.30.&nbsp; Stops are cited below major retracement levels linked to the 19568.52 and 15460 levels, including the 25309, 25094, 23954, 23255, 22278, 22025, 21415, 19139, and 18796 areas.</p>
