<p>Arkham said that this is the latest in a string of market activity that has weakened many short positions in Alameda after bankruptcy.</p>



<p>On December 29, about 30 hours after liquidators started moving assets out of the Alameda wallet, the Alameda wallet <strong>transferred $7 million USDC and $4 million DAI from the decentralized crypto lending platform intermediate AAVE</strong> to a separate optimistic L2 account occurs.</p>



<p>This withdrawal puts the position at high risk of liquidation, resulting in <strong>11.4 million USDC being sold to the liquidation bot on Optimism </strong>and an additional<strong> 100,000 USDC being collected as liquidation tax by the AAVE vault.</strong></p>



<p>Arkham explained that if the liquidator used a function to instantly close the position by selling the collateral instead of withdrawing it from the wallet, <strong>at least $15 million could be kept instead of $11 million being recovered</strong>. Therefore, a preventable loss is equivalent to $4 million.</p>



<p>Before that, on January 13, liquidator Alameda lost $72,000 on Aave while trying to consolidate funds. Coincu News <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160773-alameda-lost-over-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated </a>on January 15 that Alameda wallet has lost over $1 million in assets due to liquidation.</p>

<p>As part of its earlier bigger objectives to make the protocol viable and lucrative, <strong>the protocol will place a strong emphasis on DEX products this year. </strong></p>

<p>In particular, the firm&#8217;s objective is to become a market-leading DEX by enhancing its product stack and achieving feature parity to give a solid platform for innovation, such as <strong>biased LP routes via aggregation router and focused liquidity</strong>, which will be available in Q1 2023.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Ultimately, we will provide deep liquidity, optimal pricing, sustainable tokenomics, &amp; an easy-to-use platform, placing <em>you</em> first in everything we build.</p>

<p>The DeFi Protocol was built as a copy of Uniswap, but with additional liquidity mining and governance features. According to DefiLlama statistics, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157513-kashi-and-miso-platforms-sushiswap/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/157513-kashi-and-miso-platforms-sushiswap/" rel="noreferrer noopener">SushiSwap</a>, the DEX, had approximately<strong> $457.8 million in locked token</strong> value as of Tuesday. A total of <strong>$329.6 million is invested in Ethereum-based assets.</strong></p>



<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinmarketcap </a>statistics,<strong> SUSHI</strong>, the native token of the <strong>SushiSwap</strong> decentralized exchange, has increased roughly <strong>36%</strong> this year, compared to Ethereum&#8217;s native token ether <strong>(ETH)</strong>, which has risen <strong>33%</strong>.</p>

<p>The protocol created its DEX aggregation router in &#8220;stealth mode&#8221; during 2022, according to Grey, and it will help <strong>offer the greatest user experience by delivering consumers with optimum pricing</strong>. DEX aggregation joins the liquidity pools of numerous decentralized exchanges, allowing traders to get better prices and liquidity. 1inch, OpenOcean, and ParaSwap are among the top DEX aggregators.</p>



<p>Additionally, Sushi is also planning to develop <strong>Sushi Studios</strong>, a decentralized incubator that will license the brand to launch independently-funded initiatives to foster ecosystem growth without burdening the DAO treasury, according to Grey&#8217;s blog.</p>

<h5><strong>Coincheck is the most popular and largest regulated cryptocurrency exchange in Japan. It has over 1.5 million customers and processes billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin transactions per year. Coincheck is a simple cryptocurrency exchange with a limited coin selection, but it also provides crypto loans, an Over-The-Counter (OTC) service desk for larger purchases, and even a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplace.</strong></h5>



<p>In this analysis, we cover the following aspects of the Coincheck platform: its safety, the cryptocurrencies it supports, the fees it imposes, the quality of the trading experience it provides (both on desktop and mobile), and its customer service. In this lesson, you will learn how to create a Coincheck account, how to make a trade, how to deposit assets, and you will also receive an overview of the trading platform.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Introduction of Coincheck</strong></h2>

<p><strong>The amount of Bitcoin transactions on Coincheck in 2017 was the highest of any exchange in Japan</strong>, making it one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges in Asia. The Android and iOS apps offered by Coincheck are used by a greater number of individuals than those offered by any other Asian cryptocurrency exchange. <strong>Coincheck was established in 2012 by Keisuke Wada and Yusuke Otsuka</strong>, whereas the cryptocurrency exchange itself didn&#8217;t start doing business until 2014. Wada is currently acting as CEO, while Otsuka is currently serving as COO, and both founders continue to be active directors. Coincheck is nominally a Japanese exchange; yet, it may be accessed anywhere around the world.</p>



<p><strong>The Japan Blockchain Association</strong> has verified the legitimacy of the exchange and issued it with a license to trade in digital currencies there. In addition to that, it is a member of the <strong>General FinTech Association</strong> as well as the <strong>Japan Virtual Currency Business Operator Association</strong>. It has been reported that the <strong>capital reserves amount to 92 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Coincheck is a cryptocurrency exchange that also<strong> provides merchants with a payment mechanism</strong> that enables them to accept cryptocurrency payments and have those funds automatically converted into the currency of their choice. Another option is a &#8216;loan&#8217; arrangement, which functions very similarly to a<strong> savings account at a traditional bank</strong>. Coincheck users have the opportunity to <strong>earn up to 5% interest</strong> on their deposits by lending the platform bitcoin funds. <strong>The company even offers electricity provision with bills that can be paid in Bitcoin</strong>, which is very off-topic from its principal services because it is offered in partnership with some of the most important power providers in Japan. Coincheck also offers <strong>a prepaid Visa debit card</strong>, which may be loaded with bitcoin and then converted into fiat currency automatically for use in transactions.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Coincheck functions</strong></h2>



<p>As one might expect from a Japanese company that is driven mostly by technological innovation,<strong> Coincheck&#8217;s technological prowess</strong> is one of its key advantages. New users and those who have little to no prior experience with financial exchanges will appreciate the exchange&#8217;s well-made and user-friendly interface. The exchange itself is quite nicely built. Coincheck also provides hosting services for bitcoin wallets, in addition to <strong>mobile apps for Android and iOS that function as digital wallets</strong>. The iPhone operating system can also be used to fund exchange accounts.</p>



<p>The exchange offered by Coincheck allows users to trade Bitcoin in addition to a number of other cryptocurrencies. On the exchange, you&#8217;ll also be able to trade cryptocurrencies such as <strong>Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Lisk, Ripple, Zcash, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero.</strong> Additionally, you can exchange Dash. It does, however, have a tendency to focus on the larger cryptocurrencies, which means that users who are trying to diversify their holdings into more obscure options should not use this exchange.</p>

<h3>Fees for deposits and withdrawals</h3>



<p>Coincheck account holders can fund their accounts using a bank transfer or by using a debit or credit card to add fiat currency. Deposits in Yen are not charged, while deposits in USD are charged <strong>a flat fee of $25 or 2500 from bank accounts outside of Japan.</strong> If account holders want to make cross-cryptocurrency purchases, they can transfer supported cryptocurrency holdings into their account. As the base currency, all prices are denominated in yen.</p>



<p>Withdrawals can be made to a bank account or credit card in addition to cryptocurrency wallets that hold fiat dollars or cryptocurrency. <strong>The fee for withdrawing money in yen is 400, whereas the fee for withdrawing money in US dollars is 2500</strong>. Since Coincheck <strong>does not now charge any fees for trading transactions</strong>, it is currently free to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on the platform. However, this is likely to change in the not too distant future.</p>



<h3>Security and privacy</h3>



<p>Coincheck, like most cryptocurrency exchanges that accept fiat money deposits and withdrawals, provides two categories of accounts with two levels of personal identity verification criteria. <strong>Depositing or withdrawing up to $500 each day takes only an email address and a verified telephone number for SMS verification.</strong> Account holders who want to use larger deposit or withdrawal limits must produce personal identification documents such as a passport or other type of government-issued ID, as well as proof of residency.</p>



<p>Coincheck wallets provide <strong>2-factor authentication security and &#8216;cold storage&#8217;.</strong> This means that someone who hacked the exchange will not be able to access them online. Wallets only become &#8216;hot&#8217; when a transaction is completed.</p>



<h3>Lending in Cryptocurrency</h3>



<p>Coincheck provides a cryptocurrency lending platform that pays interest to users who lend their cryptocurrency to borrowers. Coincheck offers<strong> up to 5.0% APY</strong> on these crypto loans, but the interest is not due until the loan term is up.<strong> Loan periods range from 14 days to 365 days</strong>, with interest rates varying according to term length.</p>



<p>Users can <strong>deposit any of the 17 cryptos supported for lending, select a term duration, and apply to become a lender.</strong> When an application is granted, the coins are locked into the loan term and are not available for withdrawal until the loan term expires or Coincheck chooses to re-deposit cryptocurrency into a user&#8217;s account. While lending with Coincheck can offer <strong>a modest interest rate capped at 5% APY</strong>, there are far better venues to earn money on crypto with greater rates and a wider selection of crypto.</p>

<h3>Purchases that are made on a regular basis (Reserving)</h3>



<p>Coincheck allows investors to purchase cryptocurrency using <strong>Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)</strong>. The &#8220;Reserving&#8221; technique allows users to <strong>utilize fiat currencies to purchase crypto in smaller amounts over time rather than attempting to &#8220;time&#8221; the market.</strong> This method helps to protect against price fluctuations.</p>



<p>Coincheck users only need to link their bank account, choose a preset quantity of cryptocurrency to buy, and establish a timetable (monthly or daily) to automate their crypto purchases. There is a minimum monthly<strong> purchase requirement of 10,000 JPY and a monthly maximum available of 1,000,000 JPY.</strong> At the very least, daily purchases will be made in 1,000 JPY increments. These recurring plans also have no deposit fees, making them a low-cost method to buy cryptocurrency on a monthly basis.</p>



<h3>Verification of Coincheck</h3>



<p><strong>Know Your Customer (KYC) verification</strong> must be completed for each and all newly created Coincheck accounts. Accounts that have not completed the Know Your Customer process cannot make deposits, trades, or withdraw funds until the process is finished. Verification is absolutely necessary in order to maintain compliance with the regulatory authorities and prevent money laundering on the site.</p>



<p><strong>Users are required to provide their full names, addresses, and social security numbers on the &#8220;Identity&#8221; tab</strong> of their Coincheck accounts in order to verify that they are the rightful owners of those accounts. In addition to submitting a photo of oneself holding a government-issued ID, users are required to supply a photo of the ID itself. A second form of identification is going to be necessary as well.</p>



<p>In the end, users are required to<strong> produce evidence of their residency.</strong> This can take the form of a copy of a recent utility bill bearing a residential address and <strong>a date stamp that is less than six months old</strong>. Coincheck will receive all of the documents, do a check to ensure their accuracy, and then manually authorize them for use.</p>



<h3>Trading in the open market</h3>



<p>Coincheck offers <strong>an over-the-counter (OTC) trade desk</strong> for customers who wish to make larger purchases of select cryptocurrencies. Users have the ability to make large-scale purchases of any of the 17 cryptocurrencies that Coincheck now supports. This can result in lower spread fees and reduced slippage, both of which can lead to monetary savings for customers making larger trades.</p>

<h3>Fees for Coinchecks</h3>



<p>Coincheck charges no trading fees for purchasing, trading, or selling cryptocurrency. Instead, <strong>a spread of 0.1% to 5% </strong>applies to deals where the spread is the difference between the asset&#8217;s purchasing and selling price. While this can be as low as <strong>0.1% in regular markets</strong>, it can also be as high as <strong>5% in volatile markets</strong> or when trading volume is low.</p>



<p>During initial testing, there was <strong>a 5% disparity </strong>between the prices <strong>(4,058,800 JPY purchase vs. 3,814,200 sell)</strong> when comparing the Coincheck price of Bitcoin on the &#8220;Marketplace (Buy)&#8221; form vs. the price of Bitcoin on the &#8220;Marketplace (Sell)&#8221; form, which is a very high charge. This price may be lower in less volatile markets, but it is critical to understand how much exchanges charge for trades.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></h2>



<h3>Pros</h3>



<ul>
<li>A well-designed exchange that is simple to use.</li>



<li>Credit cards are accepted.</li>



<li>Wallet apps are available.</li>



<li>JPY and USD are accepted.</li>



<li>Trading without fees for a limited time.</li>



<li>Excellent reputation.</li>



<li>A wide variety of major cryptocurrencies are supported.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Cons</h3>



<ul>
<li>There is no telephone or chat-based customer service.</li>



<li>The verification process for overseas account holders is difficult.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Is it safe to use Coincheck?</strong></h2>



<p>The Japanese government and organizations associated with cryptocurrencies, such as the <strong>Financial Services Agency, Japan Virtual Currency Business Operator Association, and Japan Blockchain Association,</strong> regulate and audit Coincheck to a high degree. Coincheck is a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



<p>Coincheck has a security structure and methods in place that are similar to those found in banks in order to secure the monies and assets of its customers. <strong>Offline cold storage vaults for crypto</strong> are included as part of the security features, in addition to <strong>end-to-end encryption and daily backups</strong>. The reserve reserves that Coincheck maintains are used to safeguard user funds, which are never loaned out or used for any other purpose.</p>



<p>Although Coincheck is a very secure website at the moment, it was compromised in 2018 and more than $500 million worth of NEM crypto tokens belonging to consumers were stolen. This was caused by the fact that NEM coins were kept in a hot wallet that was open to the public. This is something that they do not do any longer for any cryptocurrency on the platform.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Coincheck is a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that also offers some helpful additional services, such as <strong>Bitcoin-funded prepaid Visa cards</strong>. Coincheck is a leader in the industry. The technology that runs the exchange is not only among the most advanced that can be found elsewhere in the globe, but it is also incredibly<strong> user-friendly.</strong> It&#8217;s possible that some people won&#8217;t bother with the international account verification process because it&#8217;s a little bit complex. In addition to the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen, increasing support for other fiat currencies, such as the Euro, would boost the country&#8217;s appeal on the world stage.</p>

<p>As Coincu reported, 3AC founders are raising $25 million in a new project in partnership with cryptocurrency exchange CoinFlex, a crypto exchange which is <a href="https://news.coincu.com/127859-coinflex-restructuring-plan-in-early-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the process of restructuring</a>, <strong>to introduce investors to a new crypto exchange known as GTX, focused on authentic trading take ownership.</strong></p>



<p>It intends to launch an exchange where customers may <strong>trade cryptocurrency, equities, and debt claims on insolvent firms such as FTX. </strong></p>



<p>According to CoinDesk, <strong>GTX is planning to charge 0.25%-0.50% in fees </strong>and estimates time-to-market is &#8220;<strong>ASAP by end of February</strong>.&#8221; Once the claims trading has drawn people in, GTX said it will &#8220;fill the power vacuum left by FTX&#8221; by allowing its users to trade crypto, and eventually stocks.</p>



<p>However, <strong>the crypto community was quick to express its mistrust</strong>, with Wintermute&#8217;s CEO as the representative. </p>

<p><strong>He also said unequivocally that his business will not be investing in any initiatives, including those of 3AC&#8217;s co-founders</strong>. &#8220;Similarly, we will not be participating in venture rounds when these folks are ready to enter the cap table,&#8221; Gaevoy said in another tweet.</p>

<p>Since January 6, 2023, the overall crypto market value has increased significantly, <strong>adding $156 billion</strong>, causing a surge in token prices across the board.</p>



<p>Additionally, <strong>Aptos has also witnessed the most substantial price rise, up 77%</strong> over this time period, followed by Decentraland, with <strong>Helium placing third at 54% gains</strong>.</p>



<p>There is little question that these flimsy signs of recovery have spurred confidence for the upcoming year, even though the small sample size does not prove an end to the current bear cycle.</p>



<p>Decentraland has been moving higher since hitting a local low of <strong>$0.2858 in December 2022</strong>. On January 13, <strong>the upswing culminated in a 34% swing to the upside </strong>before concluding the day slightly lower. Subsequent days saw large upward swings, ending in a top price today slightly below the pre-FTX crash level.</p>



<p>The daily candle pattern for January 16 has printed a <strong>Doji candle</strong> body with a lengthy top and bottom wick, signalling market hesitation at the present price.</p>

<p>In spite of this, the peak-to-trough movement of <strong>+156%</strong> and the two previous weeks&#8217; closes in the green shows that <strong>the market has trust in the project and the Metaverse idea as a whole.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>Nexo, a cryptocurrency lending platform, is suing the Cayman Islands government for refusing the company a virtual asset license, according to<a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/202614/nexo-sues-cayman-islands-regulator-over-rejected-license" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theblock.co/post/202614/nexo-sues-cayman-islands-regulator-over-rejected-license" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The Block</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>Firstly, the Cayman court filing that the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority denied Nexo&#8217;s application on December 20 because the firm&#8217;s business model did not match the acceptable risk profile. <strong>Nexo posed a risk to market confidence, consumer protection and the reputation of the Islands as a financial centre</strong>, according to the CIMA.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, <strong>Nexo directors and owners neglected to disclose to the CIMA a potential regulatory enforcement situation</strong> in the United States as well as proceedings in English courts.</p>



<p>Nexo&#8217;s attorneys contend that the<strong> CIMA&#8217;s decision was procedurally unjust and that the regulator also violated its constitutional and statutory obligations by failing to tell the lending firm of the specific basis for the denial</strong>. The firm also stated that during the application process, it addressed the regulator&#8217;s concerns.</p>



<p>According to the prosecutors’ office, <strong>300 detectives, police officers, and security officials </strong>were involved in the operation on Thursday, which was part of a pre-trial probe “<strong>aimed at neutralizing an illegal criminal activity”</strong> of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160543-4-people-charged-nexos-money-laundering/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/160543-4-people-charged-nexos-money-laundering/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The lending crypto firm denied CIMA&#8217;s fears about litigation in English courts</strong>, claiming it was a dispute between the firm and a former employee about control of a BitMEX account. Meanwhile, Nexo wants the CIMA judgment overturned, and the court to find that the company is appropriate for registration and then require CIMA to register it.</p>

<p><strong>Two of the suspects were previously detained</strong>, while the other two were being sought. They had been operating <strong>in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Bulgaria, and the Cayman Islands since 2018</strong>, according to officials. </p>

<p><strong>Binance Custody</strong>, a regulated and compliant institutional digital asset custodian, <a href="https://www.binanceinstitutional.com/support/announcements/article/204448334901952512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced the official launch</a> of <strong>Binance Mirror</strong>, an over-the-counter settlement solution that allows institutions to access trading and investment products within the <strong>Binance Exchange ecosystem </strong>without the need to provide collateral directly on exchanges,<strong> on January 16.&nbsp;</strong></p>

It&#8217;s worth noting that assets in Binance Mirror make up more than <strong>60% of all assets in Binance Custody.</strong></p>

<p>The tool, known as Binance Mirror, could be<strong> a boon for crypto investors dealing in leveraged markets</strong>, as most crypto traders must retain their collateral on the exchange in order to trade. However, employing cold storage wallets allows users to continue trading cryptocurrency during volatile sessions without experiencing large outflows on an exchange.</p>



<p>Users&#8217; assets would also be <strong>safe against on-chain hack</strong>s, which hot wallets are vulnerable to. The collapse of Binance&#8217;s rival FTX in November last year raised concerns about crypto exchanges&#8217; ability to protect users&#8217; assets, with regulators investigating FTX for misusing customer funds.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is an effort to instill confidence in institutions that their cash would be safe. It&#8217;s a positive sign that Binance is transforming into an institutional-focused cryptocurrency exchange &#8220;said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, a crypto services provider.</p>
