<p>Cardano, the third largest proof of stake cryptocurrency, continued to fall during the weekend as traders took leave to celebrate the Christmas holiday. At press time on Sunday, ADA was trading at $0.2596 after a 0.68% drop in the past 24 hours, with the coin’s trading volume plunging by roughly 36.28%, according to data by CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>Ostensibly, this holiday season hasn’t exactly been filled with cheer for crypto investors. Apart from battling inflation and market volatility, a recession seems to be looming ahead, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-sentiments-reveal-historically-bullish-indicator-has-surfaced/">keeping cryptos</a> such as Bitcoin, Ethereum Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu enmeshed. Since tapping an all-time high of $3.10 last November, Cardano has plunged by over 91.64%, the highest among all the other top 10 cryptos by market cap.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-sharks-accumulating-ada-rapidly"><strong>Cardano Sharks Accumulating ADA Rapidly</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the brutal winter, Cardano sharks seem to be splurging more money towards ADA at current discounted prices. According to on-chain and social metrics platform Santiment, ADA key shark addresses now hold 4 billion ADA after accumulating 331M more since the FTX implosion. Sharks for this particular cryptocurrency as addresses which hold 10,000-100,000 ADA.</p>



<p>As per the firm, whereas these addresses have been accumulating steadily since June 2021, they seem to have taken this level of dip buying to a new level since the FTX fallout in early November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Addresses holding 10k to 100k </em><em>ADA</em><em> have added $83M worth of coins since November 7</em><em><sup>th</sup></em><em>,”</em> wrote Santiment. Notably, this cohort currently holds its largest percentage of supply in 1.5 years, that is, since June 2021.</p>



<h2><strong>Key Metrics Encourage Investors</strong></h2>



<p>Besides large addresses adding to their bags, over 200,000 new Cardano wallets have been added in November alone. According to data provided by the Cardano Foundation, the overall number of wallets has risen to 3.80M from just under 3.62 million at the start of November. The cryptocurrency network also recounts <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-reigns-as-the-most-developed-crypto-asset-as-ada-leaps-forward/">explosive growth</a> since 2021, with the number of smart contracts based on Plutus, a smart contracts platform by Cardano, surging by 394% to 4,445.</p>



<p>Furthermore, roughly 7.30M native tokens are already running on Cardano after a 192% spike in the past year, with the number of transactions surpassing 56.9 million, up 139% from 2021. Although these developments are yet to show in price, large investors are likely to continue purchasing ADA with the incentive to hold it for longer as their focus increasingly shifts from value rather than hype-driven investments.</p>

<p>SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, has been putting up a price rally in the past few hours. According to crypto market intelligence platform Santiment, this rally could continue until short traders change their negative sentiment on the popular altcoin. </p>



<p>Santiment noted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1595238974187896832?s=46&amp;t=loWArq4Eobuhv-4uUzjN0g">tweet</a> that, at present, Solana does not have a lot of big believers seeing as fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) saw traders start placing massive short bets for SOL on Binance about four days ago.</p>



<p>However, the price of SOL seems to have bottomed out at $11.02 and rebounded to over $12.70 over a 15 hours period, Santiment noted. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;There are not a lot of big #Solana believers, even as its price bottomed out at $11.02 and rebounded to $12.70 over the past 15 hours. This #FUD could cause more rebounding until traders slow down their nearly unanimous bets against $SOL&#8217;s price,&#8221; Santiment wrote. </em></p>



<p>Much of the negative sentiments around Solana and SOL have originated from Solana&#8217;s ties to the collapsed FTX exchange. The Solana Foundation detailed in a recent <a href="https://solana.com/news/solana-facts-ftx-bankruptcy">blog post</a> that it had approximately $1 million worth of cash or equivalent assets on FTX as of Nov. 6 that are now stuck.</p>



<p>The post also revealed that FTX and sister firm Alameda Research holds over 50 million SOL. While most of the SOL stands vested, it did not stop investors from fearing the worst and looking to exit their SOL and other Solana ecosystem token positions on exchanges. </p>



<h2 id="h-solana-blockchain-ecosystem-is-still-advancing-with-developments"><strong>Solana blockchain ecosystem is still advancing with developments</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the price surge on the day, SOL has been down about 50% in the last month and around 92.4% since the start of the year. This has, however, not stopped development from going on in the Solana ecosystem. </p>



<p>Earlier last month, Solana Labs released an update to the Solana blockchain node software. In a tweet, co-founder of the blockchain startup Anatoly Yakovenko <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1594024294056484864?t=1TJGBecOc_jb8n1kjUSsng&amp;s=19">urged</a> validators to upgrade to the new node software version, adding that the update should fix all Solana network outage issues caused by UDP-based protocols&#8217; overload.</p>



<p>Previously, the problem had caused prolonged shutdowns and restarts of the Solana network. According to data from Solana blockchain explorer Solscan, 60.82% of 2,341 validators on the blockchain have upgraded to the latest node version. Around 11% and 7.5% are still running two former versions of the node software.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), has been recording a price surge following a remark made by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that the central bank is likely to slow down its interest rate hikes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1598095504797487105?s=46&amp;t=aeh2ddUGk3MnGKOnOI2Csw">analysis from Santiment</a>, the rare encouraging 2022 announcement saw BTC cross $17,000 and ETH cross $1,300 for the first time since the middle of November.</p>



<p>Santiment added that with interest rate hikes potentially slowing down, the crypto market may see strong bullish support in the days before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Jerome Powell made a rare encouraging 2022 announcement for markets today. With interest rate hikes potentially slowing, crypto &amp; equities immediately responded by surging. We may see strong bullish support leading up to the Dec 13-14 FOMC meetings,&#8221; Santiment said in the tweet.</em></p>



<p>The Fed was expected to announce its last rate hike for 2022—an anticipated 0.5 percentage points hike as opposed to the four previous 0.75 percentage point hikes so far in the year—during the meeting.</p>



<p>Santiment had previously <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1597397104317456384?t=qtlrUoc-YvlDC5_L5EMcqw&amp;s=19">noted</a> that Bitcoin whales have been showing &#8220;moderate signs of accumulation&#8221; in the past few days even as the market was trying to recover from the FTX exchange collapse contagion. The whales accumulated 43,888 BTC in five days, reversing a 13-months streak of cumulative dumping.</p>



<h2 id="h-bearish-sentiments-continue-to-linger-for-the-crypto-market"><strong>Bearish sentiments continue to linger for the crypto market</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the price spike that was kick-started by Powell&#8217;s encouraging remark, some analysts maintain that the crypto market is still underlyingly bearish. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/bitcoin-btc-price-tops-17000-for-the-first-time-in-two-weeks.html">told CNBC</a> that the latest rally is likely just a bearish retest.</p>



<p>He opined that the rally is a fake out as the price of BTC has currently hit resistance at $17,000 and is likely to go lower from there as the price run is a result of over-leveraged short traders covering their positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the wavering investor confidence, BTC has continued its upsurge. The flagship crypto is trading at $16,644 down 2.13% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing. Other tokens among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap have also all been trading in the green. Meanwhile, Powell&#8217;s announcement also saw the stock market record an upswing.</p>

<p>On the positive line are <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jack-dorseys-first-ever-tweet-nft-that-sold-for-2-9m-ends-up-with-a-top-bid-of-just-96/">Jack Dorsey</a>, Mark Zuckerberg, and Vitalik Buterin, among others. Co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, made laudable contributions to the growth of web3 this year. Dorsey sponsored several web3 projects, including Bluesky, a decentralized social networking platform giving users control of their data.</p>



<p>In December, he gave 14 BTC to Nostr, another decentralized social media platform, alongside other efforts in BTC mining like solar and renewable energy mines.</p>



<p>Co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has pushed the development of blockchain technology to new levels. Notable among others is the Ethereum Merge, which saw the second-largest network <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">transition</a> to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism reducing energy consumption by over 98%.</p>



<p>Buterin has also been a supporter of young web3 developers this year, urging them to improve the technology in wallets and stablecoins. </p>



<p>Meta’s CEO Zuckerberg led at the forefront of the development of the metaverse this year. Although it was a bad year for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/meta-reports-a-3-67-billion-loss-in-its-metaverse-division-signaling-more-problems-for-the-company/">metaverse</a> and Meta, Zuckerberg kept the faith and continued to push developers to make the most of the opportunity to create an augmented reality for users.</p>



<p>After taking several losses running into billions this year, Zuckerberg still believes in Meta and its metaverse division pledging that the technology will get better in 2023.</p>



<h2 id="h-bad-actors-billions-gone-into-thin-air"><strong>Bad actors: billions gone into thin air</strong></h2>



<p>This year was riddled with digital asset scams as well as major decentralized applications filing for bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been the most notorious bad player in the industry this year following the collapse of FTX. SBF was seen as a successful figure in crypto spaces, but the story changed since the implosion of FTX, which is reported to have caused investors $2 billion in losses.</p>



<p>Do Kwon, the founder of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-says-alameda-instigated-terras-downfall-suggests-ftxs-collapse-is-deserved/">Terra blockchain</a>, was also in the bad books after its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD lost its peg with the dollar. Kwon has since gotten on Interpol’s Red Notice and is facing a class action suit, although his whereabouts remain unknown.</p>



<p>Avraham Heisenberg, the infamous Mango Markets hacker who wiped off $100 million from the platform, is among the top crypto bad actors of 2022. Although the platform recovered some funds, it made investors wary of decentralized applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC, ETH, XRP, and ADA record an uptick in value entering Christmas week. </li>



<li>On the other hand, DOGE is still struggling post-Elon Musk poll and traded lower by 8% in the past 7 days.</li>



<li>With the new year approaching, bulls are pushing their favourite coins to start the year on a high note.</li>
</ul>



<p>Digital asset enthusiasts have seen promise amid a turbulent market following a slight positive movement in the price of several top cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) showed positive signs of a breakout after its price increased by 1% over the weekend, trading at $16,890 but still short of the $17,000 resistance level. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand had a better weekend going up by 4% and trading at $1,223. </p>



<p>Cardano (ADA), which has performed poorly like other major assets this year, also saw slight gains over the weekend and has continued to be in the green zone on Monday. On the other end is the red zone currently hosting a large number of top assets.</p>



<p>Leading the pack is Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin (DOGE), still trading short sequel to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-takes-biggest-hit-falls-18-following-elon-musks-twitter-poll/">Musk’s Twitter poll</a> last week. DOGE has been down 8% over the past week, with its price hovering around $0.075.</p>



<p>Heavier losses hit Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Quant (QNT), and other assets in the last seven days. Solana fell 15%, exchanging hands at $11.85, while DOT plummeted 14%. Also recording double-digit losses are QNT and Avalanche (AVAX) losing 12% and 10% respectively ending the week at $105 and $11.78.</p>



<p>The recent losses in these top assets have been attributed to several factors, including the aftermath of the implosion of FTX and the wider bearish performance of the financial market.</p>



<h2 id="h-bulls-look-to-2023"><strong>Bulls look to 2023 </strong></h2>



<p>After a bad run this year, bulls have their eyes locked on 2023, with many already displaying new metrics on why their assets will soar in the new year. In the cryptoverse, the Ripple (XRP) community has been one of the loudest voices on the prospects of their coin, with bulls anticipating it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-tops-a-three-year-high-above-1-amid-new-turn-in-ripple-lawsuit/">breaking into $1</a> in Q1 2023.</p>



<p>Despite the current setbacks, DOGE fans still hope for their anticipated Twitter use cases like incorporated payments to push the price to a new level. Like XRP, the DOGE community has predicted the coin to hit $1 in 2023. Market leaders BTC and ETH have both lost over 50% of their market cap with investors hoping for a recovery in Q1 2023.</p>

<p>Ethereum, the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is set to come out ahead of Bitcoin in the next bull market, according to Bloomberg’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone.</p>



<p>Despite Bitcoin and other risk assets deflating considerably in the past year, McGlone noted in the latest market outlook report that Ethereum <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-discloses-three-landmark-opportunities-for-crypto-in-2023/">exhibited more resilience</a>, suggesting that it “may be a top candidate to continue outperforming the firstborn crypto.”</p>



<p>Since tapping all-time highs in November 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped roughly 76% and 75%, respectively. Notably, Ethereum’s annual volatility is about 1.3x that of bitcoin. Thus, while Ethereum is still deeply undervalued, McGlone noted that at a ratio of 0.08, the ETH/BTC cross rate remained the same as in May 2021 when the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index was about 20% higher, tilting ETH towards resuming appreciation if volatility tells us anything.</p>



<p><em>“Our graphic shows the trend of the No. 2 crypto outperforming No. 1, which appeared coincident with the rise of risk assets. This year’s 30% drop in the Nasdaq is part of a receding tide, including about a 65% decline in Ethereum to Dec 16,”</em> he wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RD4oT4N2vnO9YmzGUXDFFEdiCy6mcljgjmSJ3MnV9cdyrs13ABGjYYawnKFzhoSeMvvnALzjkzGHyjL4b-jYpeOlX35sV4ZPzWldvHoO-zOwZGkUh_cQRZ4tJHJemdF9rp4NEwwdeFq1mMa_AELHb0PgFgnsn_SEirfkTgFnD50IwNJSRKZkclroRRqwdu8Y8r13H3ueQQ" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-ethereum-s-holy-grail"><strong>Ethereum’s Holy Grail</strong></h2>



<p>According to the pundit, Ethereum’s resilience and projected outperformance against the top crypto-asset are largely tied to mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>“<em>Migration into the mainstream is our key takeaway and once the dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressures, Ethereum is more likely to resume doing what it has been&#8212;outperforming,”</em> Glone added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum has been at the centre of focus in the past year as crypto adoption gathers steam globally.&nbsp;Although the crypto was modelled like bitcoin in its early years, Ethereum went a step further and now powers a wide range of applications through smart contracts -becoming a darling to institutions, developers and enthusiasts who believe that it&#8217;s a valuable altcoin with real-world use cases.</p>



<p>In the past year, thousands of projects and companies, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/paypal-teams-up-with-metamask-to-enable-ethereum-purchases-in-the-us/">such as PayPal</a>, have enrolled their services on the network seeking to make a footprint in the Metaverse, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous applications (DAOs).</p>



<p>The demand for Ethereum has largely been depicted in the rise of its market dominance. In 2021, Ethereum’s market dominance rose as high as 22%, suggesting it could “Flippen” Bitcoin at some point.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s migration from Proof-of-Work to a more eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake consensus blockchain earlier this year has also boosted its appeal to governments and institutions worldwide as the push for lesser carbon footprints rages on.</p>



<p>Ethereum was trading at $1,212 after a 0.36% increase in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $16,851 after adding 0.44% in the same period, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>The crypto market could be poised for a price rise going by historical market sentiment data pointed out by the crypto market intelligence tracking platform Santiment.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1593713589113610240?t=8-Z3v8QnNxamUjGtPmFXnA&amp;s=19">tweet</a>, Santiment noted that fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the crypto market had reached their most negative level in five months. This is indicated by the fact that conversations relating to crypto on all major social platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and Telegram, are leaning towards a major bearish bias.</p>



<p>According to the analysis, such levels of negativity have historically increased the probability of future price rises.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Conversations relating to current market conditions on Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and Telegram indicate a major #bearish bias. This historically increases the probability of future price rises,&#8221; Santiment said.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, the metric is not the only bearish indicator Santiment anticipates contributing to a crypto market price bounce. The platform has <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1594767648625131523?t=zpVzSHB1KJuoQws5MuAWRg&amp;s=19">pointed</a> out that the Bitcoin (BTC) market has been seeing many traders finally liquidate their assets as its price has fallen to a two-year low.</p>



<p>The massive exodus of investors has resulted in the BTC market seeing the lowest level of transactions made while in profit since Nov. 2019. According to Santiment, bounces also typically occur when this happens in the market.</p>



<h2 id="h-ftx-collapse-is-still-the-leading-source-of-crypto-market-negative-sentiments"><strong>FTX collapse is still the leading source of crypto market negative sentiments</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-deliberate-move-shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-blames-binance-for-ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a> and the market contagion it sparked have continued to be the major cause of the crypto market&#8217;s unravelling in recent weeks. The market jitter has now reached Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary Genesis, a liquidity provider to FTX. </p>



<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-21/crypto-firm-genesis-warns-of-possible-bankruptcy-without-funding">report</a>, the crypto derivatives trading and lending firm has mentioned that it is considering filing for bankruptcy if it cannot raise around $1 billion in fresh funding from investors.</p>



<p>Aside from affected crypto firms, the collapse has been rocking the already shaky trust regulators had for the crypto market. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Tina Smith, and Richard Durbin recently wrote to Fidelity Investments to reconsider their plans to introduce Bitcoin exposure to workplace retirement plans it manages.</p>



<p><em>“The recent implosion of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, has made it abundantly clear the digital asset industry has serious problems,” the Senators said. </em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-treasurys-yellen-more-effective-oversight-needed-crypto-markets-2022-11-16/">stated</a> that the failure of FTX and its impact on crypto investors &#8220;demonstrates the need for more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cardano ecosystem continues to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-centered-stablecoin-djed-set-to-debut-in-january-ada-poised-for-rapid-adoption/">roll out innovations</a> that will play a major role in its development in 2023. One such innovation is Carp, a new Cardano SQL indexer and replacement for dbSync.</p>



<p>The tool released by product-based blockchain company dcSpark allows anyone to run a local price indexer for Cardano native assets. According to dcSpark, the tool does this entirely from on-chain data and does not require a third-party API. In its announcement, dcSpark describes Carp as:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;A super fast, super flexible indexer for Cardano that now supports indexing the top DEXs too! Can&#8217;t wait to see what you all build with this, and which other DEXs may be added next.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Sebastien Guillemot, CTO and co-founder of dcSpark, added that the tool is free to use as it does not require an API. The indexer, built using funding from Cardano grants program Project Catalyst, already supports three Cardano decentralized exchanges. These include Minswap, Wingriders, and SundaeSwap.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-community-turn-attention-to-upcoming-voltaire-upgrades"><strong>Cardano community turn attention to upcoming Voltaire upgrades</strong></h2>



<p>While Carp has already launched, Cardano has several other innovations that the community is weighing in on. JCRYPTO, a Cardano-focused educational podcast, has taken to explaining the Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) that will be the cornerstone of the Voltaire upgrade planned for 2023, CIP-1694.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CIP will introduce a mechanism for on-chain governance that will be a precursor to the transition to the Voltaire phase in Cardano. The CIP was developed by IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson and is currently undergoing voting after being proposed by developer Jared Cordouan in late November.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Hoskinson has commended the podcast for its effort to understand the CIP. He further encouraged the Cardano community to read the CIP and share their opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Glad to see the community going through this. I&#8217;d encourage everyone in Cardano to do readings of the CIP and share your opinions both pro and con,&#8221; he wrote in a tweet.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The Voltaire upgrade is billed to move Cardano to adopt decentralized governance fully at the protocol level. Hoskinson had previously noted that the Voltaire upgrade would put Cardano far ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>Additionally, Cardano continues work on other projects, including Hydra and Mithril, that will bring massive scaling benefits to Cardano. Currently, Cardano is the most <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-reigns-as-the-most-developed-crypto-asset-as-ada-leaps-forward/">actively developed blockchain</a> network going by the number of significant submissions on its GitHub repository.</p>

<p>The Department of Treasury, the Australian Government ministerial department responsible for economic policy, fiscal policy, market regulation, and budgeting, announced that the country will introduce stricter rules for crypto in early 2023.</p>



<p>Minister in charge of the Treasury, Jim Chalmers, said in a press release that Australia&#8217;s government under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is taking action to improve the regulation of crypto service providers. </p>



<p>However, Chalmers clarified that the legislation will only be introduced after the government completes its ongoing &#8216;token mapping.&#8217; The process involves uncovering the characteristics of all digital asset tokens in Australia, including charting the type of crypto asset, its underlying code, and any other defining technological feature.</p>



<p>Australia has been carrying out the process since August this year and has plans to release a consultation paper in early 2023. The mapping will inform the government of what financial service laws should regulate digital assets. It will also guide the development of appropriate custody and licensing policies to safeguard consumers, according to Chalmers.</p>



<p>The crypto regulations plans are part of broader financial sector reforms the Australian Government has lined up. The press release reveals that the government has plans to update and strengthen Australia’s payments system.</p>



<p>It will also strengthen financial market infrastructure and establish a regulatory framework for &#8216;Buy Now Pay Later.&#8217; According to the Treasury minister, Australia fell behind in financial regulations in these sectors due to the negligence and failed promises of the previous government.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Unfortunately, our regulatory architecture has not kept pace with changes in the market. In many areas, the previous government sat on its hands. In other areas, it made announcements but didn’t deliver,&#8221; the release stated.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-australia-is-still-ramping-up-its-cbdc-plans"><strong>Australia is still ramping up its CBDC plans</strong></h2>



<p>The government of Australia has also not given up its plans to introduce a digital version of its currency, the Australian Dollar. In a consultation paper the Treasury published this month, the ministry stated that the central bank digital currency (CBDC) is part of its strategic plan for the payments system.</p>



<p>The consultation paper posed questions about the policy rationale for an Australian CBDC. These include investigating the economic, legal, regulatory, and technological considerations associated with an Australian CBDC.</p>



<p>The paper revealed that channels for public input on the matter are open till February 2023. The Australian central bank adds that it intends to conduct a pilot test of the CBDC early next year.</p>

<p>The case between Ripple Labs Inc. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to wrap up. In a new joint motion, both parties filed for an extension to file Daubert Motions until Jan. 13, 2023. The extension will also affect the filing accompanying redacted exhibits on the public docket.</p>



<p>Attorney James K. Filan, an XRP community member, first shared the filing. He notes that the court has already granted the motion. He also adds that the filing comes on the back of the court&#8217;s Dec. 19 sealing ruling.</p>



<p>The Daubert motion is a type of motion that seeks to exclude the presence of an expert&#8217;s testimony to a jury. In this case, it aims to protect third parties&#8217; confidential and legitimate privacy interests.</p>



<p>The sealing ruling saw <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-eager-to-receive-verdict-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-as-attorney-sets-tentative-settlement-date/">Ripple</a> score another minor win in the case. The court granted the company&#8217;s request to redact documents submitted in connection with the Daubert Motions. In particular, Ripple was permitted to redact case documents submitted by MoneyGram and &#8220;third party A&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>



<p>MoneyGram, formerly a Ripple partner, requested to redact the deposition transcript of one of its officers. Third-party A&#8217;s refer to non-parties subpoenaed for documents and testimony in the lawsuit. These parties requested the redaction of seven documents to which Ripple has consented.</p>



<p>In contrast, the SEC had a minor loss in the ruling. The regulator&#8217;s motion was granted and denied in part. The court denied the SEC&#8217;s request to redact the names of the consulting firms that assisted its expert witnesses. However, it granted its request to redact documents and exhibits submitted in connection with the Daubert motions.</p>



<h2 id="h-experts-still-expect-the-case-to-end-around-march-2023"><strong>Experts still expect the case to end around March 2023</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC vs Ripple case just clocked two years since it began in Dec. 2020. However, experts like Attorney Filan, who have followed the case, expect to see a dispute resolution soon.</p>



<p>Filan predicted in November that District Judge Annalisa Torres would make her ruling on all pending issues in the case on or before March 31, 2023. This ruling will include both the expert motion and the summary judgment.</p>



<p>For its part, Ripple expects to receive a favourable ruling in the case. The blockchain-based fintech company has reiterated severally that it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-continues-to-exude-confidence-of-scoring-major-win-against-the-sec/">is confident</a> in its arguments in the case. At present, the embattled XRP token trades at $0.35, up 2.49% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) released its 2022 Annual Report following approval by its voting members on December 16, 2022. According to the report, digital assets were amongst the vulnerabilities identified within the United States (U.S.) financial system.</p>



<p>The FSOC is a federal government organization charged with identifying risks to the financial stability of the United States, promoting market discipline by eliminating expectations on the part of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties of such companies that the U.S. government will shield them from losses in the event of failure, and for responding to emerging threats to the stability of its financial system.</p>



<p>An October 2022 FSOC Report on <em>“Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation” found that financial stability vulnerabilities with respect to digital assets arose firstly from the interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem and the traditional financial system and secondly from the digital asset ecosystem. The report recommended that members continue to enforce existing laws by applying following the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulatory outcome”.</em></p>



<p>The FSOC 2022 Annual Report identified gaps in the regulation of crypto-asset activities within the U.S. and made recommendations to address the gaps.</p>



<p>The first gap that the annual report noted was that the spot markets for crypto-assets that are not securities were subject to limited direct federal regulation. The council recommended that Congress pass legislation that provides for explicit rulemaking authority for federal financial regulators over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second gap identified was that crypto-asset market businesses did not have a consistent or comprehensive regulatory framework and could engage in regulatory arbitrage. To reduce the risk of regulatory arbitrage, the Council recommended continued coordination, legislation addressing the risks posed by stablecoins, legislation relating to regulators’ authorities to have visibility into and supervise the activities of all of the affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto-asset entities, and appropriate service provider regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third gap identified was that a number of crypto-asset trading platforms have proposed offering retail customers direct access to markets by vertically integrating the services provided by intermediaries such as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. The Council recommended that member agencies assess the impact of potential vertical integration by crypto-asset firms.</p>



<p>Finally, the Council recommended that Council members continue to build capacities related to data and the analysis, monitoring, supervision, and regulation of crypto-asset activities.</p>



<p>Crypto asset prices have declined in 2022, with the total crypto market cap dropping from a US$ 2.3 trillion at the start of the year to around US$ 900 million, as at press time. A number of crypto companies have also wound down, with FTX making the news headlines when it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. The crypto events of 2022 are likely to have a significant impact on the future of crypto.</p>

<p>Binance’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Rohit Wad considers India a hub of web3 innovations, and he plans to hire technology professionals from its top universities. In an interview with Businessline, Wad mentioned Mumbai among the cities where it plans to select new talents.</p>



<p><em>“There is going to be a tremendous boom, in the innovation that comes out of India. In fact, as a beginning step, I would like to see if we can find interns in India and get them bootstrapped on crypto,” he said.</em></p>



<p>Binance is also looking to invest in Indian web3 startups. Without naming the probable candidates on its investment radar, the Binance CTO revealed that the company might look at a couple of Indian startups for this purpose in the near future.</p>



<p>Wad plans to induct new interns from the list of cities, including Toronto, Vancouver, and Mumbai. As Binance is a remote-first company, hiring from different global tech hubs works fine with its work-from-home employment model.</p>



<p>Binance is set to hire India’s tech institutes and universities, mainly from Mumbai, which, according to Wad, is among the top global tech incubation hubs.</p>



<p>Wad disclosed that Binance has keenly watched the Indian blockchain ecosystem and has identified some promising startups and entrepreneurs. As far as Binance is concerned, its primary goal would be to build a vibrant community of developers and coders interested in learning more about decentralized technologies, as India has a lot to offer regarding technical skills and knowledge.</p>



<p>Wad’s interest in India’s tech talents comes close on the heels of a recent survey by Nasscom, and a web3 venture capital fund that said India, with its huge talent pool, is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/india-with-huge-talent-pool-set-to-play-key-role-in-global-web3-push-study/">all set to play a key role</a> in global web3 transformation.</p>



<p>Binance CEO Chengpang Zhao (CZ) twice pointed out India’s high taxation for the cryptocurrency sector in about a fortnight. First, he talked about it at Singapore Fintech Festival, where he said <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heavy-taxation-could-kill-indias-cryptocurrency-market-binance-ceo-warns/">high taxes would kill</a> the crypto industry in India. On November 17, he said India’s crypto trade market is unviable due to high taxation. Given this, Binance does not plan anything big for the Indian market right now, he clarified.</p>



<p>However, CZ mentioned that Binance, which is available to Indian users, is engaged with prominent crypto industry players and influencers to put its logic before the Indian policymakers.</p>

<p>According to Fabio Panetta, a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), solid foundations for the broader digital finance ecosystem are needed to harness the possibilities of digital technologies, and that regulation alone will not be enough to address the shortcomings of cryptos.</p>



<p>Panetta said that a risk-free and dependable digital settlement asset provided by central bank money and new technologies for wholesale settlement are some of the areas the ECB is exploring. Panetta was speaking at the Insight Summit held at the London Business School on December 7, 2022.</p>



<p>Panetta is sceptical that crypto technology can replace regulated intermediaries. He further said that unbacked crypto-assets were too volatile, offered no benefits to society, transactions inefficient, did not fund consumption or investment and played no part in combating climate change.</p>



<p>Panetta referred to investors who had suffered significant losses from the crypto collapse and could not be compensated as there were no insurance schemes. He also pointed out that stablecoins are exposed to runs.</p>



<p>To mitigate crypto risks while harnessing the innovative potential of digital finance beyond cryptos, Panetta said that what is required is a timely, global regulatory framework for crypto-assets to primarily prevent crypto-assets from circumventing financial regulation. This should be followed by shielding the mainstream financial system by segregating crypto-related activities of supervised intermediaries.</p>



<p>Panetta emphasised that digital finance, like other forms of finance, requires an anchor of stability in the form of a risk-free digital asset. He said that the regulation of crypto activities would have to be adapted to the continuous evolution of crypto risks. He called for regulators, overseers, and supervisors to be empowered to adjust their instruments to keep pace with market and technological developments.</p>



<p>Panetta advised authorities to address the social risks associated with crypto-assets, such as tax evasion, illicit activities, and their environmental impact. He called for harmonisation of the taxation of crypto-assets across jurisdictions.</p>



<p>Panetta concluded that regulation would not turn risky instruments into safe money. He, however, said that a stable digital finance ecosystem requires well-supervised intermediaries and a risk-free and dependable digital settlement asset, which only digital central bank money can provide.</p>



<p>The European Union (EU) is already working on a comprehensive framework for crypto assets through the markets in crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA aims to harmonise rules for crypto-assets within the EU. MiCA will also provide legal certainty for crypto-assets not covered by existing EU legislation and subject stablecoin issuers of e-money tokens and asset-referenced tokens to licensing and supervision.</p>

<ul>
<li>Retail investors&#8217; Bitcoin holdings hit an all-time high, according to a new report from Glassnode.</li>



<li>The group&#8217;s total Bitcoin ownership now stands at 17% of the total supply, a 5% growth from its 12% figure in 2020.</li>



<li>Although current statistics from the report show that Bitcoin ownership is largely decentralized, critics argue that the survey did not account for wrapped and lost Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>



<p>A new report released by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that retail investors are doubling down on their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/still-bullish-billionaire-money-manager-bill-miller-maintains-view-bitcoin-will-rise-again-despite-ftx-chaos/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> investments despite the recent bearish trend.</p>



<p>According to the report, retail investors&#8217; BTC ownership is now at an all-time high of 17% of the total supply showing significant growth over the years. Retail BTC ownership has grown exponentially since 2011, with several periods of rapid growth, including the late 2014 bull market and 2017.</p>



<p>In 2020, the figure stood at 12% of the total supply showing a 5% growth in two years. Glassnode classifies retail investors as wallets holding less than 10 BTC in exchanges currently at $168,300.</p>



<p>With this new report, experts say that the asset is headed in the right direction. Blockchain expert Will Clemente lauded the performance of BTC in the last 12 years, although he believes it is not yet perfect.</p>



<p><em>“Not perfect yet, but solid for a 12-year-old asset and definitely trending in the right direction. Bitcoin&#8217;s supply disperses over time, while fiat&#8217;s holder base concentrates to whales over time.”</em></p>



<p>Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock also confirmed the report with data showing that holders of 0-10 BTC stand at 17%. An increase in the total holding of retail investors shows a growth in the adoption of BTC rather than other narratives, such as distrust from institutional investors.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-btc-holdings-getting-more-decentralized"><strong>Are BTC holdings getting more decentralized?</strong></h2>



<p>Whales have been a significant part of every digital asset, opening up the decentralization debate. Over the years, data shows that BTC holdings are slowly becoming more spread across all categories of holders.</p>



<p>Data from IntoTheBlock show that wallets with 100 BTC are having a declining market share from 69.5% in 2013 to 59.8% today. BTC is also more decentralized than other top cryptocurrencies. About 38% of Ethereum (ETH) and 64% of Dogecoin (DOGE) are held by addresses with 0.1% of total supply compared to BTC with 9%.</p>



<p>Critics have pointed to the fact that the recent statistics do not include lost BTC, wrapped BTC signifying that it may not be as decentralized as portrayed.</p>
