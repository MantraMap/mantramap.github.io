<p>In recent weeks, the crypto market has traveled through a bumpy road, with its fair share of ups and downs. For one, Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have introduced new updates to improve their shaky position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, Tradecurve (TCRV) launch has captured a lot of attention. This new project has become an instant hit due to its uniqueness, and enormous growth potential. Its ongoing presale has broken records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Cardano&rsquo;s (ADA) Network Activity Falls
<p>The Cardano (ADA) community is hopeful that the recent developments in its ecosystem, including the release of a novel Dynamic P2P networking scheme, will increase the traction on the network. Dynamic P2P has been launched to bring scalability and modularity to the Cardano network. However, experts have raised concerns over the latest on-chain data related to Cardano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per Santiment&rsquo;s data, the number of daily active addresses on the Cardano network has plummeted by 71% in the past month. The social dominance of Cardano has also taken a hit. Subsequently, the exchange rate of Cardano has suffered a drop of 23% in the last 30 days. At press time, Cardano is available to change hands at $0.29.</p>

Solana (SOL) Aims To Benefit From Firedancer
<p>To get out of the clutches of bears, and prevent its price from falling further, Solana (SOL) has shifted its focus to the NFT space. This shift in focus has come as Solana has taken a dip of 11% in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the current exchange rate of Solana is $19.19, which is 93% below its peak of $260.06. However, the new validator client for Solana, Firedancer, is expected to provide market support to SOL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the data from Messari, Firedancer can lower latency times on the Solana network, enhancing DeFi maturity. This, in turn, will enable faster transaction processing on Solana, attracting more users to the network. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out the declining TVL of Solana.</p>

Tradecurve Presale Becomes More Appealing With 50x Growth
<p>According to data, about 5 new cryptocurrencies enter the market every day, and there are more than 26,000 digital currencies in circulation. Subsequently, crypto trading has also boomed. However, existing crypto exchanges have been criticized for their high fees, limited investment options, and data insecurity. To address these issues, and meet dynamic market demands, Tradecurve (TCRV) has launched a disruptive crypto exchange.</p>
<p>This new Web3 trading platform enables users to invest in different markets, such as forex, equity, cryptocurrency, CFDs, and more, with a single account. What is more exciting for traders is the platform&rsquo;s privacy feature. It does not require users to fulfill any KYC requirements. Contrary to this, exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood mandate users to share their private details.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform boasts high-leverage trading that starts from 500:1, and a VIP account service. It will also provide traders with distributed liquidity, and non-custodial storage to enhance their trading experience. The Metaverse Trading Academy is another remarkable feature of this platform. Through the academy, users can learn better and more profitable trading strategies.</p>
<p>The presale round of the platform is live, and a TCRV token is available to purchase for $0.018, an 80% increase from the launch price. Experts forecast that the tokens will record 50x gains during the presale round, and 100 times growth after their launch on tier-1 exchanges.</p>
