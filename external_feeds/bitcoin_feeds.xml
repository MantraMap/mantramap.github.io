Youssef claimed that Paxful is now &#8220;just paying legal bills&#8221; and that &#8220;no African or any non-American should trust any IS corporation.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Paxful&#8217;s Alleged Removal of Reserve Funds From Status Page Raises Concern</h2>
<p>Following reports that Paxful, the peer-to-peer crypto marketplace, has removed the reserve funds amount from the status page, former CEO Ray Youssef advised users to cease trading. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/raycivkit/status/1677424162015461377?s=20">reply</a> to a Twitter user who warned of an FTX-style collapse, Youssef suggested that users should consider switching to self-custody until &#8220;we get to the bottom of this.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-597048 size-full" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12.png" alt="" width="1180" height="426" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-300x108.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-1024x370.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-768x277.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px" /></p>
<p>In addition to exposing the alleged removal of reserve funds from Paxful’s website, the unidentified social media user also claimed to have seen tweets from former employees who complained of not being paid all their dues after they left. The user also claimed to have heard rumors that Paxful was dipping into customer funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>In another <a href="https://twitter.com/raycivkit/status/1677423787208318978">tweet</a>, Youssef, in an apparent response to Paxful’s pledge to unfreeze $4.5 million in customer funds, reiterated his lack of confidence in the process, declaring:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not trust lawyers. Paxful is now just paying legal bills. No African or any non-American should trust any IS corporation. Don’t say you were [not] warned folks. My reputation I value over any shares in any company.</p></blockquote>
<p>In early April, trading on the P2P marketplace was suspended due to regulations and what Youssef attributed to the departure of key personnel. However, after Paxful announced the resumption of services, Youssef, who had already left the organization, said he could not vouch for anything that is happening there now.</p>
<p>Since leaving Paxful, Youssef, who has more than 50,000 followers on Twitter, has not only urged users to abandon the platform but has routinely promoted Civkit which he founded. Although many of the followers have lauded Youssef&#8217;s efforts, some have accused him of being an &#8220;attention seeker.&#8221; He has also been accused of seeking to use his influence to harm rivals.</p>

<h2>’Central Banks Are Diversifying Currency Holdings’</h2>
<p>Invesco, an asset management firm with $1.5 trillion in global assets under management, published its 11th annual study of sovereign investors on Monday. The &#8220;2023 Invesco Global Sovereign Asset Management Study&#8221; includes insights from 142 chief investment officers, heads of asset classes, and senior portfolio strategists representing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks. Together, these institutions oversee around $21 trillion in assets as of March 31.</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;Central banks are diversifying currency holdings, stirred by geopolitical uncertainties and attractive opportunities in emerging markets,&#8221; Invesco described:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amid volatile yields, 2022 saw a flight to gold, questions around the U.S. dollar’s future as the world’s reserve currency, and increased diversification of currency holdings.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the study, central banks see gold as a safe-haven asset, which led to record purchases in 2022, &#8220;with net acquisitions of 1,136 tonnes, marking a 12th consecutive year of a net increase in gold holdings.&#8221; While emphasizing that almost 20% of these net purchases came from Turkish and Chinese central banks, Invesco noted that other central banks, particularly in the Middle East and emerging markets, were also noteworthy gold buyers in 2022.</p>
<p>The study also explores de-dollarization. &#8220;The freezing of Russian assets by Western nations has thrust the world’s reliance on the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency into the spotlight, raising questions about its long-term viability amidst high U.S. debt levels,&#8221; Invesco explained, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>A growing percentage of central banks year-on-year believe that the U.S. debt levels are negatively impacting the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>“However, central banks generally agree that there is no clear alternative to replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, with 53% disputing that the dollar will be weaker in five years, up from 46% last year,” the asset management firm continued. One central bank based in an emerging market was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>People have been looking for alternatives to the dollar and euro for a long time and they would’ve gone to them already if there were any suitable alternatives.</p></blockquote>

<p>The study also examines the potential for the Chinese yuan to replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s dominant currency. “The Chinese renminbi, with its increasing allocations in recent years, is often considered a potential future alternative,&#8221; the asset manager detailed, adding that in the long term (10 years or more), “most central banks do not anticipate a significant shift in global trade currencies,” but “a considerable proportion do expect a shift towards renminbi (27% of central banks), but expectations differ based on the region.”</p>
<p>Invesco pointed out that &#8220;sentiment surrounding the renminbi becoming a true reserve currency has declined year on year, with a significantly greater proportion of central banks disagreeing that it will achieve that status within five years.” In addition, the firm stressed that &#8220;barriers such as liquidity, property sector debt, and political risk hinder the renminbi’s potential to overtake the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.&#8221; Nonetheless, the asset manager concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite these concerns, central banks still expect to increase renminbi holdings over time.</p></blockquote>

Egypt, the world&#x2019;s 14th most populous country, grapples with soaring prices for goods and services across the region. Additionally, the bitcoin exchange rate in Egypt is approaching the record high set in November 2021.</strong></p>
<h2>Egyptian Pound Plummets as Inflation Reaches Highest Level in Decades, Bitcoin Nears All-Time High</h2>
<p>Recent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/egypt-economy-inflation-record-russia-ukraine-8024c29526c135bb87f74c55cfd3af57">inflation figures</a> show Egypt is currently grappling with soaring inflation rates. The annual inflation rate surged to 36.8% in June. Citizens face rising food prices, a depreciating currency, higher fuel costs, and a growing fiscal deficit. Since June 2022, when the inflation rate was at 14.7%, the cost of goods and services in Egypt has more than doubled.</p>
<p>The Egyptian pound (EGP) has <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-USD">declined significantly</a> against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 2023, according to the latest exchange rates. The EGP&#x2019;s value has dropped 80.25% against the dollar since Dec. 26, 2003, with 42.09% of that decline occurring within the past five years. The currency has depreciated nearly 20% against the U.S. dollar since the start of 2023. Additionally, the inflation rate in Egypt has reached the highest level recorded since 1958.</p>
<p>In response to the inflation crisis, the Egyptian government has taken measures such as <a href="https://mepc.org/commentary/rising-inflation-egypt-impacts-responses">reducing state spending</a>. Moreover, the Central Bank of Egypt increased the benchmark bank rate four times in 2022. Despite the significant rise in inflation in Egypt, the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound (EGP) against Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) indicates <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is nearing a record high.

<p>Egypt&#x2019;s ongoing currency crisis and rampant inflation have severely impacted its citizens. An Egyptian family <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/egyptians-struggle-to-afford-food-this-ramadan-as-crisis-worsens-831e5a54">told</a> the Wall Street Journal in April they were &#x201C;hardly surviving this crisis&#x201D; and were running low on food. In order to mitigate the severe inflationary conditions, on January 16, 2023, the government announced a plan to sell discounted bread to low-income Egyptians most affected by the economic upheaval.</p>

<p>According to government statistics, nearly 30% of Egyptians live below the poverty line. Egyptian policymakers have also been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Since 2016, Egypt has received multiple financial support packages from the IMF. The most recent of these, a $3 billion loan, was <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/01/31/egypt-imf-bailout-highlights-risks-austerity-corruption">approved</a> by the IMF in December 2022.</p>

Thielen&#x2019;s forecast is based on a signal indicating the conclusion of the bear market, which occurred when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> reached its highest point in 12 months since the 2022 &#x2018;Crypto Winter.&#x2019;</strong></p>
<h2>Matrixport Research: Bitcoin Expected to Hit $125,000 by Year-End 2024</h2>
<p>Bitcoin prices have experienced a period of consolidation over the previous three days. However, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s value has still seen a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-leaves-major-assets-in-the-dust-surges-80-in-the-first-half-of-2023-soars-to-12th-largest-global-asset/">notable increase</a> of 17.5% over the past 30 days and a significant surge of 72% against the U.S. dollar within the last six months. This recent upward momentum has sparked several predictions.</p>
<p>Three days ago, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/btcs-year-end-price-projections-for-2023-vary-widely-ranging-from-25k-to-40k-while-future-forecasts-extend-into-six-digit-territory/">featured</a> two projections regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price by the end of 2023. These reports revealed a wide range of forecasts, ranging from $25,000 to $40,000 per bitcoin. On July 5, 2023, Markus Thielen, the head of research at Matrixport, published his own prediction for the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Thielen emphasizes that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> reaching its one-year high serves as a compelling indicator that has consistently marked the conclusion of bear markets and the onset of new crypto bull markets. The Matrixport researcher draws attention to notable instances when this signal occurred in August 2012, December 2015, May 2019, and August 2020. Thielen underscores that, in each of these cases, the bull market commenced within a timeframe of 12 to 18 months following the signal. The Matrixport executive added:</p>
<blockquote><p>If history is any guide, then, there is now a 100% probability that by the end of 2024, Bitcoin will experience another massive bull market with a price target of $125,000 (+310%) &#x2013; based on the previous three signals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matrixport&#x2019;s projection for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price at the end of 2024 follows venture capitalist Tim Draper&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-adjusts-timeframe-for-his-250k-bitcoin-price-forecast/">revised timeline</a> for bitcoin&#x2019;s value to reach $250,000. Draper acknowledged the possibility of a slightly extended wait, suggesting it could take an additional two years. These forecasts from Matrixport and Draper have also emerged with less than 300 days remaining until the next <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-2024-halving-presents-new-challenges-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-mining-rewards/">Bitcoin block reward halving</a>. Matrixport predicts a price of $63,160 for the halving, citing the Blackrock spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filing</a> and a surge in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-citadel-launches-with-trading-of-4-cryptocurrencies/">institutional interest</a>.</p>

<p>&#x201C;There is no obvious indication of what will drive the next bull market, but the data indicates that bitcoin could continue to rally into the 2024 halving,&#x201D; Matrixport&#x2019;s Thielen writes. &#x201C;Many market participants argued that the bitcoin bear market would continue throughout the year as the overhang from the crypto bankruptcies and the expected regulatory backlash would cause prices to stay low for the year. &#x2018;Matrix on Target&#x2019; had a different view, based on proven and reliable data analysis.&#x201D;</p>

The emergence of a discount on crypto assets paired with USD on Binance US has fueled speculation about the affiliate&#x2019;s future and the fate of users&#x2019; funds.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoin Asset Pairs Tracking the True Value of Crypto Assets</h2>
<p>On July 10 the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD value on the beleaguered crypto exchange Binance US stood at just over $27,500, about $2,500 below the price prevailing on other centralized exchanges. In contrast, when paired with the stablecoin <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, the top cryptocurrency&#x2019;s value of just over $30,100 on Binance&#x2019;s affiliate in the U.S. was consistent with that on other exchanges.</p>

<p>In fact, as shown by data on Binance US, most crypto assets listed on the platform have also been trading at a discount in USD terms. Yet, when paired with the stablecoins <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC, many of the crypto assets appeared to track their true values. While news of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and other crypto assets&#x2019; discounts was one of the most trending topics on Twitter on July 9, recent <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-us/">data</a> on the trading platform indicates that these price discrepancies initially emerged around June 21.</p>
<p>The emergence of a discount on all assets paired with USD is seemingly the direct opposite of what happened when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sought to freeze user assets via a court motion. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-trading-at-premium-on-binance-us-amid-sec-lawsuit-and-asset-freeze-motion/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in early June, the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD value on Binance US was $1,444 higher per bitcoin than the average global exchange rate. Ethereum was also trading at a premium of $100.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>The Existence of Arbitrage May Indicate Deeper Problems</h2>
<p>In the meantime, the emergence of a discount on all crypto assets paired with the USD appears to be linked to the crypto exchange&#x2019;s banking partner challenges. In its message to users on June 23, Binance US <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-restores-usd-withdrawals-suggests-users-withdraw-or-spend-their-dollars/">said</a> it expected its banking partners to discontinue the USD withdrawal service. At the time, the affiliate encouraged &#x201C;users to use, withdraw, or convert their USD fiat balances to stablecoins to continue crypto-to-crypto trading on the platform.&#x201D;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> is trading $3000 lower on Binance US & <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> is trading $200 lower. I don&#x2019;t think this is an arbitrage opportunity. It&#x2019;s too obvious and it smells like something is seriously wrong. Again, this is Binance US. Just US version. Don&#x2019;t freak out yet. <a href="https://t.co/6WS9y6bMjD">pic.twitter.com/6WS9y6bMjD</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Max (@MaxBecauseBTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBecauseBTC/status/1677719251589775360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On Twitter, the emergence of a discount on crypto assets paired with the USD has on one hand fueled speculation about the affiliate&#x2019;s future and the fate of users&#x2019; funds. On the other hand, users have questioned the apparent discount on nearly all assets paired with the USD. For example, a user by the name of Max said the price discrepancies on Binance US may not be an indication of an arbitrage opportunity. Another user named James Foura characterized the supposed arbitrage opportunity as one-way trade.</p>
<p>&#x201C;People keep talking arbitrage on Binance US &#x2026; it&#x2019;s a one-trip trade folks. Getting money back in requires crypto that has to be bought at higher prices elsewhere. So it&#x2019;s basically a wash unless you want to dump your crypto. Can anyone find parity on Coinbase,&#x201D; Foura said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/J_Foura/status/1678005929411747841">tweet</a>.</p>

The move pushed the price near a one-week high, and came as the global crypto market cap fell 0.07% lower as of writing. Solana also dropped, following a recent bull run.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>)</h2>
<p>Binance coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>) was a notable gainer on Monday, as the token rose by nearly 5% to start the trading week.</p>
<p>After falling to an intraday low of $232.01 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>/USD rose to a peak of $244.80.</p>
<p>This resulted in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> hitting its strongest point since last Tuesday, when the token climbed to a high of $246.90.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that this latest rally occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 48.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 49.33, with the next visible point of resistance at 52.00.</p>
<p>Should the index reach this point, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> will be near $250.00.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>After climbing to a two-month high last week, solana (SOL) was in the red on Monday, falling for a second straight day.</p>
<p>SOL/USD hit an intraday low of $20.57, which comes less than 24 hours after price peaked at $21.53.</p>
<p>The move appears to be a result of profit taking, since solana reached its highest point since May 6, this past Saturday.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, it seems that sentiment is still somewhat bullish, as traders opted to reject a breakout below $20.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the token is trading at $21.09, with the 10-day (red) moving average still upward facing.</p>
<p>Overall, the recent decline comes following a collision with a ceiling at $22.00.</p>

Anticipation is mounting as ministers from the BRICS countries convene to explore potential avenues for expanding the bloc&#8217;s membership and introducing a unified currency. Recent data from Google Trends reveals a surge of interest in the BRICS, with search terms such as &#8220;BRICS,&#8221; &#8220;de-dollarization,&#8221; and &#8220;BRICS currency&#8221; reaching their peak scores last week, signifying widespread curiosity on a global scale.</strong></p>
<h2>Google Trends Data Exposes Heightened Curiosity in BRICS Subjects</h2>
<p>In the past four weeks, the spotlight has been shining brightly on the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-emerges-as-the-worlds-largest-gdp-bloc-propelled-by-chinas-rapid-expansion/">BRICS bloc</a>, a dynamic alliance of nations comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. 2023 has witnessed an incredible surge in news coverage and content centered around these <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-coalescing-against-the-dollar-major-banks-predict-more-fed-hikes-bitcoin-records-large-blocks-as-ordinals-gain-currency/">influential nations</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 days, the world&#8217;s interest in the BRICS bloc has witnessed a spike. According to Google Trends (GT), the search term &#8220;BRICS&#8221; skyrocketed to a perfect score of 100 out of 100 on July 3, 2023. The day before, the search term &#8220;BRICS&#8221; garnered a score of 72 out of 100.</p>

<p>Among the countries showing the greatest interest in the search term &#8220;BRICS&#8221; are Burundi, Botswana, Nicaragua, South Africa, and Bangladesh, according to GT data. Notably, associated topics linked to the &#8220;BRICS&#8221; search term encompass “gold,” “de-dollarization,” “Bangladesh,” “Vladimir Putin,” and “France.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, global interest in the search term &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/what-is-de-dollarization-exploring-the-shift-away-from-the-us-dollars-global-dominance/">de-dollarization</a>&#8221; has experienced a dramatic increase over the past 30 days, culminating in a perfect score of 100 on GT on June 24, 2023. Throughout the past month, &#8220;de-dollarization&#8221; has witnessed several spikes, achieving scores of approximately 94, 97, and 99, further underscoring its significance.</p>

<p>Singapore and the United States emerged as the leading regions in search of the term &#8220;de-dollarization,&#8221; reflecting a global fascination with this subject. Likewise, the search term &#8220;BRICS currency&#8221; has been steadily gaining traction over the past month. According to GT data, on July 2, 2023, this query reached a score of 38.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-597070 size-full" title="Google Trends Data Reflects Rising Interest in BRICS Bloc and De-Dollarization Searches " src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curennbrics.jpg" alt="Google Trends Data Reflects Rising Interest in BRICS Bloc and De-Dollarization Searches " width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curennbrics-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curennbrics-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curennbrics-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curennbrics-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curennbrics-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curennbrics-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curennbrics.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>However, just two days later, on July 4, the &#8220;BRICS currency&#8221; query skyrocketed to a perfect score of 100. Currently, Malawi, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Kenya, and Croatia stand out as the regions displaying the highest interest in this search term. Related topics include the “economy,” “currency union,” “Americans,” “Arabia,” and “Zimbabwe.”</p>
<p>Notably, GT data also reveals a common question asked: &#8220;When will a BRICS currency be released?&#8221; Captivating the world&#8217;s attention this week is South African president Cyril Ramaphosa&#8217;s <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20230709-brics-summit-will-be-held-in-person-despite-putin-arrest-warrant-says-south-african-president">announcement</a> that the upcoming BRICS Summit will be conducted in-person, with the possibility of Russian leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s attendance.</p>
<p>While Ramaphosa remained tight-lipped about Putin&#8217;s participation in the Johannesburg Summit, curiosity looms as people eagerly anticipate the outcomes of this year&#8217;s event. The discussions revolving around expanding the bloc&#8217;s membership and establishing a common <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sberbank-analysts-editorial-tremendous-potential-brics-reserve-currency-fueling-de-dollarization/">BRICS reserve currency</a> have fueled speculation and intrigue.</p>
<p>Regardless of personal sentiments towards these subjects, global citizens have unequivocally demonstrated an insatiable interest in the BRICS bloc and its endeavors, as clearly indicated by the Google Trends data.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) started the week trading near the $30,000 level, after the price dropped below this point over the weekend.</p>
<p>Following a low of $29,985.39 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high of $30,427.59 in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The rebound comes as bears rejected a breakout below a recent support point at the $29,900 level.</p>

<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has mostly been consolidating for the past four days, which has led to the 10-day (red) moving average shifting direction.</p>
<p>After trending upwards in recent weeks, the moving average now looks as though it has flatlined, giving way to a potential downturn in the coming days.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 57.75, marginally below a ceiling at 58.00.</p>
<p>Should it fail to break out, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could decline further in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) continued to trade below $1,900 on Monday, as price is nearly 5% lower than at the same point last week.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD slid to an intraday bottom at $1,848.78 to start the week, a day after trading nearly $30.00 higher.</p>
<p>Overall, this has resulted in ethereum&#x2019;s 10-day (red) moving average closing in on a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>

<p>Should this occur, the first possible target will be a price floor at $1,815, which was last hit on June 30.</p>
<p>Price strength is currently at a reading of 50.35, however should it move under an upcoming floor at 48.00, a sell-off will likely occur.</p>

The annual turnover between the two neighboring nations exceeds $10 billion with millions of pilgrims and health tourists crossing the border each year.</strong></p>
<h2>Iran and Iraq Can Reduce Dollar Dominance by Using Dinar in Trade, Official Says</h2>
<p>The government in Tehran is pushing for wider use of national currencies in foreign trade and is viewing the Iraqi dinar as an alternative to the dollar in transactions with Bagdad, regional media reported. Replacing the U.S. currency with the dinar in bilateral trade between Iran and Iraq would weaken the dollar’s supremacy, according to an Iranian official.</p>
<p>Speaking to Iran’s Mehr News Agency, the head of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce, Yehya Eshaq, made it clear that the transition to dealing in national fiats is a priority for the current Iranian government. “Most countries in the world are looking for breaking the American hegemony in their exchanges, and the use of national currencies can help accelerate this process,” Eshaq said and added:</p>
<blockquote><p>By favoring the dinar over the dollar in trade operations with Iraq, we are actively undermining the dollar’s dominance in our import-export transactions as part of a wider governmental strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also quoted by the Shafaq news agency in Iraq, Eshaq pointed out that transacting in national currencies can speed up the ongoing shift away from U.S. control on global trade, a trend which, in his opinion, is gaining traction.</p>
<p>The annual exchange of goods and services between the two neighboring nations currently amounts to more than $10 billion, the Iranian official highlighted. “The adaptation of a trade system pivoting on the national currencies of the two nations would further cement these relations and galvanize more robust trade ties,” he elaborated.</p>

<p>Iran and Iraq should be able to reduce the dominance of the dollar by maximizing trade exchanges with their national currencies, Yehya Eshaq emphasized, adding that both nations can benefit from this move and proper follow-up steps.</p>
<p>Eshaq’s statements follow recent remarks by Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/irans-president-says-de-dollarization-key-to-a-fair-international-system/">stressed</a> the need for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/what-is-de-dollarization-exploring-the-shift-away-from-the-us-dollars-global-dominance/">de-dollarization</a>. Speaking during the virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Council of Heads of State earlier this week, he stated that any attempt to shape a fair international system requires the removal of the U.S. dollar as an “instrument of dominance in intra-regional relations.”</p>

In this issue, Bolivian President Luis Arce calls for de-dollarization at the Southern Common Market Summit, Reserve drops fiat services in Latam, and Argentina postpones a $2.6 billion IMF payment.</strong></p>
<h2>Bolivian President Calls for De-Dollarization and Diversification</h2>
<p>Bolivian President Luis Arce called for the de-dollarization and the diversification of the economic relations of the Latam region. After concluding his participation at the Southern Common Market Summit, Arce reinforced the importance of the de-dollarization process of Latam, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bolivias-president-calls-on-south-american-countries-to-ditch-us-dollar-bolster-alliances-with-china-and-brics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our region is seriously affected by the restrictions imposed by the northern financial system, which limits financing options, making it necessary to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar and diversify our economic relations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Arce mentioned China and the BRICS as possible partners to help in this diversification push. Arce finished explaining that the region was &#8220;experiencing a crucial moment of transition towards a multipolar world that guarantees a balance of powers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In May, Arce <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-bolivia-mulls-chinese-yuan-for-trade-settlements-steve-hanke-proposes-30-day-solution-for-venezuelan-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> the Central Bank of Bolivia to research if the country could also mimic the recent advancements in the Chinese yuan&#8217;s usage in countries like Argentina and Brazil.</p>
<h2>Reserve Drops Fiat Services in Six Countries</h2>
<p>Reserve, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, announced it was dropping fiat-based services in six countries: Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. In a <a href="https://rpay.app/en/home/official_announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>, Gabriel Jimenez, CEO of Rpay and former <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-programmer-who-created-the-petro-token-regrets-participating-in-the-project-works-on-an-alternative-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Petro developer</a>, explained that liquidity in fiat currencies would be available until August 3.</p>
<p>After this date, the platform will switch to operating using only cryptocurrencies in these countries. Jimenez declared that the reasons behind this measure were related to &#8220;sustainability issues associated with cryptobanking challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result, Reserve, which had been focused on Latam markets, also announced a change of strategy, now directing its effort to establish a foothold in the U.S. to create a &#8220;pathway for global expansion.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Argentina Postpones $2.6 Billion IMF Payment</h2>
<p>The government of Argentina <a href="https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202307/633089-postergan-para-los-ultimos-dias-de-julio-pago-de-vencimientos-con-el-fmi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it would postpone two payments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) until the end of July. The government deferred the delivery of these payments — which amounted to 2.6 billion — as it is still in talks to accelerate the disbursement of part of the loan of the IMF to the country.</p>
<p>Recently, Argentina <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentina-settles-imf-payment-in-yuan-brazilian-cbdc-to-be-launched-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled</a> part of a $2.7 billion payment to the IMF using the Chinese yuan and IMF&#8217;s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) due to the low dollar liquidity that the country is experiencing.</p>
