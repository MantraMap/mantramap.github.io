Recently, the Terra Classic ecosystem has been in the spotlight due to its developmental efforts, with the testnet upgrade to version 2.0.0 being the latest advancement. Contrary to general expectations, this recent improvement hasn&#8217;t translated into the price of the Terra Luna Classic token (LUNC). Since the start of February, the price of Terra Luna Classic has been on a downward trend. And it can be said that the project’s recent growth hasn&#8217;t done much to halt this decline.

This bearish period was preceded by a week in which the price of LUNC was relatively stable, moving in a horizontal direction. However, a broader look at the market shows that Terra Luna Classic has been on a downward trend in the past few months. Since the beginning of February, the token has recorded a price fall of nearly 53%.  According to data from CoinGecko, LUNC is currently valued at $0.00009549. In the past 24 hours, the value of this cryptocurrency has dropped by about 5%, falling beneath the crucial $0.0001 level in that time.  LUNCUSD on a downward trend &#124; Source: LUNCUSD chart on TradingView The last time Terra Luna Classic made it below this price point can be traced back to August 2022 &#8211; the aftermath of the Terra ecosystem collapse. With the $0.0001 level failing to hold, the token would hope to find rest at its next support level of $0.00009275, even though the current sentiment is strongly bearish.

The testnet upgrade, completed on the 4th of May, was announced on Twitter by Till, a part-time developer for the L1 team.
