<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance Coin (BNB) experiences price fluctuations, falling below the $240 support level, but sees a recovery following the announcement of the ARKM token sale on Binance Launchpad by Arkham Intelligence.</em></li>



<li><em>BNB deposits surge on Binance, resulting in a significant increase in daily trading volume.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite the positive response to the token sale, BNB&#8217;s price remains below the Fib 23.6% level and struggles to surpass the $250 resistance level.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance Coin (BNB) has seen a couple of swing swings from $250 in the last few days. The price fell below the $240 support level. Binance&#8217;s announcement of the introduction of <a href="https://coincu.com/201309-arkham-intel-on-chain-intelligence-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARKM</a>, the new token from on-chain forensics company <a href="https://coincu.com/201349-arkham-airdrop-on-july-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkham Intelligence</a>, on the <a href="https://coincu.com/201234-binance-launch-the-32nd-launchpad-arkham-arkm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance Launchpad</a> is seen as a favorable indication.</strong></h5>

<p>Binance Coin recovered all weekly losses after Binance launched a token sale for the on-chain analytics tool Arkham yesterday and said that investors must possess Binance Coin to participate. The ARKM token sale includes a hard ceiling of $2.5 million, with a maximum contribution restriction of $15,000 per user.</p>

<p>Binance has seen a huge rise in BNB deposits over the previous 12 hours, which has resulted in a 180% spike in daily trading volume. A huge whale sent roughly 141,835 BNB ($35 million) to various Binance deposit addresses, likely in anticipation of the Arkham token sale. This occurrence is most likely to blame for the current increase in BNB trading volume.</p>



<p>Binance Coin is an unusually high flyer in the market, and anytime it moves, it is clear that the exchange&#8217;s favorable feeling is strong at the moment.</p>



<p>Due to anticipation around the forthcoming token sale, the price of BNB on Binance increased by 7.46%, jumping from $231.3 to $248.6.</p>



<p>The currency is now trading at $246.4, with a 24-hour trading volume of $848,332,976.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1024x623.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1024x623.png" alt="BNB Price Is Struggling At $250 Despite Launchpad Effect" class="wp-image-201682" width="1022" height="622" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1024x623.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-300x182.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-768x467.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1536x934.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-2048x1246.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-750x456.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1140x693.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" title="BNB Price Is Struggling At $250 Despite Launchpad Effect 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BNB price chart. <em>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/1EribfXh/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TradingView</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, we need to note that this is an effect brought about by the new Binance Launchpad, and the price of BNB is still below the Fib 23.6% level. What&#8217;s special is that it also coincides with the $250 resistance level. This level is the price of the coin that was rejected many times after losing its key $300 support.</p>



<p>For now, the wait is still ongoing as Bitcoin is still trading around the $30,300-$30,600 mark with no signal of a breakout above $31,000. Although Binance Coin received a very enthusiastic response, if the overall trend of the market remains gloomy, it is difficult for it to surpass the $250 mark.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Digital asset exchange BIT announced today an update to its existing integration with Copper's ClearLoop, a leading digital asset settlement network.<p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com/201652-bit-and-copper-revolutionize-crypto-trading/" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p><p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com"><strong>Coincu News</strong></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BIT announces an integration upgrade with Copper ClearLoop, a settlement network, to enhance trading features for institutional clients.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade enables traders to use all of their assets as collateral and introduces USD-margined options, reducing counterparty risk.</em></li>



<li><em>The partnership provides secure trading on the BIT exchange while assets remain safeguarded under Copper&#8217;s custody, improving capital efficiency and settlement times.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital asset exchange BIT <a href="https://blog.bit.com/bit-extends-integration-with-coppers-clearloop-to-facilitate-off-exchange-settlements-on-usd-margined-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today an update to its existing integration with Copper&#8217;s ClearLoop, a leading digital asset settlement network.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="504" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-1024x504.png" alt="BIT And Copper Join Forces To Revolutionize Institutional Crypto Trading" class="wp-image-201659" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-1024x504.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-300x148.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-768x378.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-1536x755.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-2048x1007.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-750x369.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-1140x561.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BIT And Copper Revolutionize Institutional Crypto Trading With Enhanced Security 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The improved integration intends to transform institutional customers&#8217; crypto trading experiences by providing expanded trading tools and greater asset protection.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/174165-copper-stops-enterprise-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copper</a> through ClearLoop will now support BIT&#8217;s Unified Margin function, allowing traders to use all of their assets as collateral, thanks to the integration update. In addition, the update converts previously supported coin-margined choices to USD-margined ones. BIT will also implement the new ClearLoop trust structure as part of the upgrade, which offers additional protections against counterparty risk through Copper&#8217;s market-leading legal framework.</p>



<p>The ClearLoop update also converts previously supported coin-margined options to USD-margined options and implements the new ClearLoop trust structure, reducing customers&#8217; exposure to counterparty risk even more.</p>



<p>Copper is a SOC2 Type 2 accredited startup that was formed in 2018 with ClearLoop as its heart. ClearLoops allows customers to trade and settle in near real-time across several exchanges, reducing counterparty risk and enhancing capital efficiency.</p>



<p>Dmitry Tokarev, founder and CEO of Copper.co, expressed his satisfaction with the growing partnership, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to grow our partnership with BIT as they adopt the new ClearLoop Trust Structure, providing their institutional clients with even greater protection for their digital assets. The growing number of exchanges joining ClearLoop is a testament to the industry&#8217;s growth and commitment to continued financial market infrastructure maturity.&#8221;</p>

<p>ClearLoop&#8217;s technical capabilities for off-exchange settlement remains unaltered. The integration, however, now includes the critical advantage of bankruptcy remoteness provided by ClearLoop&#8217;s legal structure.</p>



<p>This huge boost in integration is intended to alter institutional customers&#8217; trading experiences by providing them with a smooth and safe platform. Because of BIT&#8217;s enhanced trading features and collaboration with Copper, institutional customers may easily utilize BIT&#8217;s trading services without having to move assets from Copper custody. This arrangement alleviates typical security issues connected with trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, such as the danger of exchange hacking and asset freezing.</p>

<p>The integration enables institutional customers to conduct secure trading on the BIT exchange while knowing that their funds are safe in Copper&#8217;s segregated custody. This method efficiently decreases counterparty risk, improves capital efficiency, and shortens settlement times.</p>

<p>Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of USDC stablecoin operator Circle, believes stablecoins could help the Chinese government internationalize the yuan more quickly than its central bank digital currency (CBDC) eCNY. Although there is no indication that Beijing is warming up to crypto, Allaire thinks that stablecoins typically pegged to fiat currency, could be a more immediate solution to promote the use of the RMB in trade and commerce worldwide. He cited an offshore yuan-pegged stablecoin as an example of how this might work.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has promised to roll out regulations on stablecoins by 2024, recognizing the potential impact that these products could have on financial markets. In tandem, the Securities and Futures Commission is also working on its complementary regulations. This marks the next front in Hong Kong&#8217;s bid to regulate crypto markets and become a global virtual asset hub.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are a unique breed of crypto assets, pegged to fiat currency, making them more stable than other cryptocurrencies. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including remittances, cross-border payments, and trading. It remains to be seen whether stablecoins will take over CBDCs in promoting the use of cryptocurrencies, but they are gaining traction in the global market for now.</p>



<p>Despite the potential benefits, there are still concerns over their regulation and risks. The HKMA&#8217;s move to regulate stablecoins is a step in the right direction toward addressing these issues. As the crypto market continues to evolve, it is important for regulators to keep pace with new developments and provide a framework for the responsible use of these assets.</p>

<p>As of May and June, another 18 sites were inspected, bringing the total number of inspections for the year to 34. The regulator has been working closely with the South West Regional Organized Crime Unit and the police forces of Greater London, Bedfordshire, and Hertfordshire to conduct these inspections.</p>



<p>According to the FCA, it has &#8220;disrupted&#8221; 26 machines operating unlawfully across the country. However, despite the crackdown and warnings issued by the FCA, some members of the public continue to use crypto ATMs. In one case, a person paid 1,000 British pounds ($1,290) into a crypto ATM, but no funds were returned even though the machine said the transaction was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The public to be aware that any crypto ATMs in the country are operating illegally, and consumers will not be protected if they use one and something goes wrong. The FCA has issued various warnings since March 2022, urging people not to use these machines.</p>



<p>None of the more than 40 registered crypto companies in the U.K. is licensed to offer ATM services. Therefore, any crypto ATMs operating in the U.K. are doing so illegally, as the FCA has warned. According to data site Coin ATM Radar, there are 10 such locations in the country.</p>



<p>The FCA&#8217;s crackdown on these illegal crypto ATMs is crucial to protect consumers from scams and ensure that financial regulations are being followed. Furthermore, it&#8217;s important for members of the public to be informed and aware of the risks associated with using these machines, and to avoid using them altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin Ordinals gain traction and challenge Ethereum&#8217;s NFT dominance, setting record numbers of inscriptions.</em></li>



<li><em>Ordinals experience a surge in sales and active buyers, with significant growth in USD sales and a potential shift in dominance within the NFT sector.</em></li>



<li><em>Ethereum&#8217;s struggle to maintain traction is attributed to falling floor prices of top collections, while Bitcoin Ordinals continue to gain adoption despite controversies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Ordinals, the NFTs created on the Bitcoin (BTC) network, are rapidly gaining momentum and closing in on their Ethereum (ETH) counterparts in terms of dominance. Since their inception in April 2023, Ordinals have been making waves within the Bitcoin community, setting record numbers of inscriptions and challenging Ethereum&#8217;s position in the NFT space.</strong></h5>

<p>Ordinals are unique digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Their creation became possible through the Taproot upgrade, which was launched on the Bitcoin network in November 2021. This upgrade enabled data inscription on the Bitcoin network in a similar manner to creating NFTs on other blockchain platforms. The introduction of Ordinals has created a buzz in the Bitcoin community, leading to significant traction and growing interest among users.</p>



<p>According to data from NFT aggregator <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlam</a>, collections such as $INSC BRC-20 NFTs, Uncategorized Ordinals, $SATS BRC-20 NFTs, and $BRC-20 NFTs have seen substantial trading volumes, surpassing popular Ethereum collections like Azuki, BAYC, and DeGods.</p>

<p>The number of new inscriptions on Ordinals reached over 250,000 on Monday, based on data tracked by the data analytics platform <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune Analytics</a>. This represents a surge of more than 300% since the launch of the Bitcoin Request for Comment BRC-69 token standard on July 3. The BRC-69 token standard, the modified version of the BRC-20 standard, has significantly reduced the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.</p>

<p>In contrast, Ethereum&#8217;s daily volume experienced only a 3.8% increase during the same period. However, it is important to note that Ethereum&#8217;s sales volume still exceeds that of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Ordinals have witnessed a remarkable surge in both sales and active buyers, achieving over 130% growth in USD sales and capturing close to 10% of the buyer market. Although Ethereum currently leads the NFT sector with total sales surpassing $15.65 million, the rapid rise of Bitcoin Ordinals suggests a potential shift in dominance.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>This shift indicates that traders&#8217; interest in Bitcoin NFTs has surpassed that of Ethereum. One contributing factor to Ethereum&#8217;s struggle to gain traction is the falling floor prices of its top collections.</p>



<p>While Ethereum previously held the title of the king of NFT volume, primarily due to its mass adoption in 2021, collections on the Ethereum blockchain have faced challenges in maintaining a steady upward trajectory since the beginning of the year. It was during this same period that Bitcoin Ordinals emerged, backed by the Taproot network, steadily gaining adoption despite controversies surrounding its operation on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin Ordinals continue to set new records and attract increased attention, it remains to be seen if they will dethrone Ethereum and reshape the landscape of the NFT sector.</p>

<p>This method generates Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through a process called inscribing, and has become increasingly popular. In fact, the number of new inscriptions has already risen to over 350,000 on Monday, according to data tracked by Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm.</p>



<p>This increase in daily inscriptions represents a surge of over 250% since <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bitcoin.org/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ordinals</a> launchpad Luminex unveiled the BRC-69 token standard on July 3. This modified version of the BRC-20 standard has reduced the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.</p>

<p>Luminex said in a Tweet thread that with BRC69, the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections can be reduced by over 90% through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets. The brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity, as minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends, using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions.</p>



<p>While the number of new inscriptions has surged, the daily fees paid for inscriptions remain stagnant, according to data tracked by Dune Analytics. This trend suggests that the BRC-69 token standard has delivered on its promise.</p>

<p>Ordinals was launched in January, bringing the NFT and smart contracts narrative to the Bitcoin blockchain and spurring investor interest in tokens like STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network.</p>



<p>The Ordinals boom can be divided into two waves, according to Glassnode. The first wave represents activity between early February and late April, when image-based inscriptions led the way. The second wave began in May, with high free-paying text-based inscriptions leading the way. This trend suggests that the Ordinals market is still evolving and that we can expect to see more exciting developments in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, remains optimistic about Web3 development in Hong Kong and the efforts of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to regulate stablecoins. </li>



<li>Hong Kong is actively working on regulations for stablecoins to become a global virtual asset hub. The HKMA plans to introduce stablecoin regulations by 2024, recognizing the impact these products could have on financial markets. </li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle,<a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3227171/head-crypto-firm-circle-accepts-ban-mainland-china-sees-role-yuan-backed-stablecoins?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3227171/head-crypto-firm-circle-accepts-ban-mainland-china-sees-role-yuan-backed-stablecoins?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" rel="noreferrer noopener"> remains positive </a>about Web3 development in Hong Kong and the regulation of stablecoins. Despite China&#8217;s skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, Allaire sees stablecoins as a potential solution to internationalize the yuan.</strong> </h5>

<p></p>



<p>Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of Circle, a USDC stablecoin operator, is optimistic about Web3 development in Hong Kong and stablecoins&#8217; regulation by the local monetary authority, despite not being under any illusions about mainland China opening its markets to cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>While some officials from mainland China have expressed support for Hong Kong&#8217;s moves to court the crypto industry, there has been no indication that Beijing is warming up to crypto.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, stablecoins, which are typically pegged to fiat currency, could offer a more immediate solution for the Chinese government&#8217;s goal of internationalizing the yuan than the central bank digital currency (CBDC) eCNY.</p>



<p>Jeremy Allaire cited a stablecoin pegged to the offshore yuan (CNH) as an example of how this might work. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has promised to roll out regulations on stablecoins by 2024, noting the potential impact such products could have on financial markets.</p>



<p>The HKMA has also been researching a possible digital Hong Kong dollar. There have been some questions about the future role of stablecoins in a well-regulated environment once CBDCs are available. For Jeremy Allaire, CBDCs are complementary and private coins still have a role to play in innovation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/200554-south-koreas-fsc-requires-disclose-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Services Commission</a> and the Financial Supervisory Service have collaboratively prepared these guidelines, ensuring compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) through a reasonable interpretation. The move aims to establish comprehensive supervisory guidelines for accounting standards related to various transactions and stages involving virtual assets.</p>



<p>One of the primary issues addressed by the guidelines is the timing of revenue recognition for companies issuing <a href="https://coincu.com/199125-south-korea-passed-important-crypto-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtual assets</a>. Previously, different criteria were applied by each issuing entity, leading to discrepancies and differing opinions between companies and auditors. The guidelines now specify that revenue from the sale of virtual assets will be recognized only after the company fulfills all obligations to virtual asset holders. </p>



<p>Until such obligations are fulfilled, the payments received will be accounted for as liabilities. The guidelines further emphasize the need for clear delineation of the issuing company&#8217;s obligations to avoid retroactive changes that may delay revenue recognition.</p>



<p>Additionally, the guidelines shed light on the treatment of stolen assets. If an asset is classified as a liability in the issuer&#8217;s financial statements and subsequently stolen through hacking, it must be unconditionally compensated. However, if it is considered a customer&#8217;s asset, the liability for damages exists, but there is no obligation to reimburse the stolen amount.</p>

<p>The guidelines also address the recognition of development costs associated with virtual assets and platforms. Unless clear grounds are provided to classify such costs as intangible assets according to the prescribed standards, they will be treated as expenses when incurred. The guidelines establish six stringent requirements for the recognition of development costs, which necessitate objective evidence for compliance. Meeting these requirements is expected to pose challenges for companies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the guidelines consider the recognition of assets and liabilities based on economic control over virtual assets, taking into account international trends and the level of legal property rights protection for customers. Factors such as customers&#8217; ability to claim legal property rights and operators&#8217; rights to freely utilize entrusted virtual assets will determine whether they are recognized as assets or liabilities of the operator.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/201159-south-korean-regulator-cracks-coin-gate-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea</a>&#8216;s government plans to gather feedback from stakeholders, including listed companies, virtual asset operators, and accounting firms, over a two-month period. The feedback will be taken into account for finalizing the revision of the supervision guidelines and standards. The revised guidelines and standards are expected to be announced and implemented during October and November, following deliberation and resolution by the Accounting System Deliberation Committee and the Securities and Futures Commission. The Accounting Supervision Guidelines will take immediate effect upon publication.</p>



<p>These comprehensive guidelines aim to provide reliable and useful information, facilitating comparisons between companies and ensuring greater transparency in the accounting practices related to virtual assets.</p>
