<ul><li>A group of FTX customers has brought a class action suit against the exchange’s law firm.&nbsp;</li><li>Fenwick &amp; West LLP is being sued for allegedly aiding fraud through its legal advice to the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The law firm has been accused of setting up entities used to perpetrate fraud and structuring transactions to avoid scrutiny.&nbsp;</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried previously cited legal advice from Fenwick &amp; West to bolster his defense.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Fenwick &amp; West LLP, the California-based law firm that served as the primary outside counsel for FTX, is being sued by the bankrupt crypto exchange’s customers. The customers have brought a class action lawsuit against the law firm for its alleged role in aiding fraud through the legal advice it provided to the crypto exchange before its collapse last year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Fenwick Was Aware Of FTX’s Shady Business Practices?</strong></h2>



<p><strong> </strong>A group of FTX customers filed a class action lawsuit against the exchange in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, though the plaintiffs plan to transfer it to the Southern District of Florida, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/ftx-law-firm-fenwick-faces-second-lawsuit-by-crypto-customers-2023-08-07/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reported earlier today. Earlier this year, a judicial panel <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judicial-panel-consolidates-ftx-lawsuits/">ordered</a> the consolidation of multiple lawsuits related to the bankrupt exchange in Miami where they would be heard by Federal Judge Michael Moore. </p>



<p>The latest complaint alleged that the services extended to FTX by Fenwick &amp; West went beyond what a law firm usually provides to its clients. The crypto exchange’s customers accused the law firm of setting up “shadowy entities” that were used by founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his inner circle to commit fraud and structure the exchange’s transactions in ways that allowed them to circumvent regulatory scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“When asked by FTX Group executives for counsel, Fenwick lawyers were eager to craft not only creative, but illegal strategies.” </p><cite>Complaint against Fenwick &amp; West LLP</cite></blockquote>



<p>The customers further alleged that through its unique position and proximity to FTX’s operations, Fenwick &amp; West was aware of the exchange’s complicated organizational structure, lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices. The class action lawsuit is the second FTX-related legal matter to hit the law firm. Earlier this year, Sam Bankman-Fried attempted to subpoena Fenwick to prove that he was acting on legal advice provided by the law firm during his stint as the exchange’s Chief Executive.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>PayPal is set to launch its own dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum called PayPal USD (PYUSD).&nbsp;</li><li>The new stablecoin will be issued by former BUSD issuer Paxos Trust Company.&nbsp;</li><li>The fintech giant aims to establish itself in the growing digital asset space with PYUSD.&nbsp;</li><li>PYUSD comes just days after a key stablecoin bill was cleared by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>American fintech giant PayPal is set to launch its own stablecoin on Ethereum. The payment services company announced earlier today that its dollar-pegged PYUSD stablecoin would be 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. With its ERC-20 stablecoin debut, PayPal is looking to venture into the growing digital asset space.</p>



<h2><strong>Paxos Trust Co. Will Issue PayPal’s PYUSD Stablecoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from PayPal, the new PYUSD stablecoin will be issued by Paxos Trust Company, the New York-based blockchain firm that minted Binance’s BUSD stablecoin till February this year. Paxos is licensed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which also issued a BitLicense to PayPal in June last year. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.&#8221; </p><cite>Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal</cite></blockquote>



<p>PYUSD will initially be made available to U.S.-based PayPal customers, who will be able to purchase it through the payments giant’s online platform. Users will be able to transfer the stablecoin between the platform and compatible external wallets, use it for online purchases, and convert it to one of PayPal’s supported cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting September 2023, Paxos Trust Co. will publish monthly Reserve Reports for PYUSD outlining the composition of the reserves backing the stablecoin. The stablecoin issuer will also publish third-party attestation of the value of the reserve assets. The attestation itself will be carried out per the standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of PayPal’s stablecoin comes nearly six months after the fintech giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paypal-halts-stablecoin-crypto-crackdown/">halted</a> stablecoin development following the crackdown on crypto by regulators in the United States. At the time, Paxos was being probed by the NYDFS for unknown reasons. </p>



<p>The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023, which was <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NASAA-Letter-to-Congress-Regarding-H.R.-4766-Clarity-for-Payment-Stablecoins-Act-of-2023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">cleared</a> by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee last month may have played a role in PYUSD’s launch. Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said in a statement earlier today that the stablecoin bill brought much-needed clarity surrounding the regulation of stablecoins and other digital assets. </p>

<p>Worldcoin’s warehouse in Nairobi was reportedly raided by Kenyan law enforcement agencies over the weekend. The raid came amid growing scrutiny of the controversial crypto project that was launched by ChatGPT founder Sam Altman last month. Privacy watchdogs around the world have expressed concerns over Worldcoin’s biometric data collection through iris scans in exchange for WLD tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Worldcoin Failed To Disclose Its True Intentions</strong></h2>



<p>Local media <a href="https://kahawatungu.com/police-raid-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-warehouse-in-nairobi-over-data/" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> earlier today that the Kenyan executed a search warrant on August 5, 2023, at one of Worldcoin’s facilities in the capital city of Nairobi. The raid, which involved officers from multiple agencies, resulted in the confiscation of documents and machines that are believed to be associated with the crypto project’s biometric data collection. </p>



<p>The raid was reportedly conducted under the supervision of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The seized machines and documents are reportedly being analyzed at the headquarters of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. Immaculate Kassait, the Data Protection Commissioner, has accused Tools for Humanity, the crypto project’s parent firm, of failing to disclose its true intentions at the time of registration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The raid came just days after Kenya’s Ministry of Interior and National Administration <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kenya-halts-worldcoin-activity/">ordered</a> the crypto project to shut down its operations and initiated an investigation into its activities in the country due to concerns over privacy and security. The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority (CMA) previously expressed concerns about biometric data collection and publicly stated that Worldcoin was not regulated in the country. </p>



<p>Kenya was the first African nation targeted by Worlcoin, given its booming tech industry and a four million-strong crypto trading community. The crypto project has maintained that its activities are in accordance with Kenyan regulations. However, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki told the Kenyan Parliament last week that the firm was not registered as a legal entity in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its launch last month, Worldcoin has come under scrutiny from multiple privacy and data regulators around the world, including Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. France’s CNIL and the Bavarian State Authority in Germany have launched a joint investigation into the crypto project’s activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Alchemix/CurveFinance Exploiter returned nearly $9 million in funds drained from the DeFi protocol following on-chain negotiations spotted via Etherscan on Friday. </p>



<p>Alchemix Finance received a blockchain transaction note asking the protocol to confirm its wallet address. The exploiter then <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8#tokentxns" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8#tokentxns" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transferred</a> 4,820 ether over three transactions to Alchemix&#8217;s multi-sig wallet. At current prices, the assets are worth $8.9 million. </p>



<p>Friday&#8217;s transaction represents a portion of around $61 million drained from decentralized exchange Curve Finance. The attacker reportedly exploited a code bug in Vyper&#8217;s compiler, a smart contract programming language used by Curve across its platform. </p>



<p>The code bug allowed malicious attackers to drain liquidity pools affecting Metronome, Alchemix, and JPEGd. So far, exploiters have returned some of the looted assets to Alchemix and JPEGd. </p>



<p>Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix previously asked the exploiters to return 90% of the drained funds for a 10% bounty in return. CRV gained 5% in price on Friday following news of Alchemix&#8217;s recovery. </p>

<h2>Curve Founder Offloads CRV To Balance Debt</h2>



<p>CRV, Curve native token and a cryptocurrency widely used across Ethereum&#8217;s DeFi lending ecosystem dipped in price following exploits on the exchange&#8217;s in-house pools. </p>



<p>The drop in CRV&#8217;s price spelled danger for loans taken by founder Michael Egorov. Egorov deposited million of CRV tokens as collateral on DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Fraxlend. These loans risked liquidation if CRV&#8217;s price fell below $0.30. </p>



<p>In response to the CRV&#8217;s declining price amid last weekend&#8217;s exploit, Egorov <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-egorov-sells-72-million-crv/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-egorov-sells-72-million-crv/" rel="noreferrer noopener">spurred</a> a deluge of over-the-counter (OTC) deals with some 13 investors including Tron founder Justin Sun. </p>



<p>Egorov&#8217;s CRV sales from OTC trades total 106 million CRV tokens and he received $42 million USDT in return. This liquidity has seemingly gone into <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1687294816890347520?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1687294816890347520?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">balancing debts on Aave</a> and other lenders amid concerns of a DeFi implosion. </p>



<p>DeFi analyst Ignas opined that a CRV nosedive looked unlikely due to an increase in Curve&#8217;s 3Crypto pool featuring crvUSD+ETH+CRV. </p>

<p>The United States Department of Justice is seeking the revocation of Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail due to his role in an article published by the New York Times last month that has stirred up <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutor-revoke-sam-bankman-fried-bail/">controversy</a> over the past two weeks. In a recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.188.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> to SDNY Judge Lewis Kaplan, federal prosecutors from the Justice Department cited multiple attempts by the disgraced FTX founder to tamper with witnesses and urged the judge to put him behind bars. </p>



<h2>DOJ Wants Sam Bankman-Fried Detained Pending Trial In October</h2>



<p>The Department of Justice highlighted the acknowledgment by Sam Bankman-Fried’s defense team regarding his involvement in the New York Times article on former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Bankman-Fried provided Ellison’s diary to NYT, which contained private writings about her time at the now-defunct crypto firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors told Judge Kaplan that the FTX founder shared Ellison’s private writings to influence the public’s perception of her, given that she is set to testify against him after pleading guilty in the lawsuit against FTX. The prosecutors believe that Bankman-Fried’s actions amount to a federal felony while out on bail, and asked Judge Kaplan to revoke the same till his trial hearings begin on October 2, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, the New York Times wrote to Judge Kaplan on August 2, 2023, in what appeared to be an attempt to defend Sam Bankman-Fried’s decision to share Caroline Ellison’s private diary. The NYT argued their article was in the “public’s legitimate interest” given Ellison’s proximity to the case and knowledge of FTX and Alameda’s inner workings. </p>

<p>The New York Times also cited the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and the press, among other things. The news giant asked the court to make its decision in Bankman-Fried’s bail revocation matter in accordance with the First Amendment. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, stated that NYT’s invocation of the First Amendment for a bail revocation hearing was unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Matter Labs has denied allegations of source code plagiarism made by Polygon.&nbsp;</li><li>Polygon previously accused Matter Labs of copying part of its open-source code without giving due credit.</li><li>In response, Matter Labs claimed it had sufficiently attributed the copied code to Polygon.</li></ul>



<p>Matter Labs, the crypto firm behind zkSync, has responded to the recent plagiarism allegations made by fellow <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/">Ethereum</a> layer-2 scaling solution Polygon. Earlier today, Polygon accused Matter Labs’ developers of copying parts of its open-source code without giving due credit for the plagiarized code. Matter Labs has denied the allegations and argued that it had sufficiently attributed the copied part to Polygon. </p>



<h2><strong>Matter Labs: Polygon Is Making “Untrue Claims”</strong></h2>



<p>Earlier today, Polygon published a <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x70DF15b0208eFCeFaA541Da9A0ED6C4A884554Fc/gNi8coqXjd1ybFsQBAG7QARUkPHZECu7ihIRkpiVx2Y" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> titled “Protect the Open Source Ethos”, which accused Matter Labs of copying a “significant amount” of source code from the Plonky2 library to its recently unveiled proving system called Boojum. According to Polygon, the code was copied with copyrights or attribution to its original authors. </p>



<p>Polygon also called out Matter Labs’ founder Alex Gluchowski for claiming that Boojum is more efficient than Plony2. Polygon questioned the authenticity of Gluchowski’s claim, given that Boojum’s code concerning performance was directly copied from Plonky2. Polygon further cited Boojum’s introductory post, which failed to mention the layer-2 scaling solution or its developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to Polygon’s allegations, Matter Labs clarified that its Boojum proof system derived 5% of its code from Plonky2, which was “prominently attributed” in the first line of its library. In a statement to CoinDesk, a Matter Labs spokesperson said that Polygon’s blog post made untrue claims about Boojum’s code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CEO Alex Gluchowski followed up with a detailed tweet where he expressed his disappointment with Polygon’s allegations. Gluchowski reiterated that only 5% of the Boojum code was based on the Plonky2 code. He added that Boojum and Plonky2 were both implementations of the Redshift, which he claimed was introduced by Matter Labs 3 years before Polygon published the Plonky2 paper. </p>

<p>The tension between Polygon and Matter Labs comes as both firms rush to deliver the first zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) to offer cheaper and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network. Earlier this year, Polygon’s Mihailo Bjelic and Matter Labs’ Alex Gluchowski were involved in a heated exchange over the latter’s zkSync Era, particularly its security audits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coinbase has reported a total revenue of $708 million for the second quarter of 2023. Despite having a quarter-on-quarter decline of 8%, the revenue was seen as a positive metric given that it beat the market estimate of $628 million. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange’s net revenue came in at $662.5 million, down 10% compared to the first quarter.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Coinbase Posts Net Loss Of $97 Million In Q2 ‘2023</h2>



<p>As per Coinbase’s <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/Shareholder-Letter-Q2-2023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Q2 earnings report</a>, the transaction revenue from institutional and retail clients came in at $327 million, down from $374 million in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue from subscriptions and services took a 7.2% hit, coming in at $335.4 million. The total revenue also accounted for $45.4 million of corporate interest and other income, which grew 25% compared to Q1. </p>



<p>The largest crypto exchange in the United States saw a total trading volume of $92 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Retail traders contributed $14 billion, while institutional traders accounted for the remaining $78 billion of trading volume. The consumer and institutional trading volume decreased by 33% and 37% QoQ, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of June 30, 2023, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/">Coinbase</a> had an ETH staking balance of $7 billion, $2.2 billion of which was from institutions. Custodial fees contributed $17 million to the exchange’s revenue. The crypto exchange’s assets under custody witnessed a QoQ hike of 14% to $59.6 billion. Meanwhile, the interest income came in at $201 million, $151 million of which was from USD Coin. </p>

We’ve cut costs, are operating efficiently, and remain well-positioned to build the future of the crypto economy and help drive regulatory clarity.” </p><cite>Brian Armstrong, co-founder, and CEO of Coinbase</cite></blockquote>



<p>The earnings report also revealed a net loss of $0.76 per share for common stockholders. However, Coinbase’s overall Q2 metrics prompted its share price to gain 10% earlier today, with the stock soaring as high as $100.42 in after-hours trading. The company’s stock had returned to $91 at the time of writing. </p>

<ul><li>Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has offloaded 72 million Curve Dao Tokens since last week’s exploits.&nbsp;</li><li>Egorov has managed to reduce his $100 million debt, collateralized with 427 million CRV, by 21%.&nbsp;</li><li>Earlier today Curve’s crvUSD stablecoin briefly lost its peg to the US Dollar and tanked 0.35%.</li></ul>



<p>Michael Egorov, the man behind the automated market maker<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-defi-tvl-down-curve-crisis/"> Curve Finance</a>, has offloaded roughly 72 million Curve DAO tokens (CRV) in over-the-counter (OTC) trades since last week’s exploits on the DeFi protocol. Egorov’s recent sales came as he attempted to minimize his CRV-backed debts of over $100 million, which risk getting liquidated with CRV’s tanking price. </p>



<h2><strong>Curve Finance Founder Still Owes Over $80 Million</strong></h2>



<p>In a summary of Michael Egorov’s recent OTC sales, on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1687115628006772737" rel="nofollow noopener">Lookonchain</a> reported that the Curve Finance founder had sold CRV to 15 different institutions and investors at an average price of $0.4, raising over $28 million in the process. </p>



<p>Last week’s exploit on Curve, which drained over $47 million from the DeFi protocol, put a spotlight on Egorov’s hefty loans totaling $100 million that was backed by more than 427 million CRV, which accounted for 47% of the token’s total circulating supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The largest debt was on Aave, where the Curve founder had posted a collateral of 305 million CRV for a loan of 63.2 million USDT. This debt is eligible for liquidation as soon as CRV’s price sinks to $0.37, given that it has a liquidation threshold of 55%. The riskiest debt was on Frax Finance, where Egorove had pledged 59 million CRV for 15.8 million FRAX. Fraxlend’s time-weighted variable interest rate made it so that the interest rate would double every 12 hours if the credit utilization reached 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, Michael Egorov has repaid 12 million USDT to Aave and 6.6 million FRAX to Frax Finance, which left an outstanding debt of 51 million USDT and 9.1 million FRAX, respectively. The Curve Finance founder still owes 12 million MIM on Abracadabra, 9.4 million DOLA on Inverse, 740,000 XAI on Silo, reducing his total debt obligations by 21%.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Curve’s crvUSD stablecoin lost its peg to the US Dollar and sank as much as 0.35% amid uncertainty surrounding the DeFi protocol. Since the exploit, several players in the crypto industry, including Justin Sun and Huobi, have stepped in to prevent a dramatic decline in CRV’s price in order to avoid a DeFi catastrophe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1687089210216595456?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1687089210216595456?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> the release of an Ethereum bridge and NFT minting for its layer 2 network Base. Base is set to launch its mainnet on August 9 after opening to developers back in July. </p>



<p>The Ethereum bridge will allow Base users to transfer tokens including ETH between Coinbase&#8217;s network and Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain. This was previously impossible as developer access released in July only allowed one-way transactions to Base. </p>



<p>Starting August 9, users will also be able to mint NFTs on Base and claim digital ID or crypto usernames on Coinbase Wallet. Coinbase also partnered with names like OpenSea, Atari, and Coca-Cola to power user rewards.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The bridge to Base is OPEN 🔵<br><br>Here are six ways you can bridge, including commemorative NFTs 👇 <a href="https://t.co/UtHxpxr8sg" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/UtHxpxr8sg</a></p>&mdash; Base 🛡️ (@BuildOnBase) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1687089210216595456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>BALD Degens Rekkt On Coinbase&#8217;s L2 Chain</h2>



<p>The previous lack of bridge options to Base did little to stop speculative traders from aping into memecoins launched on the blockchain. These degens as they&#8217;re known in crypto poured millions into tokens, with a coin called BALD taking center stage. </p>



<p>Traders reportedly turned a few hundred dollars in initial punts into millions overnight. Indeed, BALD&#8217;s market cap peaked at nearly $90 million on Sunday from a $50,000 token market cap two days prior. </p>



<p>BALD&#8217;s ascent was shortlived as its price <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" rel="noreferrer noopener">tumbled</a> toward zero after the developer withdrew over $12 million in liquidity. The rug pull &#8211; the term used to describe when a token deployer withdraws liquidity after prices have increased, leaving users unable to liquidate their coins &#8211; splashed across Base&#8217;s ecosystem with several of these memecoins rugging would-be early investors. </p>



<p>Decentralized exchange LeetSwap also paused operations after multiple exploits on liquidity pools. The team has since recovered over 400 ETH, per LeetSwap Twitter updates. </p>
