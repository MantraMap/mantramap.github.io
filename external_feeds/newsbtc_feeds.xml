					<description><![CDATA[In today’s micro update from Capriole, founder Charles Edwards presented a compelling analysis that draws parallels between the current low volatility of Bitcoin and its historical behavior in 2016. With Bitcoin&#8217;s price stagnating around the $29,000 mark, experts are closely watching for signs of a potential bullish breakout. &#8220;Bitcoin’s price remains at $29K, in a sideways consolidation that has created one of the absolute lowest volatility periods in Bitcoin’s 14 year history,&#8221; Edwards states. This prolonged period of low volatility is reminiscent of 2016, suggesting that a significant price movement could be imminent. Bitcoin Breakout Imminent? While the technicals indicate a bearish breakdown from the $30,000 mark, the absence of a downward momentum offers a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. &#8220;If price was going to collapse, we would usually have seen that follow through by now,&#8221; the report notes. However, for a more concrete bullish sentiment, &#8220;a close back above $30K on the daily timeframe is required at the minimum as a technical confirmation of a failed breakdown.&#8221; Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit On the fundamental front, Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain data continues to contract, albeit at a decelerating rate. The imminent decisions on several Bitcoin ETF approvals could potentially disrupt the current low volatility phase. &#8220;An approval could cause a break from the current low volatility range. Best not to pre-empt this though, as these decisions often get pushed. Confirmations are key to mitigate risk,&#8221; Edwards cautions. Diving deeper into the technicals, the report highlighted two key observations: Since 2010, Bitcoin’s historic volatility has only been lower than today in 2016. Suggesting a big price move is on the horizon when volatility expansion (reversion to the mean) occurs. Bitcoin’s $30K breakdown has (so far) failed to follow through&#8230; A close back into the Wyckoff structure at $30K would signify a failed breakdown and therefore be a very positive technical signal. BTC On-Chain Indicators Are Neutral Capriole&#8217;s Bitcoin Macro Index, a comprehensive tool that amalgamates over 40 Bitcoin on-chain, macro market, and equities metrics into a machine learning model, currently scores at -0.36, indicating &#8220;Contraction&#8221;. This suggests that while the short-term outlook remains neutral, the long-term perspective appears bullish. Remarkably, this strategy takes long-only positions in Bitcoin. In slowdowns and contractions, cash is held. &#8220;The Macro Index today remains in a period of relative value (below zero), suggesting decent long-term value for multi-year horizon investors,&#8221; the report elucidated.

Drawing parallels with 2016, the report suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s current low volatility phase could be a precursor to a bullish breakout. &#8220;All else equal, Bitcoin is like a beach ball submerged underwater.

					<description><![CDATA[The drama surrounding FTX and founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) continues to unfold almost a year after the crypto exchange collapsed. This time around, prosecutors are coming after the former CEO for allegedly using customer funds to buy the favor of politicians. SBF Used Customer Funds For Campaign Contributions The latest indictment filed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) details how Bankman-Fried embezzled customer deposits and used these stolen funds towards various ventures, including funding the political campaigns of several politicians in the Democratic and Republican parties.  Related Reading: BALD Deployer Moves Proceeds Of The Rug From Base To Ethereum According to the filing, SBF did this to lobby for crypto regulations that could favor him and his company. His plan was to get Congress and regulators to make laws and regulations that make it easier for FTX to accept customers’ deposits, consequently allowing his embezzlement to continue without getting noticed.  SBF also apparently broke several campaign finance rules to maximize his influence on politicians by using straw donors as some of these political contributions were allegedly made in the names of FTX executives. The founder also made to conceal the fact that the source of these donations was customer funds, as he directed that the customer deposits be paid into the executives’ bank accounts, who then made the donations in their names.  SBF had been publicly known to make contributions to the Democratic party while secretly funneling funds to the GOP. He previously admitted that he made “significant” donations to both parties before the midterm elections last year.  At the time, the funds he reportedly donated totaled over $40 million, making him the seventh-highest political donor between 2021 and 2022. However, the latest indictment filing reveals that he could have well been the second-highest political donor with over $100 million in political contributions.  While SBF made these donations and portrayed himself as the “savior of the cryptocurrency industry” (in reference to SBF bailing out crypto firms that were struggling financially), there were gaps in FTX’s finances resulting from his alleged misappropriation.  FTT Token struggles as SBF case intensifies &#124; Source: FTTBUSD on Tradingview.com Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Seven Counts Of Fraud Despite this latest revelation, prosecutors will no longer be charging SBF with violation of campaign finance rules.

					<description><![CDATA[On August 14, Kevin Kelly, Co-founder of prominent crypto research firm Delphi Digital provided some interesting insights on Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. According to Kelly, the crypto market moves in consistent cycles, and we are currently in the initial stages of a new cycle based on market evidence. Using the premier cryptocurrency as a benchmark, Kelly states a crypto cycle usually begins with Bitcoin attaining a new all-time high (ATH) value, followed by an 80% loss in the next year. Thereafter, BTC would experience a market recovery over two years before embarking on a bullish run to attain a new ATH.  The Interplay Between The Crypto Cycle And Macroeconomic Signals Based on Kelly’s analysis, a typical crypto cycle occurs within four years, and its events are triggered by some factors in the bigger macro business cycle.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Relatively Muted – What Could Trigger A Sharp Decline? The analyst noted that, for example, Bitcoin usually attains new price peaks at the same period as the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Index &#8211;  an economic indicator that tracks the manufacturing sector’s health in the United States. He said: BTC price peaks occur around the same time the ISM shows signs of topping out. Active addresses, total transaction volumes, total fees – they all peaked alongside tops in the ISM too. As the business cycle shows signs of recovery, so too does network activity levels… Due to this similarity in market movement, Kevin notes that turning moments in a typical business cycle have proven to be a favorable period to increase one’s exposure to risk assets such as Bitcoin.  Source: Delphi Digital Bitcoin Poised To Attain New ATH By Q4 2024, Kelly Says Interestingly, Kevin Kelly stated in his analysis that the ISM is currently heading toward the end of a two-year downtrend, indicating that BTC’s prices may soon start surging in the coming months. To back his long-term bullish price prediction, Kelly highlights several other factors, including the Bitcoin Halving event coming up in April 2024.  The Delphi Digital Co-founder stated that the last two Bitcoin halvings had occurred 18 months after BTC’s price tanked and 7 months before rallying to a new ATH. Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit Based on this historical data, BTC could well attain a new ATH by Q4 2024. However, as with all predictions, Kelly stated that are certain risk factors involved.  Firstly, he predicted that the BTC market is likely to soon witness a modest selling pressure or price consolidation, especially following the market&#8217;s strong recovery in the last 9 months. In addition, he also highlighted the possibility of the business cycle presenting a false bearish end &#8211; as seen in March 2020 &#8211;  or not reaching its bearish end as soon as predicted.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading around $29,333.89, with a 0.12% decline on the last day. However, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 26.38% and is valued at $12.2 billion BTC trading at $29,322 on the daily chart &#124; Source: BTCUSD chart on Tradingview.com Featured image from LinkedIn, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent revelation, Lookonchain, the on-chain analysis service, reported that Voyager Digital, the now-bankrupt crypto lending platform, has been offloading its crypto assets on Coinbase in recent days. Over the past four days, the defunct lender has sold 49 different crypto assets, netting approximately $63 million. For the SHIB army the most notable sale was the 1.4 trillion Shiba Inu tokens, which amounted to nearly $14.4 million. Beyond SHIB, Voyager&#8217;s sales included significant amounts of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Polygon (MATIC), and Decentraland (MANA). &#8220;Voyager has been selling assets on #Coinbase for the past 4 days and has sold 49 tokens for ~$63M. Including: 781 BTC ($23M); 9,570 ETH ($17.6M); 1.4T SHIB ($14.4M); 234,660 LINK ($1.74M); 1.87M MATIC ($1.27M); 3M MANA ($1.1M);&#8221;, Lookonchain tweeted. The sales have significantly reduced Voyager&#8217;s crypto holdings. However, they haven&#8217;t entirely emptied their coffers. The on-chain analysis service further detailed Voyager&#8217;s remaining assets: &#8220;Voyager currently holds $11.3M worth of assets, including: 52.4M VGX ($8.27M); 55 BTC ($1.62M); 537K KNC ($371K); 1.18 FTM ($286K); 20.7M STMX ($140K); 4.85M GALA ($111K).&#8221; Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Golden Cross – How Will Prices React? While the sales have drawn attention, there&#8217;s a silver lining for the SHIB community. According to Lookonchain&#8217;s data, Voyager&#8217;s SHIB holdings have been completely liquidated. Thus, Voyager&#8217;s SHIB holding have gone to zero, suggesting a potential reduction in sell pressure on the Shiba Inu token in the future. Shiba Inu Price Shows Resilience Despite the massive sell-off by Voyager, SHIB&#8217;s price remained resilient. The token has seen a surge of over 14.2% in the past week. This bullish momentum is largely attributed to the forthcoming Shibarium mainnet launch at the Blockchain Future Conference, starting today. Investors seem optimistic about SHIB&#8217;s potential, believing that if the layer-2 scaling solution delivers on its promises, the SHIB token could witness even more substantial gains. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges At press time, the Shiba Inu price stood at $0.00001019 after finding support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.00001007). The key resistance on a daily basis is currently the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.00001121. Should a breakout occur, SHIB could rise 21% from its current price to follow through to the 61.8% Fibonacci level. Major resistance is expected at this price level ($0.00001235). The RSI on a daily basis has been in an ascending trend since the annual low on June 10 and was at 65 at press time. This leaves the SHIB bulls with further room to run. For an explosive double-digit move, the RSI should enter deep overbought territory. For investors, today&#8217;s or tomorrow&#8217;s Shibarium launch should be taken with a grain of salt. As usual for the crypto market, it could be a &#8220;buy the rumor, sell the news&#8221; event, as the impact of the launch might only be seen in the long term over the coming months. In this case, the 200-day EMA at $0.00000938 will be a key support to defend for the bulls. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Toncoin (TON) recently saw a remarkable breakthrough, shattering its month-long consolidation phase and providing a glimmer of hope for traders. The coin, which had been confined within a price range of $1.31 to $1.49, broke free from this range-bound pattern, but not without facing its share of challenges. During the consolidation phase, Toncoin exhibited multiple instances of attempting to breach the crucial $1.50 mark.

<p>If ripple fails to clear the $0.650 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.620 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5926 swing low to the $0.6654 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is near $0.60. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.60 level, XRP’s price could extend losses. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.585 support zone.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are encouraging on-chain activities in Cardano. According to Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, on August 14, there were 25,294 wallet addresses with at least 100,000 ADA, the highest in over 16 months. The uptick could signal interest, especially considering that prices are under pressure looking at the performance in the daily chart.  ADA Whales Accumulating Looking at Santiment trends, it appears that ADA whales began accumulating as early as June 2022, and the number has been rising steadily ever since. However, amid this encouraging &#8220;bullish&#8221; signal, ADA prices have fluctuated, edged lower, and diverged with whales&#8217; actions in the past 16 months. ADA is changing hands at around $0.289 at spot rates, down from $0.465 when whales began loading up in mid-June 2022, as seen below.  There are over 25,000 whales with at least 100,000 ADA of writing in mid-August, up by over 3,000 since June 2022. Overall, and as aforementioned, this is a vote of confidence for Cardano and may signal optimism in how ADA&#8217;s future prices could pan out.  Related Reading: Michael Burry’s Massive $1.6 Billion Short: Is A $DXY Collapse The Catalyst For A Crypto Bloodbath? In crypto, token holders closely monitor whale activity, as their actions often influence market sentiment. Their continued accumulation, for example, of ADA, is an endorsement of a project&#8217;s potential and could ignite demand, lifting prices. Conversely, when they offload, it could trigger a sell-off, forcing asset prices lower. ADA whales are buying more of the coin when Cardano&#8217;s market capitalization has been pulling back from 2023 highs. At spot rates, the project&#8217;s market cap is down by at least 35%, dropping from $15.76 billion to $10.1 billion as of mid-August. Even so, ADA is one of the most liquid coins looking at the average daily trading volumes and position in the leader board.  Cardano Building, ADA Resilient But Weak Presently ranked eighth, Cardano is ahead of Solana and Tron but trailing XRP and Dogecoin in the top 10. ADA is trading at $0.289, down roughly 10% from August 2023 highs. While ADA remains within the June to July 2023 trading range, ADA buyers hold an advantageous position looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Despite recent lower lows, sellers have not yet reversed the gains of July 13, a conspicuous bar that shapes the immediate price action. Related Reading: HBAR Token Spikes 16% In One Day, Can Bulls Sustain the Momentum? Cardano is in the Basho era, where developers look at enhancing scalability and network performance to support intensive decentralized applications (dapps), particularly those in decentralized finance (DeFi). Notable improvements in this phase include pipelining and the release of Mithril, aimed at bolstering network security. Additionally, Cardano&#8217;s leading developer IOG is working on Hydra, a layer-2 solution to boost scalability further using off-chain channels.  Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>

<p>There are over 25,000 whales with at least 100,000 ADA of writing in mid-August, up by over 3,000 since June 2022. Overall, and as aforementioned, this is a vote of confidence for Cardano and may signal optimism in how ADA&#8217;s future prices could pan out. </p>

<p>In crypto, token holders closely monitor whale activity, as their actions often influence market sentiment. Their continued accumulation, for example, of ADA, is an endorsement of a project&#8217;s potential and could ignite demand, lifting prices. Conversely, when they offload, it could trigger a sell-off, forcing asset prices lower.</p>
<p>ADA whales are buying more of the coin when Cardano&#8217;s market capitalization has been pulling back from 2023 highs. At spot rates, the project&#8217;s market cap is down by at least 35%, dropping from $15.76 billion to $10.1 billion as of mid-August. Even so, ADA is one of the most liquid coins looking at the average daily trading volumes and position in the leader board. </p>
<h2>Cardano Building, ADA Resilient But Weak</h2>
<p>Presently ranked eighth, Cardano is ahead of Solana and Tron but trailing XRP and Dogecoin in the top 10. ADA is trading at $0.289, down roughly 10% from August 2023 highs. While ADA remains within the June to July 2023 trading range, ADA buyers hold an advantageous position looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. </p>
<p>Despite recent lower lows, sellers have not yet reversed the gains of July 13, a conspicuous bar that shapes the immediate price action.</p>

<p>Cardano is in the Basho era, where developers look at enhancing scalability and network performance to support intensive decentralized applications (dapps), particularly those in decentralized finance (DeFi). Notable improvements in this phase include pipelining and the release of Mithril, aimed at bolstering network security. </p>
<p>Additionally, Cardano&#8217;s leading developer IOG is working on Hydra, a layer-2 solution to boost scalability further using off-chain channels. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[According to Bloomberg, a recent research report from Sanford C. Bernstein has shed light on the potential impact of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on the Bitcoin market dynamics. Related Reading: Silent Bitcoin Storm: Glassnode Uncovers What Lies Beneath The Surface Potential Surge In Bitcoin Market Value Sanford C. Bernstein&#8217;s research indicates that should the US green-light a fund investing directly in spot Bitcoin, ETFs could constitute roughly 10% of Bitcoin&#8217;s market value within the next three years. Such a shift could amplify Bitcoin&#8217;s presence in traditional financial portfolios and potentially foster more significant institutional adoption. According to Bloomberg, Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, highlighted the rising probability of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the report. In a separate report, this same analyst had recently disclosed that the SEC believes that a Bitcoin Spot ETF may be &#8220;unreliable&#8221; since crypto exchanges (such as Coinbase) aren&#8217;t under their oversight, leading to concerns about potential price manipulation and unreliability. While the speculation on the SEC approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF continues, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust currently holding about 4% of all Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg, a direct investment, ETF could more than double this figure, potentially aiding the growth of the crypto investment landscape. The “Growth Flywheel” Effect Once regulatory approval is in place, Bernstein anticipates a &#8220;growth flywheel&#8221; effect propelled by retail and other institutional inflows. Such a cascade effect would be reminiscent of other financial markets where introducing new financial products spurred fresh investments and liquidity waves. Notably, to understand the significance of this, one only needs to consider the broader ETF market&#8217;s growth trajectory. Since their inception, ETFs have grown exponentially, with assets under management surging across various sectors and asset classes. Introducing a Spot Bitcoin ETF would mean integrating a highly liquid, decentralized, and increasingly accepted asset into this mix, further validating Bitcoin&#8217;s place in the financial ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is struggling to break above the $30,000 mark after slipping below that price range last week. As of this writing, the asset trades at $29,623, recording a slight increase of 0.5% over the past 24 hours. Alongside its struggling price, BTC’s market capitalization has increased by more than $10 billion in just the past week. The asset market cap has surged from a high of $560 billion earlier last week to a current cap of $573 billion.
