					<description><![CDATA[Security firm Dedaub discovered and disclosed a critical vulnerability on the popular Ethereum decentralized exchange Uniswap. The team behind the protocol fixed the bug, and the affected components were successfully redeployed—otherwise, an attacker could have tempered with transactions to steal a user’s funds.  Related Reading: Ol’ Reliable Litecoin Up By 7% As LTC Flexes Muscles For 2023 Uniswap Avoids Danger And Fixes New Features According to the security firm, the vulnerability was unintentionally implemented with the Universal Router. This component allows Uniswap users to trade ERC-20 tokens and non-fungible tokens “into a single swap router.” In other words, Uniswap users can optimize their operations and trade multiple tokens and NFTs in a single transaction, saving time and money. This new component also allows users to transfer funds to third parties.  When the vulnerability was in-placed, a user could send a transaction to a third party, and the latter could have gained access to the sender’s funds. Dedaub explained the following: (…) if third-party code is invoked at any point in the transfer (which manifests itself due to composition of protocols), the code can reenter the UniversalRouter and claim any tokens temporarily in the contract (…). The attacker also needs to implement code to reenter the router (calling execute) and sweep all token amounts. The router may contain funds mid-transaction due to other actions and transfers in a complex swap. The Universal Router hold the sender’s funds while the transaction is completed. While this happened, the funds were vulnerable, and a bad actor could drain them by calling specific commands such as “dispatch” with a “.TRANSFER” or. “.SWEEP.” The vulnerability could have allowed a bad actor to “re-entered” a transaction using this command. Once inside, the attacker could have been able to “drain the entire amount” from the sender’s wallet.  The security firm added the following on the “endless scenarios” where the vulnerability could have been exploited: If untrusted code is invoked at any point in the transfer, the code can re-enter the UniversalRouter and claim any tokens already in the UniversalRouter contract. Such tokens can, for instance, exist because the user intends to later buy an NFT, or transfer tokens to a second recipient, or because the user swaps a larger amount than needed and intends to “sweep” the remainder to themselves at the end of the UniversalRouter call. And there is no shortage of scenarios in which an untrusted recipient may be called (…). Ethereum DEX Grants $3 Million In Bug Bounty In December 2022, Uniswap launched the Universal Router as part of their new NFT compatibility. At that time, Uniswap Labs announced a $3 million bounty program. Dedaub was granted this amount for their bug report on the new component. The firm celebrated the reward and the fact that a bad actor never exploited the vulnerability. In addition, the security firm was “the only bug report that Uniswap acted upon.”  2022 was a troublesome year for crypto and risk-on assets, while macroeconomic forces played against the nascent sector. Users experienced hurdles beyond declining prices as hackers and bad actors took billions from the industry.  Data from on-chain analytics firm Chainalysis claims that bad actors have received over $26 billion in cryptocurrency from 2017 to 2021 alone.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has seen a slow start in 2023 as the cryptocurrency remains stalled and moving sideways around its current levels. Many experts believe BTC has seen the worst of the recent bearish cycle and could be gearing up for some profits.  Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Lack Volumes To Justify Caps, Says Santiment As of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $16,700 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours and the previous seven days. The low trading volume and low activity because of the holiday contributed to the current price action.  The Bitcoin Price Near A Bottom, But Profits Remain Elusive According to analyst Caleb Franzen, the Bitcoin price registered another indication of a bottom. Franzen and others have been tracking down the clues that could support a bullish thesis for BTC, and the Heikin Ashi printed a positive signal. The Heikin Ashi is a technique to visualize price action and create candlestick charts to measure trends in a market. Franzen claims the Bitcoin price printed its 13th consecutive monthly Heikin Ashi on December 22.  The last time BTC saw a similar trend was at the end of the 2018 and 2015 bear markets. This data supports a positive outlook for the Bitcoin price and hints at a bullish potential in the coming months. The analyst stated: Each red streak has been longer than the last &#38; we&#8217;re currently building #14 for January &#8217;23. Historically, a green monthly candle after 5+ red monthly candles has marked the end of each bear market. As mentioned, Franzen and other metrics point to Bitcoin forming a bottom at its current levels. Crypto exchange Coinbase claims that 50% of BTC investors present losses. In previous bear cycles, this metric reaching 50% coincided with a &#8220;sold base for a macro market bottom,&#8221; the report from Coinbase claims: These represent major inflection points for BTC performance, preceding subsequent periods of price appreciation, we believe this metric provides important insights into current cycle positioning. The Bitcoin price must clear a $14 million sell wall at $17,000 to take a first step in this direction. Additional data from Material Indicators claims that this level is a significant short-term hurdle for the cryptocurrency.  #FireCharts shows roughly $14M in ask liquidity, blocking #Bitcoin from a green Weekly candle close. pic.twitter.com/f5kfVtOd0R — Material Indicators (@MI_Algos) January 1, 2023  What Could Fuel A Fresh Bitcoin Rally As NewsBTC reported, history is on the side of the bears. For the past two years and since 2015, the Bitcoin price had traded downside during January when it recorded double-digit losses.  The start of a new year, low liquidity, and trading activity contribute to this historical pattern. The elements for another red January are there, but the cryptocurrency might surprise if macro conditions take a turn for the better.  Related Reading: Ol’ Reliable Litecoin Up By 7% As LTC Flexes Muscles For 2023 The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to continue with its interest rate hike program, but financial institution representatives have hinted at a shift in the monetary policy.

<p>In previous bear cycles, this metric reaching 50% coincided with a &#8220;sold base for a macro market bottom,&#8221; the <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-holders-loss-number-positive-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from Coinbase claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>These represent major inflection points for BTC performance, preceding subsequent periods of price appreciation, we believe this metric provides important insights into current cycle positioning.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bitcoin price must clear a $14 million sell wall at $17,000 to take a first step in this direction. Additional data from Material Indicators claims that this level is a significant short-term hurdle for the cryptocurrency. </p>

What Could Fuel A Fresh Bitcoin Rally
<p>As NewsBTC <a href="https://newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/bitcoin-stuck-indicator-points-to-new-trajectory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, history is on the side of the bears. For the past two years and since 2015, the Bitcoin price had traded downside during January when it recorded double-digit losses. </p>
<p>The start of a new year, low liquidity, and trading activity contribute to this historical pattern. The elements for another red January are there, but the cryptocurrency might surprise if macro conditions take a turn for the better. </p>

<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to continue with its interest rate hike program, but financial institution representatives have hinted at a shift in the monetary policy. According to the <a href="https://qcp.capital/featured-article/just-crypto-5-the-ghosts-of-arthur-burns-2022-wrap-2023-unwrap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">trading desk QCP Capital</a>, if the Fed rushes in and changes its approach, the Bitcoin price will benefit. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[XRP price is having a shaky start to the year 2023 after a sharp drop on Monday during Asia hours. The digital asset eventually recovered but it remains shaky even now a new report from Santiment shows that there could be a bull case for the cryptocurrency. This bull case is tied to large XRP holders who have been accumulating coins over the past six months. A Bull Case For XRP The report from Santiment starts out with the revelation that large investors holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens have been increasing their bags aggressively. Apparently, over the last six years, these investors raised their collective balances by 25%. This now meant that they were holding more than 4 billion XRP. Related Reading: SOL Jumps 15% In 24 Hours As Solana Receives Support From Ethereum Founder Santiment notes that such accumulation trends were important given that they are often observed during bear market bottoms. Basically, when these whales go on a buying spree such as this, it is when the price has already reached its lowest point in the bear market. So if history is anything to go by and this was to have the same effects as previously seen, then it could mean that there is a bull rally in scope for the digital asset. Additionally, it explains that the MVRV 30 for the altcoin shows that short-term holders were seeing losses of 7% on average. So this points to a hesitancy to sell among these holders because they do not want to take a loss. This refusal to dump tokens and whales adding to their balances adds up to less supply hitting the market while demand is on the rise. Basic laws of economics will easily put this as a recipe for a jump in the price of assets, hence the bull case for XRP. XRP price continues to struggle at $0.34 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com But What If This Isn’t The Case? One thing that XRP holders have to take into account is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. This case is yet to be concluded and it continues to put a damper on the price of XRP. To know just how much of an effect it had, while most cryptocurrencies in the market were hitting new all-time highs, XRP’s price had declined, unable to even reclaim its own all-time high price from 2018. Related Reading: Valkyrie Investments Wants To Take Over Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Reveals Plans What this shows is that until the case with the SEC is concluded, XRP will continue to struggle in the market. Furthermore, if the final judgment were to be against Ripple, then investors should expect a rapid decline in the price of the asset. The only thing that can categorically determine if there is a bull rally coming for the altcoin would be for the outcome of the case to be in favor of Ripple. Until then, the price of the digital asset is expected to trade sideways, as well as lag behind the general crypto market.

					<description><![CDATA[As the current bear market in crypto continues to deepen, Bitcoin has fallen by 78%, and Ethereum by 82%. Yet elsewhere in the crypto market, many altcoins are down by as much as 96% or more.  In a recent video, Elliott Wave International Currency &#38; Crypto Analyst Jason Soni sheds some light on why this occurs and what this could mean for various cryptocurrencies.  Breaking Down Why Some Crypto Assets Crash More Than Others Bitcoin price has retraced by more than 78% from all-time highs set back in 2021. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw an approximately 82% retracement from peak to trough thus far.  As you move down the ranks of cryptocurrencies, the total drawdown figures deepen.

					<description><![CDATA[The bitcoin mining difficulty had adjusted upward for the majority of 2022, recording its highest correction in the same year. However, 2023 kicked off with a downtrend as the mining difficulty has begun to drop. A sharp drop in this metric recorded in the early hours of Tuesday could be the start of a trend reversal in this regard. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Plunges The bitcoin mining difficulty declined suddenly on Tuesday morning during Asia hours. Data from CoinWarz shows that it had fallen almost 3.6% in a sharp downward correction. This took the mining difficulty from the 35.36T that it was trending at to 34.09T following the adjustment.  Related Reading: Valkyrie Investments Wants To Take Over Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Reveals Plans The bitcoin mining difficulty is important in the fact that it actually measures how much power is needed to verify transaction blocks on the network. The higher this figure is, the more demand it shows for the bitcoin network. And the lower it becomes, it means there are fewer miners on the network. One factor that has had a profound effect on the mining difficulty in the last month was the blizzard that blew through the United States. As temperatures dropped dangerously low in some places, miners had to disconnect their machines to free up the energy grid. This was in a bid to leave enough energy for citizens to power their homes. BTC price at $16,700 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Impact Of This On BTC The bitcoin price is still stalling despite the sharp downward correction in the mining difficulty. The digital asset is still trending in the mid-$16,000s and has refused to budge. Even the return of some momentum with the new year has not been enough to trigger a movement beyond this point. So when looking at the broader picture with the difficulty adjustment and price, it does not look like there would be any profound effect on price. Also, miners are still seeing similar profitability in their mining operations, so there is no tipping of the scale toward sell-offs or holding.

					<description><![CDATA[Known to be one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in the world, Litecoin (LTC) has been making headlines as it reported record high transaction numbers. According to the altcoin’s official Twitter account, it has serviced 39 million transactions as of December 29.  Add on to this the accompanying news that it has also hit second place in the unique addresses metric which grew to 52 million. These very bullish developments led to the token pumping 7% in the weekly timescale, according to Coingecko data.  The Litecoin Network completed over 39 million transactions in 2022. A new record! ⚡$LTC⚡ pic.twitter.com/DXbnuur2tI — Litecoin (@litecoin) December 31, 2022 2022 Leaving Marks &#8211; Will 2023 Be A Healing Year? The current developments are certainly bullish, but this didn’t come without a cost. Like the broader crypto market, LTC’s value has definitely suffered.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Known to be one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in the world, Litecoin (LTC) has been making headlines as it reported record high transaction numbers. </p>

<p>Add on to this the accompanying news that it has also hit second place in the unique addresses metric which grew to 52 million.

					<description><![CDATA[Data from Santiment reveals both Bitcoin and Ethereum currently lack the trading volumes to justify their market caps. Bitcoin And Ethereum NVT Ratios Are Both Bearish Right Now According to the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, both the bitcoin and ethereum networks will need to see a pickup in activity this year. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;Network Value to Transaction&#8221; (NVT) ratio, which measures the ratio between the market cap of any crypto and its transaction activity. Usually, the trading volume is considered as the transaction activity of a coin, but Santiment&#8217;s NVT ratio works differently. Instead of dividing the market cap by the volumes, this version of the metric makes use of the &#8220;daily circulation,&#8221; a measure of the total number of unique coins that have seen some movement in the past day. The advantage of the circulation indicator is that transactions, where the same coins jump through several wallets, are only counted once towards the measurement, while the normal trading volume metric would have counted them as many times as they were transferred. This helps eliminate duplicate transactions and gives a more accurate idea about the market activity. Now, what the NVT ratio tells us is how the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum currently compares against the activity on the respective networks. High values of the metric suggest the volumes are much lower than the cap right now, and hence the coin may be overvalued at the moment. On the other hand, low values suggest the price may be undervalued. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Withdraws $32M In LTC From Binance, Good Sign For Rally? Now, here is a chart that shows where the NVT ratio has been valuing Bitcoin and Ethereum during the past few years: The value of the metric seems to have been bearish for both the coins recently &#124; Source: Santiment As the above graph shows, the NVT ratio has been bearish for Bitcoin since August 2022. This means that in the last few months, the circulation on the BTC network has remained pretty low when compared to the market cap of the crypto. For Ethereum, the indicator&#8217;s value had been switching between bearish and bullish throughout 2022, but the coin seems to have ended the year being overvalued as the circulation was bearish in December.

BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin&#8217;s price floats around $16,700, down 1% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[A look at the top performers over the past 24 hours reveals a trend that could trigger a boom among certain altcoins in 2023. We&#8217;re talking about Lido Finance (LDO), which has risen 7% in the past 24 hours and 17% over the past seven days, making it the 37th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Lido Finance is a decentralized liquid staking application that allows users to generate additional yield for staking their assets. The application currently offers support for five cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Kusama (KSM), and Polkadot (DOT). Of particular interest, however, is the first-mentioned altcoin, Ethereum. As Thor Hartvigsen, blockchain and defi researcher, explained, Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) altcoins could see a boom in 2023 as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap implements the Shanghai upgrade. Of all major layer-1 blockchains, Ethereum has the lowest staking ratio of only 14%. In contrast, 90% of all BNB, 72% of all ADA, 68% of all SOL, and 62% of all AVAX are staked. The huge gap is likely related to the fact that ETH cannot yet be de-staked. However, the Shanghai hard fork planned for March will change that. Related Reading: These Altcoins Will Be Hit The Hardest If DCG And Grayscale Fall While the analyst expects a major unstaking initially, the upgrade could trigger massive growth for liquid staking solutions in the long run. And Lido Finance (LDO) is currently the undisputed leader in the liquid staking of ETH, providing further rocket fuel for the LDO token. Altcoins Poised To Skyrocket Based On The Narrative However, not only the LDO but rather small LSD altcoins could benefit from the new narrative. As anonymous analyst &#8220;Karl&#8221; says, numerous LSD solutions are poised to wobble at the throne of Lido Finance. Currently, LDO&#8217;s market share is about 65.62%, followed by Rocket Pool (3.10%), StakeWise (0.9%), Ankr (0.81%), Frax Finance (0.67%), and Stafi (0.25%). As the analyst assesses, the market caps of the altcoins Stakewise (SWISE) and Stafi (FIS) are still below $20 million, despite the fact that they control significant market share. &#8220;[T]heir tokenomics aren&#8217;t the best though, as there is still a considerable portion of the supply to be unlocked as team/investors&#8217; allocation and liquidity mining rewards,&#8221; the analyst added. A look at the market share/market cap ratio also shows that both SWISE and FIS tokens are close behind the market leader, poised for future gains. Also remarkable is Frax Finance, which recently entered the LSD landscape of altcoins and has already managed to capture a significant market share. Hartvigsen stated that in less than 2 months, Frax has managed to attract more than 45,000 ETH (about $55 million TVL). According to the analyst, there are &#8220;no signs of slowing down&#8221; as APRs are consistently at 9-10%, far outperforming any competitor. Frax Finance accomplishes this by giving users frxETH when they are either liquidity pooled on Curve (frxETH/ETH) or staked on Frax Finance (sfrxETH). Related Reading: Craziest Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2023, 1,400% Rally Possible? &#8220;Only sfrxETH receives the ETH staking yield. This results in a higher APR as not all of the staked ETH is receiving the rewards as they are in the curve pool instead,&#8221; the analyst explained. But Rocket Pool is also a prime candidate to grow from the new narrative due to its relative size, recent popularity growth, and several differentiators, Hartvigsen added. Two Potential Spoilers For LDO However, in the near term, there could be two spoilers in particular for the price of the Lido Finance token, LDO. Both Nansen and Chain EDGE on-chain data shows that &#8220;smart money&#8221; has been selling LDO rather than buying it, Twitter user @AvaxGems pointed out. I guess not all of us are bullish on LSD coins.

The ex-company of Sam Bankman-Fried sold 719,498 LDO on December 28, worth about $717,451, for 601 ETH, and currently still has 1.86 million LDO left, the equivalent of about $1.81 million.

<p>Also remarkable is Frax Finance, which recently entered the LSD landscape of altcoins and has already managed to capture a significant market share. Hartvigsen stated that in less than 2 months, Frax has managed to attract more than 45,000 ETH (about $55 million TVL).</p>
<p>According to the analyst, there are &#8220;no signs of slowing down&#8221; as APRs are consistently at 9-10%, far outperforming any competitor. Frax Finance accomplishes this by giving users frxETH when they are either liquidity pooled on Curve (frxETH/ETH) or staked on Frax Finance (sfrxETH).</p>

<p>&#8220;Only sfrxETH receives the ETH staking yield. This results in a higher APR as not all of the staked ETH is receiving the rewards as they are in the curve pool instead,&#8221; the analyst explained.</p>
<p>But Rocket Pool is also a prime candidate to grow from the new narrative due to its relative size, recent popularity growth, and several differentiators, Hartvigsen added.</p>
<h2>Two Potential Spoilers For LDO</h2>
<p>However, in the near term, there could be two spoilers in particular for the price of the Lido Finance token, LDO. Both Nansen and Chain EDGE on-chain data shows that &#8220;smart money&#8221; has been selling LDO rather than buying it, Twitter user @AvaxGems pointed out.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I guess not all of us are bullish on LSD coins. Both <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@nansen_ai</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChainEDGE_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@ChainEDGE_io</a>(by <a href="https://twitter.com/OnChainWizard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@OnChainWizard</a>) showing &quot;smart money&quot; been selling <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LDO&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$LDO</a> rather than buying. <a href="https://t.co/9k0nt0tHpG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/9k0nt0tHpG</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>A second factor for LDO could be <a href="https://newsbtc.com/ftx/can-ftt-hold-the-gains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alameda</a>. The ex-company of Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1607995876575969280" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold</a> 719,498 LDO on December 28, worth about $717,451, for 601 ETH, and currently still has 1.86 million LDO left, the equivalent of about $1.81 million.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows a Litecoin whale has withdrawn $32 million in LTC from Binance, a sign that could be positive for the latest rally. Litecoin Whale Takes Out $32M In LTC From Binance As per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive LTC transfer has taken place during the past day. In total, the transaction involved the movement of 425,660 LTC on the blockchain, worth around $32.1 million at the time of the transfer.

However, which way the price will respond to a transfer depends on the intent behind it. Here are a few additional details regarding the latest whale transaction that may shed some light on its purpose: Looks like this massive transfer only took a negligible fee of 0.00000224 LTC to be possible &#124; Source: Whale Alert As can be seen above, this Litecoin transaction was sent from a wallet attached to the crypto exchange Binance, and its destination was an unknown wallet. An unknown address is any address not affiliated with a known centralized platform and is thus likely to belong to a personal wallet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Can’t Give Any Clear Signals As Demand Remains Low Transfers of this nature, where coins move from exchanges to personal wallets, are called exchange outflows, and since holders usually withdraw from these platforms for accumulation purposes, outflows can have a bullish effect on the price. Here, the exchange outflow was done by a whale, so it may mean that this humongous investor is planning to hold onto their Litecoin for an extended period of time. In the few days since the new year has started, LTC has been rallying up with the coin already reclaiming $75, so the whale not selling here to take advantage of this profitable opportunity and instead opting to accumulate suggests conviction from the investor that there is more to come for LTC. There has also been another bullish signal for Litecoin recently, and it&#8217;s that the monthly LTC transactions on BitPay, the largest crypto payments processor, have gone up by 109% over the past year. This means that the network has observed some sharp growth in terms of adoption, a sign that should be constructive for the price in the long term.
