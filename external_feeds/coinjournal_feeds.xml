<li>Coinbase reported its second-quarter financial results on Thursday.</li>
<li>Berenberg analyst Mark Palmer sees downside in &ldquo;COIN&rdquo; to $39.</li>
<li>Coinbase stock has nearly tripled since the start of the year 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shares of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase Global Inc</a> wobbled but eventually ended flat in extended hours today even though the crypto exchange reported market-beating results for its fiscal second quarter.</p>
<h2>Why is Coinbase stock unimpressed in after-hours?</h2>
<p>The stock is primarily responding to weakness in transaction revenue that printed at $327 million &ndash; down nearly 13% sequentially. Trading volume also tanked to $92 million versus $145 million in the prior quarter.</p>
<p>Also a negative was interest income that declined about 17% on a quarter-over-quarter basis to $201 million. Reacting to the earnings print in an email, Mark Palmer &ndash; a Berenberg analyst wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interest income and staking revenue appear to be at risk going forward given the ongoing declines in USDC&rsquo;s market cap and regulatory challenges to staking programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>USDC holdings brought in $151 million in interest income to Coinbase in Q2.</p>
<h2>Notable figures in Coinbase Q2 earnings report</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lost $79 million versus the year-ago $430 million</li>
<li>Per-share loss also narrowed from $1.98 to 34 cents</li>
<li>Revenue tanked roughly 35% YoY to $773 million</li>
<li>Consensus was 76 cents loss on $628 million in sales</li>
<li>Subscription and services revenue printed at $335 million</li>
</ul>
<p>In June, Coinbase Global Inc was sued by the SEC that accused it of violating the U.S. securities laws (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/the-sec-strikes-again-first-binance-now-coinbase/">read more</a>).</p>
<h2>Should you buy Coinbase stock?</h2>
<p>Coinbase also revealed in a <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2023/Coinbase-Releases-Second-Quarter-2023-Shareholder-Letter/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter to shareholders</a> today that transaction revenue stood at $110 million in July.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange now forecasts at least $300 million in subscription and services revenue in its current financial quarter. According to Berenberg&rsquo;s Palmer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guidance was muted, and adjusted EBITDA print included a huge adjustment for stock-based compensation &ndash; an area management had said it would look to reduce.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that Palmer has a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-03/coinbase-share-price-rally-leaves-berenberg-calling-stock-uninvestable-coin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$39 price target</a> on Coinbase stock that warns of a more than 50% downside from here. In his own words, shares of the crypto company are uninvestable at least in the near term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">XDC is the best performer amongst the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap so far this week.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals has now raised more than $1.2 million in its second presale round.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been bearish so far this week, with the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies trading in the red zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, XDC is outperforming the market after adding more than 30% to its value since the start of the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, AltSignals&rsquo; stage two presale has surpassed the 50% point, with more than $1.2 million raised so far.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">XDC outperforms the broader crypto market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">XDC, the native coin of the XDC Network, is the best performer amongst the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap so far this week. The coin has added more than 30% to its value over the last few days. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/xdc-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of XDC</u></a> stands at $0.08069.</p>
<p dir="ltr">XDC&rsquo;s positive performance comes despite Bitcoin and the other leading cryptocurrencies underperforming. Bitcoin continues to trade just above $29k after dropping below that level earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The market&rsquo;s poor performance this week could serve as more buying opportunities for investors. XDC could be heading to the $0.09062 resistance level in the short term.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals&rsquo; second presale stage surpasses the 50% point</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the bearish trend in the market, the XDC presale has been going on smoothly. The second presale stage has now surpassed the 50% mark, with more than $1.2 million raised so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the first presale round, ASI, the native token of the&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> ecosystem, went for 0.015 USDT. The token is now selling for 0.01875 USDT in the second presale round.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The AltSignals team revealed that funds raised from the various presale rounds would be used to develop products for the users. AltSignals is a unique project that will use AI and blockchain technology to ease crypto trading and, in the process, help onboard more traders to the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to read more about the AltSignals presale.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is AltSignals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As a Web3 project, AltSignals is casting its net beyond the cryptocurrency space. This project targets traders in the broader financial markets, including crypto, forex, stocks, commodities, and indices traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals seeks to make it easier for traders to gain access to trading signals and other trading resources. With such tools, it will become easier for more people to trade cryptocurrencies and other financial assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The primary product of AltSignals will be ActualizeAI. ActualizeAI is an AI solution that will make it easier for people to trade cryptocurrencies and other financial assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As an automated solution, ActualizeAI will work 24/7, generating signals and helping traders to identify various patterns in the market. Thus, eliminating some of the obstacles traders face in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The AltSignals ecosystem will be powered by its native ASI token. According to the team,&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> will use blockchain technology, AI, natural language processing, machine learning, regression, and predictive modelling, to enhance its services.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once the presale stages are completed, ASI will be listed on various centralised and decentralised crypto trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals (ASI) price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">It is impossible to predict ASI&rsquo;s price at the moment since the token is still in its presale stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the end of the presale rounds, ASI will be listed on numerous cryptocurrency exchanges. This could boost ASI&rsquo;s price in the short to medium term.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to that, AltSignals&rsquo; adoption by traders could help push ASI&rsquo;s price higher in the coming months and years.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should I buy AltSignals now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> is still in its presale stage, and this could be the best time to invest in the project. Once the presale stages are over, the platform will become fully active, and AltSignals&rsquo; adoption could see its ASI price rally higher.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Projects have historically generated thousands of percentages in ROI to presale investors. AltSignals could gain massive adoption in the crypto space and beyond, and this could make it one of the leading Web3 projects in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin continues to trade below $30k, and market experts expect a further downward trend in the short term.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s presale has surpassed $1.1 million, with more than 21 million tokens sold so far.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin stays below $30k</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s number one cryptocurrency by market cap, has been underperforming since the start of the month. It is down by more than 1% over the past 24 hours and continues to trade below the $30k psychological level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the recent bearish trend, investors remain optimistic that a bullish cycle is on the horizon. This has seen more investment in cryptocurrency projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> has already raised over $1.1 million in its second presale stage with a target of $2 million.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Before you invest in the project, you need to understand what Chancer is and the utility it is presenting to web3 users.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is an exciting Web3 project that seeks to change the gambling and betting ecosystem. The team is developing a unique Web3 peer-to-peer (P2P) custom betting platform allowing users to live stream betting events.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ultimate goal of the team is to decentralise the betting industry.&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> will be a completely decentralised online gaming platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The biggest selling point of Chancer is that the betting options go beyond traditional sports and casino bets. With Chancer, users can bet on any event, even ones they make up themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the second presale stage, and Chancer has raised $1.1 million of the desired $2 million. So far, the team has sold more than 21 million CHANCER tokens, with 132 million tokens allocated for the entire 12 presale stages.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The developers will use the funds raised from the presale stages to build a P2P betting platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In their Whitepaper, the team said users can enjoy various benefits, including betting markets in real-time and based on user interests, social media connections, and expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer users would also be given the opportunity to set up their own custom P2P betting markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Chancer claims it wants to solve the problems associated with using bookmakers when betting. Users would be allowed to set up their custom P2P betting markets.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s second presale is 50% completed</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s presale event will occur in stages, and the second one is more than 50% completed. In the second presale stage, Chancer has raised $1.1 million so far, with less than $900k left to raise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funds generated from the presale will be used to develop Chancer&rsquo;s suite of products. Chancer intends to carry out 12 presale events, with a target of $15 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s native token, CHANCER, is currently sold for $0.011, with the price set to increase to $0.012 in the next presale round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token will power several activities on the Chancer platforms. Token holders can create markets and invest in markets created by other users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the token would allow users to create, participate in, and profit from their very own predictive markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the moment, investors can purchase CHANCER tokens by connecting their Web3 wallets to the Chancer website. Some of the supported wallets include Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer website</u></a> to get more information about the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Chancer today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chancer</a> could be an exciting project for investors due to the team&rsquo;s desire to decentralise the betting industry. With the right adoption, Chancer could become a multi-billion dollar platform in the medium to long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A surge in Chancer&rsquo;s adoption could push its token price higher over the coming months and years. Furthermore, CHANCER&rsquo;s price could rally higher if the market embarks on a bull run.</p>

<li>The Bridgecoin Capital lending platform will lend customers&rsquo; crypto into traditional real estate assets.</li>
<li>The new lending platform enables investors to defer their crypto gains tax, while simultaneously diversifying their portfolio and generating passive income.</li>
<li>Bridgecoin Capital has been pursuing the integration of blockchain technology into the commercial real estate space since 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bridgecoin Capital has today launched its lending platform, the first of its kind to lend customers&rsquo; cryptocurrencies into conventional real estate assets.</p>
<p>This innovative model is the first tax-effective way to preserve wealth in the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/blockchain/">blockchain industry</a>, by creating a partnership between real estate and cryptocurrency experts. The platform will defer crypto capital gains by using real estate to both defer taxes and diversify customer portfolios.</p>
<h2>Deferring crypto capital gains</h2>
<p>The real estate market is estimated to be worth over $3 trillion, whereas the cryptocurrency market is worth over $500 billion. However, there were significant tax repercussions for capital gains due to the $163 billion that investors made during the most recent crypto bull run.</p>
<p>Billions were also lost to taxes by crypto whales, institutional investors, accredited investors, and anyone else with gains.</p>
<p>To help crypto investors (click here for more on&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/invest/">how to invest in crypto</a>) from losing money through capital gains, Bridgecoin Capital has created a fully regulated process that enables a customer to borrow money against their cryptocurrency holdings without paying capital gains tax, and then invest that money in interest-bearing real estate deals.</p>
<p>The Bridgecoin platform is marketed as a regulation-focused design that offers users access to features like tax and interest payments. Its lending and lockup structure is simple and required customers to submit to KYC.</p>
<p>The Bridgecoin lending platform loans are collateralized meaning the return is fixed in terms of the USD repaid after the lockup period and the APY provided throughout the process.</p>

<li>The Curve founder had taken a $100 million DeFi stablecoin loan using his own CRV stash as collateral.</li>
<li>Curve Finance was recently hacked causing the CRV token to depreciate significantly.</li>
<li>The Huobi co-founder has locked up the tokens as veCRV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jun Du, the co-founder of Huobi has bought 10 million Curve Dao tokens Michael Egorov, the Curve founder who is trying to reduce his exposed stablecoin loan positions.</p>
<p>Egorov has so far paid back over $17 million of his stablecoin loans, which has slightly improved the health of the loans as a whole. The DeFi founder, however, still has a heavy debt load, with about $60 million in stablecoins owed on Aave, $12 million on Abracadabra, and about $8 million on Inverse. To add salt to injury, Abracadabra Money has proposed increasing the interest rate on its outstanding loans in order to reduce the risks related to its exposure to Curve DAO (CRV).</p>
<p>Jun Du announced his intention to purchase 10 million CRV tokens in an <a href="https://twitter.com/DujunX/status/1686296439876648960">initial tweet</a> on August 1 at the market price of $0.40, which was established through a number of over-the-counter transactions involving Egorov and several members of the crypto community. In a direct message on Twitter Du confirmed that the purchase was successful and that he had made the decision to lock up the tokens as veCRV.</p>
<p>By locking up the tokens, Jun Du is entitled to voting rights on the Curve platform.</p>
<h2>Curve Finance liquidity crisis</h2>
<p>Curve protocol was exploited on July 30, resulting in a 30% crash in <a href="https://coinjournal.net/curve-dao/">CRV token price</a>.</p>
<p>Jun Du&rsquo;s move was in support of Curve protocol which is in a liquidity crisis after the July 30 exploit. Du drew comparisons to his earlier assistance during BendDAO&rsquo;s liquidity crisis. He emphasised that the current Curve difficulties were temporary and that the industry would profit from support from all sides.</p>
<p>Notably, Du is the co-founder and general partner (GP) of the web3 fund ABCDE in addition to being the CEO of New Huo Tech, a platform for the service of digital assets.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Binance has added zero-fee trading for BTC/FDUSD and ETH/FDUSD pairs.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Trading for the two pairs opens at 08:00 UTC on August 4, 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Binance has <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1686951733803769856" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> trading support for the First Digital USD (FUSD) stablecoin against both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The exchange, the world&rsquo;s largest by trading volume, will also provide zero-fee spot and margin trading for the two pairs &ndash; BTC/FDUSD and ETH/FDUSD.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BNB discounts will not apply&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to a notice published August 3, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> is adding the zero maker and taker fees feature for the BTC/FDUSD pair via its Zero-Fee Bitcoin Trading Program. This feature is effective at 08:00 UTC on August 4, 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>During the promotion period, trading volume on the BTC/FDUSD spot and margin trading pairs will be excluded from the VIP tier volume calculation and all Liquidity Providers program. BNB discounts, referral rebates, and any other adjustments will not apply to the BTC/FDUSD spot and margin trading pairs during the promotion</em>,&rdquo; Binance announced.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, customers will benefit from zero maker fee for ETH/FDUSD via the FDUSD Zero Maker Fee Promotion and the standard taker fee, with this applicable as per a user&rsquo;s VIP level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance&rsquo;s conditions for the promotion include the exchange&rsquo;s &ldquo;right to disqualify trades that are deemed to be wash trades or illegally bulk registered accounts.&rdquo; The company also reserves the right to disqualify trades deemed to be market manipulation or self-dealing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The introduction of zero-fee trading for BTC/FDUSD comes a few months after Binance ended the zero-fee trading for BTC. The exchange also halted the zero-maker fee program for the stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD), with the promotion opening for TrueUSD (TUSD).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The exchange&rsquo;s overall <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/is-binances-dominance-falling/">market dominance suffered a blip</a> following these moves, with market share and trading volume shrinking by as much as 50%. The outlook also impacted crypto prices as liquidity shrunk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is still trading around $29k per coin and could dip lower in the near term.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has hit %1.5 million after selling more than 52 million SHMU tokens.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has been underperforming in recent weeks, down from the $31k level it achieved last month. The world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap is struggling around the $29k region, and market experts believe it could dip lower in the near term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu has continued to set new records with its presale despite the bearish market conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BItcoin Stays Around $29k</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been bearish since the start of the month. The prices of most cryptocurrencies are trading in the red zone despite the positive performance recorded earlier this week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has lost more than 1% of its value so far this week and is now trading at $29,119 per coin. Ether, Dogecoin, Solana, XRP, and other leading cryptocurrencies are all down by more than 2% so far this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the bearish trend,&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu&rsquo;s</u></a> presale continues to set new records. The team has raised more than $1.5 million so far, with more than 52 million tokens sold.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is an exciting project in the cryptocurrency space that seeks to combine the powers of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. With the rise of AI, their applications have become vast globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is a project that wants to leverage AI and blockchain to make it easier for people and organisations to create content and roll out marketing campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In their whitepaper, the team explained that Shiba Memu could handle the task of numerous marketing agencies. As an AI tool, Shiba Memu is always active and will work 24/7 to find the best work going on in creative advertising, consuming it and generating better content marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea to launch as a meme token has to do with the recent popularity of meme projects in the cryptocurrency space. Within the space of two years, the market cap of meme coins grew from practically $0 to $20 billion in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, what makes Shiba Memu different from other meme token projects is that it has an excellent use case. Shiba Memu can be regarded as a self-sufficient marketing tool powered by AI technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu can be able to create marketing strategies, roll out PR schedules, and promote campaigns on relevant forums and social media platforms. At the moment, Shiba Memu is available on the Ethereum and BNBChain blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale hits $1.5M</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has been going on excellently despite the bearish trend in the market. The presale has been around for roughly a month now, and the team has raised $1.5 million so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Shiba Memu project has sold over 52 million SHMU tokens to raise $1.5 million. The team intends to use the funds to develop some of its products and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, most of the funds generated in the presale would be directed towards developing the Shiba Memu AI technology. By leveraging AI technology, Shiba Memu can provide exciting marketing services to its users.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Shiba Memu platform would also have a robotastic dashboard, allowing users to interact with the AI, provide feedback, make suggestions, and ask questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to find out more about Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Predicting Shiba Memu&rsquo;s price would be impossible at the moment since the SHMU token is still in its presale stage. At the moment, 1 SHMU = 0.017650 USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the team, SHMU&rsquo;s price increases every day at 6 pm GMT. In a few hours, the token will go for 0.017875 USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">SHMU began trading at $0.011125 when the presale began and will trade at $0.0244 when the presale ends. The SHMU token can be purchased using Ethereum, USDT, BNB and BUSD</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you buy Shiba Memu today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu could be an excellent project for investors to get into. The fact that it is still in its early stage means that it could generate impressive ROI for investors in the medium to long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a project,&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is combining AI and blockchain technology, making it an interesting meme token. With the right level of adoption, SHMU&rsquo;s price could rally over the next few months and years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to that, a Bull Run by the broader crypto market could see SHMU&rsquo;s price also rally higher. So far, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are up by over 40% year-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A combination of excellent adoption and a Bull Run by the broader crypto market could make SHMU one of the best performers in the market over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Bank of England delivered another interest rate hike.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The BTC/GBP and GBP/USD pair diverged after the report.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It has formed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The BTC to GBP pair moved sideways after the latest Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision.&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> was trading at &pound;23,000 on Thursday, where it has been in the past few days. This price is about 7.2% below the highest level this month. On the other hand, the GBP/USD pair slipped to a low of 1.2625, the lowest level since June 30th.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bank of England decision</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The BTC/GBP pair moved sideways after the latest interest rate decision by the BoE. In a statement, the bank decided to hike interest rates again by 0.25% to a 15-year high of 5.25%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The committee did that in a bid to fight the elevated inflation. In a statement, Governor Andrew Bailey said that the hike was necessary to combat the stubbornly high inflation. In a statement, he said:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Inflation is falling and that&rsquo;s good news. We know that inflation hits the least well-off hardest and we need to make sure that it falls all the way back to the 2% target. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve raised rates to 5.25% today.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most recent data showed that the headline consumer inflation dropped from 8.3% in May to 7.9% in June while wage growth jumped by 7.7%. There are signs that the British economy is slowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, data published this week by Nationwide showed that the country&rsquo;s house price index plunged at the fastest pace in over a decade. Still, the bank believes that the UK will narrowly avoid a recession this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW<a href="https://twitter.com/bankofengland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bankofengland</a> raises interest rates for 14th successive meeting: up by 0.25 percentage points to 5.25%.<br>&ndash; UK to avoid recession but economy effectively flatlining with 3yrs of near-zero growth, acc to Bank forecasts.<br>&ndash; Rates to stay high for a long time, Bank signals</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin reacts moderately to the actions of central banks like the Bank of England (BoE), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). It also reacted mildly to actions of the Federal Reserve, which delivered its last rate hike of the year.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BTC/GBP technical analysis</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/03/1691063115996-14149ed5-adb7-4bbd-ba85-0d220fa5aef5.png" style="width: 674px;height: 328.013px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="674" height="328.013"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the BTC/GBP pair rose to a key resistance level at 24,711 in July. This was an important price since it was the highest point in April. A closer look shows that the pair has formed a bullish flag pattern. Also, it has risen above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, the BTC to GBP price will likely have a bullish breakout in the coming weeks. If this happens, the next level to watch will be at 24,711.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Crypto volumes are sagging amid summer lull</li>
<li>In dollar terms, the amount of Bitcoin moving on-chain is at three-year lows</li>
<li>Trading activity commonly dies down in trad-fi markets at this time of year</li>
<li>However, falling crypto volumes have been realised consistently over the last year, while the dropoff has been starker than other asset classes</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">On-chain activity is rather muted right now. The seven-day moving average of transfer volume on the Bitcoin network is currently at its lowest level since August 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the one hand, the falling volume represents a traditional summer lag in trading activity. However, the lowly activity is not far out of place with what we have seen thus far this year, with liquidity and volume markedly lower since the FTX collapse in November.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/03/1691057120161-9bd05263-ea7e-4196-b3d0-eca6843e3f32.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="337">Looking at dollar volume, as per the above chart, also takes into account the rampant volatility in the BTC/USD price over the years. If we assess activity in BTC terms, the dropoff is even more stark. Measuring in Bitcoin, the seven-day moving average is it at its lowest point since 2014, when Bitcoin was a niche Internet asset trading for a few hundred dollars. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/03/1691057068177-32e6a204-4dd2-4c2d-a045-d1fb1f4b7c36.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="337">The dropoff is not limited to Bitcoin. Crypto exchanges have seen volume decimated in the last couple of years. According to data from the Block, there was $984 billion of trading volume in March 2022. Last month, that figure read $413 billion, a fall of 58%. The chart shows the aggressive spike up in 2021, followed by a long and steady downtrend to today.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/03/1691057183785-4b6c74fd-85c0-455f-9f63-7db43ff728a9.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="314">This follows in line with the shift in monetary policy. The $984 billion of trading volume in March 2022 came in the same month that the Federal Reserve first hiked rates. Since then, the increases have come thick and fast, with investors dumping risk assets relentlessly. </p>
<p dir="ltr">While there has been a bounceback this year as inflation has cooled and optimism over the end of the tightening cycle approaching picks up, prices remain far below the peaks of 2021. So too do volumes, liquidity and overall activity in the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14565862">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The pace of interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve has been relentless&rdquo;, says Max Coupland, director of CoinJournal. &ldquo;This impacted risk assets across the financial landscape last year, and of course crypto prices are an obvious reminder of this. But while prices have begun to bounce back in 2023, volumes and liquidity in the industry are still trending down, to the point we are now at levels last seen in 2020&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s hard to understate how much of an impact the collapse of FTX in November had in this area. Sister firm of the fallen exchange, Alameda Research, was one of the biggest market makers in the space; with its demise, there is a massive hole in order books that has not yet been filled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other big push factor for many has been regulation. We saw prominent market makers Jump Crypto and Jane Street <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-liquidity-falling-as-market-makers-pull-back-from-hostile-us-market/"><u>announce a scaling back</u></a> of their operations earlier this year as US lawmakers put the squeeze on the industry, while last month both Binance and Coinbase were sued by the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On a positive note, derivatives have not seen quite as stark a dropoff in liquidity. Looking at data from The Block, we see the spot-to-futures volume ratio has fallen sharply in 2023, having risen in the second half of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/03/1691057253895-6d89a4df-92bc-4fbf-9599-17428125d51c.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="314">However, there is no denying that on an overall basis, liquidity and volume in the space are declining. Prices remain far below the mania of the bull market, regulators are squeezing hard, and people are now going outside to touch grass, in contrast to a big portion of the bull market when the COVID pandemic locked everybody in without much to do beyond trade some of these funny things called caryptocurrencies. </p>
<p dir="ltr">There is also the reputational damage suffered by the space, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel too outlandish to speculate that some users simply grew tired of all the shenanigans. But while Bitcoin transfer volume falling to three-year lows is ominous, this is the middle of summer and hence a lag in activity is to be expected. As a result, we may see volumes pick up a tad after summer. Even if this is the case, the scale of the capital outflow has been remarkable, and crypto has a long way to go yet before getting back to the good old days, a.k.a. 2021 &ndash; at least as far as liquidity and on-chain volume goes. &nbsp;</p>
