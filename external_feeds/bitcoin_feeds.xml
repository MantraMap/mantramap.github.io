<h2>Lawmaker Wants SEC Chair Gensler to Testify Regarding Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) wants the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, to testify before Congress about his failures, particularly in regulating the crypto industry. The congressman from Minnesota tweeted Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gensler has repeatedly dodged Congress at the expense of investors … leaving us to learn about the SEC&#8217;s crypto investigations, like the one into FTX, through the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>He noted that the SEC chief &#8220;hasn&#8217;t publicly appeared before the House Financial Services since October 5, 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emmer, who chairs the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, described in a different tweet that his team &#8220;received info from several sources … that Gary Gensler&#8217;s efforts to gather info on crypto companies were not targeted, intentional, or clear; rather, the SEC&#8217;s requests were haphazard and unfocused.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawmaker emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>We now know Gensler&#8217;s crypto information-gathering efforts were ineffective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rep. Emmer explained that he previously sent Gensler a letter requesting information about how the securities watchdog plans to regulate the crypto sector. However, he said the SEC chief &#8220;declined to provide Congress with the information requested in the letter, which would&#8217;ve informed Congress of the apparent inconsistencies in Gensler&#8217;s approach that caused him to miss Terra/Luna, Celsius, Voyager, and FTX.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emmer concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gary Gensler must testify before Congress and answer questions about the cost of his regulatory failures.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lawmaker has repeatedly criticized Gensler and his enforcement-centric approach to crypto regulation. In June he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-slams-sec-for-not-regulating-in-good-faith-under-chair-gensler-sec-has-become-power-hungry/">said</a>: &#8220;Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has become a power-hungry regulator, politicizing enforcement, baiting companies to &#8216;come in and talk&#8217; to the Commission, then hitting them with enforcement actions, discouraging good-faith cooperation.&#8221; Last month, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-accuse-gary-gensler-of-hypocritical-mismanagement-of-sec-chairman-refuses-to-practice-what-he-preaches/">said</a>: &#8220;Chair Gensler&#8217;s regime at the SEC has been characterized by regulatory hypocrisy and inconsistency. Unacceptable that Gary Gensler doesn&#8217;t hold himself to the same transparency standards that he places on the private sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>The securities regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">announced</a> Tuesday that it has charged FTX and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) with &#8220;orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors.&#8221;</p>

<h2>SDNY Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and Attorney Williams Charge SBF With 8 Financial Crimes</h2>
<p>A federal grand jury in Manhattan unsealed an indictment on Dec. 13, 2022, tied to the disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), and the SDNY Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ftx-founder-indicted-fraud-money-laundering-and-campaign-finance-offenses">press release</a> details detail that SBF is accused of “conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission and commit campaign finance violations.”</p>
<p>The SDNY DOJ <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/kxfZltq/unsealed-indictment-in-us-v-bankman-fried-22-cr-673-abrams-as-sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-heads-to-sdny-echoes-of-onecoin-and-un-bribery-cases-pdf">indictment</a> says SBF is facing up to 165 years in prison and investigators note that since 2019, “Bankman-Fried and his co-conspirators perpetrated a scheme to defraud customers of FTX by misappropriating billions of dollars of those customers’ funds.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the DOJ claims that SBF “allegedly used billions of dollars of FTX customer funds for his personal use, to make investments and millions of dollars of political contributions to federal political candidates and committees.” The news stemming from the DOJ’s Manhattan team follows the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charges levied against SBF</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-follows-sec-by-filing-a-lawsuit-against-disgraced-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">lawsuit filed</a> by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>Both the SEC and CFTC charges detail that SBF and FTX executives allegedly committed fraud since day one. SDNY attorney Damian Williams said in a statement on Tuesday that he believes the fraud was downright intentional. “One month ago, FTX collapsed, causing billions of dollars in losses to its customers, lenders, and investors,” said U.S. attorney Williams in the DOJ press release. Williams added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, a federal grand jury in New York has indicted the former founder and chief executive officer of FTX and charged him with crimes related to the phenomenal downfall of that one-time cryptocurrency exchange, including fraud on customers, investors, lenders, and our campaign finance system. As today’s charges make clear, this was not a case of mismanagement or poor oversight, but of intentional fraud, plain and simple.</p></blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, in the SEC, CFTC, and SDNY DOJ charges, Sam Bankman-Fried is the only person charged besides his companies, and ex-Alameda executive <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/alameda-research-ceo-caroline-ellison-reportedly-spotted-at-a-coffee-shop-in-manhattan-with-ftx-dog-gopher/">Caroline Ellison</a> is not named. Moreover, there have been <a href="https://twitter.com/Viking4Eth/status/1602450088822964229?s=20&amp;t=fl5UHYvZc3-Z1YYHw2LcYA">rumors</a> and <a href="https://www.gawker.com/money/it-sure-looks-like-caroline-ellison-snitched?utm_campaign=gawker&amp;utm_content=1670951760&amp;utm_medium=owned&amp;utm_source=twitter">theories</a> that Ellison may have <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1602359732555157505?s=20&amp;t=fl5UHYvZc3-Z1YYHw2LcYA">snitched</a> on SBF. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/LJMoynihan/status/1602753039638867969?s=20&amp;t=fl5UHYvZc3-Z1YYHw2LcYA">reports</a>, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorney also claimed SBF has &#8220;suffered from depression, insomnia, and ADD for over a decade,&#8221; and his legal team would like SBF to be released on bail.</p>
<p>In the SDNY DOJ press statement on Tuesday, the FBI’s assistant director of the FBI New York Field Office, Michael J. Driscoll, warned other financial operations that if they “deceive and defraud&#8221; customers, the &#8220;FBI will be persistent in our efforts to bring you to justice.” Reuters further <a href="https://twitter.com/ReutersLegal/status/1602784389250789376?s=20&amp;t=kpmelH-YXpbMSAigsC3-Jw">reported</a> on Tuesday, that despite SBF&#8217;s alleged mental ailments, the Bahamian magistrate in charge of his case denied the FTX co-founder&#8217;s bail. &#8220;Bankman-Fried to be sent to the Bahamas Department of Correction till Feb. 8, [the] judge says,&#8221; Reuters disclosed.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the press statement from the SDNY prosecutor&#8217;s office concerning the charges against SBF? What do you think about the Bahamian judge denying SBF bail? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The CFTC alleges that FTX customer deposits, “throughout the relevant period,” including both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, were reportedly “appropriated by Alameda for its own use.”</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission: &#8216;FTX and Alameda Comingled, Mishandled, and Misappropriated FTX Trading Customer Funds&#8217; From Day One</h2>
<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a lawsuit (Case 1:22-cv-10503) against SBF and his companies FTX and Alameda Research. The lawsuit claims that “at Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives created features in the underlying code for FTX that allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX.”</p>

<p>The CFTC alleges that SBF and his inner circle “took hundreds of millions of dollars” in loans from Alameda and used the funds for Bahamian real estate, “political donations, and for other unauthorized uses.”</p>
<p>The CFTC’s court filing insists:</p>
<blockquote><p>Through this conduct and the conduct further described herein, [the] defendants violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. commodities regulator is seeking “civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief.” Furthermore, like the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">SEC charges</a>, the CFTC wants SBF banned from trading activities. The CFTC believes it has jurisdiction over SBF, as Bankman-Fried is a U.S. citizen who has resided in various locations worldwide. SBF and his companies have conducted business dealings in the U.S. as well for a “relevant period,” the CFTC court document declares. For instance, Alameda Research is a Delaware limited liability company registered in the United States.</p>
<p>“The FTX Enterprise failed to observe corporate formalities, including failure to segregate funds, operations, resources, and personnel, or to properly document intercompany transfers or funds and other resources,” the CFTC lawsuit alleges. “The entities regularly shared office space, systems, accounts, and communications channels. On information and belief, assets flowed freely between the FTX Enterprise entities, often without documentation or effective tracking,” the court document adds.</p>
<p>The U.S. CFTC court document further states:</p>
<blockquote><p>FTX and Alameda comingled, mishandled, and misappropriated FTX Trading customer funds from the moment of FTX’s launch.</p></blockquote>

<p>The recently published <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charges</a> stemming from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 13, also indicate that the SEC believes the FTX fraud began from day one. The SEC charges are similar to the CFTC’s lawsuit, as both complaints note that Alameda allegedly had an &#8220;unlimited&#8221; line of credit that derived from FTX and essentially customer funds. In addition to the CFTC, the Southern District of New York’s Attorney’s office <a href="https://www.law360.com/fintech/articles/1557724?nl_pk=0b77fccb-222a-45c3-854e-51f93de7b80a&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=fintech&amp;utm_content=1557724&amp;read_more=1&amp;nlsidx=0&amp;nlaidx=0">indicted</a> SBF with eight counts of financial crimes charges.</p>

The lawyers detailed that it was a “request for live, dynamic access that would be provided immediately to the government of the Bahamas and to Messrs.”</strong></p>
<h2>Government of Bahamas Accused of Getting Special Treatment From Disgraced FTX Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>
<p>Following Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrest</a> in The Bahamas, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charged</a> SBF with fraud over the FTX collapse. Furthermore, reports show that the Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutor&#8217;s office and SDNY attorney Damian Williams have charged SBF with crimes as well.</p>
<p>“The Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office on Tuesday unsealed an eight-count indictment charging disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried with a multi-year scheme to siphon money out of the now-collapsed crypto exchange,” law360.com court reporter Rachel Scharf <a href="https://www.law360.com/fintech/articles/1557724?nl_pk=0b77fccb-222a-45c3-854e-51f93de7b80a&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=fintech&amp;utm_content=1557724&amp;read_more=1&amp;nlsidx=0&amp;nlaidx=0">disclosed</a> on Tuesday. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/65748821/ftx-trading-ltd-and-the-financial-times-ltd/">court documents</a> from the FTX Chapter 11 bankruptcy case indicate that the joint provisional liquidators of FTX Digital Markets <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.213.0.pdf">filed a motion</a> to dismiss the Chapter 11 case of FTX Property Holdings LTD.</p>
<p>Lawyers have also accused the government of The Bahamas of asking SBF to mint new digital tokens worth millions of U.S. dollars. The tokens were allegedly given to Bahamian officials, FTX’s legal team said. FTX’s new CEO John J. Ray III and his team noticed that new tokens were being issued and suspected that SBF and FTX co-founder Gary Wang were the executives who worked on orders stemming from Bahamian officials. The news follows the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-odd-relationship-with-vertical-farming-firms-a-look-at-exchange-boss-ryan-salames-and-bahamian-pm-philip-davis-trip-to-80-acres/">odd relationship</a> FTX officials like exchange boss Ryan Salame had with vertical farming firms.</p>
<p>Ryan Salame and Bahamian prime minister (PM) Philip Davis visited Ohio to tour a business called 80 Acres Farms in Jan. 2022. Furthermore, during his <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXxyvQZzdnKM?s=20">interview</a> with Mario Nawfal’s Twitter Spaces crew, FTX co-founder SBF admitted that withdrawals to Bahamian residents took place before FTX fully collapsed, and possibly on two occasions. SBF also described giving Bahamian withdrawals the green light in his two-part interview with Tiffany Fong (<a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1597627998626160640?s=20&amp;t=TF6piT3mkK8UXPgRnFVuZA">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1597668636998914049?s=20&amp;t=TF6piT3mkK8UXPgRnFVuZA">here</a>). FTX’s American attorney detailed this week that SBF negotiated with the Bahamian government and $100 million a day in withdrawals was allegedly permitted by SBF.</p>

<p>Discussing the minting of new crypto tokens for the Bahamian government, the lawyers claim SBF and Gary Wang worked with the officials very closely before the bankruptcy filing on Nov. 11, 2022. “It is a request for live, dynamic access that would be provided immediately to the government of the Bahamas and to Messrs. Samuel Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, who are located in the Bahamas and working closely with Bahamian officials,” the FTX lawyers said in the court filing.</p>
<p>After the allegations, the <a href="https://twitter.com/sctbofficial">Securities Commission of The Bahamas</a> issued a statement and wholeheartedly denied FTX CEO John Ray’s allegations published in the court filings. The Bahamas regulator said the accusations are meant &#8220;to create a false impression of communications between Mr. Bankman-Fried and the Commission.&#8221;</p>

On Dec. 12, 2022, Reuters reported that U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors have been investigating Binance, according to four people familiar with the matter. Moreover, while a number of crypto assets have risen in value this past week, Binance&#x2019;s exchange token has slid roughly 6.9% against the U.S. dollar over the last seven days.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Takes a Hit from the Speculation Surrounding the World&#x2019;s Largest Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>This week, Binance is dealing with a lot of rumors, speculation, and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) following the aftermath of the recent FTX collapse. Across social media, there&#x2019;s been speculation concerning Binance&#x2019;s proof-of-reserves (POR) and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-and-crypto-com-publish-proof-of-reserve-audits-conducted-by-global-auditor-mazars-group/">criticism</a> against the company&#x2019;s POR efforts.</p>
<p>On Dec. 13, Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602590863451889665?s=20&t=BqP4p1pHamB0jY8M9Yl1vg">addressed</a> the FUD on Twitter. &#x201C;FUD helps us grow, even though they are thoroughly annoying,&#x201D; CZ tweeted. &#x201C;You can FUD about someone without explicitly mentioning their name, which spreads awareness. It also helps unite their supporters because it forms a common defense alliance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>CZ <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602590865523892225?s=20&t=BqP4p1pHamB0jY8M9Yl1vg">insisted</a> that since day one, Binance was relentlessly targeted with FUD &#x2014; some of which was allegedly sponsored by a large exchange. &#x201C;Since then, there has hardly been a week going by without some FUD. We learned the ability to ignore them and keep building,&#x201D; CZ added in his Twitter thread.</p>

<p>CZ&#x2019;s commentary follows the Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-justice-dept-is-split-over-charging-binance-crypto-world-falters-sources-2022-12-12/">report</a> published on Dec. 12, which claims the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has been investigating Binance. Reuters reported on Monday that four people familiar with the matter explained that DOJ prosecutors are at odds about the alleged investigation. The reported split between DOJ prosecutors is &#x201C;delaying the conclusion of a long-running <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-us-sought-records-binance-ceo-crypto-money-laundering-probe-2022-09-01/">criminal investigation</a>&#x201D; into Binance, Reuters reporter Angus Berwick wrote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Binance&#x2019;s exchange token <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> has taken a big hit from the speculation and FUD surrounding the world&#x2019;s largest crypto exchange. The crypto exchange token <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> has lost 8.5% in value during the last two weeks.</p>

<p>Seven-day stats show <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> shed more than 8% against the greenback but since the recent U.S. inflation data was published on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> is now only down 6.9% against the U.S. dollar. The trend is the opposite of what leading cryptos like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> have done as both coins increased in value between 5-7% higher on Tuesday morning (9 a.m. ET).</p>

<p>Despite the significant losses this week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> has outperformed crypto assets like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> in terms of losses from the all-time highs posted last year. For instance, despite <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s rise today, the leading crypto asset is still down &#x200B;&#x200B;74% from the all-time high (ATH) last year. Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) is down 72% from last year&#x2019;s ATH, but Binance&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> is only down 60.8% since the crypto asset&#x2019;s $686 per unit price high printed on May 10, 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the speculation and rumors surrounding Binance? What do you think about <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>&#x2019;s recent market performance this week? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below. </strong></em></p>

Consumer prices rose to 7.1% in November, which was lower than the 7.3% markets had expected. The figure was also 0.6% lower than October&#x2019;s reading of 7.7%. Litecoin also rebounded on the data, rising by over 6%.</strong></p>
<h2>Avalanche (AVAX)</h2>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) was a notable gainer on Tuesday, as prices surged following the release of U.S. inflation figures.</p>
<p>November&#x2019;s consumer price index (CPI) came in at 7.1%, which was lower than the 7.3% traders were expecting.</p>
<p>As a result, AVAX/USD rallied to an intraday high of $14.09, which saw prices up by nearly 10%.</p>

<p>Today&#x2019;s rise saw avalanche hit its strongest point since December 5, which was the last time the token was trading above its ceiling at $13.75.</p>
<p>The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, breaking out of a resistance point of 51.50 in the process.</p>
<p>Gains in AVAX have eased from earlier highs, and as of writing the token is trading at $13.94.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) also rose in today&#x2019;s session, with the token rebounding from its losses to start the week.</p>
<p>Following a drop to $73.52, which was the lowest level <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD had hit since November 29, the token raced to a high of $79.52 earlier today.</p>
<p>This surge in price sent litecoin to its strongest point since December 7, which is the last time price was above $80.00.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s bullish momentum comes as the RSI bounced from a floor of 55.50, and it is now nearing a ceiling of 61.50.</p>
<p>This move has also sent the 10-day (red) moving average higher, a day after it appeared to be certainly heading for a downwards trend.</p>
<p>What happens on Wednesday with the U.S. Federal Reserve will now dictate how cryptocurrency prices will move during the run-up to the Christmas period.</p>

SEC chairman Gary Gensler explained that the U.S. financial regulator alleges that SBF “built a house of cards on a foundation of deception.”</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. SEC Contends Former FTX CEO SBF Committed Fraud, Crypto Firms Warned the &#8216;Sec’s Enforcement Division Is Ready to Take Action&#8217;</h2>
<p>Following the arrest of the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) in The Bahamas, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219">revealed charges</a> against the FTX co-founder. The SEC complaint contends that “Bankman-Fried orchestrated a years-long fraud to conceal from FTX’s investors” the undisclosed funneling of customer funds from FTX to Alameda Research. This includes providing Alameda “with a virtually unlimited ‘line of credit’ funded by the platform’s customers.”</p>
<p>In addition to the SEC, on Dec. 12, 2022, after SBF was arrested, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-bahamas.html">report</a> detailed that the Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutors office and SDNY attorney Damian Williams have confirmed SBF was charged. The report noted that SBF’s charges included “wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering.”</p>
<p>“Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY,” Williams <a href="https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1602451395910803457?s=20&amp;t=2v_RdZlAkJdjNm-j89IJNw">disclosed</a> on Twitter. “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.” In the press release published by the SEC, chairman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-accuse-gary-gensler-of-hypocritical-mismanagement-of-sec-chairman-refuses-to-practice-what-he-preaches/">Gary Gensler</a> explained that the U.S. regulator believes SBF is responsible for defrauding investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,&#8221; Gensler remarked in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws,&#8221; Gensler continued. &#8220;Compliance protects both those who invest on and those who invest in crypto platforms with time-tested safeguards, such as properly protecting customer funds and separating conflicting lines of business. It also shines a light into trading platform conduct for both investors through disclosure and regulators through examination authority.”</p>
<p>Gensler further added a warning for other crypto platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>To those platforms that don’t comply with our securities laws, the SEC’s Enforcement Division is ready to take action.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC charges follow the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-discusses-crypto-regulation-following-ftx-collapse-says-this-field-is-significantly-non-compliant/">controversy</a> that surrounded Gensler and his meeting with Sam Bankman-Fried on March 29. Congressman Tom Emmer explained in a tweet that his office received reports that the SEC chairman allegedly helped SBF with legal loopholes. Yet a contradictory view of the meeting reported on by Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino claims that Gensler gave SBF a “45-minute lecture.” Gasparino alleged that Gensler made no promises to SBF, and “ordered [FTX] to provide much more in the way of disclosure etc to the SEC about their model.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-regulator-cftc-met-with-sam-bankman-fried-10-times-before-crypto-exchange-ftx-collapsed/">told the press</a> that the CFTC met with SBF roughly ten times before FTX collapsed. The director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, Gurbir S. Grewal, stressed that “Bankman-Fried [is] responsible for fraudulently raising billions of dollars from investors in FTX and misusing funds belonging to FTX’s trading customers.&#8221; The fraud, Grewal said, was painted as legitimate, and the SEC alleges that the perception of legitimacy was the furthest from the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr. Bankman-Fried created by, among other things, touting its best-in-class controls, including a proprietary ‘risk engine,’ and FTX’s adherence to specific investor protection principles and detailed terms of service,” Grewal detailed. “But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.”</p>

<p>According to the SEC, SBF is also being charged by other law enforcement officials and financial regulators in the United States. This includes the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The ongoing investigation will be conducted by members of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.</p>
<p>“The SEC’s complaint seeks injunctions against future securities law violations; an injunction that prohibits Bankman-Fried from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, except for his own personal account; disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains; a civil penalty; and an officer and director bar,” the SEC’s charges against SBF conclude.</p>

Ethereum was also higher in today&#x2019;s session, as prices neared the $1,300 mark.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rallied to a one-month high on Tuesday, as markets began to price in a fall in consumer prices in the United States.</p>
<p>Following a low of $16,966.59 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $17,457.30 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>This move saw the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency fly to its strongest point since November 11, when price was at a high of $17,645.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, today&#x2019;s surge comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a ceiling of its own.</p>
<p>The index climbed above a resistance level of 52.00 earlier in the day, and as of writing is tracking at 55.00.</p>
<p>Despite this afternoon&#x2019;s report, we will likely see more volatility on Wednesday, as traders get ready for the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also rose in today&#x2019;s session, as bulls reentered the market, taking prices close to the $1,300 level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to a high of $1,294.10 in today&#x2019;s session, which comes less than a day after hovering at a low of $1,248.36.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD moved closer to a recent resistance level of $1,300, as prices were almost 4% higher than Monday&#x2019;s peak.</p>

<p>Like with bitcoin, bullish sentiment in ethereum returned following a breakout of a resistance level at the 53.00 mark.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 53.75, and now seems to be moving towards a ceiling of 55.00.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will likely recapture the $1,300 level, however what happens at that level is the key question for traders.</p>

The launch comes at a time when the number of personal digital currency wallets created in the Chinese city of Suzhou alone now exceeds 30 million. </strong></p>
<h2>Insurance Product &#8216;Guarantees&#8217; Security of Digital Wallets</h2>
<p>According to a report, the Suzhou branch of China Pacific Insurance along with the Bank of Communications branch in the same city, recently launched what has been described as the Asian country’s first central bank digital currency insurance product. It added that the launch &#8220;lays the foundation for the continuous and in-depth promotion of digital renminbi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides helping to widen the use cases of the digital yuan, according to the report, the new insurance product guarantees the &#8220;security of the personal digital currency wallet.&#8221;</p>
<p>As explained in the <a href="http://finance.caijing.com.cn/20221208/4905590.shtml">report</a>, Suzhou, a major city in China’s Jiangsu province, is one of the cities selected to participate in the digital renminbi pilot. To date, more than 30 million digital currency or e-CNY wallets have been created. It is this growth in the number of wallets that has raised the importance of having an appropriate insurance product available to users of the e-CNY, the report said.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>Explaining how the insurance product works, the report states that if personal funds are stolen or if the password of a wallet is compromised during the guarantee period, the affected wallet user will be able to lodge a claim. Since the insurance product’s launch, over 500 people, including students of Soochow University Business School and employees of Zhangjiagang government agencies, have reportedly signed up.</p>
<p>Starting in 2020, China Pacific Insurance’s Suzhou branch has been expanding the use of the digital yuan by way of increased cooperation with stakeholders such as the government, banks, and B-end and C-end customers. The report said these stakeholders are tasked with the job of collecting insurance premiums, paying indemnities, and issuing employee salaries and benefits.</p>
