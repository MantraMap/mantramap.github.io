We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards."</i></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">FTX is accused as a company, or perhaps CEO Sam Bankman-Fried himself of doing something behind the scenes, with at least the goal of hurting a competing crypto company...</h3><p>At least that seems to be the accusation CZ, the Binance CEO, is making, although vaguely, and because of their mention of LUNA (which famously crashed, then crashed the market, and never recovered) and FTT together - the FTX CEO has been trying to assure customers that their token has none of the same risk factors (and from what we can see, that's true).</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Any comparison of FTT with LUNA is a bit unfair...</h3><p>There's no reason for CZ to bring back memories of the LUNA disaster when mentioning FTT - none of LUNA's risk factors can be applied to FTT.<br /><br /><i>"A competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors. FTX is fine. Assets are fine" </i>said CEO Sam Bankman-Fried his first public response.</p><p>However - Binance CEO CZ has proven to be a level-headed voice of reason in the industry, and seems to have a reasonable outlook on the 'big picture' of cryptos future - so if he's accusing FTX or their CEO of crossing a line, it's probably true.&nbsp;</p><p><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">---------------<br /><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Oliver Redding<br /></i><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span><span style="color: #cc0000;">Seattle Newsdesk&nbsp;</span></span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/" style="backface-visibility: hidden; box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; display: inline; margin: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; touch-action: manipulation;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></span></span></i><br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
