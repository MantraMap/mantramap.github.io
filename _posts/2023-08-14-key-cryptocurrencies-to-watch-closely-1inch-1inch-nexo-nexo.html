<p>There are gems of tokens that have been overshadowed by bigger, well-established tokens. However, we'll be highlighting some of these lesser-known tokens that have shown significant growth potential. They include Nexo (NEXO), Pomerdoge (POMD), and 1inch (1INCH) tokens.</p>

Key Cryptocurrencies To Watch Closely &ndash; 1inch (1INCH), Nexo(NEXO), and Pomerdoge (POMD)
<p>The once bearish trend experienced by the 1inch (1NCH) token has flattened and it is looking set to go on a bullish rally. This is evident in the stats that show that it has seen a slight move towards a positive price action after suffering a 2.45% loss in price value in the last 7 days. 1INCH currently trades at $0.30 with a 24-hour trading volume of $14 million.</p>
<p>After falling to an all-time low of $0.25 on June 15, 2023, 1inch is bouncing back at the moment, with the coin gaining 3% in the last 30 days. Crypto price prediction platforms have projected that 1inch could exceed the $0.5 benchmark very soon.</p>
<p>Right now, analysts reckon that 1 inch is on the right track to surge in the coming days and weeks.</p>
Investors Confident in the Resurgence of Nexo (NEXO) Despite Current Dip in Price
<p>Notwithstanding the ongoing declining price action of the Nexo (NEXO) token, investors and analysts are confident that the token will rally anytime soon. For context, It has lost 1.93% in price value in the last 24 hours and trades at $0.63 as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>However, the trading volume of Nexo in the last 24 hours shows that the market activity of the token gained 8.88% to see a market return of over $1.90M.</p>
<p>A further look at the price chart shows that Nexo is 3.69% better off in price value than it was in the last 30 days and has only lost 0.58% of its price value in the last 7 days. As such, Nexo may well be a shrewd investment option.</p>
<p>Most crypto price prediction platforms already predicted that Nexo will hit the $1 benchmark in the year. If the coin breaks the current resistance level, we could witness a rally very soon.</p>
