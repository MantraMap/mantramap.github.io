<p dir="ltr">Litecoin price has slumped in the past few weeks as it ignored key events.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It went through its third halving that reduced its block rewards last week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin"><u>Litecoin</u></a> price has underperformed the market as the hype surrounding the halving event waned. LTC price dropped to a low of $80, the lowest level since June 21st. It has dropped by more than 28% from the highest point this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Litecoin&rsquo;s price action is a reflection of the overall performance of the crypto industry. Bitcoin, its biggest peer, has remained at the $29,000 level in the past few weeks. Similarly, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has remained at $1.12 trillion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Litecoin price has ignored several important events in the ecosystem. Last week, it went&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/litecoin-completes-third-halving-block-reward-cut-to-6-25-ltc/"><u>through halving</u></a>, a process that reduces the block rewards to miners in its ecosystem. Historically, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies tend to show some volatility before and after a halving event.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, it reacted mildly to last week&rsquo;s credit rating downgrade of America&rsquo;s debt by Fitch, one of the big three credit rating agencies. In an ideal situation, the credit rating downgrade should have been a good for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they are designed to be anti-US dollar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, on-chain metrics shows that the number of Litecoin transactions has been a bit muted in the past few months. On a positive side, the hash rate has remained at an all-time high of 800 TH/s.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hash rate is an important metric that looks at the computational power of a network. In most cases, a strong hash rate means that the network is healthier.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Litecoin price prediction</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/08/1691497014108-ea4e44db-50d2-4b7a-a236-036019a7ec54.png" style="width: 668px;height: 325.093px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="668" height="325.093"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The future price action of Litecoin price will depend on the performance of Bitcoin since the two have a close correlation. On the daily chart, the LTC price has dropped below the important resistance level at $105.75, the highest point in February.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most importantly, Litecoin has formed what looks like a head and shoulders pattern, which is usually a bearish sign. It has also dropped below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The two averages are about to make a bearish crossover, which is known as a death cross.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The coin has also formed a bearish flag pattern. Therefore, the outlook for Litecoin price is bearish, with the next level to watch being at $71.20.</p>

<li>PayPal launched its stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li>Huobi has already announced it will launch the new stablecoin.</li>
<li>The PYUSD has an &ldquo;assetProtection&rdquo; role that can wipe your balance in two transactions (first `freeze`, then `wipeFrozenAddress`).</li>
</ul>
<p>The recently <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/paypal-launches-a-us-dollar-stablecoin-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/">launched Paypal stablecoin</a>, the Paypal USD (PYUSD), has been reviewed by Pashov, an expert in smart contracts security reviews. The PYUSD was announced on August 7 and a brief review has shown some unsettling revelations as posted by Pashov on X platform on the same day that the stablecoin was launched.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The new Paypal USD stablecoin has an "assetProtection" role which can wipe your balance in two transactions (first `freeze`, then `wipeFrozenAddress`)</p>
<p>In smart contract security we call this a "centralisation attack vector" <a href="https://t.co/RsmqvsnKvi">pic.twitter.com/RsmqvsnKvi</a></p>
<p>&mdash; pashov (@pashovkrum) <a href="https://twitter.com/pashovkrum/status/1688591468498239496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to Pashov, selected development team members at PayPal will be able to execute delicate code functionalities like freezing accounts and cleaning frozen account balances using the &ldquo;assetProtection&rdquo; role.</p>
<h2>USDT and USDC have similar attack vectors</h2>
<p>While a majority of crypto enthusiasts expected PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin to stand out, Pashov&rsquo;s revelation revealed that the new Paypal USD stablecoin is no different to USDT and USDC in terms of security.</p>
<p>The PayPal USD (PYUSD), the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/tether/what-is-tether/">Tether (USDT)</a>, and the USD Coin ( USDC), all have &ldquo;assetProtection&rdquo; role, which in smart contract security is referred to as a &lsquo;centralization attack vector.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Newsflash: USDT &amp; USDC both have similar attack vectors as well. I thought this one might be different, but it's really isn't.</p>
<p>&mdash; pashov (@pashovkrum) <a href="https://twitter.com/pashovkrum/status/1688615907323428865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The feature makes PayPal stablecoin a centralized stablecoin just like a majority of other popular stablecoins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Vienna, Austria, August 8th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.taskchain.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">TaskChain</a>, a groundbreaking Web3 project, has just announced the launch of its presale today. This new development comes prior to the introduction of TaskChain&rsquo;s innovative platform which is set to transform the way users earn income online.</p>
<p>For early investors, the news about TaskChain&rsquo;s presale launch is another exciting opportunity to be part of a new Web3 platform&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>With a vision to empower individuals worldwide, TaskChain combines Web3 technology with GameFi features with the ultimate goal of creating a virtual space where everyone can easily find diverse opportunities for extra income as they collaborate with others.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFy5hOhYZAw?showinfo=0"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What is TaskChain&rsquo;s Mission</strong></h2>
<p>At its core, TaskChain champions the financial inclusion of the masses through fun and user-friendly Web3 features. The platform has the potential to level the playing field, especially for low-income regions, thanks to the Quests, digital jobs, or one-time gigs that users can take on to earn cryptocurrency rewards on the platform.</p>
<p>Each &ldquo;Quest&rdquo; fulfillment is supported by video game mechanics with plans to introduce VR/AR features into the platform for a more immersive experience for users in the future.</p>
<p>Simply put, each &ldquo;Quest&rdquo; on TaskChain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Quest2Earn&rdquo; feature breaks down everyday tasks into a game-like experience where users who fulfill these tasks get to earn XP points as they level up and collect rewards.</p>
<p>The rewards are paid in TaskChain&rsquo;s native token called $TASKC.</p>
<p>In contrast to other similar platforms, TaskChain stands out as a true pioneer in the Web3 space.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional microtask platforms, TaskChain&rsquo;s Quest2Earn feature brings the thrill of gaming to real-life tasks, making the earning process enjoyable.&nbsp;By providing a wide range of Quests and Quest2Earn functions tailored to individual preferences, TaskChain ensures that everyone, regardless of their background or location, can participate and earn rewards.</p>
<p>This inclusive approach empowers users from all walks of life to access valuable income opportunities and take charge of their financial futures.</p>
<h2><strong>How TaskChain works</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Quest2Earn is at the heart of TaskChain&rsquo;s platform. Inspired by popular video game quests, Quest2Earn offers a dynamic and engaging earning experience, allowing users to boost their income, regardless of their location or skills.</p>
<p>Quest2Earn presents a wide array of exciting quests, each tailored to individual interests and categorized into various themes such as shopping, traveling, learning, trading, events, etc. By completing these and many other tasks within these quests, users not only earn cryptocurrency rewards but also gain experience (XP) points to level up and unlock milestone rewards, making the earning process enjoyable and rewarding.</p>
<p>Tom Klein, CEO of TaskChain, said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;TaskChain&rsquo;s Quest2Earn is a game-changer, transforming mundane tasks into exciting opportunities to earn income while having fun. We believe in providing diverse earning opportunities for our users and creating a vibrant community where collaboration and support thrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/FIX_TaskChain_diagram_1200x720_02_1691411272T6jtZNWUsY.jpg"></p>
<h2><strong>TaskChain Presale</strong></h2>
<p>TaskChain is set for kick-off with a listing price of $0.011 per TASKC token. With a current beta-stage price set at $0.004 per token, the 175% price difference marks the first phase of the presale. Early investors can participate in funding the project in an earlier price tranche.</p>
<p>TaskChain has confirmed it has successfully passed a full security audit and KYC, providing extra security for investors.</p>
<p>There is also a massive <a href="https://www.taskchain.co/giveaway" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">giveaway</a> of $120,000 in rewards for presale participants to spice up involvement in the presale.</p>
<h2><strong>$TASKC Token</strong></h2>
<p>$TASKC ERC20 token, the lifeblood of TaskChain, is built on the most popular Ethereum Blockchain, which will provide transparency, security, and fast payouts with valuable rewards.</p>
<p>With a total supply of 4 billion $TASKC tokens, scarcity, and value are baked into $TASKC&rsquo;s design, the presale will give investors a chance to grab a share of 2.8 billion tokens spread across all the 11 exclusive stages.</p>
<h2><strong>About TaskChain:</strong></h2>
<p>TaskChain is set to build the world&rsquo;s first unique Web3 earning platform. By combining a fun experience with crypto earnings and financial inclusion, TaskChain&rsquo;s Quest2Earn feature will revolutionize the way individuals earn income and interact with blockchain technology.

<h2 dir="ltr">Bitstamp seeks to expand the number of markets it serves</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitstamp, one of the oldest crypto exchanges, has revealed that it is currently in talks with investors to raise fresh funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is according to Bitstamp&rsquo;s CEO, Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux. The CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/crypto-exchange-bitstamp-in-fundraising-talks-seeks-expansion?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told Bloomberg</u></a> that the cryptocurrency exchange began the fundraising process a few weeks ago, and Galaxy Digital Holdings serves as its adviser.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency exchange will use the funds to expand its operations. Bitstamp wants to launch its derivatives trading service in Europe by next year and will also expand the number of markets it serves in Asia. The company will also expand its operations in the U.K.,</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Bitstamp is not for sale, and we are not actively looking to sell the company. Our current and exclusive priority is to raise money through strategic investors to accelerate Bitstamp&rsquo;s growth by providing new products and services to retail and institutional crypto customers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitstamp has been expanding its business in the crypto space in recent months. In June,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitstamp-registered-as-a-cryptoasset-business-by-uks-fca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bitstamp was registered</u></a> as a cryptoasset business by the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By doing so, Bitstamp joined other platforms like eToro, Revolut and Moonpay on the FCA list of firms complying with Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Regulations (MLRs).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitstamp is a UK-based cryptocurrency exchange and has been around since 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<li>SEC has to rule on ARK&rsquo;s application for a Bitcoin ETF by August 13th.</li>
<li>Cathie Wood expects the financial regulator to extend that deadline.</li>
<li>A summary of what else she said in an interview with Bloomberg today.</li>
</ul>
<p>The U.S. SEC will likely delay ruling on application for a Spot Bitcoin ETF that Ark Invest registered on May 15<sup>th</sup>, says Cathie Wood.</p>
<h2>Highlights from Wood&rsquo;s interview with Bloomberg</h2>
<p>Current deadline for the financial regulator to announce its decision on the said filing is August 13<sup>th</sup>. But the famed investor anticipates that the Securities and Exchange Commission will extend that deadline.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-08-07/wood-sec-could-approve-more-than-one-bitcoin-etf-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> this morning, the Founder and Chief Executive of Ark Invest also alluded to the possibility that the U.S. SEC may approve a bunch of Bitcoin ETFs at once.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think SEC, if it&rsquo;s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once. Most of these will be same, and it&rsquo;ll come down to marketing and communicating the message.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other than her investment management firm, eight others, including <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/should-exchanges-fear-a-blackrock-etf/">BlackRock Inc</a>, have so far filed for such an exchange-traded fund.</p>
<h2>Wood is significantly invested in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust</h2>
<p>A Bitcoin ETF has been the front and centre of all crypto-related debates in recent months.</p>
<p>In fact, the possibility of one that may make it more convenient to gain exposure to BTC has largely contributed to the 80% <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/cryptocurrencies/2023/06/23/bitcoin-surges-to-highest-level-since-june-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">year-to-date rally</a> in Bitcoin. Wood also said on Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve been putting out our Bitcoin monthly for the last year. We&rsquo;re now starting a Bitcoin brainstorming session. We&rsquo;re trying to get the word out there that our research is deep.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the third largest holding in her Ark Next Generation Internet ETF at writing is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Wood refrained from commenting, though, on what she plans on doing with her investment in GBTC if a Spot <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> ETF gets a nod from the financial regulator.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu token has raised over $1.64 million from investors.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It is one of the most popular upcoming crypto tokens in the world.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It combines key industries like AI and meme coins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/"><u>Cryptocurrency prices</u></a> moved sideways even as American equities jumped. Bitcoin remained slightly above $29,000 while the total market cap dropped by 0.42% to $1.16 trillin. The Dow Jones and the Nasdaq 100 indices jumped by over 0.65% as investors embraced a risk-on sentiment. This article will look at the forecast for key cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash, Algorand, and Shiba Memu.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is an upcoming cryptocurrency that is aiming to combine key technologies like artificial intelligence and meme coins. Its goal is to take advantage of the most hyped industries this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In AI, some of the best-performing companies and cryptocurrencies have been in the industry. Some of these firms are Nvidia, Microsoft, and C3.ai while the most popular crypto AI platforms are SingularityNET and Fetch.Ai.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu aims to be a better alternative to other popular cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Pepe. It is also taking advantage of AI technology by self-marketing. It will do that by self-responding to user inquiries and grow from their feedback.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu will have&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/whitepaper.pdf"><u>several technologies</u></a>, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment analysis, predictive analysis, and personalization among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s token sale has gained traction in the past few weeks. It has already raised over $1.6 million from global investors. The price of the token is rising on a daily basis. You can buy the Shiba Memu token&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin Cash price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The 4H chart shows that the BCH price has moved sideways in the past few days. This price action has mirrored that of Bitcoin, which has also dropped from the year-to-date high of $31,388 to $29,000. BCH price has moved slightly above the 25-period and 50-period moving averages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The price was also slightly above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved slightly above the neutral point at 60. Therefore, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin-cash"><u>Bitcoin Cash</u></a> price will likely remain in this range for a while. The key support and resistance levels to watch will be at $219 and $260.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/07/1691439162821-fc07e18d-c88a-426d-a892-03bee95bb33b.png" style="width: 693px;height: 337.26px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="693" height="337.26"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Algorand price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/algorand/"><u>Algorand</u></a> has been under pressure in the past few months. This pressure intensified recently when AlgoFi, the biggest DeFi platform in the ecosystem collapsed. ALGO price is consolidating at the 25-day and 50-day moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) drifted upwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Average True Range (ATR) has drifted downwards while the price is above the key support level at $0.1043. Volume has been constrained in the past few weeks. Therefore, the token will likely remain in a tight range in the coming days. The key support and resistance levels to watch will be at $0.10 and $0.12.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Crypto investment products saw outflows totaling $107 million, the primary focus being BTC.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> traded near the $28,800 early afternoon on Monday as caution dictated overall sentiment across the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/stocks/">Stocks</a> were mixed in midday trading on Monday as earnings season starts to wind down and investors brace for an inflation reading crucial to the Federal Reserve decision making.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average held slightly positive ground at 0.5% and 0.9% respectively, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and Rusell 2000 were down 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BTC hovers at key level amid huge outflows</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On Monday, digital assets manager CoinShares released the latest <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-143-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-6d46f78754c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weekly report</a> on digital asset investment products flows. According to an analysis by the firm, total outflows for last week was $107 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin saw total weekly outflows of $111 million. Although outflows into short bitcoin products reportedly stopped for the first time in 14 weeks, those from the flagship cryptocurrency were the largest since March.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Ethereum recorded outflows of $6 million, while Solana outpaced the top altcoin with $9.5 million in inflows. There were also inflows of $0.5 million for XRP and $0.46 million for Litecoin. Uniswap had $0.8 million in outflows and Cardano with $0.3 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares noted in the report that the outflows have come amid increased profit taking deals in recent weeks. Also notable was the decline in weekly trading volumes for digital asset investment products and on-exchange volumes &ndash; which stood at 36% and 62% year-to-date respectively.</p>
