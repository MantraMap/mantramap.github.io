			  <description><![CDATA[<p>While there has not been much time since the crypto market's peak, prices are miles down, and investor behavior has begun to shift. During the bull run, investors were willing to throw money at any crypto project and its dog. The competition was fierce regarding who could accumulate the most cryptocurrencies, earn huge returns, and invest in new projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors got burned in every corner of the industry&mdash;-savings in protocols like Celsius evaporated, holdings that were supposed to be safe on FTX got stuck or disappeared, not likely to be redeemed, and the list goes on. Meanwhile, HODLers are largely underwater, holding on to losses.</p>
<p>What surfaces now are alternative ways for investors to expose themselves to the benefits and tremendous potential of Web3 without taking on the excessive volatility inherent in much of the industry.</p>
<p>One such project is ShelterZoom, a leading blockchain-based, smart-document SaaS provider. While the crypto economy collapsed, ShelterZoom inked a significant partnership with an Argentinian hospital to tokenize medical records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the first time, patients can share their medical data with other doctors safely and easily and hear second or third opinions whenever they want. It will also prevent bureaucratic delays and mistakes, which are crucial in healthcare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finding Web3 projects and companies with real products and maturity to commercialize is a challenging but rewarding way of trying to catch the upside of this budding technology.</p>
<p>Investing in a Startup might be complex, which is why many investors still try to accumulate tokens available on major exchanges. But even in the token ecosystem, new examples are popping up with value propositions.</p>
<p>Illumishare has unveiled a token backed by three uncorrelated assets, including gold, stored in a safe room at a bank in Abu-Dhabi and broadcast live 24/7. The idea is that backing the token with a diversified set of uncorrelated assets can prevent volatile downward swings&mdash;but still offer unlimited upside. Even though uncorrelated assets support its SRG token, it's not a stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another project with a robust Web3 selling proposition is VAIOT. The first company to be regulated by the Maltese VFA Act in 2020, VAIOT is building AI-powered intelligent virtual assistants to digitize major industries. .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value of the regulation proved itself over time, in stark contrast to companies that either aren&rsquo;t regulated or very loosely regulated. Early in 2022, the company suffered a hack. As VAIOT is legally required to maintain the highest operational standards of the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), every investor was reimbursed in full.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode shows a real-life example of a company that works based on a professional business plan reviewed and approved by the regulator, which creates a layer of protection for the token holders. The VAIOT token is available on Gate.io and KuCoin.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Extends Technical Ascent:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 12 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to resume recent upside progress early in the Asian session as the pair encountered additional buying pressure around the 17141.55 area, right around the 23.6% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 17424.59 to 16679.52.&nbsp; Stronger technical bids emerged recently around the 17060.69 area, representing a test of the 50% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 17424.59 to 16679.52.&nbsp; Additional downside retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 16964 and 16855 levels, while BTC/USD bulls are eyeing the 17265.15 area as an upside target.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 17193.77 and 17095.50 areas during the recent pullback, representing the 23.6% and 38.2% retracements of the recent appreciating range from 16679.52 and 17352.62.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to resume its recent upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17209.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17149.37.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase has waived conversion fees to try and induce customers to switch from USDT to USDC. Meanwhile, Binance has delisted USDC trading pairs and is pushing its own BUSD stablecoin.</p>
Stablecoin wars
<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance have recently been at the centre of the so-called &ldquo;stablecoin wars.&rdquo; Coinbase has asked its users to switch their US Dollar Tether (USDT) holdings to USDC, while Binance has chosen to stick with USDT and its own BUSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For traders, this could have implications for their portfolio as each stablecoin has different features and characteristics. Coinbase is encouraging its users to move their funds from USDT to USDC, a US dollar-backed stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
The alternatives
<p>USDC is an Ethereum-based token that is backed by a US dollar reserve, and it is administered by the CENTRE Consortium. USDC is designed to be a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to USDT, as Coinbase claims that USDC is more regularly audited than USDT. Coinbase has also introduced a feature that allows users to easily convert their USDT to USDC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance, on the other hand, has chosen to remain loyal to USDT. USDT is a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar and is issued by Tether Limited. USDT currently holds the largest market share of the stablecoin market and is used by many traders as a way to store and transfer value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>USDT has come under fire in the past due to its lack of transparency and audits, but the coin has been able to stay afloat due to its large user base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For traders, the choice between USDC and USDT can be a tricky one. USDC is more transparent than USDT and is backed by a reserve, but it is also more expensive to use. USDT is more widely used, but it is not as secure or transparent as USDC. Ultimately, the decision between the two coins boils down to personal preference and the specific requirements of each trader.&nbsp;</p>
Which stablecoin will dominate?
<p>In conclusion, Coinbase and Binance have taken sides in the stablecoin wars, and traders should be aware of the differences between USDC and USDT when making their decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With stablecoin regulation fast approaching, it will be interesting to see which of the stablecoins might rise to prominence and unseat USDT as the main way to transact between cryptocurrency and the US dollar.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India says a CBDC can be anonymous and that any crypto data is misleading.</p>
<p>The ongoing debate between the use of cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has prompted the RBI Deputy Governor Rabi Patra to enter the fray with a few words of caution.&nbsp;</p>
Misleading crypto data
<p>In a recent statement, RBI Deputy Governor Patra has said that whatever data is available on cryptocurrency is misleading. Patra&rsquo;s comments came during an online event organised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the event, Patra noted that untrustworthy crypto data could be a result of the lack of proper regulation and guidelines in place for its use. Patra went on to explain why the data available on cryptocurrency is so misleading, making it difficult to make a proper assessment of the risks and benefits associated with each cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
Insufficient regulations and lack of transparency
<p>Furthermore, Patra noted that the absence of proper regulations and guidelines could lead to fraudulent activities that could potentially lead to huge losses. He pointed out that such activities could be conducted with impunity, as the lack of rules and guidelines make it difficult to trace or prosecute the perpetrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to this, Patra also raised concerns about the lack of transparency in the cryptocurrency market. He said that this could lead to manipulation and other unethical practices. He urged all stakeholders involved in the cryptocurrency market to ensure that the market is made more transparent.</p>
Indian crypto regulation
<p>Patra&rsquo;s comments come at a time when the Indian government is looking to introduce its own regulations for the use of cryptocurrency. The RBI has already imposed a ban on banks and financial institutions from dealing in cryptocurrency, but the government is yet to introduce any comprehensive regulations for its use.&nbsp;</p>
The e-rupee
<p>The RBI is also looking to trial and issue its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the form of the e-rupee. It states that it will be as anonymous as the rupee in circulation today and will not need any intermediaries.</p>
Opinion
<p>That the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India is saying that crypto data is misleading is rather misleading in itself. Anyone educated in how cryptocurrencies work would know that they are based on blockchain technology which means that every single transaction can be tracked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments and banks are involved in a war against cryptocurrencies which they need to win in order for CBDCs to be adopted without any competition from private assets. The comment that CBDCs will be "anonymous" is also highly debatable. Most experts have already said that this technology can give ultimate power to central banks to intervene in any individual's account and sanction them in any way they choose.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>More than 40 celebrities and companies are defendants in a lawsuit brought against Yuga Labs and Moonpay over their alleged use to misleadingly promote NFTs.</p>
Lawsuit
<p>Yuga Labs and MoonPay, two companies at the centre of a legal dispute concerning the sale of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) featuring the likenesses of various celebrities, have been thrust into the spotlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed by a group of investors in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Yuga Labs and MoonPay defrauded investors and violated U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered securities.</p>
Alleged misleading sale of NFTs
<p>The lawsuit follows a campaign by Yuga Labs to promote the sale of NFTs featuring various celebrities, including Paris Hilton, The Weeknd, and Snoop Dogg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFTs, which are digital tokens stored on a blockchain, are meant to represent a certain asset in a digital format. The NFTs offered by Yuga Labs were sold using MoonPay's platform, which allegedly allowed investors to purchase the NFTs without the necessary verification and disclosure requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit further alleges that Yuga Labs and MoonPay misrepresented the sale of the NFTs, as well as their value. Specifically, the suit claims that Yuga Labs and MoonPay did not adequately disclose the risks associated with investing in the NFTs, as well as the fees associated with their sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Yuga Labs and MoonPay allegedly failed to provide investors with accurate information regarding the celebrities whose likenesses were featured on the NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investors behind the lawsuit are seeking compensation for the alleged losses incurred as a result of the alleged misrepresentations. They are also seeking an injunction to prevent Yuga Labs and MoonPay from selling any further unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>
Due diligence
<p>With government enforcement agencies cracking down on all things crypto, and heavy regulation for the sector possibly arriving in the near future, investors will need to increase their diligence when purchasing such new assets as NFTs.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Again Tests 17052 Support:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 11 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to test technical support early in the Asian session as the pair bounced after trading as low as the 17060.69 area, representing a test of the 50% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 17424.59 to 16679.52.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional downside retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 16964 and 16855 levels.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 17193.77 and 17095.50 areas during the pullback, representing the 23.6% and 38.2% retracements of the recent appreciating range from 16679.52 and 17352.62.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to resume its recent upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, this 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17029.33 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17075.17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A report by global audit and advisory company Mazars proves that Binance&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralised.</p>
Confirmation of overcollateralisation
<p>The world of cryptocurrencies is rapidly changing, and Binance is serious about taking a lead role in the evolution. The world's largest crypto exchange recently completed an independent audit which confirms that Binance&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a big deal and could signal a major shift in the way that crypto exchanges manage their reserves. While this news may not surprise those familiar with the crypto industry, it's a significant milestone for the sector as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To put it simply, overcollateralization means that Binance holds more Bitcoin than is necessary to cover customer deposits. This provides a greater level of security for customers, ensuring that their funds are not at risk of being lost in the event of a hack or other incident.&nbsp;</p>
Customer Bitcoin assets safe and secure
<p>According to the audit, Binance&rsquo;s custodial services are safe and sound, with no customer funds held in unsecured wallets. This is something that many exchanges have struggled with in the past, so this offers a clear indication that Binance is taking customer security seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audit also found that Binance is compliant with the FATF&rsquo;s Travel Rule. This rule requires cryptocurrency exchanges to collect, verify and transfer customer information when sending funds to another exchange. This is a significant step forward for the entire crypto industry and could provide a much-needed layer of oversight and regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the results of the audit show that Binance is committed to providing its users with a safe and secure experience. The fact that their Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized is a clear indication that the exchange isn&rsquo;t taking any chances when it comes to the safety of customer funds.&nbsp;</p>
A contrarian opinion
<p>However, not everyone has taken the Mazars audit at its word. According to a Coindesk article, Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, gave the view that the audit was worthless. She said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They did a comparison of balances per public key address from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or depositories,"</p>

<p>Mckenna was even more derogatory of the audit when she added:</p>

<p>"This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report,"</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>London, United Kingdom, 10th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Pillar&rsquo;s latest release for its non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet ships with a sophisticated recovery mechanism that protects user funds without compromising security. Other game-changing updates include in-app cross-chain swaps and meta-transactions, which allow users to pay for gas fees on any chain with stablecoins housed on any other chain.</p>
<p>The security that is a major benefit of non-custodial wallets is also a user&rsquo;s main risk. Should they lose their private or public key, there is no other way to regain access to the wallet. People often lose access to their funds because their private key was written on a scrap of paper and got lost.</p>
<p>Pillar Wallet solves this single point of failure without compromising security through a sophisticated and fully decentralized mechanism. The private keys to a Pillar Wallet are secured by a smart contract, meaning that if the owner loses access to it, they can still recover their funds. At the same time, Pillar never retains knowledge of the private key.

A community-run, multichain DeFi wallet, Pillar supports Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain, and Optimism with more coming. Pillar Wallet is powered by Etherspot SDK. While private key wallets are usually free, smart wallets come with a small cost, as a smart contract must be deployed on the blockchain. However, Pillar Wallet offers to deploy Polygon and Gnosis wallets for free, covering all deployment fees.</p>
<p>Users of Pillar Wallet can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Store, buy, send, trade, and swap assets with low-to-no gas fees on numerous EVM-compatible chains within the app</li>
  <li>Buy crypto directly on Ethereum or Polygon with card or bank transfer via implemented on-ramps</li>
  <li>Move funds seamlessly between different EVM chains without the need for external bridging apps</li>
  <li>Perform cross-chain swaps without gas tokens on the destination chain. Users can cover gas fees with any stablecoin they have in their wallet on any chain (Meta-transactions)</li>
  <li>Use Wallet Connect to interact with a wide range of supported DeFi applications directly within the in-app browser</li>
</ul>
<p>Pillar is a fully decentralized, open-source, non-custodial, and community-run wallet. Users are free to join the Pillar DAO, help manage the project&rsquo;s treasury, make proposals to the DAO and shape future developments.</p>
<p>About Pillar Wallet
Pillar Wallet is a next-generation crypto wallet that stores your cryptocurrencies securely and provides you with the same level of comfort as any custodial wallet. Its advanced smart contract design supports account recovery without exposing the private key to any third party including Pillar.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s come to light that leading crypto news platform The Block was secretly funded by Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s FTX for more than a year.</p>
<p>For a crypto news platform that led the industry with transparency and a fervent pursuit of truth and justice, this must be a bitter pill to swallow for the management and journalists who were not aware of secret loans channelled through SBF&rsquo;s Alameda Research.</p>
<p>The Block CEO Michael McCaffrey has resigned from the company following the news and he has also stepped down from the board. Meanwhile the shock and disbelief continues to be exhibited on social media channels.</p>
<p>Frank Chaparro, Editor of The Block, was particularly scathing of the actions of McCaffrey, saying that he was gutted by the news.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1) I'm absolutely gutted by this news, which was briefed to the company this afternoon.Underpinning my shock are feelings of utter disgust and betrayal by Mike&rsquo;s actions, greed, lack of disclosure. He's literal scum. He kept every single one of us in the dark. https://t.co/jIZCxtHrfc</p>
&mdash; Frank Chaparro (@fintechfrank) December 9, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>Bobby Moran, the Chief Revenue Officer at The Block, published a Medium post on Friday announcing that he had assumed the role of CEO following McCaffrey&rsquo;s resignation. He also expressed his disappointment at what had transpired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This news came as both a shock and disappointment to The Block leadership team. Mike&rsquo;s decision to take out a loan from SBF and not disclose that information demonstrates a serious lack of judgment. It undermines The Block&rsquo;s reputation and credibility, especially that of our reporters and researchers, as well as our efforts at industry-leading transparency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added that neither he nor anyone else at The Block had any knowledge of the loan arrangement from Alameda and he maintained that he had seen no evidence that there was any bias in The Block&rsquo;s reporting of SBF, FTX or Alameda.</p>
<p>Mike Dudas, co-founder and ex-CEO of The Block, was also shocked and offered a harsh criticism of McCaffrey&rsquo;s dealings with Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Block's new CEO Bobby Moran evidently knew about the $43m in SBF loans *before* Thanksgiving but told employees about it today?McCaffrey never told me once that SBF was involved in any transaction related to The Block, nor did SBF.These two sociopaths deserved each other.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The collapse of FTX saw a major push for transparency in the crypto space, leading several exchanges to disclose proof of reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto.com has become the latest exchange to provide its proof of reserves, featuring an audit from Mazars Group, an independent crypto-focused advisory firm.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto.com Proof Of Reserves&nbsp;
<p>Crypto.com has joined Binance in providing proof of reserves, announcing the move in a statement issued on the 9th of December on its website. The proof of reserves revealed that the exchange has more than enough crypto assets backing any customer liabilities. The exchange&rsquo;s customer balances for top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are over 100% backed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof of reserves shows that Crypto.com has 102% of the Bitcoin, 101% of the Ether, and 102% of the USD Coin it needs to process withdrawals on the platform. Additionally, Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Chainlink (LINK), and MANA are also included in the report, which shows that Crypto.com is maintaining reserves above 100% for all of them. The exchange shared an update on Twitter, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto.com releases Proof of Reserves audited results. Mazars Group compared the assets held in on-chain addresses proven to be controlled by Crypto.com with customer balances through an auditor-overseen live query of a production database as of the 7th of December.&rdquo;</p>

Audit Conducted By Mazars Group&nbsp;
<p>The statement revealed that the audit was conducted by the international audit, tax, and accounting firm, Mazars Group, which had also conducted Binance&rsquo;s proof of reserves just last month. Mazar claims its auditor page runs a version of the open-source Silver Sixpence Merkle Tree Generator program. If the auditor page was doctored to produce false results, programmers could discover the false results by running the program in their developer environment.&nbsp;</p>
An Important Step For The Industry&nbsp;
<p>The cryptocurrency community has cast considerable scrutiny on centralized exchanges since the spectacular unraveling of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX. Crypto.com itself was not immune from the resulting contagion, having to pause withdrawals on Solana. The team at Crypto.com stated that by releasing its proof of reserves, it hopes to prove to users that it is a good steward of user assets and has the required capability to process all withdrawals, should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CEO of Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek elaborated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Providing audited Proof of Reserves is an important step for the entire industry to increase transparency and begin the process of restoring trust. [...] Crypto.com is fully committed to providing customers around the world a safe, secure, and compliant means of engaging with digital currencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crypto.com is one of many exchanges to submit their proof of reserves. Crypto exchange OKX offered its proof of reserves on the 23rd of November, although its liabilities are yet to be audited. Binance has also submitted its proof of reserves for the Bitcoin it holds.</p>
Users Can Self Audit Reserves&nbsp;
<p>For users who would be a little skeptical of the exchange&rsquo;s reporting on its assets and liabilities, Crypto.com has also given the option to self-audit the exchange&rsquo;s reserves. Users can log into the app, verify the assets held by them when the audit was conducted, and copy the Merkle hash derived from the balances. After obtaining the Merkle hash, customers can navigate to a separate audit page and check if their liabilities are part of the larger Merkle tree of the exchange&rsquo;s audited liabilities.&nbsp;</p>
Criticism Of Proof Of Reserves&nbsp;
<p>Proof of reserves has come under some criticism because its proper implementation requires an external auditor to analyze the company&rsquo;s liability to ensure its solvency. This has been criticized by Jesse Powell, Kraken CEO, who was also critical of Binance&rsquo;s proof of reserves earlier in the week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll give you a hint. This is just the easy stuff that says this OBVIOUSLY is not a traditional Proof of Reserves and should immediately have had actual journalists digging. Why use collateral value? Why are negative balances included? No wallet signing? Who issues BTCB &amp; BBTC?&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Elects Stops Above 17265:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 9 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) worked to sustain recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair elected Stops above the 17265.15 level, representing the 78.6% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 17424.59 to 16679.52.&nbsp; Recent upside progress has increased risk that Stops above the 17424.59 area could be tested and lead to a test of the 17759.18 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp; Additional upside retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 18469 and 19179 areas.&nbsp; Traders are watching to see if BTC/USD can establish a constructive base around the 16880 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to extend its upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, this 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17352.03 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17007.11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Binance crypto exchange has control over more than 87% of the entire exchange volume, according to the Block analytical platform that aggregates sheer information on trading volumes using CryptoCompare data.</p>
<p>Although an analysis of raw data provided by the same global cryptocurrency market data provider comes out to be around 28%, while CoinMarketCap, that is controlled by Binance, shows roughly the same figure at 24% for the first week of December 2022.</p>
<p>By the end of November, Binance controlled around 75% of the exchange volume in the crypto industry, according to data collected by The Block. One way or another, Binance is dominating the market and is expanding further. The exchange has recently taken over the Japanese market by acquiring Sakura Exchange BitCoin. Now the exchange has obtained the first license in Asia.</p>
<p>Binance has also started negotiations to take over the Indonesian Tokocrypto exchange that is currently suffering from bad market conditions. It has also acquired a stake in the Malaysian regulated MX Global trading platform. After claims by Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency that Binance was operating without a license in Japan, it exited Japan in 2018 and also received another warning from the regulator in 2021 as some Japanese residents continued to still do business with Binance.</p>
<p>With these issues cleared up, Binance is now compliant to conduct operations not only in Japan and Malaysia, but also in France, Italy, Spain, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, New Zealand, Kazakhstan, Poland, Lithuania, and Cyprus. The company plans to continue its expansion as it has accumulated over $1 billion to bail out troubled digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the company has no-office style culture of operations and may be easily targeted by local watchdogs in one of these countries. First on the list is the U.S. Congress which may approve more vigilant regulations to tract the activity of crypto exchanges followed by SEC. However, Binance U.S. is only a small portion of Binance&rsquo;s global business. So, it could be a matter of interest for some European Securities and exchange commissions to keep a close look on Binance operations in 2023.</p>
<p>Thus, the centralisation of the crypto market may become its weakness as other crypto exchanges are far behind the leader, as OKX exchange, the second largest exchange, controls about 6% of the daily trading volume in the crypto market, according to data from The Block.</p>
<p>Whether or not Binance will finally win this battle will largely depend on the actions of local authorities. Any witch hunt in the crypto market by monetary authorities may lead to the decentralisation of companies, like Binance, and lead to the immediate loss of confidence in regulators. So, any harsh actions could simply discourage crypto enthusiasts from the regulated market and push local exchanges to act without any regulation.</p>
<p>Binance itself may easily transform its business to operate in &ldquo;decentralised structures&rdquo; as it has no offices and no compliance department that would regularly communicate with officials, as is the norm with other regulated companies in other financial segments.</p>
<p>So far, Binance is a trend setter in the crypto market as it has been pioneering the industry with larger transparency than any other market players. Immediately after the crash of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges, on November 8, Binance&rsquo;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, said that the company was ready to publish proof of reserves.</p>
<p>Moreover, the exchange has published a guide of &ldquo;What is Proof of Reserves and How it Works on Binance&rdquo;. On November 15 Changpeng Zhao continued with his &ldquo;Best practices for Exchanges&rdquo; and continued with a recovery fund to prop up legitimate projects in distress.</p>
<p>Other crypto exchanges majors like Bitfinex, Crypto.com, Huobi, OKX, and Kucoin, had to follow this example and release their &ldquo;proof of reserves&rdquo;. All of the majors have shown support to Binance&rsquo;s recovery fund and promised to invest more in crypto startups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, transparency is not the only element that could challenge Binance&rsquo;s leadership. The company or event that will transform the crypto industry towards new standards while keeping it decentralised is the one that will become the new market leader.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In light of the FTX incident, United States lawmakers are putting pressure on key federal financial regulators to investigate banks with ties to cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
Senators Question Banks&nbsp;
<p>Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith have written to multiple federal agencies and regulators, questioning the close ties between crypto markets and traditional banking. The aftermath of the FTX collapse has stirred up trouble, especially among lawmakers who have intensified their scrutiny of the industry even more since then. In this case, both the Senators, who are members of the Senate Banking House and Urban Affairs Committee, have addressed the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in their letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excerpt from the letter reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the banking system has so far [been] relatively unscathed by the latest crypto crash, FTX&rsquo;s collapse shows that crypto may be more integrated into the banking system than regulators are aware.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Banks Had Close Ties To Crypto&rdquo;
<p>There have been other instances of associations between FTX and financial institutions. Several noteworthy banks, like Silvergate Capital, Provident Bancorp, Metropolitan Commercial, Signature, and Customers Bancorp, have all landed in hot water due to their significant exposure to the FTX ecosystem. The Senators&rsquo; letter referenced several banks and financial corporations struggling after prolonged exposure to FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears crypto firms may have closer ties to the banking system than previously understood. Banks&rsquo; relationships with crypto firms raise questions about the safety and soundness of our banking system and highlight potential loopholes that crypto firms may try to exploit to gain further access.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Banks In Trouble After FTX Crash
<p>Almost 90% of Silvergate&rsquo;s overall deposit base consisted of crypto deposits. In addition, more than 50% of the equity capital for Provident bank consisted of crypto loans. In the aftermath of the crash, Provident bank is experiencing losses as high as $27 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a report in The New York Times, FTX&rsquo;s sister company Alameda Research had an $11.5 million investment in the Washington state-based Moonstone Bank. The latter&rsquo;s parent company FBH Corp was headed by Jean Chalopin, who is also the Chairman of the Bahamas-based Deltec Bank, which had a working relationship with stablecoin issuer Tether (an FTX trading partner).&nbsp;</p>
Regulators' Attention On SBF
<p>On the other hand, regulators have been focusing most of their attention on ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The Texas Securities Board has summoned him to investigate whether Texas securities laws were violated by offering unregistered securities products through FTX&rsquo;s yield-bearing service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other regulators, like the Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee, have also summoned Bankman-Fried to hearings discussing the collapse of the FTX ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cardano (ADA) and Flow (FLOW) are among the top 50 biggest cryptocurrencies in market cap. However, many investors and traders are abandoning the coins in favor of new projects with better real-world utilities. The Hideaways (HDWY) is anticipated to climb to the top 50 cryptocurrencies in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Is Cardano Under Selling Pressure?
<p>Active address usage on the Cardano (ADA) network has increased dramatically by 90% daily. It has been reported that there are now over 1.2 million allocated wallets on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The price of ADA has decreased by 5% during the past week. The current price of Cardano is $0.304558. However, a look at the token's 24-hour chart reveals that bulls are in command, leading the ADA/USD pair toward a bullish momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, ADA bulls pushed the price to $0.318917, but they could not maintain momentum.</p>
<p>Since ADA has been doing poorly, there may be more on-chain action related to Cardano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the uptick in on-chain activity is traders cutting their losses and reducing their exposure to a faltering market by selling their holdings or taking profits.</p>
Flow Is Not Worth Your Money‒Here&rsquo;s Why
<p>The FLOW utility token helps the Flow economy function by functioning as both a means of trade and deposit. Despite its many utilities, FLOW had fallen this week after earlier in the week when it showed a more unexpected pattern of minor gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After dropping 5.1% last week, the currency is trading at $1.11. During the past 30 days, FLOW has decreased by more than 34.5%. Do not make any new purchases of FLOW coins right now, advised veteran crypto traders.&nbsp;</p>

The Hideaways (HDWY) is anticipated to climb to the top 50 cryptocurrencies in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Is Cardano Under Selling Pressure?
<p>Active address usage on the Cardano (ADA) network has increased dramatically by 90% daily. It has been reported that there are now over 1.2 million allocated wallets on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The price of ADA has decreased by 5% during the past week. The current price of Cardano is $0.304558. However, a look at the token's 24-hour chart reveals that bulls are in command, leading the ADA/USD pair toward a bullish momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, ADA bulls pushed the price to $0.318917, but they could not maintain momentum.</p>
<p>Since ADA has been doing poorly, there may be more on-chain action related to Cardano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the uptick in on-chain activity is traders cutting their losses and reducing their exposure to a faltering market by selling their holdings or taking profits.</p>
Flow Is Not Worth Your Money‒Here&rsquo;s Why
<p>The FLOW utility token helps the Flow economy function by functioning as both a means of trade and deposit. Despite its many utilities, FLOW had fallen this week after earlier in the week when it showed a more unexpected pattern of minor gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After dropping 5.1% last week, the currency is trading at $1.11. During the past 30 days, FLOW has decreased by more than 34.5%. Do not make any new purchases of FLOW coins right now, advised veteran crypto traders.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hideaways (HDWY), Stellar (XLM), and Bitcoin (BTC) are three promising cryptocurrencies that can help you diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio. Stellar and Bitcoin have recently dropped in value, whereas The Hideaways (HDWY) has remained stable.</p>
<p>Discover why Stellar (XLM) and Bitcoin (BTC) investors are making the switch to The Hideaways (HDWY), a newcomer in the crypto industry that has seen a rise of 800% in a short amount of time.</p>
Stellar (XLM) Price Falls 72% In One Year
<p>Stella (XLM) holders had a difficult year as the token's value has continued to decrease throughout the course of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts question what will happen to Stellar (XLM) when over 25 billion tokens have been distributed. Stellar (XLM) is a novel coin that enables value transfer between assets, and it has several potential use cases.</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM) tokens enable smart contracts and facilitate the transfer of a wide variety of assets across the Stellar network. Unlike Bitcoin, XLM cannot be mined since it does not use the proof-of-work algorithm.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, one unit of Stellar (XLM) costs $0.09 and had a 24-hour trading volume of $53,669,096.</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) Price Struggling
<p>On Friday, cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin (BTC), fell. There are signs of widespread pessimism among market participants as the digital asset field continues to feel the effects of the repercussions of the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's value was decreasing, down to roughly $16,500, or less than 1% in the preceding 24 hours. Even while the entire repercussions of FTX's bankruptcy are likely still unknown, the largest crypto has maintained above its two-year lows near $15,550, which were recorded during peaks of selling over fears over instability at FTX and eventually its bankruptcy. However, Bitcoin has still lost over 20% of its value in the past few weeks and is currently selling for less than 25% of its record-high price of around $69,000 from a year ago.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) investors are looking elsewhere, and The Hideaways (HDWY) are the latest hot ticket.</p>
The Hideaways (HDWY) Price Is Expected To Grow By 15,000%
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) could be an excellent option for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies at the moment.&nbsp; When you join The Hideaways, you'll have access to a curated portfolio of luxury rental properties across the world, where you may invest and collect a passive income through rentals.</p>
<p>Here are some advantages of investing in HDWY tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The platform's security has been validated by SolidProof, the industry-leading crypto security auditing organization.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">By doing this, the organization is assuring that there will be sufficient funds to operate into the next millennium.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You can increase your return on investment (ROI) and avoid dealing with middlemen if you buy more high-end real estate anywhere in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The HDWY token is now selling for a miniscule price, with an expected price increase to $1 at the start of 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Alameda Research-backed Ren Protocol has warned users of a potential risk of losses as it winds down its current Ren Version 1.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ren team stated that once version 1.0 is retired, users may not be able to recover their assets.&nbsp;</p>
Potential Losses As Version 1.0 Shuts Down&nbsp;
<p>Alameda Research-backed Ren Protocol, which issues the wrapped bitcoin asset RenBTC, warned users that they risk losing their assets once it shuts down its existing Ren 1.0 version. The project team encouraged users to redeem their tokens before the current version shuts down and the tokens lose all their value. The primary reason behind the shuttering of version 1.0 is the lack of funding after the collapse of Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developers added that users could unwrap their tokens and bridge them back to their native chains. The Ren team plans to disable mints on Ren shortly, meaning it would be impossible to deposit assets on the platform to bridge to other networks. Additionally, burns will also be disabled within 30 days.</p>
Compatibility Issues&nbsp;
<p>Once Ren&rsquo;s version 1.0 is shut down, it will be replaced by Ren 2.0, a new, community-run version. However, the Ren team warned that the two projects might not be compatible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As announced previously, the Ren 1.0 network is shutting down due to the events surrounding Alameda. As compatibility between Ren 1.0 and 2.0 cannot be guaranteed, holders of Ren assets should bridge back to native chains ASAP, or risk losing them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ren announced on the 18th of November that it was releasing a new protocol version. The announcement stated that the new protocol would be launched in parallel with the shutdown of the current version. This implied to users that current bridged assets may still be usable. However, the announcement has made it clear that current assets would not be usable on the new version of the platform and may be lost forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RenVM, the company behind the protocol, was acquired by Alameda Research in 2021. However, the collapse of Alameda necessitated the speeding up of the move to the new version of Ren.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marking this event as the end of Alameda&rsquo;s involvement in the project by sunsetting Ren 1.0 safeguards the reputation, integrity, and hence long-term prospects of the Ren ecosystem.</p>

<p>According to available data, there are currently 1130 renBTC currently on Ethereum.</p>
Users Are Confused And Angry&nbsp;
<p>The announcement from the Ren team has created considerable confusion and anger in the community as users woke up to the possibility of losing their assets in their entirety. Users also wondered if the Ren token itself was in any type of danger following recent events. One frustrated user vented,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we hold tokens on a CEX, do we need to do something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other users were confused, asking for clarification about their REN tokens and if the current update would impact those as well. Several users asked the Ren team to issue a clarification, adding that the announcement had led to panic selling. So far, the Ren team has not responded to these tweets. However, it did issue instructions on how users could check if they have bridged assets that need withdrawing.</p>
