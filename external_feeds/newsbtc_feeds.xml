Bitcoin recovered higher above the $16,800 resistance zone. The price is trading above $16,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a rising channel forming with resistance near $17,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could resume its decline unless there is a close above the $17,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance Bitcoin price found support near the $16,250 zone. BTC traded as low as $16,260 and started a recovery wave. There was a clear move above the $16,500 and $16,600 levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the $16,800 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price even spiked above the $17,000 resistance, but upsides were limited. A high was formed near $17,067 and the price is now trading in a range. Bitcoin price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,260 swing low to $17,067 high. It is now trading above $16,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a rising channel forming with resistance near $17,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,000 zone. The first major resistance is near the $17,200 zone.

The next major support is near the $16,650 zone. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,260 swing low to $17,067 high. A downside break below the $16,650 support might call for a drop towards the $16,260 level. Any more losses might send the price towards $16,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $16,800, followed by $16,650. Major Resistance Levels – $17,000, $17,200 and $17,500.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Grayscale Investments may offer to buy up to 20% of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust  (GBTC) shares. This is a move the company hopes will close the gap between the GBTC share price and the company&#8217;s underlying Bitcoin holdings. Grayscale Can&#8217;t Act Independent Of Investors The Wall Street Journal released a letter by Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein urging that Grayscale would consider issuing a tender offer should the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and shareholders give their approval. Being a close-ended fund, GBTC shareholders can only liquidate their holdings on the open market. Under the Williams Act (part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that governs tender offers in the US, an investor tendering for a security must disclose their source of funds, legal agreements related to the offer, and reasons for the offer. GBTC trades at $8.08 on the 24-hour chart. Source: TradingView If the company cannot return GBTC shareholders funds, it will continue to offer the tender until it&#8217;s converted to an ETF. Sonnenshein wrote to investors: In the event we are unsuccessful in pursuing options for returning a portion of the capital to shareholders, we do not currently intend to dissolve GBTC, but would instead continue to operate GBTC without an ongoing redemption program until we are successful in converting it to a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with the SEC after its application to convert GBTC to a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 29, 2022. The letter by the CEO was an attempt to ease shareholder concerns after a turbulent few months across the crypto market. Related Reading: GBTC Unlocks Spells Doom For Bitcoin? Top Expert Breaks It Down ETF Conversion Seems To Be Only Option As it stands, Grayscale doesn&#8217;t have a specific timeline for when it may explore other options apart from the ETF conversion. The lawsuit seems to be a long-drawn battle. Grayscale filed its opening brief against the SEC on Oct. 11, 2022. In response, SEC filed a brief on Dec. 13, 2022 denying Grayscale&#8217;s accusations that its rejection was discriminatory and arbitrary. The firm has until Jan. 13, 2023 to respond. Afterwards, a three-judge panel will be selected to listen to oral arguments and rule on the case. Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust has roughly $10.78 billion or 633,000 BTC in assets under management. The fund has failed to meet its goal, and it&#8217;s currently changing hands at a 48.8% discount to Bitcoin. Source: YCharts Sonnenshein didn&#8217;t clarify if the business may later sell off its Bitcoin holdings. However, a market dump like Grayscale could see Bitcoin crashin to a fresh yearly low. Grayscale selling off its Bitcoin stash could also drive down confidence in crypto as significant liquidations for those engaged in Bitcoin derivatives markets. This would hurt crypto volumes, and send a bearish crypto market further down.

					<description><![CDATA[Despite the market downturn, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still seeing growth in terms of its holder base. The meme coin maintains its position as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies as its total holder count has now crossed 1.26 million. 10,000 New Shiba Inu Holders Added In a time when cryptocurrencies across the space are marking a decline in support, Shiba Inu has added over 10,000 new holders in the span of two weeks. This saw the total SHIB holders cross into the 1.26 million territory, marking more growth for the meme coin. In the last 24 hours alone, the number is up by 0.033%, according to data from Etherscan. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Balks As Dormant Whales Reactivate The meme coin also recently marked another milestone after it crossed more than 1.8 million watchlists on Coinmarketcap. The growth comes even as the price of the digital asset suffers multiple setbacks, drastically dragging down the profit margins for investors.

The holder base had been consistently climbing over the last two months but the price of SHIB has not reacted positively in any way. Instead, developments on Shiba Inu seem to be disconnected from the price performance of the native token. Related Reading: Binance Smart Chain User Activity Tanks, Why BNB Price Could Suffer With no meaningful movement following all of these, then it is possible that the meme coin will not be seeing any sort of recovery before the year runs out. It continues to trend just above $0.000008 as the bear market rages on. It is important to keep in mind that the total number of active Shiba Inu addresses currently sits below 5% of its total addresses. This means that there is a decreased activity for the digital asset, which could explain why there have been no positive reactions to the milestones.  The cryptocurrency has also fallen out of favor with large Ethereum whales who no longer hold a significant amount of the cryptocurrency on their balances. This has accelerated the bear case for the meme coin.

					<description><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market continues to feel the darkness of crypto winter, but it could be Litecoin bringing the blossom of a new bull trend, according to a an eerily similar fractal found in LTCUSD daily price charts.  The fractal pattern developed following the most recent pullback, and appears to have a similar structure to a major bull market breakout. Could this be the light at the end of the tunnel for cryptocurrencies?

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) remains one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies even before the bear market was officially in full bloom. The digital asset which had seen returns higher than 1,000% during the 2021 bull run would eventually see almost the entirety of those gains wiped out. Despite this, it had been able to maintain above a critical point for a long time. However, the cryptocurrency has now lost its footing, leading to an incredibly bearish outlook for the asset. ADA Price Falls Below $0.3 For a digital asset such as ADA, maintaining above $0.3 was important for it at a time when assets in the space needed to hold on to their critical support levels. Most of Cardano’s investors had thrown their hat in the ring to hold the bears off at $0.3, something they succeeded at until the FTX collapse happened.

However, this time around, there was no recovery to save the digital asset and it would continue to spiral down.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows signs aren&#8217;t looking good for Bitcoin as the NVT ratio is indicating that the crypto is still overvalued right now. Bitcoin NVT Ratio Continues To Be At High Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC is currently overvalued from an on-chain perspective. The &#8220;Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its transaction volume (both in USD). This ratio judges whether the current value of Bitcoin (that is, the market cap) is fair or not, by comparing it against the network&#8217;s ability to transact coins right now (the transaction volume). When the metric has a high value, it means the price of BTC is high compared to the volume, and thus the coin could be inside a bubble at the moment. On the other hand, low values suggest BTC may be undervalued as the chain has a high ability to transact coins (in comparison to the market cap) right now. Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Slide, Now Below Shiba Inu In Market Cap Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT ratio over the past year: Looks like the metric's value has been pretty high during recent weeks &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph highlights, the Bitcoin NVT ratio jumped up following the LUNA collapse back in May of this year and has since mostly stayed at similar or higher levels. This means that despite the price observing multiple crashes in the period, the coin&#8217;s value still became increasingly overvalued as volumes across the market sharply dropped. Even after the FTX crash, which has delivered another solid blow to the crypto&#8217;s market cap, the metric has only climbed higher as it has registered a new high for the year recently. BTC has only been getting more and more overpriced as the bear has gotten deeper, suggesting the dire state of the market in terms of trading volumes.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain data shows signs aren&#8217;t looking good for Bitcoin as the NVT ratio is indicating that the crypto is still overvalued right now.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin NVT Ratio Continues To Be At High Values</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63a07ede36ec775f47466f3b-BTC-Evaluation-and-Trading-Perspective-from-On-Chain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">post</a>, BTC is currently overvalued from an on-chain perspective.

<p>This ratio judges whether the current value of Bitcoin (that is, the market cap) is fair or not, by comparing it against the network&#8217;s ability to transact coins right now (the transaction volume). When the metric has a high value, it means the price of BTC is high compared to the volume, and thus the coin could be inside a bubble at the moment. On the other hand, low values suggest BTC may be undervalued as the chain has a high ability to transact coins (in comparison to the market cap) right now.</p>

<p>Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT ratio over the past year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/165524/quicktake/elWHFI3Ko_4ade16ab9a5ca400aa560adf3c6692e22209f53fe4253aa66145fc2399c8b36f.png" alt="Bitcoin NVT ratio" width="1778" height="1125" /></p>

<p>Both these signs are certainly not in the favor of Bitcoin and may imply there is further pain ahead for investors. &#8220;A more extended bear market could be seen as a potential risk that could add selling pressure,&#8221; explains the analyst.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a surprising turnaround in its monetary policy today, the Bitcoin price managed to rise near the important resistance level of $16,900. The BOJ announced that it will drastically widen its yield curve control band to 0.50%. At the same time, it announced that it will significantly increase the number of government bonds it will buy each month. According to Bloomberg senior commodities analyst Mike McGlone, this trend could continue. McGlone shared his insights via Twitter and said that a &#8220;warm spell&#8221; is ahead for Bitcoin. As the analyst notes, BTC has taken a beating as a risk asset in 2022 with most other cryptocurrencies, but &#8220;appears poised to resume its inclination to outperform.&#8221; This will happen when the U.S. Federal Reserve eases monetary policy and completes its pivot. Bitcoin Is Set To Outperform When&#8230; According to the chart from a Bloomberg Intelligence report, the levels that BTC and the Nasdaq 100 stock index have been resisting have now turned into support. According to the analysis, the BTC price soared in 2020 and 2021 due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, allowing it to outperform the stock index. McGlone further elaborated: At a Bitcoin/ Nasdaq ratio of 1.5x on Dec. 16, what&#8217;s been consistent for most of the benchmark crypto&#8217;s history is its declining relative risk vs. the stock index. At 2x, Bitcoin&#8217;s annual volatility at the end of 2022 compares with 4x at the end of 2021. In the coming year of 2023, McGlone expects that it will be a matter of how much lower global economies fall. Investors should by no means underestimate BTC then, as the risk/reward ratio is in favor of the leading cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off $16,300, Here’s Why &#8220;Risk vs. reward appears to argue against under-allocating or estimating the propensity for Bitcoin to continue its trajectory toward becoming digital collateral,&#8221; McGlone claimed. In other words, the Bloomberg analyst predicts that as soon as the U.S. Federal Reserve fires up its money printer again, cuts interest rates and returns to monetary easing, Bitcoin will &#8220;outperform&#8221; the rest of the market again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Topside Bias Vulnerable If It Continues To Struggle Below $17K In another tweet, McGlone predicted that the leading cryptocurrency will outperform the Tesla stock. &#8220;The near-certain decline in Bitcoin supply compared to the rising number of Tesla shares outstanding favors cryptocurrency outperformance when the rules of economics apply,&#8221; McGlone said. BTC Price At Crucial Level Meanwhile, the BTC price needs to crack the extremely crucial $16,900 level in the short term and could then have a strong continuation. If so, investors should then keep an eye on the next vital resistance in the $17,350 area. Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>In other words, the Bloomberg analyst predicts that as soon as the U.S. Federal Reserve fires up its money printer again, cuts interest rates and returns to monetary easing, Bitcoin will &#8220;outperform&#8221; the rest of the market again.</p>

<p>In another tweet, McGlone predicted that the leading cryptocurrency will outperform the Tesla stock. &#8220;The near-certain decline in Bitcoin supply compared to the rising number of <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/rumors-of-microstrategy-selling-bitcoin-grow-with-teslas-disclosure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla shares</a> outstanding favors cryptocurrency outperformance when the rules of economics apply,&#8221; McGlone said.</p>
<h2>BTC Price At Crucial Level</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the BTC price needs to crack the extremely crucial $16,900 level in the short term and could then have a strong continuation. If so, investors should then keep an eye on the next vital resistance in the $17,350 area.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Bitcoin &#8220;mid-term&#8221; holders have been on the move during the past day, suggesting that they may be dumping currently. Bitcoin 3-6 Months Age Band Shows Large Spike In Spent Outputs As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, an increase in the spent outputs for the 3-6 months group has resulted in big moves for BTC before. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;Spent Output Age Bands,&#8221; which tells us which age bands in the Bitcoin market are moving how many coins right now. These &#8220;age bands&#8221; are groups that define ranges between which the coins (or holders) falling into said band last showed any movement or selling. For instance, the &#8220;1m-3m&#8221; age band includes all tokens that have been sitting dormant since at least 1 month and at most 3 months ago. If holders belonging to this group shift their coins, then the move will show up as a spike on the spent outputs chart for the band.

Here is a chart that shows the trend in the spent output metric for it during the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have shot up during the last day &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph displays, the spent output metric has recorded a large value for the 3m-6m Bitcoin age band recently. The holders belonging to this group are sometimes referred to as the &#8220;mid-term holders,&#8221; because of the fact that their range covers the boundary between the short-term holder and the long-term holder cohorts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Monthly Momentum Reaches Worst On Record From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that generally whenever this holder group has shown signs of heavy dumping, the price of BTC has observed a steep decline shortly after. The latest crash following the collapse of FTX, too, was preceded by a large movement from these investors. After the current spike, Bitcoin has actually already seen a short-term drop, as the below chart shows. However, it&#8217;s unclear at the moment whether this decline was all there is going to be. If past examples are anything to go by, Bitcoin usually observes a large move whenever this trend forms, which implies the real decline from the latest spike may be yet to come.

					<description><![CDATA[Current market conditions hinder bullish market movements even for Bitcoin, which is arguably the king of cryptocurrencies. Recently, a crypto analyst named nino released an analysis showing that long-term Bitcoin positions are being liquidated.  As this develops, experts in the cryptocurrency market have warned that the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s efforts to rein in inflation through monetary tightening are unlikely to ease any time soon, thus has the potential to impact on BTC price. Warming Up For The Crypto Winter  Nino used the Long Term Output Profit Ratio indicator. This measures whether long-term holders who sold their holdings are taking profit.  As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $16,855, down 1.9% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Nino found that after the CPI and FOMC announcements, Bitcoin values saw significant fluctuation. Soon after this occurred, the LTOPR skyrocketed. Many long-term Bitcoin holders may have cashed out their holdings at this time.

					<description><![CDATA[After beating France in the dramatic final of the 2022 Soccer World Cup in Qatar on Monday, Argentina won its third world title. The win that Argentina achieved is destined to go down in history as a momentous event. But, despite the dramatic victory, the country&#8217;s fan token ARG shed nearly half of its value, trading for as low as $2.68 from over $6, down 24% in the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko shows. The European soccer token lost 49.5% of its value. market cap likewise decreased by half &#8211; from $22 million to $11 million over the same timeframe.

ARGENTINA ARE WORLD CHAMPIONS!! 🇦🇷#FIFAWorldCup &#124; #Qatar2022 — FIFA World Cup (@FIFAWorldCup) December 18, 2022 World Cup Win Fails To Kickstart ARG Price The reduction in the value of the crypto asset is unexpected, as holders anticipated the victory would boost ARG&#8217;s valuation. ARG lost approximately 30 percent of its value in the first few days of the competition after Argentina&#8217;s shocking loss to Saudi Arabia. ARG, a token issued via the consumer-facing platform of Socios.com that offers its owners an increased fan interaction with the Argentine squad, had earlier rallied on major victories, such as the semi-final match against Croatia. ARG was introduced in July 2021 and surged above $9 on November 18 — two days prior to the start of the World Cup. It has dropped roughly 70 percent from its all-time high since then. Meanwhile, ARG&#8217;s price performance after the World Cup is comparable to that of other fan tokens. The majority of them were in the red zone over the last 24 hours. Chart: FanMarketCap Fan Tokens Wash Up In Crimson Tide According to data from FanMarketCap, majority of the top 10 fan tokens were down in the 24-hour and seven-day timeframes. ARG, at No. 8, has lost 24.45% of its value in the last week. Fan tokens are a unique form of cryptocurrency that grants access to a variety of fan-centric activities. Activities that involve fans include voting on certain club choices and receiving special match ticket discounts, and other such things. Fan tokens were initiated by prominent sports clubs such as AC Milan, Santos FC,  Inter Milan, and FC Porto, etc. During the COVID-19 shutdown, fan tokens grew in popularity.

Crypto total market cap still below the $800 billion mark today &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Due to pandemic regulations, it was difficult ffor sports organizations to obtain cash in any other way and these fan tokens provided a stream of revenue. Held every four years, the World Cup is the most watched and followed single sporting event in history, and it also happens to be the most prestigious football tournament on the planet. Given its history of extreme volatility and unpredictability, even in its response to Argentine national football team performances, it is difficult to predict the future of the ARG coin.]]></description>

<h2>World Cup Win Fails To Kickstart ARG Price</h2>
<p>The reduction in the value of the crypto asset is unexpected, as holders anticipated the victory would boost ARG&#8217;s valuation.</p>
<p>ARG lost approximately 30 percent of its value in the first few days of the competition after Argentina&#8217;s shocking loss to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>ARG, a token issued via the consumer-facing platform of Socios.com that offers its owners an increased fan interaction with the Argentine squad, had earlier rallied on major victories, such as the semi-final match against Croatia.</p>
<p>ARG was introduced in July 2021 and surged above $9 on November 18 — two days prior to the start of the World Cup. It has dropped roughly 70 percent from its all-time high since then.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ARG&#8217;s price performance after the World Cup is comparable to that of other fan tokens. The majority of them were in the red zone over the last 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Fan Tokens Wash Up In Crimson Tide</h2>
<p>According to data from<a href="https://www.fanmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> FanMarketCap,</a> majority of the top 10 fan tokens were down in the 24-hour and seven-day timeframes. ARG, at No. 8, has lost 24.45% of its value in the last week.</p>
<p>Fan tokens are a unique form of cryptocurrency that grants access to a variety of fan-centric activities. Activities that involve fans include voting on certain club choices and receiving special match ticket discounts, and other such things.</p>
<p>Fan tokens were initiated by prominent sports clubs such as AC Milan, Santos FC,  Inter Milan, and FC Porto, etc. During the COVID-19 shutdown, fan tokens grew in popularity.</p>

<p>Due to pandemic regulations, it was difficult ffor sports organizations to obtain cash in any other way and these fan tokens provided a stream of revenue.</p>
<p>Held every four years, the World Cup is the most watched and followed single sporting event in history, and it also happens to be the most prestigious football tournament on the planet.</p>
<p>Given its history of extreme volatility and unpredictability, even in its response to Argentine national football team performances, it is difficult to predict the future of the ARG coin.</p>
