This cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu dog-inspired logo, has garnered significant attention in the crypto community. As the highly anticipated Shibarium launch draws near, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is riding on bullish momentum.  In terms of the 7 days price gain, the meme coin is outperforming other notable assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE), representing less than 1% price increase. Investors and enthusiasts are now considering whether to buy in as the project&#8217;s new development unfolds.  SHIB Price Gains Momentum As Shibarium Nears A recent examination of on-chain data by IntoTheBlock exposed a remarkable rise in transactions related to SHIB ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, demonstrating an astounding surge of 300% over the last month. The current upward movement can also be linked to a post by the main developer, Shytoshi Kusama, on July 31.

After Shibarium is launched, more people could want to invest in the $SHIB token, as it might create a new wave of excitement. Technical Indicators Signal Bullish Momentum As the Shibarium launch nears, the coin experienced bullish sentiment evident in the 4-green candles on the daily chart. According to the chart, SHIB/USDT has approached the upper Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting a high bullish pressure.  The upper Bollinger Band is a resistance level, indicating that the coin&#8217;s price might be challenging to sustain further upward movement without a pullback. A breach of the upper Bollinger Band could signal a continuation of the uptrend, but if the price fails to break through and starts to decline, it might indicate the beginning of a retracement.  With the RSI level at 69, the coin&#8217;s price might hover in the overbought territory, suggesting a potential slowing down or a reversal. However, the MACD above the signal line indicates positive momentum and potential upward movement.  So the RSI indicates that the coin might be due for a corrective pullback, but the MACD suggests there is still buying interest.  Related Reading: Bittrex, SEC Reach Settlement In Securities Violation Case Considering the analysis, the coin could observe a period of consolidation or a minor dip before a potential continuation of the upward trend. Traders should closely monitor price action, especially around key support levels at $0.0000077, and be prepared for potential short-term volatility. As of today, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000105. According to CoinGecko statistics, it has advanced by 18% &#38; 24% over the last 7 and 14 days, respectively.
