<p>Following on from the huge impact made by Open AI and Chat GPT in the artificial intelligence space, the huge interest fermented in AI has turned its gaze on AI projects in the crypto sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the top crypto AI projects are making strides in the industry by utilising blockchain technology to create decentralised, transparent, and secure marketplaces for AI services and data. Each project has its own unique approach and set of features that make it well-suited for different types of AI projects and use cases.</p>
SingularityNET
<p>SingularityNET is an open-source, decentralised platform that allows for the creation, sharing, and monetization of AI services. It utilises blockchain technology to create a marketplace for AI services, where developers can create and share their AI models, and users can access and utilise these models to improve their own businesses or projects. The platform also allows for the creation of decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) that can govern the use and development of AI on the platform.</p>
Ocean Protocol
<p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralised data exchange protocol that allows for the secure sharing of data between organisations and individuals. The platform utilises blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent marketplace for data, allowing data providers to monetize their data while also giving data users access to high-quality, verified data. Ocean Protocol also includes a number of tools for data science and AI, such as data curation, data governance, and machine learning workflows, making it an ideal platform for AI projects.</p>
DeepBrain Chain
<p>DeepBrain Chain is a decentralised AI computing platform that uses blockchain technology to create a secure and efficient marketplace for AI computation. The platform allows users to share their idle computing resources to train and run AI models, while also providing a secure and private environment for data storage and computation. This allows for the creation of a decentralised, distributed AI network that can be used to train and run AI models at a lower cost and with higher efficiency than traditional centralised systems.</p>
AIgatha
<p>AIgatha is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to create and share their own AI models, as well as access and utilise the AI models created by others. The platform utilises smart contracts to facilitate the sharing and monetization of AI models, allowing for a decentralised and transparent marketplace for AI services. Additionally, AIgatha also includes a number of tools for data science and AI, such as data curation and machine learning workflows, making it an ideal platform for AI projects.</p>
Cortex&nbsp;
<p>Cortex is a decentralised AI platform that allows users to submit their AI models to the platform and be rewarded in the platform's native cryptocurrency, CORTEX, for their contributions. The platform also allows users to access and utilise the AI models on the platform, creating a decentralised and transparent marketplace for AI services. Additionally, Cortex also includes a number of tools for data science and AI, such as data curation and machine learning workflows, making it an ideal platform for AI projects.</p>
Vectorspace AI
<p>Vectorspace AI is a cryptocurrency and blockchain-based platform that utilises natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create a decentralised and transparent marketplace for trading algorithms. The platform allows users to create, share, and monetize their own trading algorithms, while also providing a secure and transparent environment for the use and execution of these algorithms. Additionally, Vectorspace AI also includes a number of tools for data science and AI, such as data curation and machine learning workflows, making it an ideal platform for trading and investment related AI projects.</p>
