The Shiba Inu community has remained consistent in burning SHIB tokens. In a week, it sent a whopping 1,748,403,277 SHIB tokens to the project’s dead wallet. The burning mechanism is part of the processes that the Shiba Inu uses to maintain stability in its ecosystem. It is a strong measure to reclaim the value of the SHIB token as it removes more coins from circulation.  Community Burns 1.74B Tokens Through 20 Different Transactions According to data from the Shiba Inu burning portal, Shibburn, over 1.74 billion SHIB coins were burned within 7 days. The community completed the burning mechanism for the week through 20 different transactions.

But SHIB’s value is yet to mark a remarkable recovery.  The entire crypto market has been battling with the influence of the bears pushing most assets’ prices to the bearish zone. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00000886, indicating a slight gain of 0.80% over the past 24 hours. Its market cap is $5.22 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $96 million. Its 7-day and 30-day price actions indicated a drop of 1.40% and 20.74%, respectively. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview.com
