<h2>Fidelity&#8217;s Crypto and Metaverse Trademark Applications</h2>
<p>Fidelity Investments filed three trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) last week for a wide range of cryptocurrency, non-fungible token (NFT), and metaverse products and services. Fidelity has $9.6 trillion in assets under administration as of Sept. 30; the financial services firm serves about 40 million individual investors.</p>
<p>Mike Kondoudis, a USPTO-licensed trademark attorney, tweeted Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fidelity has plans for the metaverse! The company has filed 3 trademark applications covering NFTs + NFT marketplaces, metaverse investment services, virtual real estate investing, cryptocurrency trading, and more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial services giant&#8217;s trademark applications were filed on Dec. 21. Their serial numbers are 97727473, 97727439, and 97727409.</p>
<p>The applications specifically detail a vast number of products and services &#8220;in the metaverse and other virtual worlds,&#8221; including mutual fund investment services, retirement fund investment services, investment management services, financial planning, securities brokerage services, money management, financial analysis, and investment management.</p>

<p>Fidelity is no stranger to the metaverse. In April, the financial services firm opened a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-launches-multi-level-learning-center-in-metaverse/">multi-level learning center</a> called &#8220;The Fidelity Stack&#8221; in Decentraland. The firm also launched a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-investments-launches-crypto-metaverse-etfs-says-we-continue-to-see-demand/">metaverse exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) in the same month.</p>
<p>In November, Fidelity Investments began offering commission-free <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-investments-launching-commission-free-retail-crypto-trading-for-bitcoin-and-ether/">retail bitcoin and ether trading</a>. However, its subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets has been offering bitcoin services to institutional investors for several years and recently began offering <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelitys-crypto-platform-prepares-to-start-offering-ethereum-trading-next-week/">ether trading</a>. The firm published a report earlier this year, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-future-of-crypto-ecosystem-bitcoin-superior-form-of-money/">stating</a>: &#8220;Bitcoin&#8217;s first technological breakthrough was not as a superior payment technology but as a superior form of money. As a monetary good, bitcoin is unique.&#8221;</p>
<p>A growing number of big corporations are filing cryptocurrency and metaverse-related trademark applications with the USPTO. This month, banking giant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/banking-giant-hsbc-files-trademarks-for-a-wide-range-of-digital-currency-and-metaverse-products/">HSBC</a> filed trademark applications for a range of digital currency and metaverse products. In October, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/visa-files-trademark-applications-covering-a-range-of-cryptocurrency-products-including-crypto-wallet/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Visa</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-and-western-union-file-trademarks-for-wide-range-of-crypto-services/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Paypal, and Western Union</a> similarly filed crypto-related trademark applications. Last month, JPMorgan Chase was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-granted-wallet-trademark-covering-various-virtual-currency-and-crypto-payment-services/" target="_self" rel="noopener">granted</a> a wallet trademark covering various virtual currency and payment services.</p>

The regulator explained that the cryptocurrencies were transferred to its wallets &#8220;for safekeeping&#8221; and &#8220;are being held by the Commission on a temporary basis.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Bahamas Regulator Seizes FTX&#8217;s Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>The Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB) said Thursday that it has obtained a court order to transfer the digital assets owned by, or under the custody or control of, FTX Digital Markets Ltd. (FTXDM) to its secure wallets. FTX Digital Markets is the Bahamian subsidiary of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX Trading Ltd., which owned and operated the crypto trading platform FTX.com.</p>
<p>The regulator wrote that on Nov. 12:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Commission … took the action of directing the transfer of all digital assets under the custody or control of FTXDM or its principals, valued at more than US$3.5 billion, based on market pricing at the time of transfer, to digital wallets controlled by the Commission, for safekeeping.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Commission added that it is exercising &#8220;its powers as regulator acting under the authority of an order made by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas.&#8221; The regulator stressed that the process did not &#8220;involve the creation of any additional tokens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seized cryptocurrencies &#8220;are being held by the Commission on a temporary basis, until such time as the Bahamas Supreme Court directs the Commission to deliver them to the customers and creditors who own them, or to the JPLs [Joint Provisional Liquidators] to be administered under rules governing the insolvency estate for the benefit of the customers and creditors of FTXDM,&#8221; the regulator clarified.</p>

<p>The Securities Commission noted that the seizure was conducted &#8220;under a sealing order requested by the Commission and granted by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas&#8221; on Nov. 16. The regulator reiterated that contrary to some media reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Commission did not in any way direct, authorize, or suggest to FTXDM the prioritization of withdrawals for Bahamian clients.</p></blockquote>
<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 and an estimated one million customers and investors lost billions of dollars. The U.S. government and regulators have filed multiple fraud charges against the crypto firm and Bankman-Fried. The former FTX CEO was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the U.S. last week. He is currently at his parents&#8217; house in Palo Alto, California, on a $250 million bond.</p>
<p>However, FTX disputed the claims by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas Friday that the regulator is holding $3.5 billion of FTX assets. FTX argued that the value of the cryptocurrency at the time of transfer was approximately <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-provide-information-concerning-bahamas-crypto-seizure-301711610.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$296 million</a>.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note (Dec. 30 at 9:12 p.m. EST): This article has been updated to include FTX&#8217;s dispute that the regulator is holding $3.5 billion.</em></p>

Fong detailed she managed to interview SBF, while Lewis visited to presumably get information on the downfall of the FTX empire for the writer’s upcoming book.</strong></p>
<h2>SBF Gets 2 Visitors While on House Arrest and Before His Jan. 3 Arraignment in New York</h2>
<p>Since SBF was released on bail, reports note that two people have been granted access to visit the disgraced former FTX CEO while he’s on house arrest. Tiffany Fong <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1608236382220345344?s=20&amp;t=BUjkxQOYhRhWoAFa4DP9jQ">disclosed</a> that she met with SBF and noted that she had not written anything yet when she tweeted about her discussion with SBF on Dec. 28.</p>

<p>The following day, The New York Post published an <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/28/sam-bankman-fried-optimistic-at-meeting-with-crypto-influencer/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">article</a> about Fong’s visit, and the article’s authors Selim Algar, Andy Tillett, and Patrick Reilly decided to call Fong a “sexy crypto influencer.” The Post also used a picture of Fong wearing a bikini and when the article was published, Fong was not pleased with the depiction. “Jesus fkn christ,” Fong <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1608268282360107009?s=20&amp;t=BUjkxQOYhRhWoAFa4DP9jQ">said</a>, sharing the article.</p>
<p>Fong also <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1608275203536359424?s=20&amp;t=BUjkxQOYhRhWoAFa4DP9jQ">detailed</a> that she “obviously was not wearing a bikini” when she interviewed SBF, and she said The Post “decided to creep [through her] old pics.” In addition to The Post, the Daily Mail also published an article about her visit, and Fong said the Daily Mail reporters noted that she was not pleased with the use of an irrelevant old bikini photo in The Post’s article.</p>
<p>“As soon as I offered a sliver of commentary in response to their questions, [Daily Mail] immediately switched their photo of me to a bikini photo,” Fong <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1608564190243098629?s=20&amp;t=BUjkxQOYhRhWoAFa4DP9jQ">said</a>, sharing a screenshot of the original article and then the changed version. In addition to Fong’s statements, Taylor Lorenz from the Washington Post tweeted about the treatment Fong received from The Post and Daily Mail.</p>
<p>“[Tiffany Fong] has gotten big scoops while tirelessly covering FTX,” Lorenz <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1608574470817746944?s=20&amp;t=BUjkxQOYhRhWoAFa4DP9jQ">tweeted</a>. “She’s respected by mainstream tech/finance journalists at Wapo, NYT, etc. What she does is journalism, but because she’s a young woman (&amp; using the internet to reach her audience) this is how the media treats her.”</p>
<p>Fong also tweeted about how The Post wrote an article about the “Big Short” author Michael Lewis’s visit with SBF when she <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1608567329025331201?s=20&amp;t=BUjkxQOYhRhWoAFa4DP9jQ">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Michael Lewis actually ‘spent several hours’ with Sam Bankman-Fried before I did. Is Michael Lewis being sexualized [and] bombarded with questions about whether or not they ‘banged?’</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/27/sam-bankman-fried-met-with-big-short-author-michael-lewis/amp/">article</a> featuring Lewis and published by The New York Post is a whole lot different than Fong’s article, and it does not show Lewis in his swim trunks or speedos. The Post editorial about Lewis is quite similar to a great deal of the write-ups concerning the “Big Short,” “Moneyball,” and “Flash Boys” author getting to spend six months with SBF before FTX collapsed.</p>

<p>The Post&#8217;s article highlights how Lewis’s “publishing agency [is] pitching the book to potential movie rights buyers” and reports of the pitch sale were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hollywood-streaming-giants-scramble-for-movie-rights-to-ftx-saga/">disclosed</a> well before SBF was arrested. The news of SBF having two visitors, after being released on house arrest, also follows <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disgraced-ftx-co-founder-accused-of-moving-684k-in-crypto-assets-while-under-house-arrest/">accusations</a> that allege the former FTX CEO moved $684K in crypto assets associated with Alameda addresses. In The Post’s article, the authors detailed that Fong had further noted that SBF was on his computer during the duo’s discussion.</p>

As 2022 comes to an end, statistics show that none of the so-called &#x2018;Ethereum killers&#x2019; have surpassed the leading smart contract platform token, and a number of these tokens have lost considerable amounts of value during the crypto winter.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum Outperformed Its Competitors in terms of Market Cap, Decentralized Finance Action, and Non-Fungible Token Sales</h2>
<p>On Dec. 23, 2021, the top smart contract platform coins held an overall valuation of around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211223221620/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform">$823 billion</a> and at that time, ethereum&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) market capitalization represented 59.42% of the aggregate. Today, on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform">Dec. 30, 2022</a>, the crypto economy&#x2019;s top smart contract platform coins are valued at $239 billion, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s market cap is roughly $144 billion. Data indicates that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s market cap equates to 60.25% of the aggregate value of all the top smart contract platform tokens listed today.</p>
<p>Last year, when the smart contract platform coin economy was a lot more valuable, many people thought <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> could get &#x2018;flipped&#x2019; by a bunch of &#x2018;<a href="https://www.realvision.com/blog/what-are-ethereum-killers">Ethereum killers</a>.&#x2019; Roughly a year ago, the publication Forkast published an <a href="https://forkast.news/top-five-ethereum-killers/">editorial</a> called &#x201C;The Top Five Ethereum Killers,&#x201D; and it included tokens like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, solana (SOL), cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>), avalanche (AVAX), and polkadot (DOT). While some of these coins were top ten contenders in Dec. 2021, only <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> remain, and Polygon (MATIC) recently entered the top ten standings.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211224120437/https://www.coingecko.com/en">Dec. 24, 2021</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> was exchanging hands for $547.12 per unit, and it was the second largest smart contract platform coin at the time. Today, it still is the second-largest smart contract platform token, but the digital currency&#x2019;s value has dropped 55.19% from the $547 price point recorded in Dec. 2021. Last year, solana (SOL) was the third largest smart contract platform token and over a year ago, it was trading for $189.43 per unit at the end of Dec. 2021. Today, SOL holds the seventh-largest smart contract coin market cap and SOL holds the 19th-largest capitalization in the entire crypto economy.</p>

<p>Metrics show the smart contract coin SOL has lost 94.81% of its U.S. dollar value since Dec. 23, 2021. Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>) was the fourth-largest smart contract asset and on Dec. 23, 2021, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> was trading for $1.48 per unit. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> also was the seventh-largest market cap in the entire crypto economy. Today, on Dec. 30, 2022, cardano is trading for $0.24 per coin, and it&#x2019;s moved down to the ninth largest market valuation. On Dec. 23, 2021, Terra&#x2019;s LUNA was the fifth largest smart contract coin at the time, and LUNA (now called LUNC) was trading for $93.24 per coin. LUNA was also the ninth-largest market cap in the entire crypto-economy during the last month of 2021.</p>

<p>LUNA&#x2019;s price has been completely obliterated, and it is now down to $0.000140 per unit on Dec. 30, 2022. Polkadot (DOT) was the sixth largest smart contract token; today, it&#x2019;s moved up to the fifth position. However, last year DOT was the tenth largest crypto market cap, but DOT is now in the 13th largest position. At the time, DOT was trading for $29.39 per unit on Dec. 23, 2021, but today, DOT is down 85.30% and trading for $4.32 per coin. Avalanche (AVAX) was the seventh largest smart contract coin but today, AVAX now resides in the eighth position. On Dec. 23, 2021, AVAX exchanged hands for $121.88 per coin and on Dec. 30, 2022, it&#x2019;s down to $10.83 per unit.</p>

<p>Lastly, polygon was the seventh largest smart contract coin last year but today, its now in the fourth largest top smart contract token position. Furthermore, polygon (MATIC) was in the 14th largest position overall in Dec. 2021 and today it has managed to enter the tenth position. MATIC was trading for $2.67 per coin last year and today, it&#x2019;s down to $0.75 per unit, which is a loss of around 71.91%. While none of the so-called &#x2018;Ethereum killers&#x2019; managed to knock <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> down a notch, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> has lost a bit of dominance since Dec. 23, 2021. At that time, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> dominance was around 19.5% and today, the second-leading crypto asset&#x2019;s dominance is down to 17.4%.</p>

If the funds were spent by SBF, it goes against the court&#x2019;s release conditions that note the former FTX executive is not allowed to spend more than $1,000 without permission from the court. </strong></p>
<h2>Analyst Discovers Funds Tied to SBF&#x2019;s and Alameda&#x2019;s Wallets Moved While the FTX Co-Founder Is on House Arrest</h2>
<p>On Thursday, an analyst called &#x201C;Bowtiediguana&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/BowTiedIguana/status/1608653434387050496?s=20&t=GmWyat-p0b-tgHb2KPpBZA">published</a> a Twitter thread that shows Sam Bankman-Fried may have spent $684K while he is on house arrest. According to Bowtiediguana, in August 2020, SBF agreed to temporarily take over the decentralized exchange (dex) Sushiswap, after the anonymous founder Chef Nomi decided to leave. When the deal was made, SBF shared a public Ethereum address and Chef Nomi transferred ownership of Sushiswap to SBF&#x2019;s address.</p>

<p>&#x201C;After SBF was released, his wallet sent all its remaining crypto tokens to a new Ethereum address created an hour earlier,&#x201D; Bowtiediguana tweeted. &#x201C;In 3 hours, over 100 new deposits were made to this wallet from various addresses, most having links to SBFs defunct hedge fund Alameda Research.&#x201D; The analyst continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>In less than [four] hours, 570 [ethereum] worth approximately $684,000 was transferred out of this new wallet, to various destinations. Funds were sent to a no-KYC exchange based in Seychelles and to the Bitcoin network via the [Ren Protocol], a bridge funded by Alameda. Perhaps the SEC attorneys would like notice of this?</p></blockquote>
<p>The address in question is this <a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0x64e9b9cd74a46f71e7631cb033afa6e7849a8683">ethereum address</a> &#x201C;which received a further $1M from 11 wallets labeled as Alameda Research,&#x201D; Bowtiediguana said. &#x201C;[Five] separate transactions of 51 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> were used to move funds to newly created wallets [and] then onwards to a Seychelles-based exchange. [Three] tranches of 200K <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> were also sent from the SBF linked wallet to the Fixedfloat exchange,&#x201D; the analyst added.</p>
<p>Bowtiediguana&#x2019;s thread shows that an individual <a href="https://twitter.com/JWVerret/status/1608661175604219904?s=20&t=GmWyat-p0b-tgHb2KPpBZA">decided to email</a> the information to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about the latest onchain movements. Others tagged the U.S. regulator in the Twitter thread and <a href="https://twitter.com/ShadwySuprCod3r/status/1608733953065730048?s=20&t=GmWyat-p0b-tgHb2KPpBZA">said</a>: &#x201C;@secgov u gave [SBF] 2 long of a leash sires. plz address this criminal.&#x201D; It is unconfirmed at the moment as to who actually moved the funds, but many are speculating that it was SBF.</p>

<p>Since SBF&#x2019;s arrest and his later release, FTX and Alameda-related funds have been moving, and transfers have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/onchain-sleuths-discover-funds-linked-to-alameda-swapped-for-eth-usdt-btc-by-a-mysterious-entity/">caught</a> by onchain sleuths. Funds linked to Alameda were transferred two days ago and reportedly they were sent to Fixedfloat and Changenow and further converted into <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. In another instance, an Alameda-labeled wallet <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x85d579d2c85c1217a42eca7480c00cef28c019615b7caf0eaa3dca7e4a1dc412">sent</a> 11.37 wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) to a wallet after removing it from Aave on Dec. 29.</p>
<p>The same day, another Alameda-labeled wallet <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xae3fd1c114451d7468c6a83228b4cf495773b5eea90c3d261413473b427b79af">sent</a> 22,500 USDC on Dec. 29. Both of these transactions took place the day after a large swathe of ERC20 tokens linked to Alameda were moved on Wednesday, Dec. 28.</p>

Consequently, World Gold Council (WGC) statistics show the demand for gold by central banks has risen at the fastest pace in 55 years. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo&#8217;s head of real asset strategy, John LaForge, contends that when silver starts outperforming gold, it usually signals it is “closer to a bull market in precious metals versus the other way.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>The World&#8217;s Central Banks Are Hoarding Large Sums of Gold, China Recently Purchased 32 Tons of the Precious Metal</h2>
<p>Precious metals like gold and silver are ending the year a lot higher in value than they were 56 days ago on Nov. 3, 2022. Close to two months ago, on that day, a troy ounce of .999 fine gold was trading for $1,629 per unit and today, prices are 11.48% higher at <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">$1,816 per ounce</a>. A troy ounce of .999 fine silver was trading for $19.45 per unit on Nov. 3, and it’s increased 23.29% higher against the U.S. dollar at <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">$23.98 per ounce</a>.</p>

<p>World Gold Council (WGC) data shows that while there’s been a rise in retail demand, central banks are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/data-from-october-shows-gold-reserves-held-by-central-banks-tapped-the-highest-level-in-47-years/">hoarding gold</a> at an extremely fast pace. A number of <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/role-gold-may-be-changing-central-banks-panic-buy-precious-metals-2022">reports</a> citing WGC data show that the central banks&#8217; current demand for gold has risen at the fastest pace since 1967. China recently <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-announces-jump-in-gold-reserves-after-more-than-3-years-1.1855914">disclosed</a> that the country purchased 1.03 million ounces of fine gold or the equivalent of 32 tons of the precious metal. China&#8217;s State Administration of Foreign Exchange detailed the purchase cost the country around $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>China has a reported 63.67 million ounces of gold, which is worth roughly $112 billion. Adrian Ash, the head of research at Bullionvault <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77">told</a> Financial Times (FT) reporter Harry Dempsey that the central banks&#8217; flight to gold may suggest “the geopolitical backdrop is one of mistrust, doubt, and uncertainty.” While China is among gold reserve giants like Germany, the U.S., Russia, Italy, and France, a number of smaller central banks have also been buying large quantities of gold. To single out a few specific examples, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Qatar have accrued substantial sums of the precious metal in 2022.</p>
<h2>Wells Fargo Real Asset Strategy Analyst Says Silver Is Signaling a Possible Precious Metals Bull Market Breakout</h2>
<p>Wells Fargo&#8217;s head of real asset strategy, John LaForge, is looking at silver ahead of gold according to his recent <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-29/Gold-is-in-penalty-box-Wells-Fargo-on-why-gold-s-next-move-hinges-on-silver.html">commentary</a> with Kitco News on Dec. 29. &#8220;I am a little more positive on silver now that we are back to $23. It is the high-beta play. Silver is showing signs that whatever weakness we see in gold, it is probably short-lived,&#8221; LaForge told Kitco’s Anna Golubova.</p>
<p>&#8220;When silver starts beating gold, it is closer to a bull market in precious metals versus the other way,” the Wells Fargo executive added. LaForge believes gold prices will be anywhere between $1,900 to $2,000 in 2023, and he insists it&#8217;s quite possible silver could outperform the yellow precious metal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over a supercycle, which is 10+ years, percentage-wise, silver does better than gold,” LaForge remarked. “That&#8217;s what happened during the last cycle between 1999 and 2011. That is typical … You can sense gold wants to go higher next year. Gold had a rough two and a half years,&#8221; the Wells Fargo executive further elaborated.</p>

<p>“In the last couple of months, with all the talk about the Fed pivoting, gold started to perk up. Next year, both gold and silver will do well. Silver might do even better,&#8221; LaForge concluded. So far, with a 23.29% increase compared to gold&#8217;s 11.48% jump since Nov. 3, silver is doing a lot better than gold against the greenback. Platinum, too, has jumped a great deal, rising from $915 per ounce 56 days ago to today&#8217;s $1,051 per ounce.</p>

Analysts have recently linked the situation in peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto markets to the recent drop in the value of the bolivar.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Venezuelan Government to Monitor Crypto Transactions</h2>
<p>The Venezuelan government is aiming to monitor the the movements of crypto-based P2P exchanges to protect the value of the bolivar. On Dec. 20, the Venezuelan banking watchdog Sudeban <a href="https://twitter.com/SudebanInforma/status/1606035599768502273?s=20&amp;t=MqFZsVDKPbZT_sSSfSu31A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that it is in the process of designing a system to monitor banking transactions in real-time, with the help of Sunacrip, the national cryptocurrency regulator.</p>
<p>While no more details were offered, the organization explained the objective is to &#8220;fight the irregular practices that attack our currency and the stability of the exchange market.&#8221; This means that the government looks to be examining the link between the volumes exchanged in cryptocurrency markets and the U.S. dollar &#8211; Venezuelan bolivar exchange rate.</p>
<p>While the government has not stated explicitly there is a direct relation between these two variables, analysts have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-currency-plunges-almost-40-against-the-us-dollar-analysts-cite-crypto-drought-as-part-of-the-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked</a> the recent cryptocurrency drought in peer-to-peer markets due to the collapse of FTX, to the sudden rise in the aforementioned exchange rate. However, this is also said to be mixed in with other causes, such as the natural abundance of fiat currency in the market due to holiday-related payments.</p>
<p>Related to this measure, more than 75 bank accounts have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-banks-have-blocked-over-75-accounts-since-the-end-of-last-year-due-to-cryptocurrency-related-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked</a> due to suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency transactions since the end of 2021, according to Legalrocks, a national crypto-focused law firm.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Devaluation and Inflation Cocktail</h2>
<p>This would be one of the &#8220;drastic&#8221; measures that president Nicolas Maduro <a href="https://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/12072547/12/22/Las-medidas-drasticas-que-prepara-Maduro-para-frenar-la-devaluacion-del-bolivar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Dec. 11 in order to subdue the devaluation of the bolivar, which has gone from 12.66 bolivars per dollar on Nov. 28, to almost 20 bolivars per dollar on Dec. 28. This follows another high devaluation period in November, which saw the bolivar lose 40% of its value.</p>
<p>The behavior of the exchange rate has worried analysts, who are now examining the possible effects this will have on inflation rates for December and into next year. The country recently exited a period of hyperinflation that started in 2017 and lasted four years. Jose Guerra, a Venezuelan economist, <a href="https://www.bancaynegocios.com/economistas-aceleracion-inflacion-venezuela-diciembre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicts</a> a 30% inflation rate for December. The Central Bank of Venezuela has not released official inflation numbers since October, registering an increase of 119.4% in prices during the first 10 months of 2022.</p>

In a string of tweets, Dmitry Medvedev gave his two cents on what the future holds for the world, a “humble contribution,” as he put it, to the “wildest predictions” ahead of New Year’s Eve.</strong></p>
<h2>Medvedev Sees World Bank Crashing, Musk in the White House and Expensive Oil</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bretton Woods</a> monetary system will collapse next year causing the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to crash, according to the man who was at the helm of Russia for four years between two of Vladimir Putin’s presidential terms.</p>
<p>“Euro and dollar will stop circulating as the global reserve currencies. Digital fiat currencies will be actively used instead” while “all the largest stock markets and financial activity will leave the U.S. and Europe and move to Asia,” Dmitry Medvedev stated on social media.</p>
<p>Through a series of posts in a humorous tone this week, he gave his thoughts on what could happen in 2023. “On the New Year’s Eve, everybody’s into making predictions. Many come up with futuristic hypotheses, as if competing to single out the wildest, and even the most absurd ones. Here’s our humble contribution,” the leader of the ruling United Russia party tweeted on Monday.</p>
<p>Medvedev went on to forecast that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/oil-prices-north-of-200-per-barrel-investor-expects-oil-to-crush-every-investment-in-2023/">oil prices</a> will reach $150 a barrel and natural gas will top $5,000. He also expects the EU to collapse after the United Kingdom rejoins the bloc, and the euro to fall out of use. In a divided Europe, France and Germany will clash while Hungary and Poland will occupy parts of Western Ukraine, he added.</p>
<p>The Russian government official, now serving as Deputy Chairman of the country’s Security Council, sees California as an independent state and Texas leaving the U.S. to form an alliance with Mexico. “Elon Musk’ll win the presidential election in a number of states which, after the new Civil War’s end, will have been given to the GOP,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Dmitry Medvedev, who was also Russia’s prime minister between 2012 and 2020, and is regarded as a more liberal politician than Putin, has been quite active on social media since Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February. The military invasion was met with waves of Western sanctions. Days after the war started, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-may-nationalize-foreign-assets-in-response-to-western-sanctions-medvedev-says/">posted</a> that Russia may “nationalize” foreign assets in response to the penalties.</p>
<p>Throughout the outgoing year, Russian authorities have been working to expand the legal framework for digital assets and regulate cryptocurrencies, in particular their use for cross-border settlements amid financial restrictions. While the Bank of Russia, which is developing its own <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-digital-ruble-integrated-into-banking-app/">digital ruble</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-proposes-wide-ban-on-cryptocurrency-use-trade-mining/">proposed</a> a blanket ban on crypto transactions in the country, Medvedev <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-ban-in-russia-can-have-opposite-effect-medvedev-warns-as-opposition-mounts-against-proposal/">told</a> Russian media in January that a prohibition could have the opposite effect.</p>

<h2>The Growing Cost of Maintaining the Naira</h2>
<p>According to Aisha Ahmad, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), between the years 2017 and 2021, the apex bank spent an equivalent of nearly $1.8 billion, or 800 billion naira, managing the local currency. The production of new banknotes alone accounted for more than 90% of this figure.</p>
<p>As per remarks <a href="https://punchng.com/cbn-spends-n800bn-on-currency-production-destruction/">published</a> by the Punch, Ahmad, in her recent appearance before Nigerian lawmakers, also claimed that the cost of maintaining the local currency has been increasing by over $22 million annually. Before Ahmad’s disclosure, Kingsley Moghalu, a former CBN deputy governor, had also told lawmakers that the central bank uses approximately $336 million to manage the currency.</p>
<p>In addition to incurring high costs associated with managing the naira currency, the CBN has to contend with the increased risk of counterfeiting, the report said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in her testimony, Ahmad partly blamed the spiraling costs on what she characterized as wholesale hoarding of the naira by the Nigerian public.</p>
<p>&#8220;An observation supported by statistics shows that cash outside banks consists of over 80 per cent of the currency in circulation; worsening [the] shortage of fit banknotes in circulation. This portends [a] negative public perception of the bank and increases [the] threat to financial system stability,&#8221; Ahmad is quoted as saying.</p>
<p>To help the central bank overcome some of the challenges identified by Ahmad, the CBN <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-central-bank-says-it-will-release-new-banknotes-in-december-naira-falls-to-new-low/">introduced</a> into circulation newly designed naira banknotes on Dec. 15. At the same time, the bank said Nigerian residents in possession of the old banknotes should return these before or by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>CBN Not Targeting Politicians</h2>
<p>The central bank has also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-central-bank-increases-cash-withdrawal-limits-after-receiving-feedback-from-stakeholders/">restricted</a> the amount of cash that individuals and corporate organizations can withdraw. However, some Nigerian commentators have accused the CBN of using the so-called naira redesign policy to target politicians. Responding to these allegations, Ahmad reportedly told lawmakers that the bank&#8217;s decision to limit cash withdrawals was based on research.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to make it very clear that the CBN is an independent institution and our decisions are taken based on research — it is the work of many teams working together across the different directories,&#8221; Ahmad reportedly said.</p>

<h2>Kevin O&#x2019;Leary&#x2019;s &#x2018;Fake&#x2019; Bitcoin and Ether Giveaways</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The official Twitter account for Shark Tank star Kevin O&#x2019;Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, started promoting bitcoin and ethereum giveaways Thursday morning. The account tweeted claiming that O&#x2019;Leary has made a lot of money from crypto over the last few years and he has decided to give away 5,000 bitcoin and 15,000 ether. The tweet also provides a link for anyone to join the cryptocurrency giveaway scam event.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-bitcoin-ether-giveawawy-tweet-1.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20221229%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221229T184632Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=9380ea9bd288f38ea4b96b6da30e1378356810ddcec4d706518e9da681704dfd"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-566398 aligncenter" title="Kevin O'Leary's Twitter Account Hacked to Promote Bitcoin, Ethereum Giveaway Scam" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-bitcoin-ether-giveawawy-tweet-1.jpg" alt="Kevin O'Leary's Twitter Account Hacked to Promote Bitcoin, Ethereum Giveaway Scam" width="552" height="710" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-bitcoin-ether-giveawawy-tweet-1-233x300.jpg 233w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-bitcoin-ether-giveawawy-tweet-1.jpg 552w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px"></a>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The O&#x2019;Leary Twitter account further claimed that it is not hacked and the giveaways are not a scam. It also falsely claimed that Mr. Wonderful said on CNBC last night that he will away some cryptocurrencies for real.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-giveawawy-tweet1.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20221229%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221229T180927Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=bf7de171a4a7a4af134640ec7ec89c428b2e36fc84171b837c6eda3c6af6fbcb"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-566391" title="Kevin O'Leary's Twitter Account Hacked to Promote Bitcoin, Ethereum Giveaway Scam" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-giveawawy-tweet1.jpg" alt="Kevin O'Leary's Twitter Account Hacked to Promote Bitcoin, Ethereum Giveaway Scam" width="812" height="451" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-giveawawy-tweet1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-giveawawy-tweet1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-giveawawy-tweet1-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oleary-giveawawy-tweet1.jpg 812w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px"></a>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The link provided in the first tweet takes investors to a website claiming to be the official site for O&#x2019;Leary&#x2019;s bitcoin and ether giveaway. &#x201C;Everyone can participate, including those in the United States,&#x201D; the website details. Two more links are provided: one is to participate in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> giveaway while the other is to participate in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> giveaway.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The fake giveaway posts were removed by Twitter a few hours after they were posted.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Crypto Giveaway Scams Widespread on Social Media</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Cryptocurrency giveaway scams are widespread across various social media platforms, including Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, and Instagram.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Scammers often hack the accounts of famous people, politicians, celebrities, and companies and use them to promote their fake giveaways. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-bitcoin-giveaway-scam-millions-dollars-btc/">Elon Musk</a> and his companies Tesla and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/spacex-bitcoin-scam-btc-giveaway-elon-musk-nasa-launch/">Spacex</a> are often featured in these scams.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the O&#x2019;Leary giveaway, the scammer evidently reused the same website they created for fake Tesla and Elon Musk giveaways.
