			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Oasis Network, developers of privacy-centric blockchain products, has announced the launch of Sapphire, a privacy-focused Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The chain makes use of Oasis's privacy layer, and aims to offer a more secure platform for existing decentralized apps across EVM networks, eliminating the need for cross-chain swaps.</p>
Sapphire: A New Dawn for Web3 Development
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sapphire represents an exciting development for privacy-focused Web3 development. With its unique privacy-first features, it is set to significantly enhance the security of dApps on any EVM network. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Oasis Foundation Director Jernej Kos explained how the Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL) and Sapphire work in harmony to bolster the functionality of DApps. Specifically, he outlined how DApps can incorporate various features of Sapphire without migrating to the Oasis blockchain.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Being fully EVM-compatible means that developers can build private smart contracts in an environment that they are already familiar with," Kos stated.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sapphire's full compatibility with EVM environments also bolsters cross-chain Web3 development, providing a confidential voting mechanism for decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) smart contracts, for instance. The outcome of such confidential voting can then be conveyed to the core DAO contract on a different chain.</p>
Unlocking the Power of Privacy
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The majority of DApps built on the Oasis blockchain are privacy-centric, and this trend is reflected in the tools and platforms developed within the Oasis ecosystem. Sapphire's release is expected to drive the development of privacy-enabled blockchain games, confidential decentralized exchanges, private voting systems, sealed-bid auctions, and key management tools, among other applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sapphire employs Oasis' proprietary privacy technology that relies on a secure computing technology known as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which serves as a secure enclave for smart contract execution. During execution, encrypted data is fed into the Secure Enclave alongside the smart contract, where it's decrypted and processed. The data is then re-encrypted before it leaves the Secure Enclave, ensuring that user data remains confidential and isn't disclosed to node operators or application developers.</p>
A Gateway to Familiarity and Interoperability
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sapphire offers a familiar environment for blockchain developers due to its EVM compatibility. User-facing tools like the Web3 gateway, wallets, and block explorers are already familiar to many, and developers will recognize tools such as Solidity/Vyper, Hardhat/Truffle, and Web3.js/Ethers. Developers can port their DApps to Sapphire within minutes and start using its privacy technology and built-in functions such as Random Number Generation (RNG), signing, and encryption.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Sapphire on testnet marks an important milestone in Oasis's roadmap. Oasis has already planned a mainnet deployment for later this year and is encouraging developers to utilize the testnet to familiarize themselves with Sapphire's capabilities. In an effort to cultivate a vibrant developer community around Sapphire, Oasis plans to host its first Sapphire Hackathon in September.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sapphire&rsquo;s inception offers a more privacy-focused era for Web3 development, enabling developers to incorporate enhanced security features into their DApps without compromising the familiarity of their build environment. The privacy capabilities offered by Sapphire represent an essential step in the pursuit of a more secure and private Web3 environment, advancing the blockchain industry's progress towards widespread Web3 adoption.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chainlink has launched its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) for early adopters, with a full roll-out soon to follow. The protocol is designed to serve and facilitate cross-chain transactions across a number of blockchains currently operating from within and alongside the Ethereum and EVM ecosystems.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, this innovative protocol is now live on several major blockchain platforms, namely Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The integration of this service has already stimulated the market, evidenced by the near 10% uptick in the price of Chainlink's native token, LINK, which soared to a high of $7.30 in the wake of the announcement.</p>
Boosting Blockchain Connectivity with CCIP
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Earlier this week, Chainlink's official blog post unveiled the CCIP's early access availability on multiple blockchain platforms. This development not only enhances the potential for interconnectivity among various blockchain ecosystems but also empowers developers by providing a robust platform to create custom cross-chain solutions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A key advantage that the CCIP brings to the table is its "Simplified Token Transfers" feature. This functionality empowers protocols to expedite the process of sending tokens across chains, all under the assurance of audited token pool contracts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This cross-chain protocol is a collaborative undertaking involving Swift, the esteemed global financial messaging network. The CCIP leverages Swift's advanced messaging infrastructure, facilitating seamless token transfers across an array of public and private blockchains.</p>
Key Elements of The Protocol
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has been designed to cater to developers' needs by providing them with flexible tools to create custom cross-chain solutions. An example of this is its Arbitrary Messaging feature, which opens up the possibility for unique cross-chain applications. Additionally, Simplified Token Transfers, which utilize audited token pool contracts, streamline the process of moving tokens across chains. This feature saves development time by eliminating the need for writing custom code.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A key element of CCIP's implementation strategy is its collaboration with established financial messaging network Swift (stylized in some cases as SWIFT), along with several financial institutions. This collaboration focuses on utilizing existing messaging infrastructures to facilitate token transfers across diverse blockchain environments.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">By enabling traditional finance to connect with decentralized networks, this innovative approach lays a foundation for a new phase of collaborative advancement between these two sectors. The integration of CCIP into multiple major blockchains marks a significant stride in improving blockchain interoperability, fostering greater connectivity, and utility in decentralized networks. Chainlink is also partnered with Coinbase Cloud, which is designated as a node operator.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chainlink's co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, pointed out that the CCIP serves in such a way that it [functions to]:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts." </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Nazarov further emphasized that such a technological advancement would be vital in shaping and sustaining a society powered by blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Various prominent financial institutions and enterprises, including the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Euroclear, and Lloyds Banking Group, are currently exploring the possibilities and benefits presented by the CCIP.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Axelar has launched the Interchain Token Service (ITS), a solution designed to enhance the interoperability of ERC-20 tokens across all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Among the early adopters of this service is Sushi, a decentralized exchange (DEX), aiming to use the ITS to foster seamless interactions of its native SUSHI token across multiple blockchain networks.</p>
Driving Cross-Chain Integration with ITS
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Axelar&rsquo;s ITS primarily focuses on the interoperability of ERC-20 tokens across all EVM-compatible ecosystems. These tokens are generated on a 1:1 ratio and are managed through Axelar&rsquo;s native computing environment, the Axelar Virtual Machine. The newly revealed service is set to provide a muchj-needed boost to the ease of token interaction across Ethereum-compatible chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Decentralized exchange Sushi is set to be one of the first adopters of the &ldquo;interchain tokens&rdquo; provided through this service. Sushi's team plans to use the ITS to facilitate seamless interaction of its native SUSHI token across multiple chains. Initial deployment will ensure interoperability of SUSHI across Arbitrum, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon. This move will enable SushiSwap, Sushi's decentralized exchange, to manage its multichain deployments more efficiently via the Axelar network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Jared Grey, Sushi&rsquo;s head chef, emphasized the utility of this service, stating:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Axelar&rsquo;s Interchain Token Service unlocks a more seamless, interchain experience for Sushi users."</p>

Tackling Security and Compatibility Challenges
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The traditional approach to facilitating cross-chain transfers for Web3 applications generally relied on bridged token versions. These bridged versions could be exposed to inherent security risks and compatibility issues. Axelar&rsquo;s interoperability solution, according to co-founder Sergey Gorbunov, addresses these challenges.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Gorbunov noted that Axelar's innovative approach utilizes specialized smarlt contracts and a software development kit, which enables developers to manage interchain tokens more efficiently.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, Gorbunov says that the bridged versions of tokens, similar to SUSHI, currently lack fungibility and carry a bridge risk. In contrast, Interchain Tokens represent a "true" cross-chain interoperability merged with security and simplicity. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The news comes after Axelar's announcement following its partnership with Chainlink's cross-chain interoperability protocol.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Despite the latest crypto market recovery, Polkadot (DOT) has been trading in the red region losing all its gains from the beginning of 2023. The charts have shown a notable decline in the price of Polkadot, leaving investors curious about its future trajectory. However, analysts have predicted that another token, Tradecurve (TCRV), will lead the next crypto bull run.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Polkadot (DOT) Price Analysis: Why Is Polkadot Going Down?
<p>Over the past week, the price of Polkadot l has been range-bound, fluctuating between $5.00 and $5.50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the launch of Polkadot 2.0, the token has faced significant bearish pressure, evident in the long wick on its July 6th candlestick, suggesting selling pressure during intraday rallies. According to CoinMarketCap, the current price of Polkadot stands at $5.12, reflecting a 6.34% decline over the past seven days.</p>
<p>Although Polkadot's price has dipped below the moving averages recently, there are indications of a potential recovery as the token experiences a modest 0.88% increase in the last 24 hours. Moreover, trading volume on the network has witnessed an 8.30% surge within the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Currently, Polkadot has surpassed the 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $5.05, yet it still remains below the 200-Day SMA at $5.72.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A positive sign would be a breakout above the $5.15 mark, signaling solid demand. In such a scenario, the bulls would likely attempt to drive the pair towards $5.64. On the downside, if bearish pressure lingers, the token could drop to $4.74.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) To Lead The Next Crypto Bull Run
<p>As Polkadot gears up for a rebound, market experts have predicted that Tradecurve could lead the next crypto bull run, surpassing the likes of Bitcoin. The market's belief in the potential of Tradecurve stems from its plan to bridge the crypto and traditional financial sector.</p>
Why Tradecurve (TCRV) Can Rally By 100X
<p>While platforms like Binance and Coinbase already offer derivative options and futures for cryptocurrencies, Tradecurve seeks to expand this offering by incorporating a wide range of instruments from the traditional financial market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These instruments encompass commodities, indices, stocks, ETFs, forex, and cryptocurrencies, enabling traders to access a more diverse and comprehensive portfolio. Tradecurve gains the ability to tap into the OTC derivatives market worth over $632 trillion in 2022. It does so by introducing derivatives tied to traditional financial instruments,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve also has other features like copy trading, AI algorithmic trading, high leverage, and a metaverse trading academy. Tradecurve has attracted significant attention. This is with a projected price surge of 50x during the presale phase and up to 100x upon the launch of the trading platform,&nbsp;</p>
Experts Opinion: Time To Take Advantage
<p>Currently trading at $0.018, a 100X price increase could propel the token's value to $1.8, potentially propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization before the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Savvy investors have recognized the opportunity and have already acquired millions of TCRV tokens, positioning themselves early for potential gains.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[Recent reports reveal that Bitgert (BRISE) coin holders have received exciting news as they can now stake their tokens on the Gate.io exchange, offering a remarkable annual percentage yield (APY) of 100%. This recent development comes just a day after Bitgert announced the expansion of its rapidly growing crypto project.

&mdash; Bitgert - $BRISE (@bitgertbrise) July 18, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The team unveiled its new meme character, which has stirred up controversy within the crypto community. These updates have consequently caused an upward trend in the price of its native token, BRISE, outperforming other cryptocurrency pairs.</p>
<p>Further, Bitgert has made significant strides by listing the BRISE token on ten cryptocurrency exchanges. This milestone includes the verification of the BRISE token on Etherscan, a highly regarded Ethereum network blockchain explorer. Etherscan enables users to track transactions, tokens, addresses, and associated prices on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">🎉 Exciting news! #BRISE, our ERC20 token, has just been verified on https://t.co/eHPZvPuNwL! 🚀 Join us in the world of decentralized finance and experience the power of blockchain firsthand. #crypto #ethereum #blockchain Explorer link: https://t.co/QnVPoUoKDS</p>
&mdash; Bitgert - $BRISE (@bitgertbrise) July 13, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Etherscan's previous reports indicate that the total supply of BRISE tokens is an astounding 405 billion. There has been a noticeable increase in active holders recently, with Uniswap V3 hosting 197 billion Bitgert (BRISE) tokens. Uniswap v2 also holds a substantial volume of BRISE tokens, highlighting the token's popularity.</p>
<p>The native token of the Bitgert crypto platform, BRISE, has been leading the crypto market with remarkable price gains. A recent report that covered the eventful week for BRISE noted that the coin experienced a gain of over 30%, pushing its crypto market cap beyond $103 million.</p>
<p>While BRISE has been enjoying positive growth, other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have experienced losses in the past 24 hours. CoinMarketCap data reveals that while BRISE maintained a more than 16% upward trajectory over the past week, ETH and BNB only managed to achieve single-digit gains.</p>
<p>Moreover, BRISE has climbed three positions in the ranking of significant coins within two weeks, resulting in a market cap increase of over $3 million. The interest in this coin can be attributed to exciting developments, celebrations, and collaborations surrounding Bitgert.</p>
<p>Bitgert (BRISE) trades at $2.65e-7 in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $2,811,609 during a similar timeframe, according to Coinmarketcap data. Bitgert has also experienced a 2.41% increase in the last 24 hours, boasting a CoinMarketCap ranking of 189 and a market cap of $104,799,608.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>American investor Cathie Wood&rsquo;s ARK Invest sold another $50.5 million worth of Coinbase shares to cash in on the recent crypto market rally.&nbsp;</p>
ARK Sells COIN Shares
<p>In recent trade disclosures, it has been revealed that funds associated with Cathie Wood's ARK Investment have continued to divest shares of Coinbase Global Inc. and Tesla Inc. On Monday, substantial sales were made where three different ARK exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sold off a total of 24,8838 COIN shares.</p>
<p>The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) sold 76,788 shares of Coinbase (COIN), while the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) sold 127,266 shares, and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) sold 44,784 shares. Based on Coinbase&rsquo;s closing price of $105.55 on Monday, the sales brought in approximately $26.3 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company has also sold a significant chunk of its Tesla shares (TSLA), again through different funds. The ARK Innovation ETF sold 38,329 Tesla shares, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF sold 6,855 shares, bringing in a total of $13.1 million, based on Tesla&rsquo;s closing price of $290.38 on Monday.</p>
COIN Hits Annual High
<p>These sales add to the $50 million worth of Coinbase shares it sold on Friday when the share prices hit a yearly high of $114.43. The investment firm had made significant acquisitions of Coinbase shares during the bear market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of late, the crypto industry has been going through a much-need rally, with Coinbase stock riding a 52-week high. ARK Investment clearly wants to make the most of this price rally and has therefore chosen to divest a sizeable percentage of its COIN holdings for the second time in less than a week.&nbsp;</p>
ARK Swivelling To META?
<p>There has been an uptick in the market prices lately, owed partially to the recent crypto-favorable ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple legal battle. The upcoming weeks might experience even stronger rallies. It remains to be seen if Wood decides to cash in further on the moment by divesting all COIN shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move to sell COIN shares could also be reflective of Wood&rsquo;s decision to change up her investment strategy. In fact, following the announcement of Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s Threads, a social media platform similar to Twitter, Wood decided to invest heavily in Meta Platforms. In fact, ARK Innovation ETF has already acquired 69,793 META shares, while ARK Next Generation Internet ETF purchased 12,559 META shares.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Aave Companies has unveiled version two of its Lens Protocol and introduced several new features for the web3 social app.&nbsp;</p>
Lens Protocol Now Allows Blocking
<p>Lens Protocol&rsquo;s parent organization, Aave Companies, has launched the much-anticipated V2 of the web3 social app. This latest update takes Lens one step closer to its vision of creating an open and decentralized social media ecosystem focusing on composability, value sharing, and enhanced features.</p>
<p>One notable addition is the on-chain blocking feature, which allows Lens users to block each other, similar to Twitter's. Once blocked, users will be restricted from commenting, following, quote-commenting, and utilizing unique crypto-specific features such as mirror and collect.</p>
New Features To Support Monetization
<p>With monetization as one of the key pillars supporting the V2 upgrade, several new features have been geared toward allowing users to generate revenue. For example, the &ldquo;collect&rdquo; feature allows users to accumulate and store content on Lens as NFTs. There is also an equivalent feature to that of a retweet - Mirror. A &ldquo;mirrored&rdquo; piece of content will generate revenue, with users who have mirrored the content also receiving a portion of the earnings.</p>
<p>According to the statement from Aave founder Stani Kulechov,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Lens Protocol V2 takes decentralized social media and monetization opportunities to a new leve. Providing maximum flexibility for builders, V2 enables new types of social engagements and monetization relationships, where all stakeholders can share in the value of social networks&mdash;both individually and collectively as an ecosystem."</p>
V2 Continues Open Design Space
<p>Although the initial iteration of the social platform did not include a user interface, it had sufficient tools and supportive architecture for developers to build their own consumer apps in the Lens ecosystem. As a result, numerous social media apps stemmed from the platform, like Lenster, Orb, and Buttrfly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the developer community on the platform has also created multiple tools like algorithms that predict follower growth to search operations to find new friends and content. This characteristic open design space will continue on V2, allowing developers to execute external actions directly on the platform and build innovative projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recent introduction of the Momoka data scalability solution and V2&rsquo;s Lens Improvement Proposals (LIPs) will further enhance the platform&rsquo;s scalability and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
Profiles Get An Upgrade
<p>The latest iteration of the web3 social app is also focusing on upgrading the profiles themselves. Since V2 has transitioned the profiles to the ERC-6551 standard from the previous ERC-721, they now function like crypto wallets, allowing users to transact and store cryptocurrencies along with NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lens Protocol is also delving deeper into crypto-native actions, like creating pathways for builders to join DAOs or directly donate to public goods through investing in content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these new features and improvements, Lens Protocol V2 seeks to carve out its niche in the social media landscape, providing users with a decentralized and crypto-powered platform that offers increased engagement, monetization opportunities, and compatibility with the evolving web3 ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto world eagerly awaits as Litecoin's third halving event approaches. Expected for August 2, 2023, this event will occur once the 2,520,000th block is mined.&nbsp;</p>
What is the halving?
<p>A &ldquo;halving&rdquo; in the crypto context refers to the moment when the reward miners receive for validating transactions on the blockchain is cut by half. This means that miners will earn half the number of new coins for each block they mine, which, in the past, has significantly impacted the cryptocurrency's value.</p>
<p>The event has historically triggered significant movements in Litecoin's value, often preceding similar movements in Bitcoin. This has led some to speculate that Litecoin's performance could be a precursor to Bitcoin's future movements.</p>
Halving expectations
<p>Litecoin's halving occurs approximately every 840,000 blocks, which takes around four years. Since its inception in 2011, Litecoin has already experienced two halvings. During these events, the rewards given to miners are reduced, which has led to an increase in Litecoin's value.</p>
<p>Historical data from previous halvings in various cryptocurrencies may serve as a basis for this expectation. However, sceptics argue that market participants are already aware of the halving event and have factored it into their price calculations and strategies. In this view, the halving&rsquo;s effects may have been &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; ahead of time, meaning that any potential price impact has already been reflected in the current market value.</p>
<p>As we approach the third halving event, it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect increased market attention and potential price volatility. Holders and potential investors will be keeping a close eye on Litecoin as it approaches and then passes the halving.&nbsp;</p>
Will the halving push Litecoin higher this time?
<p>Many Litecoin holders will hope that this next halving will help to provide the spark that pulls LItecoin out of its current range bound price action. Right now, it appears that Litecoin has in fact managed to turn an incredibly important resistance at $91 into support. Sitting just above the 50 and 200 day moving averages should also provide a reliable cushion. A lift off for Litecoin from here could take it to the next strong resistance at $140.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>US Judge Sarah Netburn has ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple to agree to possible settlement dates should both parties believe them to be constructive at this stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following Judge Netburn&rsquo;s order, several members of the XRP community have speculated that both parties will settle soon.&nbsp;</p>
New Settlement Order&nbsp;
<p>The order came shortly after Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York referred the next phase of the court proceedings in the Ripple vs. SEC suit to Judge Netburn. Court documents filed on the 17th of July reveal that Judge Netburn will be presiding over the General Pretrial. The judge indicated that the concerned parties reach an agreement regarding settlement dates 6-8 weeks beforehand, pointing to the court&rsquo;s hectic schedule. The judge&rsquo;s order stated that the parties involved in the matter must agree to three mutually convenient dates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NEW: Judge Sarah Netburn orders both @Ripple and the @SECGov to agree on 3 mutually convenient dates to schedule a settlement conference, &ldquo;if they believe it to be productive at this time.&rdquo; Also recommends scheduling 6-8 weeks beforehand due to the court&rsquo;s busy schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The order also stated that the court would not agree to or tolerate any last-second requests for settlement conferences and also told the parties not to expect any adjournments on litigation deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
Do Ripple And The SEC Want To Settle?&nbsp;
<p>The pretrial phase includes aspects of the matter pertaining to scheduling, discovery, and non-dispositive pretrial motions. It is also the stage when most parties in a case would look to settle instead of going to trial. While many believe that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would want Ripple to settle, the coming few days will reveal if either side wishes to take the settlement route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eleanor Terrett, business journalist at Fox, shared her outlook, stating that Judge Netburn&rsquo;s order does not mean a settlement would occur within the next 6 to 8 weeks, noting that the order only pertains to the parties scheduling a settlement conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be clear: Judge Netburn is suggesting that both sides agree on some possible dates for a settlement meeting, *IF* &ldquo;they believe it to be productive at this time. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll see a settlement in 6-8 weeks. It means that if they do decide on a date, it will have to be scheduled 6-8 weeks in advance of the desired date due to the court&rsquo;s busy schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also added that both sides could also refuse to schedule a settlement conference or fail to reach an agreement within the stipulated time frame. Terrett has been following the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit since the beginning of the case.&nbsp;</p>
Pro-XRP Lawyer Believes Conference Will Be Scheduled&nbsp;
<p>Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli stated that he believes that Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission will schedule the settlement conference in a bid to avoid angering the court. However, he also stated that the conference would end just like how the previous meetings ended, with both sides failing to reach a compromise acceptable to each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will likely schedule one so as not to anger the court. But it will go about as well as the last two settlement conferences before it went. Settlement only happens when both parties finally reach the compromise each can stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If what Rispoli believes would play out, then one or both parties could also appeal Judge Torres&rsquo; summary decision. In a landmark ruling, Judge Torres effectively stated that XRP was not a security, triggering a massive rally for the token and the larger crypto market. While the outcome of the case is still up in the air, market watchers believe that Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory is a critical moment and could help in formulating much-needed regulatory clarity in the US crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reacting to the judgment, the Securities and Exchange Commission stated at the time that it was still assessing the order and would identify its next course of action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;NEW: Judge Sarah Netburn orders both @Ripple and the @SECGov to agree on 3 mutually convenient dates to schedule a settlement conference, &ldquo;if they believe it to be productive at this time.&rdquo; Also recommends scheduling 6-8 weeks beforehand due to the court&rsquo;s busy schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The order also stated that the court would not agree to or tolerate any last-second requests for settlement conferences and also told the parties not to expect any adjournments on litigation deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
Do Ripple And The SEC Want To Settle?&nbsp;
<p>The pretrial phase includes aspects of the matter pertaining to scheduling, discovery, and non-dispositive pretrial motions. It is also the stage when most parties in a case would look to settle instead of going to trial. While many believe that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would want Ripple to settle, the coming few days will reveal if either side wishes to take the settlement route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eleanor Terrett, business journalist at Fox, shared her outlook, stating that Judge Netburn&rsquo;s order does not mean a settlement would occur within the next 6 to 8 weeks, noting that the order only pertains to the parties scheduling a settlement conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be clear: Judge Netburn is suggesting that both sides agree on some possible dates for a settlement meeting, *IF* &ldquo;they believe it to be productive at this time. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll see a settlement in 6-8 weeks. It means that if they do decide on a date, it will have to be scheduled 6-8 weeks in advance of the desired date due to the court&rsquo;s busy schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also added that both sides could also refuse to schedule a settlement conference or fail to reach an agreement within the stipulated time frame. Terrett has been following the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit since the beginning of the case.&nbsp;</p>
Pro-XRP Lawyer Believes Conference Will Be Scheduled&nbsp;
<p>Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli stated that he believes that Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission will schedule the settlement conference in a bid to avoid angering the court. However, he also stated that the conference would end just like how the previous meetings ended, with both sides failing to reach a compromise acceptable to each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will likely schedule one so as not to anger the court. But it will go about as well as the last two settlement conferences before it went. Settlement only happens when both parties finally reach the compromise each can stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If what Rispoli believes would play out, then one or both parties could also appeal Judge Torres&rsquo; summary decision. In a landmark ruling, Judge Torres effectively stated that XRP was not a security, triggering a massive rally for the token and the larger crypto market. While the outcome of the case is still up in the air, market watchers believe that Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory is a critical moment and could help in formulating much-needed regulatory clarity in the US crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reacting to the judgment, the Securities and Exchange Commission stated at the time that it was still assessing the order and would identify its next course of action.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has abruptly ended its five-year partnership with the Argentine Football Association (AFA) after only one year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the exchange, the termination happened because the AFA failed to comply with partnership obligations.</p>
Partnership Background
<p>Binance and AFA went into business in AFA, with the former becoming the official naming sponsor of the country's national football team. The deal was for a five-year partnership, generating significant buzz in the crypto space. However, things started to sour after the AFA allegedly failed to fully comply with its partnership obligations leading to the dissolution. As per Binance, the AFA's non-compliance conflicted with their business values and partnership principles.</p>
<p>Wu Blockchain tweeted:</p>

<p>"Binance has terminated its five-year partnership with the Argentine soccer association, just after a year, citing a breach of contract. The move comes at a time when Binance is cutting staff and employee benefits. In January 2022, Binance became the main sponsor of Argentina&rsquo;s national soccer team."</p>

More Troubles For Binance
<p>Binance is currently going through challenging times after news came out that they have reportedly laid off several staff members after a number of executives left the firm. Apparently, more than 1,000 staff members were let go over the past few weeks. It should be noted that Binance CEO CZ has tweeted that the numbers reported were grossly inaccurate.</p>
AFA's Crypto Partnership
<p>The Binance partnership was far from AFA&rsquo;s first crypto rodeo. Previously, the AFA had partnered with global exchange ByBit as its main sponsor. The AFA had also partnered with the likes of&nbsp;Upland, and BC.GAME.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with price fluctuations often sparking excitement and concern among investors. In this article, we examine the recent price drop of Litecoin (LTC) and the surge of Tradecurve, which has remained a favorite presale among investors.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Litecoin (LTC) Sees a Bearish Downturn</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has witnessed a recent price drop, causing concern among its bulls. In the last week alone, Litecoin saw a drop of 14.5% on the price charts. The decline in Litecoin's value can be attributed to various factors, including overall market sentiment and profit-taking by traders.</p>
<p>Litecoin has a value of $94.30 with a market cap of $6.9B, which is a drop of 2.43% in the last 24 hours. Not only that, the technical analysis for Litecoin also paints a bearish picture, with both its technical indicators and moving averages showing strong sell signals.</p>
<p>To predict how the current conflict between the bulls and the bears will turn out, traders are now paying particular attention to the $90-$92 price range. If it falls below that range, Litecoin may continue dropping to its support level of $85.</p>
<p class="s8">Tradecurve (TCRV) Seen As the Top Pick Among Investors</p>
<p>In contrast to Litecoin's downturn, the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale has experienced a surge in price, solidifying its position as a favorite among investors. The recent 20% surge in Tradecurve's price reflects growing confidence and interest from the investor community.</p>
<p>A 40% surge is also expected to come by the end of July, as another stage begin. Traders and investors find value in Tradecurve's borderless trading platform, which solves issues like lack of transparency and limited access to advanced trading tools.</p>
<p class="s8">Benefitting Both Experienced and Novice Traders</p>
<p>Tradecurve will be a unique trading platform with a hybrid infrastructure model. &nbsp;It will place the best features of CEX and DEX on one platform. Low latency, slippage-free trading, and anonymity through its DeFi capabilities will all be present on Tradecurve.</p>
<p>Users from all over the globe may trade all derivatives on one account in complete privacy. This is because Tradecurveremoves the intrusive sign-up KYC checks that platforms like Coinbase employ.</p>
<p>Another aspect that differentiates Tradecurve from Coinbase is that it will implement a Proof of Reserves - preventing any FTX-style collapse. The platform's innovative features have attracted over 12,500 traders seeking enhanced trading experiences. They include high-leverage options, account VIP service, and the ability to subscribe to automated AI trading bots.</p>
<p class="s8">A Promising Outlook</p>
<p>Behind all Tradecurve features and ecosystem components lie the platform's native token, TCRV. Currently, the project is in Stage 4 of its presale and has a value of $0.018, a stunning 80% surge from its starting price of $0.01.</p>
<p>Holding this token brings access to VIP status, governance voting rights, staking rewards, and more. With millions of tokens sold already and a $3.2M raised, experts forecast a 50xvalue jump before the presale ends - so do not miss out, sign up for the TCRV presale below and become an early investor in an upcoming Binance rival.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto industry is constantly evolving, with new projects emerging and capturing the attention of investors and traders. This article will highlight five trending cryptocurrencies making waves on Twitter and Dextools (a popular platform for tracking and analyzing token performance).</p>
<p class="s7">Top 5 Trending Cryptos on Twitter and Dextools</p>

<p>Aptos (APT) emerges as an innovative blockchain technology, pushing the boundaries of possibility.</p>
<p>A notable milestone for Aptos (APT) comes from a recent partnership with Chingari, a renowned on-chain social app. This collaboration paves the way for a new era in decentralized social media platforms.</p>
<p>With its current price at $8.84, Aptos (APT) exhibits promising growth potential. Analysts project a trading range of $13.50 to $15.80 for Aptos (APT) by Q4 2023, presenting investors with exciting opportunities for profitability in the upcoming months.</p>

<p>Ripple (XRP), the blockchain-based payment protocol, faced legal challenges from the SEC in 2020. Instead of settling, Ripple (XRP) decided to fight the charges, setting it apart from its peers.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Autentic, the ecosystem of digital financial assets, has announced its native token AUt presale for institutional and private funds, partners, and investment companies. It is scheduled for September 1st and will last only a few weeks. During this period, major investors will have the opportunity to buy AUt at a special price of $0.20.</p>

<p>"At the initial token sale stage, we focus on large institutional and private investors, as well as on our partners who have supported the project development. They will get special purchase terms with a minimum vesting period of 9 months. We also limit the average trade within $3,000 and the number of presale participants,&rdquo; stated the company.</p>

<p>In total, Autentic plans to issue 100 million AUt, which will be used as an internal settlement for accessing platform services, paying fees, and serving as an investment instrument. The company will launch a Savings feature in the fall, providing the opportunity to earn up to 25% APY. Other benefits the company provides to its investors: predictable investment returns, 24/7 trading, low fees, and full decentralization without regulatory pressure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the end of this year we plan to launch Autentic Pay payment system, Autentic Capital platform for Security Token Offerings (STO) and initial asset offerings, Autentic Market - a marketplace for digital assets. In 2024, the company will list AUt on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and launch decentralized platform Block DEX &nbsp;for secondary asset trading,&rdquo; shared the company.</p>

<p>In the near future, the release of the following digital assets will be available to users:</p>
<p>Autentic DAO token (ADT), EIP-20 token that essentially serves as a match to company shares. It grants holders the right to receive distributed profits from &nbsp;ecosystem activities and participate in decision-making processes that determine the overall direction of the company development. A total of 2.5 million ADT tokens will be released. But there will be no public sale for these tokens.</p>
<p>AUtentic Gold (AuG), EIP-20 token - a digitized version of real gold, pegged to the precious metal quotes on Shanghai Stock Exchange. Token holders can have the opportunity to get gold bars from 1000 grams at the offices of partner banks.</p>
Currency tokens
<p>Within the Autentic ecosystem, currency tokens of BRICS, SCO, and EAEU countries will be released following EIP-20 standard. These tokens will reflect the amount of fiat currency held in Autentic bank accounts in various currency locations. These tokens will be released at 1:1 ratio based on Proof of Reserves (PoR) consensus, combined with financial audits that serve as a proof of financial funds corresponding to the number of issued tokens in Autentic accounts. Currency tokens will be utilized as key components in creating smart contracts within Autentic ecosystem. They will serve for internal accounting, calculation and investment in the system, facilitating fund transfers and payment procedures via Autentic PAY. Deposit, withdrawal, exchange and redemption of currency tokens for real funds will be made via smart contracts.</p>
The ecosystem will also include:
<p>Autentic DAO, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where participants can vote for particular decision-making, ecosystem development and receive distributed profits from company activities.</p>
<p>Autentic Capital, platform for initial listing of crypto assets, equity raising for issuing companies in Autentic platform, investing in promising projects and businesses.</p>
<p>Autentic Market, marketplace for real digitized goods and services that can be purchased using currency and metal tokens like RUR.s, CNY.s, SAR.s, AuG, or any other currency tokens representing BRICS, SCO, and EAEU countries available on the platform.</p>
<p>Autentic PAY, blockchain payment system, designed for fund transferring and without fee transactions, using any cryptocurrencies, approved for circulation within Autentic ecosystem, as well as issued currency tokens based on Proof of Reserves (PoR) protocol and pegged to real fiat currencies held in company accounts.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco, US, July 17th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Portal, a self-hosted wallet and true cross-chain Layer-2 DEX built on Bitcoin, is thrilled to announce that LFG Market, a marketplace for Ordinal NFTs and Bitcoin-based BRC-20 tokens, has chosen to integrate the Portal DEX protocol to offer users cross-chain trading of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. The integration of Portal DEX will make cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and other digital assets fast, secure, and private.&nbsp;</p><p>With this, LFG users will be able to purchase the Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens using assets from other chains such as Ethereum without bridges or custodians. Utilizing Portal&rsquo;s &ldquo;cross-chain Atomic Swaps&rdquo; technology for payments in any NFT marketplace is a monumental &ldquo;first&rdquo; in the NFT ecosystem.</p><p>&ldquo;LFG is looking for solutions that allow ETH and other NFT collectors seamless access to Ordinal trading, and we found Portal to be the best solution available. So it makes total sense to integrate Portal&rsquo;s DEX protocol,&rdquo; said LFG Market Co-founder Jason Rosenstein.&nbsp;</p><p>The creation of Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain has led to over $210 million in Ordinals trading volume, according to the latest quarterly report by DappRadar. With DEXes gaining a stronger foothold in the crypto industry, the interest in NFTs on Bitcoin is only expected to shoot up in the future. According to Nansen, 4% of the US population owns an NFT; but it was almost non-existent on Bitcoin until the Ordinals revolution in 2023.</p><p>For Ordinals to truly take off as the value layer for data and information, cross-chain solutions are needed to bring the much bigger non-Bitcoin NFT audiences from across the blockchain space to access Bitcoin Ordinals with security and trust-minimization. Whether it&rsquo;s Eth NFT fans or Solana NFT fans, there still is no ability to exchange their treasured NFTs in a trust-minimized way across chains. &ldquo;Bridge&rdquo; solutions and wrappers are cumbersome, often custodial, and highly vulnerable to security threats.</p><p>Portal&rsquo;s &ldquo;cross-chain Atomic Swaps&rdquo; functionality being built into LFG Market and other DEXes allows for stablecoin payments &ndash; that today only exist on EVM-compatible chains &ndash; seamless access to Bitcoin BRC-20 and Ordinal purchases.</p><p>While the LFG Market currently accepts payments only in BTC, other tokens such as ETH, USDC, USDT, and even tokens on Layer 2 EVMs like Arbitrum and others will be accepted after integrating the Portal DEX protocol. Since Portal&rsquo;s Atomic Swaps operate at Layer 2 without bridging, it is both the safest and least-expensive way to trade cross-chain. Portal is working on supporting as many compatible blockchains, wallets, and DeFi apps as possible.</p><p>Portal CEO Chandra Duggirala said, &ldquo;Based on our research, we know that marketplace and DEX operators value UX and liquidity. We've worked tirelessly to ensure that our infrastructure integrates smoothly with their existing setups, minimizing engineering overhead, while cross-chain liquidity aggregation helps them increase volumes and offer more assets and features to their users.&rdquo;</p><p>Portal believes that blockchains are &ldquo;specialized&rdquo; and that each chain is optimized to do one thing, at the expense of other tradeoffs. Bitcoin is purpose-designed to be sound, peer-to-peer money with superior censorship resistance. Ethereum, on the other hand, was designed for composable utility. By enabling seamless swapping of assets between incompatible chains, Portal helps aggregate liquidity across many chains, ending the fragmentation problem, and helping marketplaces like LFG and others grow their user bases and value propositions.&nbsp;</p><p></p>About LFG Market<p>LFG&rsquo;s mission is to create a platform that simplifies and enhances the trading process of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With bitcoin flat and slightly down on the day, the same could be said of the altcoins, with the exception of just a few.</p>
A flat bitcoin
<p>Bitcoin remains in its sideways accumulation as it has done for the last three days. The market is waiting for that next big move, and whether this is to the upside or the downside is still to be decided.</p>
<p>The fact that the king of the cryptocurrencies made another higher high is all to the good, and even if there is a dip to $28,000 or thereabouts a higher low will have easily been put in.</p>
Others.D
<p>The high end of the crypto market has had a flat day so far, but this is not the case for certain altcoins lower down. The Others.Dominance chart is the market cap of cryptos excluding the top ten cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This chart is 13.3% up for the day so far compared with slightly negative percentages for other Total market caps. So with such a good move to the upside for this section of the market, which were the alts that made the most percentage gains?</p>
$SUSHI
<p>Sushi ($SUSHI), one of the main competitors to Uniswap, has put on 11.9% thus far. A double bottom looks to have been found at $0.48, and today&rsquo;s rise to $0.76 has met $0.80 but has since returned to hopefully flip resistance into support at $0.76.</p>
$CELO
<p>Celo ($CELO), the mobile, carbon negative, EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem has also risen just over 11% up to now. The decent move upwards here is probably due to the announcement that Celo devs will migrate the blockchain from a layer1 to a layer2-based on OP stack, improving security and bringing more use cases to ethereum.</p>
<p>Celo has found its own double bottom which fell as far as $0.34. An uptrend has still not formed, but a range between $0.41 and $0.91 is currently being adhered to.</p>
$1INCH
<p>1inch ($1INCH), another decentralised swaps exchange like Sushi and Uniswap, was perhaps the biggest mover of the day, reaching $0.59, which equated to a 36.8% rise before retracing nearly all of those gains back down at $0.43. This surge came on the back of a 29% growth over the previous two days, so perhaps traders decided to take profits on this one.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered additional bearish volatility early in the Asian session as the pair was back above the 30000 figure after trading as low as the 29988.22 area, a move that represented a test of the 61.8% retracement of the recent narrow appreciating range from 29715.87 to 30456.&nbsp; &nbsp;Selling pressure emerged right around the 30456 area where selling pressure recently emerged before BTC/USD launched higher to the 31862.21 level.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 31003.83, 30739.19, 30474.55, and 30147.11 areas during the recent quick depreciation, downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure around the 31862.21 and 31376.52 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent trading activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 29920, 29108, 28275, 27443, 26413, and 26257 levels. &nbsp;Upside price objectives related to historical buying activity include the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460. &nbsp;Downside price objectives related to recent selling pressure include the 29849 and 29331 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30500.53 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30298.97.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
