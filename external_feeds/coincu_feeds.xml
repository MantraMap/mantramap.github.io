<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Fed is still likely to raise rates by 0.25% again at the end of July after skipping last month&#8217;s rate hike 10 times over the past year.</em></li>



<li><em>Some Fed policymakers and economists worry that the drop in inflation will be temporary.</em></li>



<li><em>The tightening labor market will push up core inflation next year.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Some Fed policymakers and economists <a href="https://coincu.com/196991-fed-chairman-inflation-to-return-to-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worry</a> that the drop in inflation will be temporary. They fear that wage growth is too strong. Without a recession, they will see a tightening labor market pushing up core inflation next year.</p>



<p>The US Federal Reserve (FED) is expected to raise key interest rates again at its two-day meeting July 25-26. The conference could bring interest rates to a range of 5.25 &#8211; 5.5%, the highest level since 2001, to meet the target of getting inflation back to 2%.</p>



<p>A year after inflation soared to a four-decade high, price growth is returning closer to normal, with families and businesses feeling the difference as wages rise faster than prices and policymakers debating how much more to slow the economy.</p>



<p>Government data released on July 12 showed a significant drop in inflation: Prices rose 3% year-on-year in June and 0.2% year-on-year, the smallest increase in 12 months since March 2021 &#8211; that marked progress from the most recent inflation report, when prices rose 4% year-on-year.</p>



<p>Especially for key categories like rent, prices of items ranging from used cars to pork all fell month-on-month. Items that have skyrocketed in the past year, such as airline tickets and hotels, are also cooling as demand returns to normal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, wages have outpaced inflation for the fourth straight month. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% from May to June, outpacing inflation by 0.2%, according to a separate BLS report <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/realer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> on the same day.</p>



<p>A key reason Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wants the labor market to slow down is because of concerns that tight employment will continue to push wages up, which could then cause inflation to soar. As unemployment rises, workers lose their bargaining power for higher wages, and households reduce spending.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance and Ceo Changpeng Zhao (CZ) are in an effort to drop the CFTC&#8217;s March lawsuit.</em></li>



<li><em>Specifically, the defendants requested to extend the legal memo&#8217;s 15-page limit to 50 pages.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, in March of this year, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) accused Binance of offering unregistered options and futures contracts to US traders.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On July 24, 2023, cryptocurrency exchange Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) filed an application in a US court to dismiss the CFTC&#8217;s lawsuit in early March.</strong></h5>

<p>According to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767.53.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court documents</a>, Binance and Changpeng Zhao (CZ) have applied for a license with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, intending to file a legal memorandum to initiate a motion to dismiss the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The defendants (Binance and Changpeng Zhao) requested to extend the 15-page limit of the legal memo to 50 pages.</p>



<p>As previously reported, in March of this year, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://coincu.com/176792-breaking-binance-and-cz-sued-by-cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> Binance of offering unregistered options and futures contracts to US traders. CFTC sued Binance, Mr. Zhao, and former Head of Regulatory Compliance Samuel Lim for knowingly violating US law. The regulator will seek to impose a permanent registration and trading ban on this exchange.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the defendants must respond to the respondent by July 27, 2023.</p>

<p>The lawsuit comes as authorities increase their control over companies in the digital currency sector. For years, US prosecutors and investigators have targeted illegal transactions and non-compliance with regulations to prevent unlawful activities by companies in this sector. However, recent government control efforts have been stepped up.</p>



<p>The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the market and its CEO is also in trouble with the heavy accusations of securities listing, deceiving customers from the SEC in early June. Binance is still being supported by users after denying all allegations. In addition, Ripple&#8217;s opening victory with the SEC also undermined the agency&#8217;s previous arguments.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, has consented to a gag order that significantly limits his ability to publicly discuss his case.<p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com/205576-sam-bankman-fried-accepts-gag-order/" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p><p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com"><strong>Coincu News</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) agreed to a gag order, which will largely prevent him from discussing his case publicly.</em></li>



<li><em>The judge ordered the SBF to appear in federal court in New York on Wednesday.</em></li>



<li><em>Prosecutors previously accused him of providing Caroline Ellison&#8217;s private documents to the media in an attempt to discredit her as a potential witness in a fraudulent criminal trial.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-24/bankman-fried-agrees-to-gag-order-with-bail-status-in-jeopardy?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, has consented to a gag order that significantly limits his ability to publicly discuss his case after prosecutors accused him of attempting to cast doubt on their crucial witness, Caroline Ellison.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1757.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="713" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1757-1024x713.png" alt="Sam Bankman-Fried Accepts Gag Order To Ban Him Revealing To The Media" class="wp-image-205578" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1757-1024x713.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1757-300x209.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1757-768x535.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1757-750x522.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1757-1140x794.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1757.png 1270w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Sam Bankman-Fried Accepts Gag Order To Ban Him Revealing To The Media 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The order still needs approval from US District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who asked the SBF to appear in federal court in New York on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Under the proposed order, filed Monday in Manhattan, the SBF, and other parties would be barred from discussing with the media any matter that might impede a fair trial, including statements about witness reliability, information not accepted at trial, and anything that might affect public perception of the case.</p>



<p>According to earlier reports, US prosecutors have accused the SBF of providing her ex-girlfriend&#8217;s private documents to the media to discredit her as a potential witness in a fraudulent criminal trial.</p>



<p>The letter, published on Sunday, comes after prosecutors sought to bar Bankman-Fried and its allies from making public statements that could interfere with the case.</p>



<p>In the letter, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorney confirmed he spoke with and provided personal documents to the New York Times, including documents written by a former colleague, Caroline Ellison, who has cooperated with the US government.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bankman-Fried did not violate the protective order in this case, nor did he violate the conditions of his bail, nor did he violate any laws or rules governing his conduct,&#8221; Bankman-Fried attorney Mark Cohen said in the letter.</p>



<p>An article published by the New York Times titled &#8220;Inside Caroline Ellison&#8217;s Private Writings, Star Witness in the FTX Case&#8221; reported excerpts from Ellison&#8217;s personal Google documents before the FTX collapse, in which she spoke of how she was &#8220;quite dissatisfied and overwhelmed&#8221; with her job and feeling &#8220;hurt after/rejected&#8221; by Bankman.</p>



<p>Ellison led Bankman-Fried&#8217;s hedge fund Alameda Research, <a href="https://coincu.com/154289-caroline-ellison-and-gary-wang-admit-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pleaded guilty</a> to defrauding investors, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. In December, Bankman-Fried said he and Ellison were romantically involved but did not provide further details.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>GMX v2 aims to address limitations in its first version, such as high transaction fees, limited asset diversity, and scalability issues for liquidity providers. </em></li>



<li><em>Notable updates in GMX v2 include diversified transaction fees, a novel liquidity provision model with isolated markets, and integration with Chainlink&#8217;s oracle solution for improved user experience and order execution.</em></li>



<li><em>GMX v2 holds promise to close the gap with rival DeFi platforms and solidify its position as a leading player in the industry, offering users enhanced efficiency, reliability, and broader asset choices.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Even if the crypto market is in a slump and is receiving a lot of bad news from conventional financial markets, GMX is one of the most effective DeFi technologies. But, GMX&#8217;s protocol still has numerous flaws, and the project must evolve if it is to continue to grow.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Big problems with the v1 protocol</h2>



<p>GMX has emerged as a prominent player, offering a unique operating model centered around the &#8220;casino game&#8221; philosophy. This innovative design positions liquidity providers (LPs) as casino owners while traders take on the role of players. However, while GMX&#8217;s approach has garnered attention, it is not without its limitations.</p>



<p>One key issue plaguing the current model is the skewed nature of the crypto market, where traders tend to engage in bulk buying or selling. As a result, the Open Interest (OI) on GMX often experiences significant fluctuations, creating challenges for both LPs and traders alike.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the absence of a funding rate mechanism in GMX v1 puts LPs at a disadvantage. When the market moves against traders&#8217; bets, the liquidity providers bear the brunt of the losses, jeopardizing the stability of the platform.</p>



<p>Another concern lies in the GLP token, which represents the liquidity provided by LPs. As GLP&#8217;s value is closely tied to a basket of tokens, including volatile ones like BTC, ETH, LINK, UNI, and stablecoins, it becomes vulnerable to extended downtrends, leaving LPs anxious about potential losses.</p>



<p>Various attempts have been made to address these issues and boost LP profits, such as integrating GLP as collateral on lending and borrowing platforms or introducing Yield Farming protocols. Nevertheless, these solutions still fall short of completely mitigating the risks LPs face when directly confronting traders. In the worst-case scenario, when traders win excessively, LPs may withdraw liquidity from the protocol, increasing the risk of a protocol collapse.</p>



<p>Moreover, GMX&#8217;s transaction fees have come under scrutiny, as they remain considerably higher compared to rival platforms in the same industry. This disparity could lead to a loss of market share, especially with the emergence of cheaper Perpetuals on different Layer 2 solutions like Pika Protocol or Kwenta on Optimism.</p>



<p>In addition to the transaction fee challenge, GMX supports only a limited number of asset classes, including ETH, AVAX, LINK, BTC, and UNI. This dearth of options leaves users with limited choices, while other popular Perpetual products like dYdX or Kwenta offer a more extensive range of supported assets. This situation stems partly from GMX&#8217;s liquidity pool model, which presents hurdles in promptly adding new trading pairs.</p>



<p>Furthermore, GMX faces capital efficiency issues, with a significant portion of liquidity in its pool remaining idle and not being utilized to generate profits. This inefficiency hampers the platform from maximizing potential earnings, mirroring the low demand for borrowing in a scenario like AAVE&#8217;s pool.</p>



<p>Additionally, the GMX development team itself gains no direct benefits from the protocol&#8217;s growth. The revenue generated is primarily distributed to GLP holders (Liquidity Providers) and GMX holders, leaving the development team and the project&#8217;s treasury with limited gains.</p>



<p>To ensure long-term resilience and competitiveness in the derivatives industry, the GMX development team must address these concerns effectively. Solutions may include refining the operating model, introducing mechanisms to regulate trader activity, revising transaction fees, expanding the range of supported assets, and optimizing capital efficiency. Only by addressing these challenges head-on can GMX secure its position as a leading DeFi platform in the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Notable updates in GMX v2</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transaction fees on GMX are diversified</strong></h3>



<p>In a recent proposal adopted by the majority of DAO V2: Interface &amp; Market Parameters, GMX v2 has set its sights on overhauling transaction fees, marking a significant step towards reforming the platform. The upcoming release promises several prominent changes to the GMX market, ushering in a more diverse fee structure.</p>



<p>One of the key changes in GMX v2 revolves around the &#8220;Increase / Decrease Position&#8221; fee. Under the new system, this fee will range from 0.00% to 0.1%, with an initial value of 0.05%. This alteration aims to make trading more flexible for users while maintaining a fair and efficient system.</p>



<p>Another significant adjustment comes in the form of the &#8220;Price Impact&#8221; fee. The new system will adjust the fee based on the liquidity available on specific exchanges. This change aims to align transaction costs with market conditions, ensuring a smoother trading experience for GMX users.</p>



<p>GMX v2 also reevaluates the &#8220;Swap Fee&#8221; structure for both Crypto Assets and Stable Assets. Under the revised framework, the fee will now range from 0.00% to 0.5% for both categories. In its initial form, the fee stood at 0.04% for Crypto Assets and 0.01% for Stable Assets. This modification seeks to strike a balance between the two asset types, encouraging a more inclusive trading environment.</p>



<p>The introduction of the &#8220;Funding Fee&#8221; adds yet another layer of diversification to GMX v2. This fee is payable by the dominant party to the less dominant party, mirroring prevalent practices on various centralized exchanges (CEX). By embracing this model, GMX aims to enhance fairness and encourage broader participation on the platform.</p>



<p>Moreover, the &#8220;Borrow Fee&#8221; will now be calculated based on a percentage using the Liquidity Pool and Multiplier Value. This change serves to limit the efforts of traders or competitors attempting to exploit the system through Long and Short orders at minimal cost. Such adjustments are designed to bolster the protocol&#8217;s stability and protect users from potential market manipulations.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Multiplier Value&#8221; in GMX v2 plays a crucial role in adjusting the Funding Fee and Borrow Fee, ensuring a well-balanced and robust ecosystem.</p>



<p>The incorporation of newly introduced fees, including Price Impact, Funding Fee, and Multiplier Value, significantly diversifies the fee market on GMX. A notable distinction between GMX v1 and v2 is the fee structure. While GMX v1 implemented a 0.1% opening/closing fee plus the Borrow Fee, GMX v2 adopts a lower 0.05% order opening/closing fee and includes Borrow Fees, Funding Fees, and Price Impact. This multi-tiered approach aims to provide users with more options and flexibility while transacting on the platform.</p>



<p>Furthermore, GMX v2 incorporates a novel fee-sharing mechanism, unlike its predecessor. Under the new system, transaction fees will be divided among four parties: Oracle, Liquidity Providers (LP), GMX stakers, and the project&#8217;s fund, GMX Treasury. This distribution ensures a fairer allocation of fees and rewards the various contributors to the platform&#8217;s growth and success.</p>



<p>In conclusion, GMX v2&#8217;s diversified transaction fees mark a significant step towards enhancing the efficiency and fairness of the protocol. By introducing a range of fees and implementing a new fee-sharing model, GMX seeks to create a more robust and user-friendly ecosystem for its community of traders and stakeholders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Innovative mechanism for liquidity</strong></h3>



<p>Departing from the traditional approach of sharing liquidity across all trading pairs from a single liquidity pool, GMX v2 has divided the liquidity sources for each trading pair into multiple independent liquidity pools. This new approach empowers liquidity providers (LPs) to freely choose the pools that align with their risk appetite.</p>



<p>Under the GMX v2 model, each perpetual trading pair, such as BTC/USD, will require a mini GLP pool encompassing the respective cryptocurrency and a stablecoin like USDT, USDC, or DAI. Consequently, when traders engage in perpetual contracts involving assets like ETH, the liquidity source will stem from various independent pools containing ETH paired with different stablecoins. This stands in contrast to the v1 model, where liquidity was solely sourced from the GLP pool.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="377" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755-1024x377.png" alt="Notable Updates In GMX V2: Resolving Protocol Backlogs" class="wp-image-205572" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755-1024x377.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755-300x111.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755-768x283.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755-1536x566.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755-2048x754.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755-750x276.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1755-1140x420.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Notable Updates In GMX V2: Resolving Protocol Backlogs 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>This novel liquidity provision model in GMX v2 bears similarities to popular AMM DEX platforms and Perpetual Protocol systems. By implementing this strategy, GMX can efficiently expand its offerings to numerous assets. Nonetheless, some concerns emerged about the requirement for multiple LPs and various asset types in each pool, potentially limiting scalability.</p>



<p>To address this limitation, GMX v2 has devised an ingenious solution for trading pairs with lower liquidity and riskier tokens. The mini GLP pool for such pairs will consist of the respective cryptocurrency and another stablecoin, mitigating risk and enhancing liquidity.</p>



<p>However, the most pivotal transformation in GMX v2 comes with the introduction of the Isolated Markets model. Unlike its predecessor, which pooled all assets under the umbrella of GLP, the new model separates each asset into isolated pairs and pools. For example, we now witness isolated pools like ETH &#8211; USD, BTC &#8211; USD, SOL &#8211; USD, DOGE &#8211; USD, LINK &#8211; USD, and others. The roles of crypto assets in these Isolated Markets are as follows:</p>



<p>BTC, ETH, LINK, UNI, and similar tokens act as Long Collateral Tokens.<br>Stablecoins function as Short Collateral Tokens.<br>Index Tokens serve as Long Collateral Tokens.<br>With the Isolated Markets model, liquidity providers gain the flexibility to choose between providing liquidity for specific crypto assets or both, receiving LP Tokens as GM. This model ensures that LPs bear the risks solely within the market they serve, without being influenced by other pools.</p>



<p>By adopting the Isolated Markets approach, GMX effectively diversifies its asset offerings without exposing users to undue risks associated with highly volatile assets. Additionally, this addresses one of the key limitations of GMX v1, where users had fewer asset options for Long &#8211; Short positions. Consequently, LPs also benefit from this innovation, overcoming certain challenges faced in the previous iteration.</p>



<p>In conclusion, GMX&#8217;s Version 2 represents a transformative leap in liquidity provision, paving the way for more extensive asset coverage, reduced risk exposure, and enhanced opportunities for users and liquidity providers alike. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, GMX remains at the forefront, ushering in innovative solutions that cater to the dynamic needs of the market.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enhancing user experience</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Introducing Chainlink&#8217;s new oracle integration</strong></p>



<p>GMX is proud to be at the forefront of innovation as it becomes the first DeFi platform to integrate Chainlink&#8217;s groundbreaking new Oracle solution. This latest product from Chainlink is set to revolutionize the way transactions are processed and user orders are matched, significantly improving the overall trading experience on the platform.<br>The new Chainlink Oracle will bring a host of benefits, one of which is the faster deployment of Oracles. Oracles play a crucial role in providing real-world data to smart contracts, and with this new integration, they will function more swiftly and efficiently. As a result, transactions on GMX will become quicker, ensuring users experience seamless and near-instantaneous order execution.</p>



<p><strong>Lookback Orders for enhanced execution</strong></p>



<p>GMX is introducing a game-changing feature called &#8220;Lookback Orders&#8221; that is designed to offer users greater peace of mind during times of rapid price fluctuations. The new feature ensures that key orders, such as Limit or Stop, will always be executed, even if the market is moving rapidly, as long as the Oracle can accurately capture the price movement.</p>



<p>The introduction of these two improvements aligns perfectly with GMX&#8217;s commitment to constantly improving user experience and staying at the forefront of the DeFi industry. By integrating Chainlink&#8217;s new Oracle product and introducing Lookback Orders, GMX is redefining how DeFi platforms cater to their users, offering enhanced efficiency, reliability, and security.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>European Banking Authority drafts new rules under MiCA regulation to impose additional requirements on stablecoin issuers with significant derivatives or covered bond reserves.</em></li>



<li><em>Stablecoins deemed to be interconnected with the financial system will face extra capital requirements and centralized supervision by the European Union (EU).</em></li>

<p>The regulations are part of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), which aims to address potential risks associated with stablecoins that have significant ties to the financial system.</p>



<p>Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tied to fiat currency or other assets, have been gaining popularity in recent years. However, concerns have emerged regarding their potential impact on the financial stability of the <a href="https://coincu.com/200056-european-lawmakers-promote-kill-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Union (EU)</a>. The EBA&#8217;s draft rules propose that stablecoin issuers deemed to have significant connections to the financial system will face extra capital requirements and centralized supervision by the EU.</p>



<p>The document emphasizes that the interconnected nature of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs) can amplify financial distress. In other words, if one stablecoin issuer experiences financial difficulties, it could trigger a chain reaction affecting other crypto-assets issuers and financial institutions. To mitigate these risks, the EBA is seeking to impose additional obligations on stablecoin issuers and assign partial or full supervision to the agency.</p>



<p>The European Commission had requested advice from the EBA in December to determine criteria for identifying stablecoins that are linked to the broader financial system or have international significance. The deadline for the EBA&#8217;s recommendations is set for September 30.</p>



<p>In a statement released on July 12, the EBA <a href="https://coincu.com/202199-eba-regulatory-asset-reference-token-micar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a> timely preparation for the implementation of MiCA regulations, which are expected to impact several cryptocurrencies. These regulations could be a crucial step toward achieving mainstream acceptance of digital assets within the EU. However, some observers note that other countries, including the US, are lagging in developing similar regulatory frameworks.</p>

<p>The MiCA regulations include provisions for consumer protection and risk management, with a focus on ensuring transparent disclosure of stablecoin projects and assets to buyers and investors. MiCA officially took effect in June 2023, and the outlined stablecoin provisions are scheduled to be applied from June 2024.</p>



<p>Stablecoins have faced controversies in the past, with one of the most significant risks being the lack of sufficient asset reserves backing them. Notably, <a href="https://coincu.com/204992-stablecoin-market-decline-usdt-still-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether (USDT)</a>, a stablecoin commonly used for moving funds between cryptocurrency exchanges, came under scrutiny and was required by the New York Attorney General to provide evidence of its USD reserves for a specified period.</p>

<p>The true impact of MiCA regulations is yet to be experienced, but many hope that appropriate regulations will deter bad actors, instill consumer confidence, and foster broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Under the new rules, stablecoins deemed significant will be supervised by the EBA instead of national regulators, subject to extra stress tests, and required to maintain their funds equal to 3% of their reserves, up from the usual 2%.</p>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In an official announcement, Worldcoin has <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1683509115417419776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> a new NFT collectible on the NFT trading market <a href="https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x6e60bcdf52078a250932cf9fec174c5f67348845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zora</a> to honor the passing of their WLD tokens.</strong></h5>

<p>The collectible will be available for free casting during a limited time frame, which will last approximately 6 days and 14 hours from the launch time.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/205302-worldcoin-token-openai-ceo-sam-altman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin&#8217;s token</a>, which was co-founded by OpenAI&#8217;s CEO, Sam Altman, experienced a significant surge on its first day of trading, garnering immense attention from investors captivated by the allure of artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>The token&#8217;s value skyrocketed to as high as $3.3 from its initial price of $1.70 before settling at $2.2 at the time of writing. CoinMarketCap data <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/worldcoin-org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that approximately $446 million worth of the token had been traded following its listing on exchanges like Binance.</p>

<p>The project recently made headlines on July 24 as it was listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including <a href="https://coincu.com/205336-worldcoin-project-now-launches-on-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, Huobi, OKX, and Bybit. The listing event garnered much anticipation, primarily due to Worldcoin&#8217;s reputation for rewarding early investors who engage with their Orb products.</p>



<p>Through the Orb eyeball, users of Worldcoin can establish their identity using the innovative Proof of Personhood mechanism, with their data securely stored on the blockchain. The team asserts that the World ID generated through this process will function as a global digital passport, conveniently accessible through users&#8217; smartphones. <a href="https://coincu.com/204875-worldcoins-world-id-sdk-is-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World ID</a> will enable individuals to verify their identities without relying on conventional personal information, such as phone numbers or email addresses.</p>



<p>Despite the project&#8217;s potential, Worldcoin has faced some controversy, mostly concerning the security of users&#8217; information, especially concerning the Orb eyeball technology. However, undeterred by the buzz surrounding these concerns, the project remains steadfast in its pursuit of resolving income inequality and revolutionizing online identity verification.</p>

<p>The Worldcoin project relies on the innovative concept of using the &#8220;orb,&#8221; a small device that scans individuals&#8217; eyeballs to create a unique digital identity. This identity, known as the World ID, provides indisputable &#8220;proof of personhood&#8221; within the Worldcoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>The project&#8217;s white paper indicates that the initial supply of WLD is capped at 10 billion. On the day of its launch, 143 million WLDs were made available, with 100 million <a href="https://coincu.com/205370-worldcoin-now-announced-wld-tokenomics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allocated</a> to market makers and the remaining portion to investors who participated in the pre-launch phase by verifying their identities through the Orb technology.</p>



<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s groundbreaking approach to identity verification and its partnership with OpenAI have garnered significant attention from the crypto community, solidifying its position as an intriguing project to watch closely in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Bittrex reminds users to withdraw funds before the August 31 deadline to resolve potential issues.</em></li>



<li><em>United States Bankruptcy Court grants the exchange permission to allow compliant customers to access accounts and withdraw remaining assets.</em></li>



<li><em>Bittrex&#8217;s well-prepared response to regulatory pressures leads to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing amid SEC&#8217;s clampdown.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bittrex Inc., the US arm of the renowned crypto exchange Bittrex Global, has issued a reminder to its users, encouraging them to withdraw their funds &#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221;</strong></h5>

<p>Despite the withdrawal deadline being set for August 31, the exchange is urging users to take action sooner, allowing ample time to address any unforeseen issues that may arise.</p>

<p>The United States Bankruptcy Court has granted <a href="https://coincu.com/200651-bittrex-faces-challenge-from-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bittrex</a> permission to <a href="https://coincu.com/195030-bittrex-us-users-withdrawing-from-june-15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enable</a> customers who meet specific regulatory requirements to access their accounts and withdraw any remaining assets. This move comes after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 8, 2023, a decision driven by regulatory pressures following the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) crackdown on the trading platform.</p>



<p>The exchange had anticipated potential challenges leading up to the bankruptcy filing, as evident from its strategic measures. On March 31, 2023, Bittrex announced its decision to wind down its US operations, citing ongoing regulatory uncertainties. However, it was on April 17, 2023, that the <a href="https://coincu.com/201434-paradigm-sec-exceeds-statutory-jurisdiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> charged the exchange with violating securities laws, including facilitating the trade of unregistered securities on its platform.</p>



<p>In response to the SEC&#8217;s charges, the exchange issued a statement expressing disappointment with the enforcement action. The company claimed that the SEC&#8217;s approach to regulation by enforcement would not only have adverse effects on cryptocurrency within the United States but also hinder blockchain technology and innovation at large.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1744-1024x682.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1744-1024x682.png" alt="Bittrex Urges Uers To Early Withdrawals As Bankruptcy Deadline Looms" class="wp-image-205551" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1744-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1744-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1744-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1744-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1744-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1744.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bittrex Urges Uers To Early Withdrawals As Bankruptcy Deadline Looms 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the impact of the regulatory actions loomed large, Bittrex took swift action, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 8, 2023. Court filings revealed that the company had more than 100,000 creditors, indicating the severity of its financial woes. Unlike other crypto platforms that experienced abrupt bankruptcy, Bittrex&#8217;s case stood out due to its comprehensive preparation leading up to the filing.</p>



<p>Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler LLP, representing Bittrex, emphasized the exchange&#8217;s extensive actions taken pre-petition to ensure full customer recovery. These actions included the announcement of winding up operations on March 31, with an effective date of April 30. During this period, the exchange halted deposits while allowing customers sufficient time to withdraw their funds without interruption.</p>



<p>Even amidst the bankruptcy filing, Bittrex continued to reassure customers that their assets were secure and would be returned to them. This customer-centric approach distinguishes Bittrex from other crypto platforms, where users often find themselves uncertain about the fate of their funds.</p>



<p>As Bittrex navigates through the Chapter 11 proceedings, its focus remains on safeguarding customer interests and expeditiously resolving the case. The crypto community eagerly awaits the outcome, hoping for a responsible conclusion to the company&#8217;s journey through bankruptcy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is perpetual futures?</h2>



<p>Perpetual futures, also known as perpetual contracts or crypto perpetual, are a form of financial derivative that has taken the cryptocurrency market by storm. These contracts offer traders the unique advantage of taking both long and short positions on an underlying asset without any expiration date. With a design that closely mimics the price movements of the underlying asset, perpetual contracts have become especially sought-after for trading major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>Key Features of Perpetual Futures:</p>



<ul>
<li>Funding Rate Mechanism: One of the most crucial elements of perpetual contracts is the funding rate mechanism. This mechanism plays a vital role in maintaining a close correlation between the perpetual contract price and the spot price of the underlying asset. The funding rate is essentially a periodic interest rate exchanged between long and short position holders. When the funding rate is positive, long position holders pay short position holders, and vice versa when it turns negative. This exchange incentivizes traders to take positions that help bring the contract price closer to the spot price, ensuring market stability.</li>



<li>Leverage Facility: Perpetual platforms also offer traders the option to utilize leverage, a feature that enables them to open positions significantly larger than their actual account balance. While leverage can magnify potential profits, it also exposes traders to higher liquidation risks should the market move unfavorably against their position. For instance, a trader utilizing 100x leverage can open a position worth $10,000 with a mere $100 of their own capital.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Optimism ecosystem has witnessed substantial growth in its perpetual platforms, with three of them standing out as the largest players in the market. As these platforms continue to gain traction, they are increasingly shaping the landscape of perpetual trading within the cryptocurrency space.</p>

By contributing liquidity to the pool, providers stand to gain trading fees from other users, making it a mutually beneficial ecosystem.</p>



<p>Security is a top priority for Perpetual Protocol, given the inherent risks in the crypto world. To safeguard its open-source code base, the platform incentivizes developers to discover bugs by offering bug bounties. This proactive approach ensures that the platform can address vulnerabilities swiftly and maintain a secure environment for its users.</p>



<p>At its core, Perpetual Protocol operates as software that encourages a distributed network of computers to facilitate the trading of derivative contracts. What sets it apart is that it functions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Instead, Perpetual Protocol relies on meticulously crafted smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized setup empowers users to engage in trading without placing trust in a central authority. All they need is confidence in the code&#8217;s ability to execute transactions as intended.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1738-1024x538.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1738-1024x538.png" alt="Comparison Of The Top 3 Largest Perpetual Platforms On Optimism" class="wp-image-205539" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1738-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1738-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1738-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1738-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1738-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1738.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Comparison Of The Top 3 Largest Perpetual Platforms On Optimism 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>The project takes inspiration from two highly successful DeFi platforms &#8211; Uniswap and Synthetix. However, Perpetual Protocol sets itself apart by focusing on leverage trading, short positions, and minimizing slippage. Unlike Uniswap, it is not intended for spot trading or exposure to real-world assets.</p>



<p>Key to Perpetual Protocol&#8217;s functionality is its innovative use of a virtual automated market maker (vAMM) and collateralization vault. These essential components settle trades and offer users access to a wide array of complex financial instruments, with perpetual contracts being the flagship product.</p>



<p>Perpetual contracts are a type of derivative akin to futures contracts but without an expiry date. In traditional futures contracts, traders speculate on the price of an underlying asset until a predetermined future date when the asset is delivered. Perpetual contracts, on the other hand, are perpetual in nature, with no delivery of the underlying asset. Traders pay fees to maintain their positions, allowing for greater flexibility and prolonged trading opportunities.</p>



<p>The native cryptocurrency of Perpetual Protocol, PERP, plays a crucial role in the ecosystem. It is utilized for staking and governance, with PERP holders having the power to influence the project&#8217;s direction. By staking their tokens, users actively contribute to securing the marketplace and ensuring its smooth operation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pika Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>In a bid to spearhead the derivatives segment on the Optimism ecosystem, Pika is making significant strides in building and developing Pika Exchange. The platform has introduced a plethora of innovative features to provide users with a cutting-edge trading experience.</p>



<p>One of the key highlights of Pika is its unwavering focus on deep liquidity. By employing the virtual automated market maker (vAMM) model, the exchange optimizes capital efficiency and minimizes slippage, ensuring a seamless trading process even during times of high volatility.</p>



<p>To determine asset prices accurately, Pika Protocol has integrated Chainlink Oracles with Dynamic Pricing. This formula calculates the Trade Price as the Base Price multiplied by the Slippage, adding the Price Adjustment. This approach enhances price transparency and empowers traders with real-time, reliable market data.</p>



<p>Pika stands out for its versatility, enabling users to trade a wide range of crypto assets available in the market. With the vAMM model, the platform ensures that traders have access to an extensive selection of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Pika&#8217;s long-term vision involves expanding its offerings to encompass traditional finance (TradFi) assets and indices, catering to a diverse set of investors.</p>



<p>Emphasizing the importance of composability in the DeFi space, Pika Protocol allows seamless integration with other DeFi protocols. This fosters the creation of profitable tools and solutions for users, enhancing the overall DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<p>One of the major advantages of utilizing Pika Protocol is its cost-effectiveness. As the platform is built on Optimism, transaction fees are relatively low while still inheriting the robust security and decentralization features of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>Pika has devised a unique liquidation mechanism, wherein the price difference between the entry and liquidation price is utilized to pay liquidators, liquidation fees, and liquidity providers. This innovative approach ensures the smooth functioning of the platform while safeguarding users&#8217; interests.</p>



<p>Arbitrage mitigation is a key concern in the DeFi space, and Pika Protocol has taken inspiration from GMX to address this issue. By offering solutions to limit arbitrage opportunities by bots, Pika enhances fairness and transparency in the trading environment.</p>



<p>For users seeking to provide liquidity, Pika Protocol offers the Liquidity Vault feature. Liquidity providers can participate in different vaults and earn profits from transaction fees, liquidation fees, and interest on trades, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem.</p>



<p>Beyond these remarkable features, Pika Protocol also supports leveraged trading, providing traders with up to 50x leverage. This feature enhances potential returns for users, making Pika a comprehensive and dynamic perpetual platform on the Optimism network.</p>



<p>With its relentless pursuit of innovation and user-centric approach, Pika Protocol is poised to lead the derivatives market on Optimism, driving the DeFi revolution forward and offering traders unparalleled opportunities in the crypto space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kwenta</strong></h3>



<p>Developed on the Optimism Layer 2 network by the renowned Synthetix team, Kwenta offers a wide range of derivative assets, from tokens to traditional financial instruments like Forex, gold, and silver.</p>



<p>At the heart of Kwenta&#8217;s functionality lies its ability to provide a diverse selection of synthetic assets, thanks to its foundation on the Synthetix protocol. The platform&#8217;s users can engage in spot swaps and perpetual futures trading, offering them a plethora of investment opportunities.</p>



<p>A standout feature of Kwenta is its emphasis on perpetual futures, which supports margin trading with leverage of up to 25x. Traders can choose from various order types, including market orders, limit orders, and stop market orders, granting them greater control over their trading strategies.</p>



<p>One of the cornerstones of Kwenta&#8217;s seamless trading experience is its integration with the Chainlink oracle, which ensures accurate and real-time price feeds for Synthetix&#8217;s synthetic assets. As a result, trades on Kwenta enjoy zero slippage, a significant advantage for traders seeking to execute precise transactions.</p>

<p>KWENTA, the governance token of Kwenta, plays a crucial role in incentivizing coordination and growth within the Kwenta DAO. Holders of KWENTA can actively participate in the platform&#8217;s governance decisions, shaping its future developments.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional exchanges that rely on order books and automated market makers (AMMs), Kwenta leverages the power of the synthetic asset protocol, Synthetix. The liquidity for Kwenta&#8217;s trades is provided by Synthetix&#8217;s Synthetic Asset Debt Pool, ensuring a robust and efficient trading environment.</p>



<p>Since its inception in October 2020, Kwenta has garnered a reputation for its steadfast security. With no security attacks or crisis events experienced, the platform remains a trusted destination for traders looking for a secure and reliable trading venue.</p>



<p>Kwenta&#8217;s commitment to security is further demonstrated through its diligent smart contract audit process. The platform&#8217;s disclosed smart contract audit report revealed a few security issues, including one high, one medium, and three low-severity concerns. However, the team promptly addressed and resolved these issues, demonstrating its dedication to maintaining a safe and robust ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>MakerDAO&#8217;s Spark Protocol reaches 14.44 million DAI tokens lent, a DeFi lending milestone.</em></li>



<li><em>Spark Protocol enables the borrowing and lending of decentralized tokens on Ethereum, serving as Maker&#8217;s MetaDAO.</em></li>



<li><em>MakerDAO halts lending to a credit pool after $2.1 million in defaults; Spark Protocol showcases DeFi potential.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a groundbreaking development for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, MakerDAO&#8217;s Spark Protocol, <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1683491395242172417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">centered</a> around the DAI stablecoin, has achieved an impressive historical high in DAI lending volume, reaching a staggering 14.44 million tokens.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1733.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="506" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1733-1024x506.png" alt="MakerDAO&#039;s Spark Protocol Achieves New Milestone with 14.44 Million DAI Tokens Lent" class="wp-image-205531" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1733-1024x506.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1733-300x148.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1733-768x379.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1733-750x370.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1733-1140x563.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1733.png 1383w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="MakerDAO&#039;s Spark Protocol Achieves New Milestone with 14.44 Million DAI Tokens Lent 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/200072-spark-protocol-lending-expand-multi-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spark Protocol</a>, which was officially launched by <a href="https://coincu.com/200460-makerdao-earns-315k-fees-daily-as-mkr-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MakerDAO</a> in May, serves as a lending solution exclusively for DAI users. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to seamlessly borrow and lend decentralized tokens. The primary objective of the project is to enhance the utility and adoption of DAI, the renowned stablecoin issued by MakerDAO.</p>



<p>As the first product in Maker&#8217;s ambitious Endgame plan, the Spark Protocol plays a pivotal role as a MetaDAO within the DeFi ecosystem. It is akin to a soft fork of Aave V3, and it even allocates 10% of its profits to AaveDAO during the initial two years of its operation, fostering collaboration and mutual growth.</p>

<p>The inaugural version of the Spark Protocol functions as a &#8220;lending marketplace,&#8221; empowering users with both supply and borrowing features for various cryptocurrencies, including Ether (ETH), staked Ether (stETH), DAI, and staked DAI (sDAI). However, the platform is specially tailored to cater to DAI users, striving to provide them with access to highly competitive interest rates.</p>



<p>One of the critical connections in the Spark Protocol ecosystem is with Maker&#8217;s D3M (Direct Deposit Dai Module). This integration facilitates seamless interaction between the Maker ecosystem and third-party lending pools. By leveraging this link, users can borrow DAI at even more favorable rates, with an initial annual rate set at an enticing 1.11%.</p>

<p>Despite the recent success of Spark Protocol, MakerDAO faced a unanimous community vote to suspend lending to a tokenized credit pool on the Centrifuge protocol. The pool, <a href="https://coincu.com/204509-makerdao-halts-lending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed</a> by fintech firm Harbor Trade, minted $1.5 million in DAI stablecoins from the DAO, utilizing loans to support a consumer firm. Unfortunately, the firm defaulted on a significant debt of $2.1 million, causing concern within the ecosystem. As a measure to safeguard the system, MakerDAO decided to reduce the Debt Ceiling for the troubled credit pool from 7 million DAI to 0 DAI, effectively halting any further borrowing and mitigating potential risks.</p>



<p>Despite this hiccup, the Spark Protocol&#8217;s impressive growth and success signify a promising future for MakerDAO&#8217;s DeFi lending offerings. With a commitment to enhancing the DAI ecosystem and enabling users to participate in decentralized finance securely and seamlessly, MakerDAO continues to shape the landscape of the crypto lending space. As the industry evolves and expands, the achievements of Spark Protocol serve as a testament to the immense potential of DeFi solutions.</p>
