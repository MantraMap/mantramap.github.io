<ul><li>A Montenegro Court sentenced TerraUSD creator Do Kwon to four months in jail for forging travel papers. </li><li>The Terraform Labs founder was set to remain in Montenegrin custody till next year as authorities consider extradition requests from South Korea and the U.S.</li><li>South Korean investigators could seek a 40-year sentence for Do Kwon after his company&#8217;s multi-billion collapse last summer. </li></ul>



<p>Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon was found guilty of forging travel documents and sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro court, <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/D264" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/D264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> said on Monday. Kwon pleaded &#8220;Not  guilty&#8221; last Friday to the charges.</p>



<p>The fugitive Kwon was arrested in March by Montenegrin law enforcement in Podgorica, the country&#8217;s capital city. Authorities detained the former crypto tycoon as he was about to board a private plane bound for Dubai. Kwon was arrested together with Han Chang-Joon, a former CFO and executive at Terra. </p>



<p>Both suspects were initially granted bail before a High Court annulled the decision. Bail was again <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-granted-400k-bail-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-granted-400k-bail-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">granted</a> by the Basic Court prior to today&#8217;s ruling. Furthermore, it was previously determined by a Montenegrin court that Do Kwon would remain in detention for six month while authorities assess extradition requests from South Korea and the U.S. </p>



<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s Legal Woes </h2>



<p>The ruling on June 19 is the first against Do Kwon since his company Terraform Labs collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out billions in investments. Estimates say that the Terra&#8217;s crash, premeditated by the collapse of TerraLUNA (now LUNA Classic or LUNC) and the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), amounted to over $40 billion in drown investments from retail and institutional players. </p>



<p>Indeed, the collapse unleashed a domino effect that saw companies like Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, and BlockFi fall to ruin. </p>



<p>Since then Do Kwon has evaded law enforcement despite claiming to not be on the run. South Korean investigators claim that Do Kwon&#8217;s violations of the country&#8217;s Capital Markets Acts makes the jurisdiction the perfect place for his trial. Kwon could spend as much as 40 years in prison if <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-sentence-40-year-south-korea-jail/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-sentence-40-year-south-korea-jail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">convicted</a> in his home country. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, U.S authorities also want to prosecute Do Kwon as the Securities and Exchange Commission already filed charges against the former Terra CEO. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder proposed increasing the validator balance cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.</li><li>The idea being considered within the developer community would stem the growing active validator set size and optimize network efficiency.</li><li>Increasing the limits of validator balances would also make room for auto-compounding of rewards, allowing validators to earn maximum yield for their staked coins.</li></ul>



<p>Following a <a href="https://twitter.com/christine_dkim/status/1669740046256312320?s=46&amp;t=pA66xOVb6aHMw-v_CxFceA" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/christine_dkim/status/1669740046256312320?s=46&amp;t=pA66xOVb6aHMw-v_CxFceA" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposal</a> from Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder, core developers of crypto’s largest altcoin network could increase the validator balance cap from the 32 ETH limit to a staggering 2,048 ETH if the idea garners support.</p>



<p>Neuder shared the proposal during the developer&#8217;s bi-weekly call where client teams meet to discuss and coordinate the most important updates to the network. The increase in validator balance seems to address a major concern &#8211; the growing number of validators on Ethereum&#8217;s PoS network.</p>



<p>Indeed, the current 32 ETH limit means that entities must run multiple validators if they wish to stake past the limit and access more staking rewards. The balance limit has so far spurred an increase in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">validators which currently exceeds half a million</a>, a rapid increase since The Merge.</p>



<p>According to Neuder’s proposal, increasing the balance limit will push Ethereum toward greater efficiency by optimizing finality in a single block.</p>



<p>While the current balance cap buoys decentralization, it also causes entities to operate a concerning number of validators which could adversely impact network efficiency, Neuder argued during Friday’s developer&#8217;s call.</p>



<h2>More Ethereum Rewards For Validators</h2>



<p>Furthermore, Neuder’s proposal could unlock greater rewards for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum validators</a> since they would be able to stake more and therefore, earn more yield on their staked tokens.</p>



<p>Currently, the 32 ETH limit does not allow validators to earn rewards beyond their capped balances. This limit propels operational costs for larger node operators who end up managing hundreds or thousands of validators in a bid to maximize their yield generation.</p>



<p>If the cap is increased, Neuder argued that an auto-compounding feature could allow for fewer Ethereum validators to exist while accessing greater rewards through auto-compounding of their staked yield.</p>



<p>The researcher warned that the idea is not without risk and developers will continue to weigh the merits alongside other hot-button upgrades mulled in the upcoming Deneb and Cancun.</p>



<p>Deneb which focuses on changes to the consensus layer should roll out based on three EIPs. EIP 7044 introduces a code change that accepts signed validator exits in perpetuity, thus bettering the shaking experience.</p>



<p>Another staking experience upgrade, EIP 4788, aims to improve access to Beacon chain blocks with information on the chain state inside EVMs. EIP 7045 focuses on improved security by expanding the attestation slot from a rolling window of one epoch to two epochs.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Binance is under investigation in France for offering illegal digital asset services and aggravated money laundering, Le Monde reported. </li><li>The platform announced its exit from the Netherlands on Friday after failing to obtain a license and meet up with AML regulations.</li><li>Binance recently shut down its business in Cyprus as part of plans to comply with the newly signed EU MiCA policies.</li><li>The crypto exchange is under heavy scrutiny from the U.S. SEC for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange and offering illegal securities trading to American investors.</li></ul>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Le Monde</a> citing word from the Paris public prosecutors office, Binance is under investigation for illegally providing French investors with digital asset trading facilities and also supporting “acts of aggravated money laundering”. </p>



<p>French authorities allege that the company offered these services to French customers through its local division and regulators have been investigating suspicions since February 2022.  The local publication reported that documents and records seized will be analyzed for evidence as regulators build their case against crypto’s largest centralized exchange. </p>



<p>In other related news, the crypto exchange is <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1669628787267624961?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1669628787267624961?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pulling out of the Dutch market</a> after failing to secure a crypto license and comply with the Netherlands’ anti-money laundering (AML) policies. </p>



<p>Binance’s exit from the Netherlands comes shortly after the company announced plans to shut down its division in Cyprus. This decision was reportedly taken as a strategic move to comply with MiCA, the landmark crypto rule recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> into law by EU policymakers.</p>



<h2>Binance Vs SEC</h2>



<p>Friday’s developments about exiting the Dutch markets and investigations in France have emerged amid intense regulatory scrutiny in America. </p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao for breaking securities law, commingling customers&#8217; funds in a private entity, and denying investors of proper protection through necessary disclosure. </p>



<p>Binance US, the company’s American affiliate, has seen its market share shrink to 1% following the news, per Kaiko data. The U.S. trading arm also announced staff cuts as it prepares for a lengthy and expensive litigation process with the SEC. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>BlackRock, Bank of America, and Fidelity have all massively increased their holdings of MicroStrategy stock, Bitcoin’s largest corporate holder.</li><li>Buying MSTR seems to be a path to BTC exposure rather than directly buying crypto’s top coin.</li><li>Canada’s sixth largest bank has also spent a considerable amount buying MicroStrategy stock in 2023.</li><li>The appetite for MSTR shares comes at a time when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is cracking down on crypto activity in America.</li></ul>



<p>Major banks and Financial Institutions in the U.S. seem to be increasing their exposure to Bitcoin by accumulating massive positions of MicroStrategy shares, the same company that is currently the largest corporate holder of BTC with coffers worth over $3 billion at current prices.</p>



<p>Three giants in particular &#8211; BlackRock, Bank of America, and Fidelity have spent a combined $200+ million buying MicroStrategy’s MSTR. </p>



<p>Bank of America, the 2nd largest bank in the U.S. worth over $200 billion and with over $3 trillion in assets under management (AUM), spent $59.5 million solidifying its 2.3% stake in Michael Saylor’s company.</p>



<p>Fidelity with its $4.5 trillion AUM portfolio splurged over $25 million securing a 1% stake in MSTR while Canada’s sixth largest financial house, The National Bank of Canada spent over half a million dollars buying MicroStrategy shares this year.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most eye-catching MSTR buyer with over $150 million worth of shares is the world’s largest asset manager with $10 trillion in AUM &#8211; BlackRock. BlackRock boasts a massive 6% stake in MicroStrategy. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, recent reports from <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/15/blackrock-close-to-filing-bitcoin-etf-source/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/15/blackrock-close-to-filing-bitcoin-etf-source/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinDesk</a> say that BlackRock plans to file a Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p>Notably, the U.S. SEC has historically denied Bitcoin ETF applications previously submitted by companies like Grayscale. It’s unclear if BlackRock might succeed where others have failed.</p>

<h2>MSTR Offers Bitcoin Exposure </h2>



<p>It’s possible that U.S. banking and financial giants are aping in on MSTR stock since the company holds Bitcoin, and thus, offers exposure to crypto’s leading coin by market cap. Indeed, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-29-million-btc-buy/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-29-million-btc-buy/" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest corporate holder of Bitcoin</a> at press time with over 140,000 BTC worth more than $3 billion at today’s prices. </p>



<p>Apart from leading the crypto industry as the top coin by market cap, Bitcoin sits on a short list of digital assets not considered an unregistered security by the SEC. </p>



<p>Analysis and predictions from several stakeholders, including the $700 billion-strong Standard Chartered agree that BTC will leap in value by 2024. This possibly makes BTC an alluring investment for America’s biggest institutions with MSTR offering a regulated way for these banks to hold Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Bitcoin traded around $25,000 on Thursday after falling in price amid a broader crypto market downturn that followed the SEC&#8217;s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase</a>. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>On Thursday, Crypto’s largest stablecoin USDT from Tether slightly depegged as a token imbalance rocked Curve’s popular 3pool.</li><li>Tether balances on Curve’s stablecoin pool peaked at 76% at press time as traders sold millions of USDT for DAI and USDC.</li><li>“We are ready to redeem any amount” CTO Paolo Ardoino tweeted saying that edgy markets make easy prey for attackers.</li></ul>



<p>Stablecoin balances on Curve’s 3pool show that traders are opting out of Tether’s USDT as crypto’s largest stablecoin by a wide margin depegged during trading hours on Thursday. </p>



<p>Analysis from on-chain insight outfit Peckshield showed that USDT made up over 76% of 3pool, a stablecoin pool offered by Curve Finance that features USDT, Maker’s DAI, and Circle’s USDC. </p>



<p>The sharp balance change means that traders are swapping millions of USDT for DAI and USDC amid the slight depeg. The development could also provide an opportunity for arbitrage traders looking to profit from another depeg event in the crypto market. </p>



<p>Curve’s 3pool showed USDT balances of over $315 million while DAI and USDC balances slipped below $50 million as traders seemingly dumped their Tether. A similar pattern was observed last summer during Terra’s meteoric collapse and again when Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange ran into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>At press time, USDT&#8217;s depeg had recovered back to $0.9975. USDT’s market cap was above $83 billion on Thursday, by far the largest stablecoin market cap in crypto per CMC data.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The hackers suspected to be North Korea’s Lazarus group moved stolen funds from Atomic Wallet through Garantex, Elliptic reported.</li><li>Atomic Wallet was hacked of several cryptos including BTC, ETH, USDT, DOGE, LTC, BNB, and MATIC to the tune of $35 million.</li><li>Lazarus hackers swapped a portion of the stolen funds to BTC using 1inch and Garantex before laundering the assets through crypto tumbler Sinbad.</li></ul>



<p>The hackers behind this month’s $35 million attack on crypto wallet Atomic Wallet <a href="https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1668357982248206339?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1668357982248206339?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moved</a> some of the stolen funds to Garantex, a crypto exchange sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).</p>



<h2>Atomic Wallet Hacked, $35 Million In Bitcoin And Cryptos Stolen</h2>



<p>On June 3, hackers believed to be part of the notorious North Korean cyberterrorist group Lazarus stole several crypto assets from Atomic Wallet. The stolen assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), BNB, Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Polygon (MATIC) were worth around $35 million.</p>



<p>The wallet provider said the attack affected less than 1% of its monthly active users and investigations were ongoing to identify the exploit vector. </p>



<p>Lazarus hackers leveraged decentralized trading service 1inch before sending the stolen assets to OFAC-sanctioned Garantex. The exchange which still operates today was blacklisted by the OFAC for its loose anti-money laundering systems in 2022.</p>



<p>According to Elliptic researchers, the hackers used Garantex to swap the funds for BTC and then sent the assets to crypto tumbler Sinbad for laundering. The hackers were forced to take this route after <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitrue-hackers-steal-23-million-eth/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitrue-hackers-steal-23-million-eth/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto exchanges</a> froze addresses tied to the Atomic Wallet hack thanks to a “cross-community effort”.</p>



<h2>Atomic Wallet Exploiter Locks ETH In Non-Withdrawable Contracts</h2>



<p>In a bizarre move, the Atomic Wallet exploiter created 0x/null contracts and deposited ETH worth around $40,000 at current prices. The reason behind the move is unclear as it is impossible to withdraw funds from these 0x/null smart contracts. Coinbase Director Conor Grogan <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1668602352155209733?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1668602352155209733?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tracked</a> the activity and alerted the crypto Twitter community on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The investment provider will delist four cryptocurrencies for U.S. customers in response to the SEC’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.</li><li>Customers will not have the option to open new ALGO, MANA, DASH, and MATIC positions from July 12.</li><li>Users can still hold and sell their positions until further notice.</li><li>eToro cited “recent developments&#8221; as the reason following securities claims in filing against the two major cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase continue to reverberate throughout the industry as investment platform eToro <a href="https://twitter.com/eToroUS/status/1668323758199955456?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/eToroUS/status/1668323758199955456?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plans to delist four digital assets</a> that are allegedly unregistered securities. </p>



<p>eToro is a cryptocurrency exchange and an online brokerage platform with a limited range of equities and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allows users to trade 30+ cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>eToro And Robinhood Move Quick After SEC Lawsuits</h2>



<p>On Monday, eToro told users that it will delist four cryptocurrencies &#8211; Algorand&#8217;s ALGO, Decentraland&#8217;s MANA, Dash (DASH), and Polygon (MATIC). The change in eToro&#8217;s crypto offering will only affect U.S. customers and will take effect from July 12. </p>



<p>eToro will allow its U.S. customers to hold and sell their positions in these four tokens post-July 12 but users cannot open new positions, per Monday&#8217;s announcement. The platform cited “recent developments&#8221; as the reason following the SEC&#8217;s litigation against two major crypto exchanges &#8211; Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The decision from eToro follows Robinhood&#8217;s move to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">delist three tokens also classified as securities</a> &#8211; Solana&#8217;s SOL, Cardano&#8217;s ADA, and Polygon&#8217;s MATIC. </p>



<h2>Altcoins In Hot Water</h2>



<p>Prices across the crypto ecosystem slumped last week after the SEC unleashed allegations against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance and Coinbase</a> claiming that both platforms broke U.S. laws. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-changpeng-zhao-summoned-dc-court/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-changpeng-zhao-summoned-dc-court/" rel="noreferrer noopener">included</a> in the watchdog&#8217;s lawsuit for supposedly commingling funds into a private entity identified as Merit Peak. </p>



<p>The altcoins listed by Gary Gensler&#8217;s watchdog boast a combined market cap of over $100 billion, creating further uncertainty about the future of these tokens in the U.S.</p>



<p>Notably, crypto proponents are pushing back against the commission&#8217;s claims and insisting that the regulator has failed in its duty to provide clear guidance for the nascent industry. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The SEC’s claims that SOL, ADA, and MATIC are securities were met with stiff disagreement by the development foundation of each token.</li><li>Following their statements last week, investors seemed to steady their feet as prices rebounded slightly on Monday.</li><li>SOL, ADA, and MATIC market values initially dropped after the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase for violating U.S. securities laws.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto Foundation to the SEC’s claim that tokens Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, and Polygon’s MATIC are Securities, saying that they are in fact not securities at all. </p>



<p>Following the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase for offering unregistered securities trading to American investors, the market prices of these tokens slumped amid a broader decline in the crypto market last week. </p>



<p>Crypto and Equities trading provider Robinhood <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">delisted</a> SOL, ADA, and MATIC after the U.S. financial watchdog classified the tokens as securities, shaking investor confidence in these assets. </p>



<p>Market makers and institutional investors like Jump Trading and Cumberland transferred millions of dollars in Polygon&#8217;s MATIC to trading venues, further prompting fears of a sell-off that triggered a further price drop.</p>



<p>These tokens have since recovered slightly in price along with crypto asset values as proponents and development foundations push back against the SEC&#8217;s war on crypto. </p>



<h2>SOL, ADA, AND MATIC Are Not Securities, Foundations Fight Back</h2>



<p>On June 11, MATIC developer Polygon Labs refuted the SEC&#8217;s claims without directly addressing the watchdog. &#8220;developed outside the US, deployed outside the US&#8221;, the startup said concerning MATIC in a bid to debunk allegations that the token is a security. MATIC was up 3% at press time and traded around $0.63 on markets. </p>

<p>The Solana Foundation &#8220;disagrees with the characterization of SOL as a security&#8221;, a thread <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1667578529612017666?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1667578529612017666?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published</a> on June 10 reads. In addition, the SOL Foundation does not expect the SEC&#8217;s claims will disrupt developer activity. The Foundation also called on U.S. policymakers to focus clearer rules for the benefit of investors and providers alike.  The coin was down 1.02% on Monday, per CMC data.</p>



<p>&#8220;Under no circumstances was ADA a security,&#8221; said Cardano developer IOG on June 9. IOD added that the SEC&#8217;s claims were riddled with inaccuracies. ADA exchanged hands for $0.27, up over 4% over a 24-hour period, TradingView data showed.</p>



<p>SOL, ADA, and MATIC are three tokens in a basket of cryptos classified as securities by the U.S. SEC in lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. Aside from the price dip that followed the news of the suits and delisting on Robinhood, it&#8217;s yet unclear the ramifications of the SEC&#8217;s claims that certain cryptocurrencies are securities and must be registered with the commission. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Data from Blockchain Intelligence startup Nansen shows a steady increase in the number of staked ETH.</li><li>So far, users and entities have locked over 22 million coins which amount to about 18% of the token’s supply.</li><li>At the same time, balances in crypto exchanges are declining and now sit below 30 million tokens. </li><li>Analysts say the Shapella upgrade eliminated concerns around withdrawals and triggered a boom in locked tokens since stakers can earn rewards as opposed to just holding their coins.</li></ul>



<p>The number of staked ETH continues to increase following the release of Shapella which enabled withdrawals for locked coins on Ethereum’s Beacon chain.</p>



<p>Following the Merge &#8211; Ethereum’s massive technological transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake &#8211; proponents were concerned about withdrawal functionality and possible selling pressure on the market.</p>



<p>Both concerns were rendered non-events, said Nansen’s Martin Lee as Shapella galvanized users and entities alike to stake more tokens. </p>



<p>At press time, the number of staked coins crossed 22 million tokens. This amounts to around 18% of the available supply. The Merge also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ether-daily-issuance-dips-ethereum-merge/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ether-daily-issuance-dips-ethereum-merge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slashed emissions</a> meaning that fewer tokens are released per block as <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rewards</a>, taking ETH into a deflationary state.</p>



<h2>ETH On Exchanges </h2>



<p>At the time when staked tokens continue on the upswing, token balances on crypto exchanges have steadily declined. Balances in crypto exchanges have dropped below 30 million, per Nansen data.</p>



<p>One reason for this could be that entities are more likely to stake their token now that withdrawals are enabled rather than simply hodl the asset. </p>



<p>Analysts opine that the staking incentive is greater now since withdrawals are possible and stakers can earn yield or rewards for locking their tokens. In contrast, holding the token on crypto exchanges earns no yield.</p>

<p>Following lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance and Coinbase, crypto prices fell across the board. Traders were able to scoop up tokens around $1,740 a pop during trading hours on Monday. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Venture Capital behemoth Andreessen Horowitz announced its first office outside the U.S. set to open later this year.</li><li>The A16z office led by General Partner, Sriram Krishnan will be stationed in London as a strategic investment point for growing the UK’s web3 ecosystem.</li><li>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak praised the move as the nation looks to develop into a global hub for blockchain innovation and Web3 businesses.</li></ul>



<p>Andreessen Horowitz (A16z) <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/expanding-uk-andreessen-horowitz/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/expanding-uk-andreessen-horowitz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> a London office scheduled to open later in the year amid growing crypto regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.</p>



<p>The London office is A16z&#8217;s first office outside the U.S. and will be led by general partner Sriram Krishnan. According to the venture capital heavyweight, London serves as an aqueduct for funding and growing the UK’s burgeoning Web3 ecosystem.</p>



<p>A16z also noted the UK’s efforts towards introducing clear rules for crypto and bringing Web3 innovation under the purview of financial regulatory oversight. </p>



<p>“We believe that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation,” A16z said, adding that there is still work to be done to achieve this vision. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The UK also has deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and a strong entrepreneurial culture. It is home to more “unicorns” than Germany, France, and Sweden combined; to some of the world’s largest financial markets and pools of capital; and to highly-sophisticated, world-class regulators. All of these make the UK strongly positioned to lead in web3.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Venture Capital giant already opened its pockets to UK Web3 projects, recently leading a $43 million Series A for Gensyn. Gensyn provides computing power for artificial intelligence (AI) projects by harnessing blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Notably, A16z’s expansion to the UK does not mean the company plans to abandon the U.S. Instead the venture capitalist plans to explore other markets while lobbying for clearer crypto rules in the U.S.</p>



<h2>Be Welcome A16z, Prime Minister Sunak Praises UK Expansion</h2>



<p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hailed the move as a step toward growing the UK into a global Web3 innovation hub. </p>



<p>Last year, PM Sunak <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/rishi-sunak-appointed-as-uk-pm-could-be-the-next-step-towards-uk-becoming-the-crypto-hub/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/rishi-sunak-appointed-as-uk-pm-could-be-the-next-step-towards-uk-becoming-the-crypto-hub/" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed</a> for crypto regulations in a bid to position the UK as a leader in blockchain and crypto development. Policymakers in the UK have since <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uk-fca-unveils-stricter-rules-for-crypto/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uk-fca-unveils-stricter-rules-for-crypto/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed advertising rules</a> and licensing regimes to protect investors without stifling growth within the local Web3 economy. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We must embrace new innovations like Web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the economy.</p></blockquote>
