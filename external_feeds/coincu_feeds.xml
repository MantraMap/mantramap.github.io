<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Gensyn has completed a $43 million Series A funding round, led by a16z</em></li>



<li><em>It is a blockchain-based artificial intelligence (AI) computing protocol that achieves many expectations.</em></li>



<li><em>The investment will accelerate the protocol&#8217;s launch and expand its workforce of machine learning engineers.</em></li>

<p>To date, Gensyn has raised more than $50 million. In March of last year, Gensyn completed a $6.5 million seed funding round led by Eden Block, with participation from Galaxy Digital, Maven 11, Coinfund, Hypersphere, and Zee Prime.</p>



<p>The protocol is gaining a lot of public interest because it allows developers to build AI systems on smaller data centers, PCs, and other connected hardware, as well as pay per unit. Gensysn uses a cryptographic verification network without intermediaries allowing users to determine that the machine learning work shared over the protocol was completed correctly.</p>



<p>The project says it will use the new funding to accelerate the launch of the protocol and expand its workforce with machine learning engineers.</p>

<p>There is growing interest in AI, which has the potential to change the way businesses operate in many industries, including media, retail, manufacturing, and financial services. The integration of AI and Blockchain affects many aspects, including Security – Cybersecurity, because AI and blockchain will provide a dual shield against cyber attacks, which are increasingly common.</p>



<p>&#8220;We believe that no one can combine the knowledge and cultural understanding of both the AI and crypto worlds better than Gensyn and look forward to working with them to create an infrastructure for AI that can much more widely accessible.&#8221; a16z Cryptocurrency General Partner Ali Yahya said in a statement.</p>



<p>Last month, computer chip maker Nvidia, whose products are indispensable for graphics processing units (GPUs) at the core of AI systems, reached a valuation of $1 trillion.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Solana&#8217;s community calls for a fork of SOL to remove the risks associated with SEC securities allegations.</em></li>



<li><em>Many of the community supports this idea, including the founder of Abracadabra HGEABC, but most of the community is still confused because the plan is unrealistic.</em></li>



<li><em>ETH&#8217;s ETC fork is also given as an example.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Since SOL was listed as a security by the SEC, there was a voice in the community about forking Solana to eliminate the SEC problems.</strong></h5>

<p>Since receiving accusations of being unregistered security by the SEC, the price of the SOL token has continuously<a href="https://news.coincu.com/194044-solana-foundation-slams-secs-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> plummeted </a>and recorded a 30% drop in the past 7 days. This prompted a discussion in the Solana community.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-821.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="974" height="1024" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-821-974x1024.png" alt="Solana Community Calls For Fork SOL To Stop SEC Allegations" class="wp-image-194168" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-821-974x1024.png 974w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-821-285x300.png 285w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-821-768x808.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-821-750x789.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-821-1140x1199.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-821.png 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" title="Solana Community Calls For Fork SOL To Stop SEC Allegations 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Coingecko</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On June 10th, a heated discussion suggested that the SEC allegation was also the time when Solana should make a decision on a new fork to get rid of the legal risks. This idea was supported by founder Abracadabra HGEABC. Overall, the community has mixed opinions about the fork, and the supporters need a real fork plan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bold but not a bad idea actually. Community fork solana will get rid of sec issue. <br><br>No bankruptcy will dump on you for next 3 years continuously.<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$ETH</a> is a fork of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$ETC</a> and doing well. <br><br>Blink twice if you agree <a href="https://t.co/fWxbkMQ4aI" target="_blank">https://t.co/fWxbkMQ4aI</a></p>&mdash; HGE.ABC (@HGEABC) <a href="https://twitter.com/HGEABC/status/1667443063822622720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In the discussion, ETH&#8217;s ETC fork was also given as an example. The person who started the discussion suggested that the fork was a copy of the chain but with a new set of rules and parameters.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a copy of the chain but with a set of new rules and parameters. For example, the FTX wallets could be blacklisted and not receive the new token. And since the token isn&#8217;t SOL you can rebrand with a new narrative and dodge the SEC potentially. ETH did this in 2017.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ethereum Classic is a hard fork of the Ethereum source platform, which occurred in 2016 following the Ethereum-based Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) hack. The community split into two opposing factions. The same goes for the project.</p>



<p>When comparing Ethereum to Ethereum Classic, Ethereum positions it as an open-source, global platform for decentralized applications. It aims to gain wide acceptance and improve the network to serve growing users.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ethereum Classic aims to provide a permissionless way to manage digital assets and allow money transfers using smart contracts, as Ethereum did in its early stages. Unlike the parent chain, the goal of ETC is to preserve the system in its old state without any significant changes.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="901" height="891" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-822.png" alt="Solana Community Calls For Fork SOL To Stop SEC Allegations" class="wp-image-194170" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-822.png 901w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-822-300x297.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-822-768x759.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-822-75x75.png 75w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-822-750x742.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" title="Solana Community Calls For Fork SOL To Stop SEC Allegations 8"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, this opinion was not supported: &#8220;Eth did not do this in 2017, eth classic did this and that was the fork therefore the new token ETC, ETH remained unchanged.&#8221;</p>



<p>Previously, the Solana foundation also issued a statement disagreeing with the description of SOL as a security. They only welcome the continued engagement of policymakers as constructive partners on regulation to achieve regulatory clarity for these issues to the thousands of entrepreneurs across the US who are building in the digital asset space.</p>

<p>So more specifically, what is DRC-20? What&#8217;s so special about this token standard? Let&#8217;s find out with Coincu in this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is DRC-20?</h2>



<p>The DRC-20 token was released on May 9 and is built on the same technological foundation as the BRC-20 coin.</p>



<p>Digital works, like the BRC-20 standard, are readable on the smallest DOGE unit, known as an Elon. According to the convention, 100,000,000 Elon equals one DOGE.</p>



<p>DRC-20 is a token standard created to address the issues and deficiencies left by BRC-20. With its lightning-fast transaction speed and cheaper costs, it has piqued the interest of both investors and lovers of these token standards.</p>



<p>When a better solution is required, creativity arises to save time. And the DRC-20 is designed to look to do just that.</p>



<p>Inscriptions may include &#8220;arbitrary content,&#8221; resulting in Dogecoin native digital artifacts that satisfy the criteria of both fungible and non-fungible (NFT) tokens without the need for a sidechain or token person.</p>



<p>At a Bitcoin Ordinals participation, the standard was dubbed Doginals by the Cheems account — a Solana-based meme project that adopted the new standard.</p>



<p>There was no DRC-20 token compiler at the beginning. Enigma, on the other hand, titled some of the future DRC-20 tokens in Cheems, Dogewow, Misu, Pepe, and Meme while releasing minting instructions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Pros and Cons</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Enormous investment opportunity: One of the great benefits of the DRC-20&#8217;s early stage is the immense investment potential it provides. Being at the forefront of the new token standard helps you to become an expert and lets you delve deep and explore its possibilities.</li>



<li>Low fee: With DRC-20, minting new tokens is incredibly inexpensive, costing only 0.1 DOGE for each mint. This low fee structure lets you experiment with a range of the tokens without putting your money at risk.</li>



<li>Confidentiality: By placing the ledger on the chain, the DRC-20 protocol provides the ultimate protection of assets. The current letterhead ledger for BRC-20 tokens, on the other hand, is centrally held by the wallet. It is necessary to distinguish between books and transactions. BRC-20 transactions are carried out on the BTC chain, and the ledger data is saved in the wallet&#8217;s database. The wallet creates the account book&#8217;s parsing and indexing rules; if the indexing is not done according to the wallet rules, the appropriate written information cannot be located. The DRC-20 ledger will be stored on the ETHF chain, while the transaction will occur on the Dogecoin chain. Even if the wallet is lost, the user may still discover the appropriate inscription; this method of chaining protects the asset&#8217;s total safekeeping.</li>



<li>Fast transaction speed: In order to fulfill its long-term growth objectives, BRC-20 must constantly enhance the DeFi ecosystem, such as by implementing functionalities like stablecoins and oracles. High gas fees, on the other hand, immediately restrict new user engagement. As users mint the standard DRC-20 token on the Dogecoin chain, the number of daily transactions on the Dogecoin chain skyrockets, hitting a record high and overtaking Bitcoin and Litecoin at one time. The BRC-20 token standard&#8217;s speculative fever has steadily extended to the Dogecoin chain.</li>



<li>UTXO model: BTC, LTC, and Dogecoin are all cryptocurrencies that lack smart contract capabilities, enabling developers to construct a variety of programmable tokens and financial products. The DRC-20 token, on the other hand, has a larger user base, and it has its own &#8220;meme&#8221; feature, which is where the potential lies.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cons</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Limited infrastructure: DRC-20 is currently in its early phases of development since it is a recently formed standard. This implies that there may not yet be a dedicated explorer, making tracking logs and token transactions difficult.</li>



<li>No exchange market: There may not be a well-established market for the DRC-20 token at this time. This may make purchasing and selling these tokens difficult since liquidity and accessibility are constrained.</li>



<li>Hazards of origin and authentication: Due to the lack of an appropriate monitoring method, ensuring the authenticity and validity of DRC-20 minting might be problematic. Without a trusted system, created tokens might pose significant hazards.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does DRC-20 work?</h2>



<p>The Cardinals protocol serves as the foundation for the token standard. The smallest indivisible unit of Dogecoin is designated as &#8220;Elon,&#8221; with 1 Dogecoin equaling 100,000,000 Elons.</p>



<p>The Cardinals protocol is a numbering scheme for Elon, and each Elon has a serial number that increases in the sequence in which they were mined. These serial numbers are referred to as &#8220;Cardinals.&#8221; They give each Elon a distinct personality. At the same time, &#8220;Inscription&#8221; refers to the act of etching text, images, audio, and video data on the elon. Cardinals NFT refers to all of the files carved on Elon, which are now mostly images and words comparable to the Ordinals protocol.</p>



<p>Based on the Cardinals protocol, DRC-20 is a standardized mechanism for homogenous tokens. Apart from BTC and LTC, only Dogecoin can currently perform the UTXO model function. On May 9, the Dogecoin community Dogewow formally announced the deal. DRC-20 intends to investigate the possibility of asset tokenization on the Dogecoin blockchain as a new experiment on the Cardinals protocol. Wallets and protocols are currently significant rule-makers and consensus promoters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Impact of DRC-20</h2>



<p>In an astounding turn of events, Dogecoin&#8217;s daily transaction volume has soared to an unprecedented level that exceeds prior records. In only one week, we had a tenfold increase in daily transactions compared to the norm. This increase in activity may be attributed to the recent implementation of a game-changing technology that allows tokens to be created on the Dogecoin network. According to historical statistics, Dogecoin typically sees roughly 20,000 daily transactions. Nevertheless, with the introduction of the DRC-20 token standard on May 9, the network saw an instant increase in activity.</p>

Will This New Token Standard Help Dogecoin Grow? 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The sudden surge in DRC-20 interest may be traced in part to the marketing and narrative pushed by various Twitter accounts. According to these stories, DRC-20 is the next big thing, similar to the previous token standard BRC-20, with the potential for tokens produced on DRC-20 to generate significant 100x profits. Several people in the crypto world have been drawn to this story. With the launch of DRC-20 and its equivalent ORC-20, developers may now design tokens that run inside the Dogecoin network and use DOGE as network fees. This novel feature not only improves the value proposition of Dogecoin, but also lays the groundwork for the establishment of possible decentralized financial (DeFi) services on the blockchain.</p>



<p>The buzz surrounding DRC-20 stems from the market frenzy around BRC-20 coins, which peaked at $1 billion on May 8. This boom was spurred by fear of missing out (FOMO) on meme coins, which saw a large increase in popularity. Unfortunately, because of the current market decline, the market value of BRC-20 tokens has fallen to $410 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The launch of the DRC-20 token standard has undoubtedly increased interest in the Dogecoin blockchain and its possible applications. Finally, the future path of Dogecoin and its ecosystem will be determined by the community&#8217;s collective choices and activities, and it will be fascinating to witness how this trend evolves over time.</p>



<p>Despite the increased transaction volume, not everyone is pleased with the DRC-20 token release. Opponents argue that DRC-20 may cause network congestion and deviates from DOGE&#8217;s goal of being utilized as a daily currency.</p>



<p>High fees and network congestion are legitimate issues for any blockchain since they may cause the network to become costly and sluggish for daily users, dampening adoption goals.</p>



<p>But, as more people become aware of the advantages of DRC-20 tokens on the Dogecoin network, transaction volume and network activity are expected to rise even more.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>North Korean cybercriminals stole $3 billion in crypto assets, 50% of which was used to finance the country&#8217;s ballistic missile program.</em></li>



<li><em>Defense accounts for 26% of North Korea&#8217;s overall economy; the regime&#8217;s revenue-generating hacking has proven to be &#8220;low-risk, high-reward, and difficult to detect.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recently, it was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-north-koreas-hacker-army-stole-3-billion-in-crypto-funding-nuclear-program-d6fe8782?mod=latest_headlines" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-north-koreas-hacker-army-stole-3-billion-in-crypto-funding-nuclear-program-d6fe8782?mod=latest_headlines" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered </a>that North Korean hackers stole $3 billion in crypto assets, with 50% of the funds being used to fund the country&#8217;s ballistic missile program, which was developed alongside its nuclear weapons. The largest heist was $600 million from Vietnamese game company Sky Mavis. </strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-816.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="475" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-816.png" alt="North Korean Hackers Steal $3 Billion In Crypto And Fund Missile Program" class="wp-image-194159" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-816.png 700w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-816-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="North Korean Hackers Steal $3 Billion In Crypto And Fund Missile Program 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This was done through a Trojan Horse document given to an engineer as part of the interview process. The hackers had access to the engineer&#8217;s computer and broke into Sky Mavis, stealing mostly from players of the game Axie Infinity. Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, reported that this was North Korea&#8217;s biggest haul in five years of digital heists. </p>



<p>Defense accounts for an enormous portion of North Korea&#8217;s overall spending, with the State Department estimating in 2019 that Pyongyang spent about $4 billion on defense, accounting for 26% of its overall economy. Although Sky Mavis has now repaid the cyberattack victims, the incident threatened the existence of the then-four-year-old company.</p>



<p>The incident has caught the attention of the White House, where it and other North Korean crypto attacks throughout 2022 have raised grave concerns. North Korea has been developing a digital bank-robbing army to evade harsh sanctions and support its ambitions to project geopolitical power through nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. </p>



<p>The regime&#8217;s revenue-generating hacking has proven to be &#8220;low-risk, high-reward and difficult to detect, and their increasing sophistication can frustrate attribution,&#8221; according to a 2020 United Nations report. U.S. officials and security experts have noted that the country has increasingly sought to focus its cyberattacks on generating cash while dramatically improving its technical sophistication to pull off large-scale thefts.</p>

<p>Sky Mavis&#8217;s Aleksander Larsen said, &#8220;when you look at the amount of funds stolen, it would look like an existential threat to what you are building.&#8221; The incident also revealed that North Korea had built a shadow workforce of thousands of IT workers operating out of countries worldwide, including Russia and China, who make money doing mundane technology work. </p>



<p>Investigators say this workforce is often linked up with the regime&#8217;s cybercrime operations. North Korea&#8217;s hackers are getting more technically sophisticated, with some experts having seen the country&#8217;s hackers pull off elaborate maneuvers that haven&#8217;t been observed anywhere else. North Korea&#8217;s cybercrime skill over the past year has impressed U.S. officials and researchers.</p>

<p>Last week, the altcoin market witnessed <a href="https://news.coincu.com/193886-robinhood-liquidation-583m-ada-matic-sol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serious bloodshed</a> when the SEC accused a series of tokens as unregistered securities that caused altcoin prices to plummet. The heaviest were Solana (SOL), Cadano (ADA) ) and Polygon (MATIC), with a reduction of up to 25%.</p>



<p>Investors should also pay attention not to rely solely on unlocked token information to make a decision to short one coin/token. Unlock tokens will increase the circulating supply of the token, but it is unlikely that the token will be inflated or depreciated if there are effective tokenomics. Besides, the unlock token is just one of the few factors affecting the token&#8217;s price besides the macro situation, tokenomics policy, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>StarkNet uses Cairo language, a language that allows developers to scale and deploy dApps or smart contracts in any field.</em></li>



<li><em>Compared with Optimistic Rollup technology, Zk-Rollups is appreciated for its optimized transaction validation process and time.</em></li>



<li><em>However, using the Cairo programming language makes it difficult for the number of applications and developers to scale to the network.</em></li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is StarkNet?</h2>



<p>Vitalik Buterin once emphasized that although Optimistic Rollups have a shorter development period, the fundamentals of Zero-knowledge Rollups technology will quickly make them “layer 2 leading”.</p>



<p>Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum have seen rapid growth in recent years. Layer 2 employing ZK rollups technology, in particular, is highly valued by the blockchain community due to its superior advantages over alternative scaling methods on a variety of metrics, including transaction prices, time completeness, and reliability assumptions. StarkNet, a layer 2 that employs ZK Rollups technology, has received a lot of attention recently.</p>



<p>StarkNet is a dApps development platform developed on the Ethereum network by StarkWare Industries. As compared to comparable platforms, this platform delivers an amazing development environment for dApps developers, with rapid processing, great dependability, and cheaper expenses.</p>



<p>Its functions as an Ethereum layer 2 solutions, using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology to address the issue of transaction dependability and processing speed on the Ethereum network. ZKP enables a party to demonstrate that they have accurate information without giving any further information. This eliminates security concerns and improves transaction privacy on the Ethereum network.</p>



<p>StarkNet employs the Cairo programming language, which enables programmers to scale and deploy dApps or smart contracts in any area. Cairo will be used by all protocols and dApps built on the network.</p>



<p>The ZK-Rollups system is capable of &#8220;Rollups&#8221; of hundreds of off-chain transactions on Layer-2 and creates STARK cryptographic proofs. This is legitimate proof that is saved on the Ethereum network. Users&#8217; assets are guaranteed to be recoverable after a block is validated, even if the operators refuse to assist. This technology will make the connection between Layers 1 and 2 simple and comfortable, and the interaction time between projects will be reduced.</p>



<p>As compared to Optimistic Rollup technology, Zk-Rollups is praised for its faster transaction validation procedure. In the medium and long term, Zk-Rollups is regarded as the main scaling option on the Ethereum network, as opposed to Optimistic Rollups, which is only viable in the short run.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why is StarkNet growing?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create an environment for developers</strong></h3>



<p>StarkNet adopts unique technical features, such as zk-STARK technology, custom development language Cairo and virtual machine Cairo-VM, etc. Custom development environments lead to higher performance, better security, and richer functionality. Developers can use the Cairo programming language and STARKs verification mechanism to build safe and reliable smart contracts while enjoying high-performance transaction processing. Although there will be some friction, this friction is temporary, and developers can gradually adapt and benefit from it.</p>



<p>StarkNet uses a custom development language Cairo and a virtual machine Cairo-VM, which is different from other Layer 2 solutions that borrow Ethereum components. Cairo is a custom programming language for the StarkWare ecosystem. </p>



<p>The StarkWare ecosystem is optimized for itself, while other Layer2 projects are more optimized for Ethereum. Although this choice sacrifices network effects that are fully compatible with Ethereum, it is difficult to argue against the rationale of this design choice, especially now that the author has clearly seen that Cairo&#8217;s own network effects have reached escape velocity.</p>



<p>In future development, these technical features and innovations will bring potential value. With the growing importance of privacy protection and data security, the strong privacy protection mechanism provided by StarkNet will attract more users and applications. </p>



<p>At the same time, StarkNet&#8217;s scalability and decentralization features make it an effective solution for high throughput and security needs. As the blockchain ecosystem develops and needs to grow, StarkNet&#8217;s technical features in providing high performance, security, and privacy protection will endow it with great potential value and stand out from the competition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Various DeFi projects</strong></h3>



<p>Starknet, developed by the Israeli startup StarkWare, is intended to overcome the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s shortcomings, such as high transaction fees and lengthy transaction processing times, by allowing off-chain calculations and data storage while still using the blockchain&#8217;s security assurances.</p>



<p>Starknet does this by using a layer-2 scaling mechanism known as zero-knowledge rollups, which bundles hundreds of thousands of transactions off-chain and then validates them on-chain for a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>Starknet seeks to enhance transaction throughput and lower transaction costs by shifting calculations off-chain and keeping just the essential data on-chain. This is accomplished through ZK-rollups, a mechanism that permits the aggregation of numerous off-chain transactions into a single on-chain proof. This solution maintaining scalability while keeping Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized and trustless character.</p>



<p>Currently, the Starknet ecosystem seems to be full of DeFi projects from DEX, AMM, Lending,… to provide diverse liquidity methods for users. Prominent among them include Starkswap, Jediswap, mySwap, Zigzag.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Good Web3 projects</strong></h3>



<p>Strong infrastructure</p>



<p>Among the infrastructure initiatives on the StarkNet ecosystem are:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Current ecosystem challenges</h2>



<p>One of the most significant challenges and bottlenecks that StarkNet&#8217;s application ecology may face in the future is competition because there are many other Layer 2 expansion solutions that are also working hard to develop, and in some ways have advantages over StarkNet, so it is necessary to continuously improve their technology. In order to attract additional developers and users, you must innovate and enhance. The network effect is another possible issue. Since StarkNet is a novel technology, it requires a large number of developers and users to have a powerful network effect, hence extensive marketing and promotion are required.</p>



<p>Another problem that StarkNet confronts is maintaining the ecosystem&#8217;s survival. As new rivals arise and technology improves, StarkNet must continue to innovate and provide appealing services in order to keep consumers loyal and engaged. At the same time, StarkNet must cultivate strong ties with developers and partners in order to enable the ecosystem&#8217;s development and expansion. Additional difficulties include:</p>



<p>The Cairo language&#8217;s adoption restricts developer involvement: Since Cairo is a whole new programming language, developers must learn and adapt to it. Many developers may have an additional learning curve as a result, reducing their capacity to engage in the StarkNet ecosystem. Ethereum&#8217;s EVM, on the other hand, has a larger developer ecosystem, making it simpler for developers to get started and swiftly construct apps.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that StarkNet has proved the benefits of high throughput and cheap transaction costs in some use cases, it is not relevant to other application situations. These benefits may be insignificant for certain applications, particularly those that do not need the processing of a high number of transactions. As a result, broad adoption of StarkNet across diverse businesses may need further verification and demonstration.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>StarkNet can be used to develop decentralized educational applications such as online learning platforms, providing courses and training for students, teachers and professionals in various fields.</p>



<p>In addition, the platform can also be used to develop decentralized medical applications such as patient record management systems, health monitoring, and consulting platforms, as well as services.</p>



<p>Overall, StarkNet is providing developers with a platform to create high-quality and scalable applications. However, several issues remain to be considered with Cairo.</p>



<p>With outstanding features such as fast processing speed, reliability, low cost, and high scalability, StarkNet promises to be a strong development blockchain platform in the future.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starknet, an open-source framework aimed at bringing scalability and anonymity to Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps), has experienced remarkable growth in different DeFi apps on the network in recent months, with its total value locked (TVL) recently reaching a new all-time high.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-801-1024x691.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="691" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-801-1024x691.png" alt="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects" class="wp-image-194124" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-801-1024x691.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-801-300x203.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-801-768x519.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-801-750x506.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-801-1140x770.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-801.png 1318w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects 29"></a></figure></div>


<p>StarkNet functions as an Ethereum layer 2 solutions, using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology to address the issue of transaction dependability and speed on the Ethereum network. ZKP enables a party to demonstrate that it has accurate information without releasing any further information. This eliminates security concerns and improves transaction privacy on the Ethereum network.</p>



<p>StarkNet&#8217;s contracts and operating system are written in the Cairo programming language. This language allows developers to scale and deploy dApps or Smart Contracts of any field.</p>



<p>According to DefiLlama, Starknet TVL is now worth $12.85 million, a roughly nine-fold rise from $1.45 million at the beginning of March. So where are the promising DeFi projects on Starknet, let&#8217;s find out with Coincu through this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Jediswap</h2>



<p>Jediswap is the first AMM created on Starknet using Zk-rollups technology, and it fully inherits Ethereum&#8217;s security characteristics. Mesh Community created and funded the project.</p>



<p>The DEX, one of the first AMMs on the Starknet ecosystem, uses Zk-rollups technology to enable users to effortlessly swap and make transactions at nearly little cost while still inheriting. Ethereum provides complete security.</p>



<p>With Jediswap, users are fully independent of any third party and are solely accountable for their own assets.</p>



<p>The Jediswap project has the potential to become one of the StarkNet ecosystem&#8217;s most prominent decentralized exchanges. Users may enjoy rapid, low-cost, and highly secure transactions using Zk-rollups technology while retaining the finest features of Ethereum. Jediswap will continue to expand and enhance the decentralized trading experience for customers as its support staff and community grow.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-802-1024x536.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-802-1024x536.png" alt="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects" class="wp-image-194125" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-802-1024x536.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-802-300x157.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-802-768x402.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-802-750x393.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-802-1140x597.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-802.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects 30"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">10KSwap</h2>



<p>10KSwap, which is being constructed on Starknet, is an AMM system that works in tandem with Ethereum. By exploiting the rollup function, 10K hopes to enhance the performance of the AMM protocol, bringing cheaper fees, less friction, and eventually greater liquidity to the L2 world and advancing DeFi adoption.</p>



<p>10KSwap was among the first open-source AMMs to be deployed on the StarkNet Mainnet. We believe in Ethereum and StarkNet, the most advanced rollup trend. Its one-of-a-kind Cairo-VM provides developers with a new development choice, increased TPS, and a computational cost that may be disregarded. We feel AMM will benefit the most directly from these two improvements.</p>



<p>The gas cost for doing a calculation with Cairo-VM is substantially lower than for state updates, and we will raise the appropriate amount of calculation to minimize the frequency of state updates, continue to enhance contract performance, and further reduce gas costs. Ensuring that 10K provides users with a lightning-fast trading experience while maintaining the security of wide consensus is what every DeFi user desires, and we look forward to exploring this wonderful starfield alongside the StarkNet pioneers.</p>



<p>10KSwap has implemented an immutable system in which the protocol serves no centralized interests. After the creator has completely provided, the power is passed on to the community. It reflects the spirit of decentralization and our aim to collaborate with people to make the impossible triangle a reality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">MySwap</h2>



<p>MySwap is an AMM on the current Starknet network similar to StarkSwap. MySwap is the place to provide trading &#8211; swap, add liquidity &#8211; pool to make a profit. Currently, the floor is still in the testing phase.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803-1024x512.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803-1024x512.png" alt="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects" class="wp-image-194126" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803-1024x512.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803-768x384.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803-750x375.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803-1140x570.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-803.png 1254w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects 31"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">SithSwap</h2>



<p>SithSwap is StarkNet&#8217;s next-generation AMM, offering immediate volatile and stable swaps with extremely minimal slippage, near-zero costs, and complete Ethereum security. SithSwap was designed as an efficient and flexible liquidity exchange protocol, enabling developers and users to make use of a highly composable architecture that provides deep, long-term, and adaptive liquidity. SithSwap provides a robust incentive structure that includes escrows, staking pools, gauges, bribes, and native $SITH emissions that may be escrowed to unlock unique advantages, such as the power to manage key protocol settings, including future rewards.</p>



<p>SithSwap provides the liquidity foundation for StarkNet protocols to begin, bootstrap, and evolve in a decentralized and sustainable manner.</p>



<p>The SithSwap AMM has been designed to adhere to the timeless Uniswap smart contracts architecture, which has been popularized by its easy Pair features and Router APIs, which are recognizable to all DeFi developers.</p>



<p>SithSwap includes new and essential features such as the ability to allow efficient, low-slippage trades for correlated assets, built-in TWAP oracles, and more.</p>



<p>SithSwap is a decentralized exchange that is meant to conduct stablecoin transactions with cheap fees, little slippage, and quick transaction speeds while inheriting Ethereum&#8217;s strong security.</p>



<p>The SithSwap project, like Curve Finance, Wombat Exchange, and Trader Joe, pioneered the veToken concept but has more enhancements than its predecessors. The project also received 1.7 million USD in the Seed round, with numerous significant investment funds in the market participating, including GSR, Lemniscap, Anthony Beaumount, Big Brain Holding…</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-804.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="375" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-804.png" alt="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects" class="wp-image-194127" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-804.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-804-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-804-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects 32"></a></figure></div>


<p>Liquidity Providers in SithSwap are richly paid depending on the commitments they may earn: 100% of the protocol fees, SITH/xSITH emissions, 3rd-party bribery, and much more.</p>



<p>SithSwap proposes a unique method for liquidity mining incentives based on non-fungible staked LP holdings, or stkLPs, which provides an extra incentive layer and revenue source.</p>



<p>Bribed Pools are the ideal use case for demonstrating the latent potential of stkLPs. These are short-term pools that accept staked LP positions (stkLPs) in return for third-party compensation (bribes).</p>



<p>Because of the protocol&#8217;s security advantages, the SithSwap codebase was meant to be non-upgradable / immutable.</p>



<p>Non-upgradable contracts imply that users and builders may rely on the deployed contracts and their behavior eternally.</p>



<p>We feel that granting all players the ability to engage with SithSwap at all levels of the system without consent or authorization is critical and advantageous to both the protocol and the ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">zkLend</h2>



<p>zkLend is a lending and money market platform built on StarkNet, Ethereum&#8217;s Layer-2 solution. As a consequence, zkLend combines zk-rollup scalability, improved transaction speed, cost reductions, and Ethereum security.</p>



<p>zkLend offers parallel money market access solutions for two client files, which include:</p>



<p>Consumers at the level of financial institutions &#8211; Project Apollo.<br>DeFi User: Project Artemis.</p>



<p>Initially, the two initiatives will run separately, but as time passes and the demand for liquidity grows, Apollo and Artemis will collaborate to complement one another.</p>



<p>StarkNet is the foundation for zkLend, and StarkNet is a scaling solution based on zero-knowledge proof (zkRollups) technology. StarkNet provides rapid transaction speeds and cheap transaction costs (around $0.2 against $8 on Ethereum). Moreover, zkLend will inherit the core Ethereum network&#8217;s security.</p>



<p>zkLend will feature two lending protocols that will serve the distinct demands of two markets, DeFi and CeFi, on an institutional scale. The two protocols will initially run separately but will eventually be able to integrate to boost liquidity and capital efficiency.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-805.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="701" height="400" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-805.png" alt="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects" class="wp-image-194129" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-805.png 701w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-805-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" title="Top 8 Starknet Ecosystem DeFi Projects 33"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Nostra Finance</h2>



<p>Nostra Finance is a lending, lending, and liquidity platform developed on the Starknet network &#8211; a Layer 2 solution for the Ethereum system that will address security concerns as well as gas costs. The project enables you to borrow, lend, and swap cryptocurrencies like as ETH, USDC, and DAI…</p>



<p>New ecosystems like Avalanche, Fantom, and Near… have overcome the problem of gas prices, but it has not attracted TVL (Total Value Locked) and huge users like the Ethereum system owing to security difficulties, security.</p>



<p>The initiative is permissionless, which means you may borrow and lend crypto assets without the need for a bank or other third-party middleman. Nostra Finance is also non-custodial, which means you always have complete control over your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>



<p>The StarkNet-based project is a decentralized ZK-Rollup, which is Ethereum&#8217;s L2 network. StarkNet enables dApps to attain infinite computational scale by utilizing Ethereum&#8217;s security.</p>



<p>Developers may create and deploy StarkNet contracts online, and users can submit transactions to these contracts (similar to Ethereum).</p>



<p>The StarkNet node (also known as a sequencer) is written in Python. Cairo has created StarkNet OS, a transaction execution environment akin to Ethereum&#8217;s virtual computer. It improves the efficiency of each transaction. The Solidity contract, which is implemented in Ethereum, links the StarkNet (L2) network to Ethereum (L1).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">StarkEx</h2>



<p>StarkEx is an expandable Layer 2 engine that generates Qualified Certificates using Stark and Aggregate technologies. StarkEx as a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform enables the development of dApps on top of the StarkEx service. Several use cases are supported by StarkEx, including NFT mining and trading, derivatives trading, AMM, spot trading, clearing, and DeFi Pooling…</p>



<p>As a consequence of complex computations, StarkEx&#8217;s certificate of competence assures that only legitimate data is added to the chain.</p>



<p>Each transaction is initially validated off-chain, and proof of this confirmation is generated by the StarkEx Proofing Provider. The on-chain verifier validates this evidence and guarantees that only legitimate transactions are carried out on the blockchain.</p>



<p>The unbalanced allocation of computing between Off-chain Verifiers and On-chain Verifiers is the key to StarkEx&#8217;s huge scalability.</p>

<p>Off-chain Prover handles massive transactions and issues STARK certifications. Through multiple computational processes, the circuit amplifier confirms the STARK certificate. This enables huge off-chain scaling, in which StarkWare executes big calculations, the integrity of which is subsequently done on-chain with minimum processing.</p>



<p>StarkEx enables applications to self-regulate and employs cutting-edge anti-censorship measures to guarantee that users&#8217; funds are always in their hands.</p>



<p>StarkEx debuted online trading in June 2020 and dozens of projects, including dYdX, ApeX pro, and rhino.fi, now utilize it (before). Myria, ImmutableX, Sorare, or Reddio (DeversiFi).</p>

<p>The project&#8217;s focus on the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188106-shiba-inu-correct-sharply-death-cross-forms/">SHIB</a> Metaverse has been evident, with the team working diligently to assemble it. A video presentation of one of the metaverse centers is set to be released soon, offering a glimpse into the immersive universe being created by Shiba Inu.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Shibarium, a groundbreaking invention, continues to undergo rapid development. The recent release of Puppynet, the beta version of Shibarium, showcases ongoing upgrades and advancements. The development team is dedicated to providing the Shiba Inu community with autonomous services and infrastructure.</p>

<p>These advancements mark significant milestones for Shiba Inu, as evidenced by the substantial price performance and market interest of SHIB. The coin has shed two zeros since April, fueling speculation and conversations among investors about the possibility of reaching the coveted price of $0.001.</p>



<p>Enthusiasm and eagerness for these developments are palpable among Shiba Inu enthusiasts, as expressed on various social media platforms. The upcoming updates have the potential to significantly increase the value of SHIB, further exciting its holders.</p>



<p>Notably, the Shiba Inu project emphasizes accessibility and inclusivity. Reports indicate that metaverse hubs like Rocket Pond will be accessible to the general public, with no buyouts by private investors. The aim is to foster community interaction and participation once the metaverse is operational.</p>



<p>As the launch dates for Rocket Pond, the SHIB Metaverse, and the Shibarium mainnet draw near, the Shiba Inu community is filled with anticipation. These planned updates represent major advancements for the project and will shape the future development of the SHIB ecosystem. Shiba Inu has already established itself as a compelling presence in the cryptocurrency market, with each milestone generating enthusiasm and confidence among its supporters.</p>

<p>The international exchanges are experiencing an influx of capital, talent, and digital asset companies, indicating a shift in the global crypto landscape. Furthermore, the market capitalization of US stablecoins has plummeted, while the US retains its dominance in Bitcoin mining, despite potential challenges from regulation and taxation.</p>



<p>Over 50% of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/193985-sec-satoshi-nakamoto-to-court-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and 56% of Ethereum held on US exchanges have been transferred outside the country, reducing Bitcoin reserves to 2017 levels. Regulatory uncertainties are believed to be the driving force behind this shift, with investors seeking more favorable jurisdictions.</p>



<p>International crypto exchanges now trade four times more volume than their US counterparts, attracting capital, talent, and digital asset companies. Regions like the European Union and Hong Kong are becoming attractive destinations for cryptocurrency activities.</p>

<p>US-based stablecoins have experienced a 35% decline in market capitalization, representing a loss of $15 billion in 2023. This decline may be linked to regulatory concerns and increased adoption of non-US alternatives.</p>



<p>Despite challenges in other areas, the US remains a dominant player in the global Bitcoin mining industry. However, there are concerns that this position could be compromised due to inadequate regulation and potential tax implications imposed on miners.</p>



<p>Regulatory uncertainty in the US has resulted in a significant decline in Bitcoin and Ethereum reserves on domestic exchanges. International exchanges are capitalizing on this situation, attracting more trading volume and market participants. The US stablecoin market has also witnessed a decline, while the country&#8217;s dominance in Bitcoin mining remains intact for now. However, regulatory challenges and potential tax policies could impact the US crypto market&#8217;s future growth and competitiveness.</p>
