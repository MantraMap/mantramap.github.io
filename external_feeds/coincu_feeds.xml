<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX Wallet has announced that it will soon enable account abstraction.</em></li>



<li><em>Account abstraction enables users to design extra security and better user experiences into their accounts in a flexible manner.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Star Xu, the CEO of OK Group, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191365-okx-wallet-proposes-brc-30-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OKX Wallet</a> will support account abstraction in the coming weeks.</strong></h5>

<p>People connect with Ethereum using externally owned accounts (EOAs). This is the sole method for initiating a transaction or executing a smart contract. This restricts how users interact with Ethereum.</p>



<p>Account abstraction is a method of addressing these issues by enabling users to build greater security and better user experiences into their accounts in a flexible manner. This may be accomplished by enhancing EOAs so that they can be managed by smart contracts or by enhancing smart contracts so that they can start transactions.</p>



<p>Each of these alternatives needs modifications to the Ethereum protocol. A third option is to establish a second, distinct transaction system to operate alongside the present protocol. Regardless of the path taken, the end result is access to Ethereum via smart contract wallets, which are either natively supported as part of the current protocol or through an add-on transaction network.</p>

<p>Account abstraction, which Vitalik considers to be the future of wallets, enables users to dynamically build greater security and better user experiences into their accounts. Because of this, OKX Wallet will <a href="https://twitter.com/okx/status/1665878922251190273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">include</a> ERC-4337 in the platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OKX wallet will support account abstraction in the coming weeks. I can not wait to try it ASAP. <a href="https://t.co/m23EKg3tqp" target="_blank">https://t.co/m23EKg3tqp</a> <a href="https://t.co/uDZG6Znx3D" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/uDZG6Znx3D</a></p>&mdash; Star (@star_okx) <a href="https://twitter.com/star_okx/status/1665888525768687617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The Ethereum standard ERC-4337 allows users to access smart wallet contracts. Using account abstraction, smart wallet contracts enable them to program their wallet for increased security and use.</p>



<p>ERC-4337 also provides for subsidized transaction fees, which implies that the transaction expenses may be partly or completely paid by other sources. This opens the door to more economical and accessible Ethereum network transactions.</p>



<p>The ability to pay transaction fees using ERC-20 tokens is another important feature of ERC-4337. This implies that instead of paying fees in Ether (ETH), users may cover transaction expenses using other Ethereum blockchain assets. If they have many ERC-20 tokens in their wallet, this adds a new level of flexibility and ease.</p>

<p>Arthur Hayes, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, suggests that despite the current downturn, the market will likely move past these challenges by the end of summer. In the meantime, investors are exploring potential opportunities, including certain alternative cryptocurrencies often referred to as &#8220;shitcoins.&#8221;</p>

<p>The market&#8217;s recent slump can be attributed to the lingering FUD surrounding Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Unsubstantiated rumors and uncertainty regarding the platform&#8217;s future have created a sense of caution among investors, resulting in a temporary decline in market sentiment.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-365.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="553" height="1024" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-365-553x1024.png" alt="Market Faces Downturn amid Binance FUD, Heightened Risk due to TGA Refill" class="wp-image-192473" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-365-553x1024.png 553w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-365-162x300.png 162w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-365-768x1422.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-365-830x1536.png 830w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-365-750x1389.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-365.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" title="Market Faces Downturn amid Binance FUD, Heightened Risk due to TGA Refill 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, the anticipation of the TGA refill has added to the current unease. The Treasury General Account, managed by the United States Department of the Treasury, plays a crucial role in managing the government&#8217;s cash balances. The forthcoming refill has raised concerns about potential liquidity disruptions and their impact on market stability.</p>



<p>Arthur Hayes, a well-known voice in the industry and co-founder of BitMEX, acknowledges the current market situation. He believes that regardless of the catalyst for the market downturn, the risk markets remain on edge due to the TGA refill. However, Hayes expresses confidence that by the end of summer, the market will overcome these challenges and shift its focus to the substantial amount of money printing occurring globally.</p>

<p>With central banks engaging in significant monetary expansion, the hum of money printing in the background has become increasingly pronounced. Hayes suggests that this excess liquidity could have an impact on asset prices, potentially presenting investment opportunities across various sectors.</p>



<p>In the interim, some investors are considering &#8220;shitcoins&#8221; as potential investment vehicles. These cryptocurrencies often lack solid fundamentals or utility but have the potential for significant price appreciation. It is important to note that investing in such assets carries substantial risks, and investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any decisions.</p>



<p>As the market navigates the uncertainties stemming from Binance FUD and the TGA refill, it is crucial for investors to stay informed and evaluate their risk tolerance.

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently announced the approval of an amended order of registration for Cboe Clear Digital, which allows it to clear additional products as a derivatives clearing organization. </strong></h5>

<p>The regulatory body stated that it is now permitting Cboe Clear to &#8220;provide clearing services for digital asset futures on a margined basis for futures commission merchants, in addition to the fully collateralized futures and fully collateralized swaps previously authorized.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cboe Digital Exchange, the parent company of Cboe Clear, is already registered as a designated contract market with the CFTC. This measure authorizes Cboe to expand its clearing of futures contracts on crypto assets &#8220;while staying within the traditional U.S. futures intermediated market structure,&#8221; according to CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cftc-crypto.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cftc-crypto-1024x538.jpeg" alt="cftc crypto" class="wp-image-192457" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cftc-crypto-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cftc-crypto-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cftc-crypto-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cftc-crypto-750x394.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cftc-crypto-1140x599.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cftc-crypto.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Breaking News: CFTC Approves Cboe Clear For Digital Asset Futures! 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In a separate statement, Romero noted that: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The Order is accompanied by prudent risk-mitigation measures implemented by Cboe.&#8221; She added that the application had stood in &#8220;stark contrast&#8221; to one from collapsed crypto exchange FTX &#8220;for a bespoke disintermediated direct-to-customer market structure.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Romero has been vocal about the benefits of bringing appropriate crypto activities into the regulated space to protect customers, but in a way that supports oversight, accountability, transparency, and risk management. She noted that too often in recent years, crypto firms have sought to take a business model or market structure that exists in an unregulated environment and port it over to the regulated environment.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Cboe has not done that, instead operating within the parameters of the traditional futures market structure and regulatory framework,&#8221; Romero continued. &#8220;It has constructively engaged with the staff and my office to address concerns related to risk and implement risk-mitigating measures.&#8221; This is a promising step towards the regulation of the crypto market and ensuring the protection of investors.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SushiSwap has announced the creation of a DEX aggregator, enabling customers to get the lowest price while trading on the agreement without further procedures.</em></li>



<li><em>The new DEX aggregator seeks to give consumers optimum pricing while broadening the kinds of assets available for trading.</em></li>



<li><em>SushiSwap intends to expand access to liquidity through additional DEXs and directly connect with market maker flows.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The decentralized exchange SushiSwap <a href="https://www.sushi.com/blog/dex-aggregator-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the launch of a DEX aggregator in its official blog, allowing users to obtain the best price when trading on the agreement without any additional steps.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="618" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360-1024x618.png" alt="SushiSwap Launches New DEX Aggregator To Support Liquidity" class="wp-image-192458" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360-1024x618.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360-300x181.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360-768x464.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360-1536x927.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360-2048x1236.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360-750x453.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-360-1140x688.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SushiSwap Launches New DEX Aggregator To Support Liquidity 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The DEX aggregator aims to provide users with optimal pricing while expanding the types of assets users can trade and the range of liquidity that liquidity providers (LPs) can provide, increasing the transaction fees they can earn.</p>



<p>Also, because the liquidity problem on most DEXs is not stable, there will be more demand for a new type of product, the DEX Aggregator. They are liquidity aggregators from various sources, such as traditional AMMs or CEXs themselves.</p>



<p>In a word, the DEX aggregator is a financial protocol that provides traders and investors with access to different trading pools using a single dashboard. They rely on a complex algorithm to calculate and aggregate based on many factors before choosing the best provider for a particular token swap on the available platforms.</p>



<p>DEX aggregator will have a mechanism to optimize the price slippage as well as transaction fees for users, making it more convenient for them to trade.</p>



<p>In terms of the token model, because it does not provide as much buy demand as AMMs, in addition, transaction fees will be paid in tokens of the blockchain itself (ETH, BNB, ..), so tokens of DEX aggregator will not have a sturdy stand.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361-1024x576.png" alt="SushiSwap Launches New DEX Aggregator To Support Liquidity" class="wp-image-192459" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-361.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SushiSwap Launches New DEX Aggregator To Support Liquidity 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>Since the aggregator provides users with a new abundance of asset possibilities, it follows that it will draw even more users to the platform, which leads to greater swap fees for LPs and attracts more liquidity overall in a positive feedback cycle.</p>



<p>The SushiSwap aggregator&#8217;s release will help users, LPs, and the protocol as a whole. Users are now more familiar with a variety of protocols and assets. By integrating the liquidity of all DEXs and Trident pools, they may have their orders executed at optimum rates, resulting in more trading and, as a result, swap fees for LPs.</p>



<p>In the future, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/181241-sushiswap-asks-lido-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SushiSwap</a> plans to increase access to liquidity through other DEXs and directly link with market maker flows; at the same time, this year will continue to focus on improving limit orders and overall order filling.</p>

<p>Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges have always been one of the more exciting concepts in the crypto space. To this day, they are often shrouded in mystery, especially for those new to the field. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/189444-vertex-labs-acquired-digimental-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vertex</a> is valued as a DEX (decentralized exchange) that is exceptional in its design &#8211; it&#8217;s a new DEX created to bridge the gap between the usability of a centralized exchange and the transparency and self-monitoring of the decentralized platform. In this Vertex review, we&#8217;re going to talk about a project that aims to remove some of that mystery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Vertex?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353-1024x512.png" alt="Vertex Review: Outstanding And Fully Featured DEX On Arbitrum" class="wp-image-192445" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353-1024x512.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353-768x384.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353-1536x768.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353-750x375.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353-1140x570.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-353.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Vertex Review: Outstanding And Fully Featured DEX On Arbitrum 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Vertex positions itself as a Defi Hub platform on the Arbitrum ecosystem to provide users with various services such as spot trading, derivatives, and Crypto borrowing &amp; lending on a single application.</p>



<p>Vertex is powered by a combined unified central limit order book (CLOB) and integrated automated market maker (AMM), whose liquidity is enhanced as positions from LP market pairs are entered into the order book. Gas and MEV fees are minimized on Vertex thanks to batch trading and the optimistic aggregation model of the underlying Arbitrum layer two (L2), where Vertex smart contracts control the risk instrument and products.</p>



<p>With the collapse of the UST stablecoin earlier this year, the Vertex team was forced to abandon their original plan and rethink their next steps. Their new mission is to build a decentralized, vertically integrated, cross-margin order book for spot, specialty, and profit products. In other words, building a decentralized exchange can match the product offering and user experience of centralized exchanges like Binance and FTX.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights of Vertex</h2>



<p>Centralized trading platforms like FTX have a permanent track record of proving how wrongful custody platforms are to users. Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) were created as an alternative to these platforms, providing the ability to trade cryptocurrencies without creating an account (no licensing required) and without using a signed wallet (no trust required).</p>



<p>By comparison, this is a huge innovation, so why do most DEXs still lag behind their centralized counterparts? At this moment, Vertex believes that current DEX exchanges need to meet the convenience and UI/UX standards that most centralized platforms provide. This is supposed to be the combined result of the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>The trading interface is not friendly</li>



<li>Complex UX for Web2 users</li>



<li>Monolithic product design in DeFi → create fragmentation</li>
</ul>



<p>The initial Web3 trading experience can be so overwhelming for some Web2 users that they immediately want to give it up. Using Metamask, new UI concepts/interfaces (e.g., swaps), and using more protocols just for hedging or leverage can be tiring for new learners to respond to their needs quickly on their favorite CEX.</p>



<p>Most DEXs these days only meet the basic needs of an advanced trader. At the same time, CEX offers tools for leverage and hedging, catering to a wide variety of markets (trading now/perps), yielding idle assets, bridging, and, most importantly, enabling fast and convenient fiat currency trading anytime, anywhere.</p>



<p>Therefore, Vertex overhauls the DEX more efficiently so that users can enjoy the advantages of both a centralized exchange and a decentralized one. This protocol will offer leading flexibility with multiple user interfaces, money markets for lending and borrowing, cross-margin and perps trading, and deep liquidity from the AMM+ order book dual integration.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="1024" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-354-717x1024.png" alt="Vertex Review: Outstanding And Fully Featured DEX On Arbitrum" class="wp-image-192446" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-354-717x1024.png 717w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-354-210x300.png 210w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-354.png 744w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" title="Vertex Review: Outstanding And Fully Featured DEX On Arbitrum 20"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Users inherit the benefits of self-monitoring, permissionless protocol, and completely trustless transaction UX on the decentralized side. The protocol is product agnostic, even implementing fiat on/off and bridging interfaces.</p>



<p>Vertex emulates the CEX model without permission or detention. Instead, its uptime depends on a decentralized network, and it combats fragmentation with an integrated approach on the same Vertex exchange. And finally, it allows traders to enjoy the best of both CEX and DEX exchanges.</p>



<p>Besides, Vertex DEX is a combination of two models: CLOB (central limit order book) and AMM (Automated Market Maker). In which accounts on Vertex will be defaulted to using cross margin. With Cross margin, the assets in the user account will be used as collateral once the margin falls below the standard.</p>



<p>Transaction fees and MEVs will be minimized by working on Arbitrum, layer 2, applying the Optimistic Rollup model, in which Vertex smart contracts will control risks and operate critical products.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Products of Vertex</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Spot Market</strong></h3>



<p>A place to buy, sell and swap pairs of assets with each other. At Vertex, this DEX platform integrates Orderbook DEX and AMM DEX mechanisms to serve traders.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to other financial markets, where you may buy and sell assets for delivery at a future date – referred to as derivatives (e.g., perpetual and futures) since their price is derived from the underlying asset. Its spot markets allow you to buy or sell listed crypto assets paired with USD-denominated stablecoins.</p>



<p>Launch spot markets on Vertex include:</p>



<ul>
<li>wBTC/USDC</li>



<li>wETH/USDC</li>



<li>Others will be added over time</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Perpetuals Market</strong></h3>



<p>The derivatives market at Vertex allows up to 10X leverage for professional traders. Perpetual markets on Vertex trade 24/7 – meaning you can buy or sell assets anytime of day or night while retaining custody of your spot assets on-chain.</p>

<p>Launch perpetual markets on Vertex will include:</p>



<ul>
<li>BTC/USDC</li>



<li>ETH/USDC</li>



<li>More markets will be enabled soon after the launch.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrated Money Market</strong></h3>



<p>Vertex integrates capital markets (borrowing and lending) directly into the DEX, whereby users can borrow assets in the underlying market for margin and increase leverage according to user needs. These operations will also be entirely on-chain on Arbitrum. Supported currencies for lending include USDC, wBTC, and wETH.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Revenue of Vertex Protocol</h2>



<p>Vertex&#8217;s revenue source will come from the fees users need to pay for participating in the following activities:</p>



<ul>
<li>Transaction fee on DEX: Fluctuating 0.01 &#8211; 0.03%</li>



<li>Loan interest rate to borrowers: The loan interest rate is not fixed</li>



<li>Sequencer Fees: Default fee when users use Vertex Sequencer service, including activities</li>



<li>Order Liquidation: 0.25 USDC/order</li>



<li>Withdrawal of collateral: Direct deduction on that asset (USDC, BTC, ETH)</li>



<li>Mint LP Token: 0.1 USDC</li>



<li>Burn LP Token: 0.1 USDC</li>



<li>Market order execution; 0.025 USDC.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tokenomics</h2>



<p>$VRTX is the token of the Vertex protocol. With $VRTX, you can hold and stake into the xVRTX derivative to provide liquidity, transferable (similar to xSUSHI) or locked to the non-transferable voVRTX enhanced token.</p>



<p>Users enjoy lower transaction fees when paying with $VRTX. $VRTX can also be used to participate in &#8220;basket auctions,&#8221; in which Vertex auctions off a portion of its revenue in installments (USDC/BTC/ETH transaction fees).</p>



<p>Unlike CEX, Vertex users retain distributed governance on the platform. xVRTX holders will be able to create new proposals or vote on changes to the protocol. However, official protocol documents suggest this will materialize later. A gradual transition to fully decentralized governance is expected as Vertex&#8217;s minimum viable product (MVP) matures from its infancy.</p>



<p>The voVRTX token will serve as the foundational mechanism for the governance and arrangement of incentives. In addition to basket trading and auction fees, it can be obtained from locking xVRTX, and voVRTX increases fees earned emissions earned, and voting rights.</p>



<p>Users holding xVRTX have two options to earn additional profits: pledge or insurance staking.</p>



<p>Pledgers lock their stake for 2 weeks or more (up to 6 months for up to 2.5x increase) and receive the boost from their accumulated voVRTX balance.<br>Stake insurance participants will lock up for 3 weeks or more, where up to 50% of their stake serves as collateral in the insurance fund. These lockers instantly receive a maximum gain of 2.5x and also have the exclusive ability to liquidate under-mortgaged positions for additional profit.</p>



<p>VRTX is distributed according to the following ratio:</p>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Very low transaction fees</h2>



<p>At Vertex, the team is completely free of trading fees for the makers, while the fees for takers are also relatively cheap, ranging from 0.01 to 0.03% (compared to outside exchanges, it is about 0.1%), meaning Vertex is 10 times cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Following years of anticipation, Apple launched the Vision Pro, the company&#8217;s first significant new product category since the Apple Watch in 2015.</em></li>



<li><em>The device is a brand-new headset that is integrated with some of Apple&#8217;s most popular apps. It costs $3,499.</em></li>



<li><em>Many see this as the future of the Internet and serious competition with Meta.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Apple introduced its long-awaited &#8220;mixed reality&#8221; headgear on Monday, the company&#8217;s most anticipated hardware product launch since Steve Jobs presented the iPad in 2010.</strong></h5>

<p>With the release of the Apple Watch in 2015, the product&#8217;s debut has been dubbed the most anticipated. Moreover, it has the ability to fundamentally alter how people use and accept augmented reality. As a result, as it prepares to compete with Meta Quest and other huge VR headsets, Apple may be prepared to make an even greater influence on the metaverse.</p>



<p>The device, named Vision Pro, will be available &#8220;early next year.&#8221; It mixes virtual reality with augmented reality, which superimposes digital pictures on top of the actual environment. The tech giant claimed it would retail for $3,499, which is more than most experts predicted and roughly 12 times the price of Meta&#8217;s Quest 2, the most popular VR headset.</p>



<p>When it was originally launched, virtual reality was expected to be the next generation of the internet. As a result, a slew of businesses embraced the shift and devised strategies to profit from it. Mark Zuckerberg changed the emphasis of his brand, and Meta emerged from Facebook.</p>



<p>CEO Tim Cook, who launched the new device at the company&#8217;s Worldwide Developers Conference at its gleaming Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, California, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This is a day that&#8217;s been years in the making. I believe that augmented reality is a profound technology.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The device has some impressive specs: it has 23 million pixels across two displays, a custom Apple silicon chip, and VisionOS, a spatial operating system that offers a three-dimensional interface, releasing applications from the confines of traditional screens and bringing them into real-world spaces. To begin, Apple claims that customers may play more than 100 Apple Arcade games, while the Silicon Valley behemoth claims that the gadget allows for new sorts of games with titles that cover a spectrum of immersion.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/183946-apple-removes-bitcoin-whitepaper-from-macos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> stressed the uniqueness of the headset&#8217;s augmented reality capabilities, as well as the sports and entertainment collaborations it will provide. The smartphone will feature a new processor dubbed R1 that will interpret information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, according to Apple.</p>



<p>The company also unveiled a slew of new goods and features at its annual developer conference, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful CPU dubbed M2 Ultra, enhancements to its iOS software, and a long-awaited fix to prevent autocorrect from awkwardly translating a frequent curse to &#8220;ducking.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apple announced this stunning device during WWDC 2023. When it will be available for purchase is currently unknown. Several have speculated on when it would be released, but one thing is certain: it might be the company&#8217;s first excursion into the metaverse.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>On Monday, Binance saw net outflows of almost $1.4 billion in one hour.</em></li>



<li><em>The withdrawals occurred as the SEC complaint charges that the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume violated various federal securities laws.</em></li>



<li><em>Not just the exchange but the entire market seems to be affected by this news.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the company and its CEO, Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, for breaking federal securities law, cryptocurrency traders withdrew the most money from Binance since the financial crisis in March.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-348.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-348-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Suffers Rapid Loss After New SEC Allegations" class="wp-image-192431" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-348-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-348-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-348-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-348-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-348-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-348.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Suffers Rapid Loss After New SEC Allegations 31"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/ScopeProtocol/status/1665757463109304323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0xScope</a>, when the SEC sued Binance, its reserve assets had a net outflow of around $1.4 billion within 1 hour (14-15 UTC, June 5), accounting for 2.6% of its total reserve assets of $52.9 billion.</p>



<p>Blockchain data suggests that the exchange had $503 million in net withdrawals on Monday, according to a <a href="https://dune.com/queries/1639250/2715750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune Analytics</a> report by crypto investment product provider 21Shares. The figure shows that traders have withdrawn more than $1 billion in digital assets over this time period, compared to $546 million in deposits.</p>



<p>The whole cryptocurrency market is down on the news, with most coins falling by 5%-10%. After the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against the exchange and its CEO, altcoins have suffered the worst losses.</p>



<p>Although outflows are increasing, this is not necessarily unusual. In February, Binance had over 800 million net withdrawals in a 24-hour period when New York state officials clamped down on Binance-related stablecoin BUSD.</p>



<p>The SEC on Monday accused <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192365-binance-immediately-responds-to-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, of mishandling client cash and lying to US authorities and investors about its operations in a broad lawsuit that has the potential to reshape the crypto landscape of power and riches.</p>

<p>According to the SEC, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange covertly moved billions of dollars in client assets to a separate company owned by Binance&#8217;s founder, Changpeng Zhao.</p>



<p>In the 136-page complaint, the agency claimed that Binance had covertly transferred billions of dollars in consumer cash to a second business, Merit Peak Limited, which is owned by CZ.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC makes sense that Binance worked with the Tai Chi plan when it established its US branch.</em></li>



<li><em>The new accusation follows a 2020 Forbes article that stated much the same thing.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf#page=30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new complaint</a> against Binance, alleging that the crypto exchange followed much of a so-called &#8220;Tai Chi plan&#8221; in establishing its US company.</strong></h5>

<p>The SEC claims in the new suit that an owner of another cryptocurrency exchange in the United States advised Binance on establishing its own entity in the region and suggested two approaches, including a moderate plan to establish a Tai Chi entity that would &#8220;reveal, retard, and resolve built-up enforcement tensions&#8221; while shielding the main exchange from liabilities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">To implement the Tai Chi Plan, the Binance Consultant recommended that Binance brand a U.S. entity a Binance entity through a “franchise model” that would rely on Binance’s technology “by visualizing Binance as a technology vendor.” &#8211; according to SEC filing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is just one of the new elements revealed in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s 136-page complaint charging Binance, Zhao, and its US-based subsidiary for violating several laws and regulations.</p>



<p>According to the petition, after examining the strategy, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is reported to have stated that the exchange had spoken with legal firms who proposed a more cautious approach. But, he said that there were components of the scheme that the exchange may merge, according to the SEC.</p>



<p>The new accusation follows a 2020 <em>Forbes</em> piece that stated much of the same thing, referring to the Chinese martial art noted for avoiding the use of direct force. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192365-binance-immediately-responds-to-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> responded at the time, stating that the piece featured numerous false, misleading, and defamatory statements.</p>

<p>The assertions are identical to those made in the <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/10/29/leaked-tai-chi-document-reveals-binances-elaborate-scheme-to-evade-bitcoin-regulators/?sh=535c2b322a92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a></em> piece, which said the Tai Chi paper was handed to top Binance officials.</p>



<p>The leaked Tai Chi paper in 2020, a presentation that top Binance executives are reported to have viewed, is a deliberate strategy to conduct a bait and switch. Although the then-unnamed corporation built up operations in the United States to distract authorities with a disguised interest in compliance, steps would be put in place to shift money to the parent firm, Binance, in the form of license fees and more. Meanwhile, prospective buyers would be educated how to circumvent regional constraints, and technology workarounds would be developed.</p>



<p>The SEC also said that Binance and Zhao, its wealthy creator and one of the crypto industry&#8217;s most prominent figures, surreptitiously controlled its clients&#8217; assets, enabling them to mix and redirect investor cash &#8220;as they please.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,&#8221; SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a tweet, Binance.US, which is owned by Zhao, said that the complaint was not supported by the facts, the law, or the Commission&#8217;s own precedent.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC has accused Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of establishing BAM Trading and BAM Management in the US to avoid US scrutiny.</em></li>



<li><em>The allegation that claims BAM Trading operates the Binance.US platform independently and that US customers cannot use Binance.com is untrue.</em></li>



<li><em>The complaint also alleges violations of key registration-related provisions of the federal securities laws.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the lawsuit against Binance, the SEC <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192395-over-300m-liquidated-after-sec-sued-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> Changpeng Zhao of establishing BAM Trading and BAM Management in the United States to avoid US scrutiny of him and Binance.

<p>BAM Trading and BAM Management falsely claimed that Binance US controlled and raised about $200 million from private investors. Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is the CEO of Binance and the chairman of the boards of BAM Trading and BAM Management (until at least March 2022). CZ and Binance take control of BAM Trading&#8217;s bank account.</p>



<p>Before December 2020, BAM Trading staff needed help controlling the company&#8217;s bank accounts, including those used by customers to deposit funds into the Binance US platform. Only CZ or the manager of the Binance back office has signing authority for these accounts. Then, to avoid regulatory scrutiny, BAM Trading&#8217;s chief financial officer was appointed as one of the signatories of the client account.</p>



<p>As of May 2023, Changpeng Zhao still has the right to log into customers&#8217; funds accounts on the Binance US platform. In addition, CZ also controls the daily financial spending of BAM Trading.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-346-1024x676.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="676" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-346-1024x676.png" alt="SEC Alleges Binance Formed BAM Trading To Evade US Surveillance" class="wp-image-192421" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-346-1024x676.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-346-300x198.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-346-768x507.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-346-750x495.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-346-1140x753.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-346.png 1369w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Alleges Binance Formed BAM Trading To Evade US Surveillance 40"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Before January 30, 2020, all costs of BAM Transactions over $30,000 require approval from CZ and Binance, including rent, franchise taxes, legal fees, Web Services fees Amazon (&#8220;AWS&#8221;), and even the use of $11,000 requires approval of all Binance-branded Sweatshirt purchases.</p>



<p>The SEC complaint further alleges that BAM Trading and BAM Management US Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;BAM Management&#8221;) misled investors about the non-existence of trading controls on the Binance.US platform, while Sigma Chain engaged in manipulative trading that increased trading on the platform&#8217;s artificial volume.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the lawsuit <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleges</a> that the defendants concealed that they were mixing billions of dollars of investor assets and sending them to a third party, Merit Peak Ltd., also owned by Zhao.</p>

<p>The complaint also alleges violations of key registration-related provisions of the federal securities laws:</p>



<ul>
<li>Binance and BAM Trade with unregistered national stock exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing houses;</li>



<li>Binance and BAM Trade with Binance&#8217;s unregistered offer and sale of crypto assets, including so-called exchange tokens, BNB, so-called stablecoins, Binance USD (BUSD), several products lending specific cryptocurrencies and staking as a service program;</li>



<li>Zhao is the operational controller of Binance and BAM Trading for unregistered national stock exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies.</li>
</ul>



<p>In response to these allegations, in a recent statement by the Binance CEO, the SEC&#8217;s allegations were completely untrue. Cryptocurrency exchanges will take more action to fight the lawsuit and demand more regulation for the crypto industry. This idea is getting the majority of the consensus from the community, including market player Justin Sun.</p>

<p>Bitcoin fell by more than 5%, sliding below $26,000 for the first time since mid-March. Stocks in MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Platforms all fell significantly.</p>



<p>According to the SEC, Binance and linked entities deceived clients and routed cash to a separate investment fund controlled by the company&#8217;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao.</p>



<p>The SEC has already investigated <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191053-former-coinbase-settles-charges-with-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>&#8216;s digital asset listings, staking-as-a-service, institutional trading, and wallet services. In response, the corporation has sued the SEC in the hopes of compelling the regulatory body to develop guidelines for the regulation of digital assets.</p>



<p>According to Berenberg analyst Mark Palmer, the SEC case against Binance might be a foreshadowing of what is to come for rival crypto exchange Coinbase in the future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We estimate that at least 37% of COIN&#8217;s net revenue would be at risk if the SEC were to target the company&#8217;s crypto token trading and staking operations,&#8221; noted Palmer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The crypto market is bracing for further turmoil as the SEC continues its quest for transparency and compliance with securities regulations.</p>



<p>Additionally, according to the complaint, Binance deceived consumers by claiming to have risk measures in place to oversee manipulative trading. That compromised the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s integrity.</p>



<p>With the consequences of the FTX exchange&#8217;s collapse, US officials have increased their monitoring of cryptocurrency trading and the platforms that support such activity.</p>
