<p class="s3">Due to fear of attacks from the U.S. SEC, investors are selling cryptocurrencies, and some companies have begun utilizing this opportunity to aggressively increase their holdings of coins and tokens while their prices are low, hoping that after fears end, they will increase in value.</p>
<p class="s3">Now, big institutions are increasing their Bitcoin exposure even though the prices have begun plummeting toward the red zone. Alongside all of this, Tradecurve, an upcoming hybrid exchange, has been forming a bullish pattern.</p>

<p class="s7">Why Large Companies Are Bullish on Bitcoin</p>
<p class="s3">Throughout the recent months, large corporations have injected huge amounts of liquidity into MicroStrategy, and some of the largest companies to do so include BlackRock and Fidelity, alongside Bank of America. For corporations that are not interested in buying Bitcoin directly, MicroStrategy shares typically serve as a reliable proxy investment, with the goal of getting exposure to the price performance of BItcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity are the top five stock owners of the company, as reported by CNN.</p>
<p class="s3">With all of that taken into consideration, Bitcoin has been trading at a value of $25,528.55 as of June 16, 2023. In the last week, the low point for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was at $24,864.61, while the high point was at $26,653.24.</p>
<p class="s3">Moreover, the all-time high of Bitcoin occurred on November 10, 2021, at $69,044.77, indicating that the cryptocurrency now trades 62.96% under this point of value. In the last 30 days, Bitcoin decreased in value by 4.9%, while in the last 24 hours, it saw an increase of 2.4%.</p>
<p class="s7">Tradeucurve Has Begun Forming a Bullish Price Pattern</p>
<p class="s3">After the large accumulation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bank of America, it is clear that interest in the blockchain space has spiked, and Tradecurve has also seen a bullish outlook as a direct result of this.</p>
<p class="s3">The TCRV token spiked by 20% in the previous week, and analysts predict that it can spike 50% by the end of June.</p>
<p class="s3">Tradecurve is an emerging player in the online trading ecosystem, and it is undergoing its presale run, offering a unique proposition for investors and traders. The platform combines derivatives and crypto trading within a single platform and eliminates any sign-up KYC checks, prioritizing privacy.</p>
<p class="s3">On Tradedcurve, users from all around the world can trade all derivatives from a single account just by opening one using their email, lining a crypto wallet, and making a deposit. What differentiates Tradecurve from its peers is also the implementation of features such as algorithmic trading using AI and its implementation of Proof of Reserves (PoR).</p>
<p class="s3">With PoR, transparency is prioritized, and with AI trading bots, trades can be executed a lot quicker and more efficiently when compared to manual trading. Analysts are bullish on the future of TCRV as well and predict a climb of 100x, especially when it gets listed on TIer-1 exchanges and on Uniswap.</p>
<p class="s3">During Stage 3 of the presale, TCRV traded at $0.015, and now at Stage 4, its price spiked by 20% to $0.018, indicating a bullish pattern. The presale stage kicked off with a flying start, as even after a day, 4,810,042 TCRV tokens have already been sold, indicating that interest is high in the project.</p>
