Bitcoin price is showing resilience in the face of adversity and is up nearly 100% from bear market lows. However, it has yet to show signs of an undeniable bull market as it has in the past. That&#8217;s because of just one missing ingredient, according to a new BTCUSD weekly chart. Bitcoin Bullish Momentum: The Missing Ingredient When cooking, or especially baking, missing even one ingredient can change the end result of the desired dish or dessert. For example, sweets without any sugar just aren&#8217;t that sweet. A prime cut of steak doesn&#8217;t quite taste as good if it hasn&#8217;t had a proper seasoning and sear.

When prices are moving exceedingly fast in one direction, maximum buying or selling effort is required. This is precisely why reaching overbought or oversold conditions can lead to a reversal – it takes consistently increasing effort to maintain maximum speed. However, in cryptocurrencies, the speculative nature of their pricing can result in extreme phases of FOMO where conditions remain overbought at length. Such phases, called a bullish impulse, show corresponding overbought levels in the RSI historically in BTCUSD.

During the 2017 bull run in crypto, Bitcoin repeatedly reached overbought levels, only to return to the zone as it kept soaring higher and higher.
