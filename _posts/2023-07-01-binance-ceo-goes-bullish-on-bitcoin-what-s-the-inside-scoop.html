In a recent tweet, Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, the CEO of Binance, drew attention to the dynamic nature of Bitcoin&#8217;s price and its increasing practicality. The tweet was timely, aligning with Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent above $31,450, marking its highest value since June 2022. This surge was primarily attributed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s endorsement of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, referred to as BITX, thereby establishing it as the inaugural leveraged bitcoin futures ETF in the United States. Furthermore, the positive sentiment expressed by BlackRock contributed to the overall strength of the cryptocurrency market.

Amidst these positive advancements, a series of allegations have surfaced regarding Binance and its CEO, concerning the alleged employment of a &#8220;liquidation waterfall&#8221; strategy in the sale of spot Bitcoin.
