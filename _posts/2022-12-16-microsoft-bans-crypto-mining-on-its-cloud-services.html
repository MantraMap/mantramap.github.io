<p>Microsoft has updated its acceptable use policy to clarify that crypto mining is now banned unless prior approval is given.</p>
An updated policy
<p>In a move that was not publicised, Microsoft has quietly changed its Acceptable Use Policy to include the following statement:</p>

<p>"Neither Customer, nor those that access an Online Service through Customer, may use an Online Service: to mine cryptocurrency without Microsoft's prior written approval."</p>

<p>In an article first published by the global online tech publication The Register, it was reported that the only other notice of Microsoft's changed stance was given in a subsequent &lsquo;advisory&rsquo; that stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Acceptable Use Policy has been updated to explicitly prohibit mining for cryptocurrencies across all Microsoft Online Services unless written pre-approval is granted by Microsoft.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We suggest seeking written pre-approval from Microsoft before using Microsoft Online Services for mining cryptocurrencies, regardless of the term of a subscription.&rdquo;</p>

Cloud mining becomes more restrictive
<p>Microsoft says that its action is designed to protect customers and to lessen risks of impaired services to its cloud services. However, it did also state that it may give access to mine crypto only if this is used for testing security of platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft is not alone in prohibiting the mining of crypto through its cloud services. Google also requires a written approval request, while Oracle has banned it completely.</p>
Advantages of cloud mining
<p>Cloud mining is a great way to mine cryptocurrencies because it offers several advantages over traditional hardware-based mining. It is more cost-effective, as there are no upfront costs for hardware or maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud mining also provides greater scalability and flexibility, as users can easily adjust their hash rate according to the current market conditions. Additionally, cloud mining allows users to access global pools of miners, which increases their chances of finding blocks and receiving rewards faster than with traditional methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, cloud mining provides a greater degree of anonymity and security than other methods due to its decentralised nature.</p>
