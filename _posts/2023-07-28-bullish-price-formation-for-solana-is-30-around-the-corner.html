Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable downturn recently, unable to sustain itself above the $32 mark. The altcoin remains below a strong resistance level, but a potential breakthrough could lead to a 20% price appreciation.

Despite the challenges, there are two essential bullish signals to consider: the morning star reversal sign and a bullish pennant formation. These signals suggest that if SOL surpasses the immediate resistance, the coin might aim for a rally back to levels it reached two weeks ago. In the broader market context, Bitcoin&#8217;s re-entry into the $29,000 price level has caused retracements in altcoins on their respective charts. Therefore, for SOL to surpass the immediate resistance, it will require strong support from the broader market. The market capitalization of SOL has also experienced a decline, indicating a slight weakening in buying strength. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, SOL was valued at $24.90. The coin tried to reach the $32 level, but the bulls faced resistance and could not sustain it. Subsequently, SOL has been striving to breach the immediate resistance level at $26. A successful move above $26 could propel the coin&#8217;s value to $28. It may encounter a potential price ceiling at that level. If this level is surpassed, the coin could rally further to reach $30. On the other hand, there is a downside risk. If SOL fails to hold above the $26 level, it might face a decline to $21. A further fall below this mark could result in a drop to $18. The price movement remains crucial for SOL&#8217;s future trajectory. Technical Analysis The market exhibited bullish signals, with the bulls taking control despite a slight dip in buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated buyers dominated the market, as it remained above the half-line. Moreover, the price movement above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line highlighted the influence of buyers in driving the price momentum. Should the price maintain its position above the 20-SMA, increased demand is anticipated to propel the asset&#8217;s value above the immediate resistance line. This could potentially lead to further bullish movement in the market. Despite the continued dominance of buyers, SOL presented sell signals on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed red signal bars, suggesting a potential slight dip in the price before any attempt to breach the $26 mark. This indicator reflects the price momentum and its shift. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was below the half-line, indicating that capital inflows were lower than capital outflows.
