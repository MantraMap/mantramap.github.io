			            <description><![CDATA[TON users will able to retain the ability to send messages via the decentralized blockchain in an event of "apocalypse," according to a core dev. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The TON Foundation &#8211; the non-profit association behind The Open Network (TON) &#8211; announced the integration of messenger encryption on the network. The move aims to enhance user privacy by deploying necessary safeguards in a text sent with a transaction.</p>
<p>The new feature uses end-to-end encryption. This essentially guarantees that only the sender and recipient are able to view the message, thereby improving levels of security for TON&#8217;s user base.</p>
<h2>Enhancing User Privacy</h2>
<p>According to the official update shared with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the network fee for delivering an encrypted message via TON is around 0.006 Toncoin (TON) per transaction. The low price is expected to make the service accessible all across the chain&#8217;s increasing user base.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest addition, TON Foundation&#8217;s core developer Anatoly Makosov said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now this popular feature &#8211; which is not available on most other blockchains &#8211; is available with full encryption. Even in the event of an apocalypse and the failure of conventional messenger servers, you will retain the ability to send messages via the decentralized TON blockchain. Rest assured that these messages will be reliably delivered and safeguarded through encryption.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Several crypto wallets, as well as standard web and desktop wallets (Windows, MacOS, Linux), have already added support for the encryption feature, the statement by the foundation revealed. Meanwhile, the encryption for messages will be available in upcoming updates for TON mobile wallets and the Tonkeeper wallet.</p>
<h2>TON&#8217;s Evolution</h2>
<p>TON &#8211; which happens to be a layer-1 blockchain previously created by Telegram &#8211; had a much turbulent start. The project has been run as a community-led, open-source project after Telegram&#8217;s abandonment a few years back. Since then, the TON Foundation has managed to ink several partnerships.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/telegram-to-receive-10m-for-ton-blockchain-effort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnership</a> with DWF Labs, the blockchain industry market maker invested $10 million towards TON&#8217;s development last November.</p>
<p>DWF Labs is reportedly slated to participate in an estimated 50 seed investment rounds scheduled over a few months. The focus of the funding rounds will be to accelerate the scaling of the TON ecosystem as well as its associated projects.</p>
<p>More recently, TON <a href="https://twitter.com/ton_blockchain/status/1660652193123389443" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">unveiled</a> a $25 million fund dubbed &#8220;TON Accelerator Program,&#8221; which aims to invest between $50,000 and $250,000 per project and be accompanied by partnerships and mentorships from TON&#8217;s staff.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[There are two main avenues to get a Bitcoin spot ETF through the SEC - but neither may be likely to work. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fate of Bitcoin’s price throughout the rest of the year largely lies in the answer to one question: Will a Bitcoin spot ETF be approved in the United States?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Joe Carlasare – a commercial litigator supporting Bitcoin – tweeted on Monday that he gives such a product a 30-40% chance of launching inside of a year. He later spoke with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CryptoPotato</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to explain how he arrived at those numbers. </span></p>
<h2>The Trouble With Grayscale’s Lawsuit</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Carlasare, the market’s best bet at launching a spot ETF remains with Grayscale’s lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the owners of the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, Grayscale sued the regulator last year for denying its ETF application in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner, despite approving multiple similar products in the form of Bitcoin futures ETFs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The case went to its first oral hearing in March, during which judges seemed more sympathetic to Grayscale’s arguments than the SEC’s. This spurred certain analysts including Bloomberg’s Elliot Z. Stein to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-has-70-odds-of-winning-sec-lawsuit-bloomberg-analyst/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">assign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 70% odds to Grayscale’s victory, thus boosting the odds of a spot ETF approval by the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Carlasare, however, refuses to be so optimistic – especially as a Grayscale victory won’t necessarily lead to a spot ETF.<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For what seems like the 100th time, my personal view is that the probability of success in approving a spot bitcoin ETF in the near term (inside of a year) is still 30-40% —- which I consider to be fairly good odds.</p>
<p>I strongly reject the view that approval is highly probable… <a href="https://t.co/fAuNJ9pkhh" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/fAuNJ9pkhh</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Joe Carlasare (@JoeCarlasare) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeCarlasare/status/1675975751630290944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The hard part about handicapping the Grayscale v SEC suit is that a “win” may just mean the court of appeals directs the SEC to revisit their decision,” explained the lawyer to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CryptoPotato</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> via DM. “In other words, the Court could just send the case back for further proceeding and assessment in front of the SEC .”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>BlackRock’s SSA With Coinbase</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A review by the SEC has inevitably meant rejection for every applicant with a similar product thus far. Nevertheless, the market is optimistic that a filing last month from BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – can get through, given the firm’s phenomenal </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">success rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> against the SEC with past applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The SEC called BlackRock and Fidelity’s filings “</span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumps-below-30k-as-sec-warns-that-recent-btc-spot-etf-filings-are-inadequate-wsj/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">inadequate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">” last Friday for failing to share a specific spot Bitcoin exchange with which their respective exchanges, NASDAQ and CBOE, would form a surveillance sharing agreement (SSA). Both firms have already refiled, clarifying that their planned SSA will be with </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-stock-surges-12-as-blackrock-names-it-as-surveillance-partner/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Coinbase is the largest Bitcoin exchange in the United States, Carlasare fears the platform doesn’t represent a market of “sufficient size,” as the SEC requests. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sufficient size is somewhat ambiguous, but they have said it has to be a market large enough so that a person or firm attempting to manipulate the Bitcoin spot market would need to necessarily trade on that platform,” he explained. “If you apply that to the SSA with Coinbase, one can conclude that’s not going to satisfy [the] SEC, especially where the majority of spot trading volume is outside the U.S.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, Carlasare gives Grayscale 50% odds of victory against the SEC in its lawsuit, and Coinbase 40% odds of being the “secret sauce” needed to get BlackRock’s ETF approved. He considers both sets of odds “optimistic.”</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The current amount held by LTHs is just 20,000 BTC shy of the all-time high of 14.49 million.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to data provided by Glassnode, long-term holders currently hold almost 14.5M bitcoin (BTC). LTHs have been on a gradual accumulation spree in the past year and a half despite the prolonged bear market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has recently revealed that institutional investors (hedge funds, pension funds, commercial banks, insurance companies, and more) have also shown an increasing appetite for holding the primary cryptocurrency in the long run.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So Close to the ATH</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Glassnode&#8217;s figures </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1675842010261979137" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">showed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that BTC investors willing to hold the asset for the long term have purchased a significant amount between April and early July 2023. The largest crypto asset has performed quite well during those months, as it recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-posts-2-consecutive-green-quarters-for-the-first-time-since-2021/" data-wpel-link="internal">closed</a> its second consecutive quarter in the green for the first time since 2021.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Long-term holders also showed rising interest in BTC between September 2022 and the end of the year. Moreover, their accumulation efforts continued even during<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal"> the FTX meltdown</a> in November, which shook the entire crypto industry to its core. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In fact, other market participants, such as those holding less than 1 BTC (described as &#8220;shrimps&#8221;) and those with no more than 10 BTC (&#8220;crabs&#8221;), also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/massive-spike-in-bitcoin-accumulation-from-retail-investors-after-ftx-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">bought</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> significant amounts of bitcoin shortly after the collapse of the once-prominent cryptocurrency exchange. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overall, long-term holders have amassed a total of 1.01M BTC over the past 602 days and now possess 14.47M BTC (around 75% of the circulating supply). The figure is just 20K BTC less than the all-time high.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that long-term holders were even more aggressive during the bull run in 2021. They accumulated over 2.4M BTC between April and November 2021, when bitcoin&#8217;s USD valuation was considerably higher than now, peaking at almost $70,000.<br />

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Institutional Investors Are Also Flocking</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutional-bitcoin-btc-accumulation-sees-exponential-increase-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> by CryptoQuant, the institutional accumulation of bitcoin has been on the rise, too. The analytics company further outlined that investment firms, hedge funds, private funds, and others seek to join the ecosystem for the long run:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Analyzing the holdings of these funds provides valuable insights into the market dynamics and investor sentiment…Monitoring fund holdings not only provides an understanding of the market sentiment but also highlights the confidence institutional investors have in bitcoin as a long-term asset.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One reason behind that enthusiasm could be the long list of financial giants which recently filed to launch a spot BTC ETF in the States. The spree was started by the world&#8217;s largest asset manager &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock</a>. Fidelity Digital Assets, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and more followed suit a few days later, infusing optimism and hope in the entire crypto sector.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Memu’s machine-learning marketing capabilities make it stand out from the pack of other meme coins in the crypto market.</p>
<p>Early whispers suggest that it could become one of the most exciting meme coin in Web3, thanks to its doggone impressive in-built ability to promote itself, learn from its successes, and improve its AI marketing protocol over time.</p>
<p>Meme coins always rely on their marketing campaigns to attract investors, so SHMU’s impressive self-promoting functionality could be the reason it rises to the top of the dogpile. For now, the native token will be released for $0.011125 on the first day of the SHMU token presale. It represents an exciting opportunity for all fans of AI and blockchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258623" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-2.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-2.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-2-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2>Taking Meme Coins to New Horizons</h2>
<p>The bull run of 2023 culminated in meme coin mania during the opening weeks of May, as brand new meme coins such as Pepe (PEPE) were skyrocketing. Demand for meme coins seems strong nowadays as speculators are looking for coins with short-term profits to capitalize on a long-term upward move in the crypto market.</p>
<p>This rapid rise has become common with meme coins. The last instance of a meme coin skyrocketing towards the end of a bull run was in 2021 when Shiba Inu (SHIB) went from a $0 market cap to over $40 billion so rapidly that it surprised everybody.</p>
<p>The crypto seems to be hungry as a stray dog for high potential memes, and the latest meme coin on the blockchain could take top dog rank away from earlier, less advanced tokens in the crypto market. Shiba Memu is an artificial intelligence meme coin that could take center stage over the coming years, as its automatic marketing protocol gives it a real edge over its competitors.</p>
<h2>What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=cryptopotato" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shiba Memu</a>, the new dog on the block, combines cutting-edge technologies, <a href="https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/technology/artificial-intelligence/blockchain-and-ai-a-perfect-match/" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blockchain and AI</a>, to deliver automated marketing efforts. The protocol can continually promote itself across leading social media networks and interacts with investors directly. Since Shiba Memu uses machine learning algorithms, this dog will become increasingly intelligent.</p>
<p>The developers are coding the new robo-dog meme coin to seamlessly integrate with artificial intelligence enabling it to learn from successful marketing strategies. It will optimize its performance faster than any human organization, with reduced latency and increased accuracy, as it removes subjectivity from the equation.</p>
<p>As a high-spec AI-based marketing protocol, Shiba Memu scans the crypto market for mentions of the brand, allowing it to track and optimize its marketing efforts directly in response to investor sentiment. It is programmed to become exponentially more powerful over time, which could lead to impressive price action for the new meme coin.</p>
<h2>How does Shiba Memu work?</h2>
<p>Shiba Memu lets users track marketing efforts in real-time via its interactive AI dashboard. The dashboard will display all interactions between Shiba Memu and the blockchain community as it automatically generates press releases, social media content, and other marketing materials.</p>
<p>Shiba Memu uses an advanced <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/traders-see-ai-technology-shaping-their-future-jpmorgan-finds?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">natural language processing (NLP) technology</a> that allows it to analyze piles of crypto market data from the internet. As people post updates about their views, Shiba Memu will respond like a good dog with tailored marketing efforts to help influence investor sentiment most effectively.</p>
<p>Users have the convenience of directly interacting with the Shiba Memu AI through the dashboard. Additionally, investors can provide feedback by posing specific questions and receive intelligent answers, all thanks to the integrated machine learning capabilities. All things considered, Shiba Memu is a cutting-edge AI protocol designed especially to drive awareness of itself all over the internet.</p>
<h2>SHMU: A Meme Coin Worth Watching</h2>

			            <description><![CDATA[Kraken has emerged as a resilient market player while its peer exchanges feel brunt of the SEC enforcement from liquidity standpoint.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The SEC&#8217;s subsequent enforcement actions, first against Ripple and XRP, followed by Binance and Coinbase, have contributed to the sufferings of other crypto exchanges from a liquidity standpoint. There has been a major shift in the CEX landscape that has already faced challenges following the FTX implosion.</p>
<p>A new report suggested that a slow recovery in liquidity appears to have haunted the second quarter.</p>
<h2>Kraken: An Outlier</h2>
<p>The blockchain data provider Kaiko&#8217;s second quarterly report <a href="https://marketing.kaiko.com/whats-driving-bitcoins-rally-1?ecid=AOKeC1ZsxplPoISj8-MxfRcQE_Oll4kxJQNtgSOc4UfLGw-sOayRHTHK0ewe4KlZd97Wv-_Vkdtk&amp;utm_campaign=Research%20newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=73538787&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--clUrUFJxIVPxodu1nuscIXTUntKydcYxOWaQ_9Yndi4M5iHH8NFvqS2WR95NShuWC2vEJw4FlDz2lHhta_uPd4K_ppg&amp;utm_content=73538787&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">revealed</a> that spot trading volumes fell sharply during Q2 2023, plunging to the lowest level since 2020. Binance plummeted by approximately 70%. Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, and Huobi also witnessed their respective trading volumes slash by 50% during the same period.</p>
<p>However, Kraken&#8217;s liquidity has been &#8220;remarkably resilient&#8221; so far. It emerged as one of the very few exchanges that flipped the narrative by increasing market depth since the beginning of the year. Kaiko said the liquidity crisis in the United States is now a significant trend that has affected prices on both Binance.US and Coinbase.</p>
<p>In the short term, the crypto exchanges in the country could potentially lose market share to their overseas counterpart.</p>
<p>The report suggests that Kraken stands out in this case because it looks &#8220;quite strong,&#8221; taking liquidity into consideration. On the other hand, overseas platforms such as OKX have managed to amplify market share and liquidity at the expense of Binance.</p>
<h2>Renewed Optimism</h2>
<p>A spot Bitcoin ETF has long been viewed as the holy grail for the digital asset industry, as a way to achieve a broader swath of consumers. The SEC, however, has different plans and has so far rejected all prior filings.</p>
<p>Despite the continued turbulence in the market, institutional clients appeared optimistic, according to the latest survey <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/over-60-of-institutional-investors-bullish-on-crypto-for-next-12-months-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">conducted</a> by Binance Research and Binance VIP &amp; Institutional team.</p>
<p>Over 50% of respondents had a crypto AUM of less than $25 million, and 22.6% had AUM larger than $100 million. 63.5% of respondents expressed confidence in the outlook of crypto for the next year, while 88% said they are positive for the next decade.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Solutions to Bitcoin NFTs’ blockchain bloat are already emerging through a technology called “recursive inscriptions.”]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ordinals developers are pioneering ways to make reduce blockchain bloat caused by Bitcoin NFTs, potentially reducing their creation costs by 90%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The latest among these is BRC69 – a new standard proposed by Ordinals launchpad platform Luminex to “optimize the costs of inscribing on Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol.”</span></p>
<h2>The BRC69 Standard</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Luminex’s GitHub </span><a href="https://github.com/luminexord/brc69" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the new standard can not only reduce inscription costs, but also unlocks new on-chain features, such as “pre-reveal collection launching and on-chain reveals.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">This means that NFT collections can use fully on-chain resources to unveil their NFTs, from the pre-reval process to the final reveal of an image and its relevant traits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is accomplished by automatically and seamlessly rendering images on the Ordinals explorer, without the need for additional action,” wrote Luminex. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BRC69 uses a 4-step process: users inscribe images of their NFT traits on-chain, deploy the collection, compile it, and then mint the assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The standard builds upon ‘recursive inscriptions’ – a method introduced by Ordinals developers in June that helps work around Bitcoin’s 4MB block size limit. Instead of individually minting thousands of JPEG files onto the blockchain, users can reference content within existing inscriptions of the same collection, and render it later using small amounts of code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Luminex, a recursive Ordinals standard will be necessary as Ordinals popularity <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-now-has-over-10-million-ordinals-inscriptions/" data-wpel-link="internal">rises</a>, and Bitcoin block space becomes “increasingly scarce and costly.”  Since popularizing in February, there have been nearly 15 million Ordinals inscriptions on Bitcoin, according to </span><a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dune Analytics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4/ The brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity. Minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image.This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends,using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions</p>
<p>&mdash; Luminex (@luminexio) <a href="https://twitter.com/luminexio/status/1675832806839308288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Bitcoin’s Blockchain Bloat</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ordinals have been met with major <a href="https://twitter.com/Pleditor/status/1666621731795083267" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">skepticism</a> from some Bitcoiners, who claim the protocol is effectively a bug enabling “spam” on the blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Criticism swelled in early May after the BRC-20 standard rose to prominence – an Ordinals-based system for launching fungible tokens on Bitcoin, alongside NFTs. This led to a swell of meme coins that briefly caused the average Bitcoin transaction fee to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-fees-explode-amid-brc-20-memecoin-mania-miners-benefit/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">soar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> over $30, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin as an affordable payments network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Solutions like BRC69 help remedy this issue but also mean fewer fees for miners, which are needed to sustain Bitcoin’s long-term security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fees have since returned to normal levels but could rise again if another NFT hype wave claims Bitcoin as its host. The network has already become the second most popular blockchain for trading NFTs, according to Crypto Slam </span><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/blockchains" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://alexthedoge.live/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Alex The Doge (ALEX)</a>, a memecoin designed to transform the GameFi ecosystem, has reported strong demand for its presale.

An extensive roadmap gives interested parties an idea of what to expect from the ALEX ecosystem as it takes shape, with the launch of the Miracle Verse sure to be an eagerly anticipated event.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs have tanked significantly in value this month.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Justin Bieber might be iconic on stage, but his investment strategy, at least in terms of NFTs, certainly missed the mark. The famous Canadian pop star paid $1.3 million for a Bored Ape NFT last year, which is now worth only around $59,000.</p>
<p>Foraying the hyped NFT space during the digital asset bull run seemed like a lucrative and exciting addition to many celebrities&#8217; investment portfolios. However, many who sang the praises of these non-fungible tokens have not managed to steer clear of the troubles that followed.</p>
<h2>Justin Bieber&#8217;s NFT Losses</h2>
<p>Bieber&#8217;s tryst with NFTs dates back to January 2022, when the sector was raging with celebrity endorsements. The global pop star invested 500 ETH, which was equivalent to $1.3 million, on BAYC. Eighteen months later, his net paper loss stands at $1.24 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Justin Bieber spent over $1.3 million on this NFT last year</p>
<p>It is currently worth $59,000 <a href="https://t.co/LwdNkLyRZU" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/LwdNkLyRZU</a></p>
<p>— Dexerto (@Dexerto) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1675923552250241029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs-unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. The once-premier collection saw a massive decline in its floor price that dipped below 30 ETH, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bayc-has-tanked-90-as-nft-collection-floor-prices-plummet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">making</a> a multi-year low not seen since October 2021. BAYC&#8217;s current state mirrors a general cooling down of the NFT market. Other prominent players such as MoonBirds, MAYC, Azuki, and Doodles also witnessed declines in value lately.</p>
<p>Bieber isn&#8217;t the only celeb to have suffered financial damage from his NFT purchases as a result of the turbulent market conditions. Last year, the paper losses of the soccer star Neymar Jr. as well as the renowned rapper Eminem stood at $700,000 and $300,000, respectively.</p>
<p>American singer and &#8220;Queen of Pop,&#8221; Madonna, also sported big paper losses with her NFTs after purchasing an evil eye ape and then subsequently watching the price go down.</p>
<h2>Legal Troubles</h2>
<p>Apart from crashing prices, legal troubles for these celebs caught up. Last December, NFT investors sued the creator of the popular BAYC collection of NFTs and its promoters, including A-listers such as Madonna, Paris Hilton, and Justin Bieber, for allegedly using the celebs who didn&#8217;t disclose they were paid to pump sales to dupe them into buying the collectibles.</p>
<p>The proposed class-action lawsuit, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/celebrities-who-endorsed-crypto-nfts-land-in-legal-crosshairs-after-investor-losses-11675097150" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">filed</a> in Los Angeles federal court, accused Yuga Labs, Hollywood agent Guy Oseary and MoonPay USA of using their network of prominent musicians, athletes, and celebrities to misleadingly promote and sell Yuga financial products.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the rapidly-evolving crypto market, a new contender has claimed the limelight – Pepe 2.0 ($PEPE2.0).</p>
<p>This meme coin, inspired by the original Pepe ($PEPE), has stunned investors with its recent rise and it continues to climb, with its value rocketing 30% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>As we explore the sudden rise of Pepe 2.0, we’ll also delve into the sea of meme coins to uncover which projects might follow in its footsteps.</p>
<h2>Pepe 2.0 Skyrockets &amp; Outshines Established Meme Coins</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, $PEPE2.0 is trading at $0.00000005052 – up over 30% in the past day.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-2-0/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap</a> data, the token boasts a market capitalization of $19.6 million, putting it ahead of more established meme coins like Samoyedcoin ($SAMO) and Vita Inu ($VINU).</p>
<p>A total of 9,642 unique wallet addresses now hold $PEPE2.0, compared to only 5,410 on June 29, showcasing retail investors&#8217; growing interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture10.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258635" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture10.jpg" alt="Picture10" width="602" height="340" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture10.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture10-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture10-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, data from <a href="https://etherscan.io/dex?q=0xfb66321d7c674995dfcc2cb67a30bc978dc862ad#transactions" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Etherscan.io</a> reveals that some big hitters are taking note of the token, with several buy orders worth over $10,000 arriving in the past few hours.</p>
<p>These figures highlight the escalating demand for $PEPE2.0 and the significant niche it&#8217;s carving for itself in the volatile meme coin market.</p>
<p>Its popularity is even reflected in the scale of its trading volume, which exceeded $12.9 million over the past 24 hours, according to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe-2-0" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, Pepe 2.0’s capacity for consistent growth only seems to be strengthening, suggesting that the best might be yet to come for this budding meme coin.</p>
<h2>Unraveling the Dynamics Behind Pepe 2.0’s Stellar Ascent</h2>
<p>Delving into the reasons behind $PEPE2.0’s skyrocketing popularity, several factors stand out.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the legacy of the original Pepe token plays a significant role in igniting interest in its successor.</p>
<p>Since $PEPE&#8217;s initial bull run saw the token&#8217;s price explode by over 10,000%, investors are naturally drawn to $PEPE2.0, hoping for a repeat performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258634" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9.jpg" alt="Picture9" width="602" height="255" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-300x127.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the current bullish sentiment in the meme coin space offers a productive environment for $PEPE2.0’s surge.</p>
<p>Data from <a href="https://coincodex.com/cryptocurrencies/sector/meme/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinCodex</a> reveals that the meme coin market is now valued at a whopping $16.2 billion – and is growing larger by the day.</p>
<p>Thus, the impressive gains from other meme coins have created a sort of &#8220;ripple effect,&#8221; encouraging retail investors to look for the next project that could produce exponential returns.</p>
<p>Overall, the bullish meme coin market and the original Pepe&#8217;s compelling legacy appear to be providing a solid platform for $PEPE2.0&#8217;s current momentum – which shows no signs of slowing.</p>
<h2>Can These Meme Coins Mirror Pepe 2.0’s Surge?</h2>
<p>While Pepe 2.0 has been grabbing headlines, it&#8217;s not the only meme coin poised to make a significant impact in the crypto scene.</p>
<p>Two other projects, Wall Street Memes and Thug Life, are currently gaining traction.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Continues to Rise After Raising $12.4m Through Presale</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=whats-behind-the-rise-of-pepe-2-0-as-the-price-continues-to-pump-and-can-these-meme-coins-follow/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is harnessing the power of community and the allure of meme culture to create a storm in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Having already raised an impressive $12.4m during its presale phase, Wall Street Memes is carving a unique path in the market – setting it apart from the hundreds of alternative meme coins that launch each week.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes aims to create a community-driven ecosystem centered around standing up to the financial heavyweights on Wall Street.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258633" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8.jpg" alt="Picture8" width="602" height="295" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This plan seems to be working, evidenced by the project’s rapidly growing <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<p>As Wall Street Memes’ presale nears its end, there’s palpable excitement surrounding the $WSM token’s forthcoming debut on Tier-1 CEXs.</p>
<p>Investors globally are eager to uncover the potential of $WSM – with several crypto influencers (including <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCryptoJamie" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto Jamie</a>) coming on board as brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>If the project maintains its momentum post-listing, $WSM could have a stellar second half of 2023.</p>

<h2>Thug Life Amasses $325,000 Funding in Record Time, 13 Days Left to Buy on Presale</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a> is another meme coin quickly garnering attention in the crypto community.</p>
<p>Billed as a way to &#8220;pimp out your money game,&#8221; $THUG has been experiencing a steady climb in community engagement since launching last week – with more than 2,900 people now following the official <a href="https://twitter.com/thug_life_token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>The team behind $THUG is banking on the viral appeal of its unique brand image and the increasing popularity of meme coins to drive its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258632" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7.jpg" alt="Picture7" width="602" height="215" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-300x107.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-50x18.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Also, the team is actively fostering an engaged community – evidenced by the fact that 70% of the total $THUG supply has been set aside for presale investors.</p>
<p>Like Wall Street Memes, Thug Life&#8217;s price could significantly rise if it continues to resonate with meme coin enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
<p>All in all, $THUG&#8217;s unique branding and rapidly growing community undoubtedly make it a clear contender for a Pepe 2.0-style surge.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[On-chain data indicates strong buying interest absorbed by limit sell orders, a balance that has formed a zone that could determine BTC’s trajectory.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new report by the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex revealed that the latest on-chain metrics and investor behavior suggest the crypto market may be ready for the next bull run.</p>
<p>In the weekly edition of the Bitfinex Alpha <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitfinex-Alpha-61.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, the crypto exchange noted that Bitcoin’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) indicators have moved into the green, showing that almost all BTC trades have been profitable since the leading asset breached the $29,500 mark.</p>
<h2>On-Chain Metrics and Investor Behavior</h2>
<p>As bitcoin’s price <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-taps-31k-on-blackrocks-etf-refiling-aptos-jumps-10-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">hovers</a> around the $30,000 range, the asset’s SOPR has remained above one, showing that market participants are confident in their spot positions and do not have to sell at a loss. They are keen on future price appreciation and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutional-bitcoin-btc-accumulation-sees-exponential-increase-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">believe</a> their positions would either realize partial profits now or hold for higher.</p>
<p>The SOPR gives insights into the profitability or loss of coins moved on-chain. A SOPR greater than one means that investors are, on average, selling their BTC at a profit. If it is less than one, then they are selling at a loss.</p>
<p>The SOPR has been above one for roughly two weeks since bitcoin soared past the $29,500 level. This signals that most market participants expect further price appreciation and are unwilling to sell at a loss, like in a bull market.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This generally keeps the SOPR value &gt; one during bull markets, because there is very little supply coming onto the market at breakeven prices. In both bull and bear markets, the SOPR value tends to find support and resistance at a value of one, thus, a sustained stint above one as we are in now would signal we are in an early bull market stage,” Bitfinex said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Tussle Between Bulls and Bears</h2>
<p>While Bitcoin’s SOPR hovers above one, the asset’s order flow data suggests a tussle between bullish and bearish sentiments. On-chain data indicates strong buying interest absorbed largely by limit sell orders, a balance that has formed a zone that could determine BTC’s direction in upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, several on-chain trackers have discovered a significant increase in miners sending bitcoins to exchanges. Such activity is usually seen in two scenarios &#8211; during a bear market capitulation or the early stages of a bull market.</p>
<p>However, on-chain data indicates the miners’ move is directed at derivative trading activities like using the BTC as collateral for their positions rather than directly selling on spot markets. This prevents any immediate bearish influence on prices.</p>
