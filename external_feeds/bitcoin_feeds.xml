<h2>Peter Schiff&#x2019;s Bitcoin Outlook</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff shared his thoughts about the future of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in a series of tweets this week. He wrote Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that bitcoin fell along with financial assets doesn&#x2019;t mean that it will rise once those markets turn.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Bitcoin isn&#x2019;t a financial asset. It&#x2019;s a collectable digital token,&#x201D; Schiff continued. &#x201C;The bitcoin bubble popped and collectors will be selling no matter what happens to financial assets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The economist also believes that bitcoin is not scarce despite the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s 21 million supply cap. Responding to a tweet Tuesday stating that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is &#x201C;the scarcest and most desirable asset the world has ever seen,&#x201D; Schiff said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is hardly scarce and in no way desirable. If you want to lose your money there are plenty of ways to do it. You don&#x2019;t need to buy bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Replying to another tweet claiming that bitcoin is a risk asset rather than digital gold, Schiff claimed that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is &#x201C;More like a fool&#x2019;s asset.&#x201D; He asserted: &#x201C;So, as long as people are foolish enough to buy bitcoin, the price will go up. Unfortunately for bitcoin HOLDers though there are plenty of fools in the world, I don&#x2019;t think there are many left willing to buy bitcoin who don&#x2019;t already own it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Schiff is the founder and current chairman of Schiffgold, a precious metals dealer specializing in gold and silver bullion. He has long been a bitcoin skeptic, regularly bashing the crypto while promoting gold.</p>

<p>Commenting on the collapse of FTX and subsequent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasurys-yellen-says-crypto-doesnt-have-adequate-regulation-calls-ftx-collapse-a-lehman-moment/">calls for stronger crypto regulation</a>, Schiff tweeted Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s ironic that the big players in crypto are looking to government to save the industry with additional regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;This goes against the very core of the original promise of Bitcoin, which was to be the free market alternative to the corrupt government fiat monetary system,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>In November, Schiff warned that bitcoin has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-says-bitcoin-still-has-a-long-way-to-fall-values-btc-at-10k/">a long way to fall</a>, valuing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at $10K. He also believes that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-the-us-dollar-will-crash-says-were-going-to-default/">U.S. dollar will crash</a> and the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s actions will lead to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-fed-action-could-lead-to-market-crashes-massive-financial-crisis-severe-recession/">massive financial crisis</a>.</p>

However, he acknowledged that banning crypto &#8220;is very difficult because it will go offshore and who knows how that will work.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Senator Sherrod Brown Suggests Banning Crypto</h2>
<p>U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with NBC Sunday.</p>
<p>He stated that the Treasury Department and all the different regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), need to get together and assess any possible action related to the cryptocurrency market. Referring to the SEC and CFTC, the senator said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want them to do what they need to do. At the same time, maybe banning it, although banning it is very difficult because it will go offshore and who knows how that will work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week, the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee held a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-calls-sam-bankman-fried-to-answer-for-failure-of-ftx-and-alameda-research/">hearing</a> on the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The House Financial Services Committee also held a separate hearing on FTX a day prior.</p>
<p>FTX filed for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">bankruptcy</a> on Nov. 11 and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> and is now in jail in the Bahamas. He and his crypto firm are facing several <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">fraud charges</a> brought against them by the U.S. government and regulators. The U.S. is seeking Bankman-Fried&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried-faces-us-extradition-bankruptcy-court-says-top-execs-wont-be-compensated/">extradition</a>. However, SBF told the Bahamas court Monday that he will make a decision only after he has seen all the indictments against him.</p>
<h2>Senator Brown on Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>The senator from Ohio also said Sunday that the cryptocurrency market is a &#8220;complicated, unregulated pot of money&#8221; and the issue was much larger than FTX. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve got to do this right,&#8221; he stressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent much of the last eight years and a half in this job as chair of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee,&#8221; Brown continued, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Educating my colleagues and trying to educate the public about crypto and the dangers that it presents to our security as a nation and the consumers that get hoodwinked by them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week, Senator Pat Toomey <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-cryptocurrency-cannot-be-stopped-ftx-collapse-isnt-an-indictment-of-crypto/">explained</a> in his opening remarks at the Senate hearing on FTX that the crypto exchange&#8217;s fallout does not justify banning or &#8220;pausing&#8221; crypto. &#8220;Some of my colleagues have suggested pausing cryptocurrencies before we can address it. This is profoundly misguided, not to mention impossible. Short of enacting draconian, authoritarian policies, cryptocurrency cannot be stopped. If we tried, the technology would simply migrate offshore,&#8221; he warned.</p>

The testing will be conducted under a special legal regime that’s currently under development. </strong></p>
<h2>Russia’s Central Bank to Explore Crypto Settlements Amid Financial Sanctions</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) intends to trial international trade settlements with cryptocurrencies, the monetary authority’s First Deputy Chairman Olga Skorobogatova announced on Monday.</p>
<p>“We are now planning, within the framework of the experimental legal regime that we are preparing, to try the use of cryptocurrency for international settlements, that is, for foreign economic activity,” she said, quoted by the Tass news agency.</p>
<p>Speaking at the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, Skorobogatova detailed that the pilot project will be carried out with interested companies. However, she did not specifically name the market participants that will join in.</p>

<p>Government institutions in Moscow have been working to expand the regulatory framework for digital financial assets to cover decentralized cryptocurrencies. The central bank has been a strong <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-proposes-wide-ban-on-cryptocurrency-use-trade-mining/">opponent</a> to their legalization in Russia but has softened its stance amid Western restrictions over the invasion of Ukraine, that have limited the country’s access to global finances and markets.</p>
<p>In September, Deputy Minister of Finance Alexey Moiseev revealed that his department and the monetary policy regulator have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-cant-do-without-cross-border-crypto-payments-consensus-reached/">agreed</a> that, in the current conditions, it would be impossible for Russia to do without cross-border settlements in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the CBR maintains its position against allowing the free circulation of digital currencies like bitcoin under Russian jurisdiction, including domestic crypto payments. It recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amendments-to-russias-digital-asset-law-aim-to-allow-mining-ban-crypto-exchange-and-ads/">backed</a> legislation designed to regulate mining, provided the minted crypto is exchanged abroad or exclusively under special legal regimes inside Russia.</p>

According to the non-binding term sheet agreement, NYDIG will obtain 2.8 exahash per second (EH/s) of Greenidge&#x2019;s mining capacity, and Greenidge further entered into a hosting deal with NYDIG for the same 2.8 EH/s.</strong></p>
<h2>Greenidge Generation Enters Into a Deal With NYDIG, Board Is Actively Discussing the &#x2018;Potential for, and Timing of, a Voluntary Bankruptcy Filing&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Bitcoin miners have been hammered by financial problems in 2022 as the price of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) has dropped below the cost of production, and the network&#x2019;s mining difficulty is very high. Furthermore, a number of interconnected bitcoin mining operations have been dealing with loan defaults and bankruptcies that have caused a contagion within the mining industry. On Tuesday, the New York-based Greenidge Generation renegotiated a deal with NYDIG that concerns a loan worth $74 million.</p>
<p>Over the last six months, Greenidge (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GREE:NASDAQ">GREE</a>) shares have nosedived by 88.91% against the U.S. dollar. 35.58% has been lost during the last 30 days according to GREE/USD market data. Greenidge says it &#x201C;entered a non-binding term sheet with NYDIG&#x201D; and NYDIG will purchase 2.8 EH/s of the company&#x2019;s mining machines. Furthermore, the New York-based mining firm says it plans to enter into a hosting agreement with NYDIG.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Greenidge would enter into a hosting agreement with NYDIG for approximately 2.8 EH/s of mining capacity, which would result in a material change to Greenidge&#x2019;s current business strategy and result in Greenidge largely operating miners owned by NYDIG, rather than operating miners owned by Greenidge,&#x201D; the company detailed on Tuesday. In exchange, NYDIG has detailed its plans to reduce Greenidge&#x2019;s $74 million debt. Greenidge stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>In exchange for the purchased miners and transfer of mining infrastructure and credits to NYDIG, NYDIG would agree to a reduction of approximately $57 to $68 million of debt.</p></blockquote>
<p>NYDIG has been a big backer when it comes to lending to bitcoin mining operations as it has lent more than $300 million to firms like Stronghold, Greenidge, Argo Blockchain, Iris Energy, and Core Scientific. The loans were secured by the firms&#x2019; application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining machines.</p>

<p>In addition to the restructuring update on Tuesday, Greenidge also filed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844971/000162828022032258/gree_exhibit991x20222012.htm">documentation</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that notes Greenidge execs are in active discussions about the potential for, and timing of, a voluntary bankruptcy filing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The bitcoin mining operation says that bankruptcy could happen if Greenidge discovers it does not have available liquidity, its remaining capital depletes and cannot fulfill debt obligations, or if Greenidge defaults on any debts or contracts.</p>

For 38 days FTT remained above the $1 per unit area up until Dec. 19, as the token suddenly crashed below the $1 region during the mid-afternoon trading sessions, slipping to a low of $0.89 per FTT at 2:30 p.m. (ET).</strong></p>
<h2>Bankrupt FTX&#8217;s Exchange Token FTT Drops Below the $1 Price Range</h2>
<p>Ftx token (FTT), the crypto exchange ERC20 coin tied to the now-defunct exchange, FTX, broke below the $1 support line on Monday, Dec. 19, 2022. Interestingly, unlike the Terra collapse and the native token LUNA dive bombing to zero, FTT fell from $25.78 per coin on Nov. 5, 2022, to roughly $1.59 per unit on Nov. 14, three days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>

<p>FTT tapped $1.92 per coin the following day on Nov. 15, and it would not see that price height again after that point. For 38 consecutive days since Nov. 12, FTT has been below $2 and above the $1 range, and it tapped a high of $1.88 per coin on Dec. 9. 11 days later, FTT markets are struggling and for the first time since the token was launched, it reached its all-time low Dec. 19.</p>
<p>The exchange token sunk to $0.894 per unit at around 2:30 p.m. (ET) on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, at the time of writing, FTT is down 8.6% against the U.S. dollar. While FTT’s price remains below $1, a myriad of crypto assets on Tuesday have seen gains and FTT has not. FTT’s market cap rank is not applicable because the project’s contract deployer unlocked the locked FTT tokens into circulation last month.</p>
<p>Coin market cap aggregation sites like coingecko.com do not rank the crypto asset’s cap among the thousands of other crypto assets listed. It is assumed there’s a total supply of 328,895,112 FTT tokens in the wild today and during the last 24 hours, FTT has seen $7.26 million in global trade volume.</p>

<p>FTT trade volumes have dwindled a great deal since FTX’s collapse and today the most active FTT trading is taking place on Binance, Kucoin, and Sushiswap. While FTT has broken below the $1 support, the crypto asset has remained consolidated just below that region at prices between $0.89 and $0.98 per unit.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) snapped a six-day losing streak on Tuesday, as prices rose by as much as 3%.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD moved away from a one-month low of $61.00, hitting a high of $65.60 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move came as bullish pressure intensified once the token hit a key support point of $63.50.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, moving away from its long-term floor of 33.50.</p>
<p>Since moving away from yesterday&#x2019;s six-month low, the index is now tracking at the 37.46 mark.</p>
<p>The next visible resistance seems to be the 46.00 level, and if hit, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> will likely be trading above $70.00.</p>

<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) was another notable gainer in today&#x2019;s session, as prices surged to a four-day high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $5.75 to start the week, LINK/USD climbed to a peak of $6.10 earlier today.</p>
<p>This rally has pushed the token to its highest point since Friday, when it was trading at a top of $6.54.</p>

<p>Similar to litecoin, today&#x2019;s move saw prices move away from a four-week low, rising from a recent floor in the process.</p>
<p>LINK rallied at the $5.80 support, which came as the RSI rose above a ceiling at the 37.00 level.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 39.81, with LINK/USD trading at $6.06.</p>

The Japanese central bank was one of the only banks worldwide to hold off on raising benchmark interest rates, as policymakers have kept the government bond yield rate close to zero since 2016.</strong></p>
<h2>Japanese Central Bank Lifts Rates for the First Time in 6 Years</h2>
<p>During the last two months, there’s been a lot of discussion surrounding the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, as the BOJ chief will be replaced soon by a successor. Kuroda, however, shocked global markets on Dec. 20, when he <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/yen-surges-as-bank-of-japan-surprises-by-letting-benchmark-rate-rise-11671510671?mod=home-page">detailed</a> that the BOJ would allow Japan’s 10-year bond yields to increase to 0.5% from the previous upper limit of 0.25%.</p>
<p>The move follows the yield curve control mechanism the Japanese central bank introduced in Sept. 2016. The BOJ <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bank-of-japan-shocks-global-markets-with-bond-yield-shift.html">explained</a> on Tuesday that the change aims to “improve market functioning and encourage a smoother formation of the entire yield curve, while maintaining accommodative financial conditions.”</p>

<p>Representatives from Mizuho Bank told CNBC in an interview that the move reflected the belief that there will be a hawkish pivot from the BOJ going forward. However, these hawkish bets may not come to fruition the financial institution elaborated on Tuesday. “Popular bet does not mean that is the policy reality or the intended policy perception,” Mizuho Bank added.</p>
<p>Gold bug and economist Peter Schiff is betting that the BOJ will raise rates again. “The Bank of Japan blinked and pivoted in the opposite direction,” Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1605044558475055104?s=20&amp;t=-rzytrqawzzFGAtFOIhQ7Q">tweeted</a>. “After artificially holding the 10-year JGB yield at .25%, the BOJ just raised the target rate to .5%. More hikes are coming. In the U.S. this means the dollar and asset prices will fall and inflation will rise.” Hedge fund manager James Lavish <a href="https://twitter.com/jameslavish/status/1605066346357743616?s=20&amp;t=-rzytrqawzzFGAtFOIhQ7Q">said</a> the BOJ has attempted to make one last goal.</p>
<p>“At this point, the Bank of Japan has pulled the goalie and is hoping for a last-second tying goal,” Lavish tweeted. “Maybe get to overtime. Maybe somehow pull it out. Except they’re down 5-1. The game is over, and they just don’t know it yet.”</p>

<p>At 8:41 a.m. (ET), the Japanese yen was up 3.42% against the U.S. dollar during the last 24 hours and 4% higher over the last five days. 30-day statistics indicate the yen has gained 5.73% against the greenback as well. Six-month metrics show the yen is up 1.81% and year-to-date the yen is down 13.25% against the dollar.</p>

The bank adjusted its yield curve control, which increased its cap on the 10-year government bond, allowing moves of up to 50 basis points (bps), up from 25 bps. Bitcoin also rose on the news, climbing closer to $17,000</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved closer to the $17,000 level on Tuesday, as traders reacted to the latest Bank of Japan policy decision.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD surged to a peak of $16,837.65 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a low of $16,398.14.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s move saw the token climb above a key resistance level of $16,700, with prices rising to a four-day high in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the surge took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at the 46.00 level.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is currently tracking at the 46.61 mark, which is its strongest point since last Thursday.</p>
<p>Should the index continue this upward trend, we will likely see <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> move above the $17,000 level in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also trended higher on Tuesday, as it once again rose into the $1,200 region.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,160.38 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to a peak of $1,214.73 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This comes despite the fact that there has been a recent downward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.</p>

<p>As of writing, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency seems set to collide with a higher resistance at the $1,230 level.</p>
<p>This could prove to be challenging however, with the 14-day RSI now hovering directly below a ceiling at 47.00.</p>

A Nigerian lawmaker, Babangida Ibrahim, suggested that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is not well positioned to regulate cryptocurrencies. </strong></p>
<h2>The CBN and SEC Feud</h2>
<p>The Nigerian House of Representatives is expected to pass a bill that seeks to give the country&#8217;s securities regulator the right to designate cryptocurrency as capital for investment, a <a href="https://punchng.com/proposed-cryptocurrency-law-to-define-cbns-roles-reps/">report</a> has said. The bill, which seeks to amend the Investments and Securities Act of 2007, reportedly clarifies the roles of Nigeria&#8217;s two regulators that have jostled to control the crypto industry.</p>
<p>As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) seemingly assumed crypto control after directing financial institutions to block crypto entities. The CBN’s Feb. 5 <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-nigeria-orders-banks-to-close-accounts-of-crypto-clients-as-remittances-via-traditional-corridors-drop-by-97/">directive</a> was issued just a few months after the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (NSEC) designated crypto assets securities.</p>
<p>Following the CBN’s abrupt decision, the Nigerian securities regulator said the guidelines that it had issued in September 2020 would be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerias-sec-in-talks-with-central-bank-of-nigeria-over-crypto-regulation-2020-crypto-guidelines-still-suspended/">suspended</a>. The NSEC also promised to engage the CBN over the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Central Bank Not Well-Positioned to Regulate Crypto</h2>
<p>Explaining why Nigeria needs to regulate digital currencies, Babangida Ibrahim, the chairperson of the legislative body’s Committee on Capital Market and Institutions, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We need an efficient and vibrant capital market in Nigeria. For us to do that, we have to be up to date [with] global practices. In recent time[s], there are a lot of changes within the capital market, especially with the introduction of digital currencies, commodity exchanges and so many other things that are essential, that need to be captured in the new Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>Concerning the CBN’s directive and the central bank’s attempts to consolidate its control of the crypto industry, Ibrahim said the apex bank is not ideally placed to regulate cryptocurrencies because many digital currency investors &#8220;don’t even use local accounts.&#8221; According to Ibrahim, this situation justifies the legislative body’s plan to amend the Securities Act.</p>
<p>Also, in his remarks during an interview with Punch Nigeria, the lawmaker said the objective of the House of Representatives is not to take sides but to follow the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not about [the] lifting of the ban, we are looking at the legality: what is legal and what is within the framework of our operations in Nigeria. The CBN is regulating financial markets and the Securities Exchange Commission regulates the capital market,&#8221; Ibrahim reportedly said.</p>
