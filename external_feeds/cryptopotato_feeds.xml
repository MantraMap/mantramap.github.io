            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Chicago, Illinois, August 8th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>For years, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have been the favored methods of payment for cybercriminals. Ransomware crime rings rely almost exclusively on Bitcoin payments to extract vast sums from major institutions, including hospitals and providers of critical infrastructure. But, in a groundbreaking move, a <a href="https://loevy-content-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/08/28.Final-Judgment-Order.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">federal court case</a> in Chicago has turned the tables on cybercriminals by using inventive technology to digitally lock the criminals out of their blockchain accounts.</p>
<p>The case was brought against Russian and North Korean hackers who are under sanctions by the United States Treasury Department.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike Kanovitz, CEO of <a href="https://jurat.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Jurat Blockchains</a>, the firm behind the technology deployed in the case, remarked, “It is encouraging to witness this invention in action, fighting criminals who misuse blockchains and give cryptocurrency a bad name.” Kanovitz explained that “Jurat technology provides the base layer for legal enforcement on blockchains by working in conjunction with official courts. It can help government officials prevent crime and lets cryptocurrency users access courts if they have had their cryptocurrency stolen, been defrauded, or lost their private keys.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The court’s order applies to 16 individuals and international criminal organizations sanctioned under Executive Orders of the President of the United States. Among those targeted was Hydra Market, the focus of “a collaborative initiative joined by the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and Homeland Security Investigations,” according to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0701" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">U.S. Treasury Department press release</a>.  Another major target named in the lawsuit is the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0768" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Lazarus Group</a>, which engaged in “malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency” on behalf of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The state-sponsored hackers committed “the largest virtual currency heist to date, worth almost $620 million, from a blockchain project linked to the online game Axie Infinity.”</p>
<p>Using the first-of-its-kind judicial injunction, the federal court has locked all accounts belonging to the 16 criminals that contain the cryptocurrency $JTC. The coin emerged following an update to Bitcoin’s software, resulting in a “fork” that left two blockchains, BTC and JTC, hosting the same accounts. Victims who previously lost $BTC can claim their $JTC using the Jurat Wallet app or by filing an action to enforce their legal rights in court. Industry estimates of cryptocurrency crimes range above $20 billion annually.</p>
<p>The case was handled by Jon Loevy, of Loevy &amp; Loevy Attorneys at Law in Chicago.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">PEPE has turned bullish these past two days and may signal the start of a significant rally.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.00000105</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.00000123</strong></p>
<h2>1. Breakout from the Wedge</h2>
<p>PEPE managed to end its correction and broke above the falling wedge. This is a bullish signal. If the resistance at $0.0000012 turns into support, then this rally will likely become significant.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265240" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265240" style="width: 1818px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265240" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44.png" alt="PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44" width="1818" height="836" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44.png 1818w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44-1024x471.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44-768x353.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44-1536x706.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-19-44-50x23.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1818px) 100vw, 1818px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265240" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>2. Buyers Return</h2>
<p>With the breakout confirmed, the volume has been in green these past two days as buyers rushed to get exposure. With each subsequent resistance that is broken, the buying pressure could accelerate.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265239" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265239" style="width: 1819px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265239" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43.png" alt="PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43" width="1819" height="835" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43.png 1819w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43-1024x470.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43-768x353.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43-1536x705.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-20-43-50x23.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1819px) 100vw, 1819px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265239" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Imminent Bullish Cross on MACD</h2>
<p>The daily MACD is also about to give a bullish signal as its moving averages are about to cross to the positive side if bulls maintain the pressure. If that happens, then PEPE could enter a sustained rally.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265238" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265238" style="width: 1819px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265238" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50-1.png" alt="PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50" width="1819" height="836" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50-1.png 1819w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50-1-300x138.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50-1-1024x471.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50-1-768x353.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50-1-1536x706.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-09_14-21-50-1-50x23.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1819px) 100vw, 1819px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265238" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for PEPE is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for PEPE Price</h2>
<p>It seems that PEPE is likely to test the key resistance levels and potentially even move higher in the coming days. If buyers don&#8217;t lose strength, then this memecoin could easily reach $0.00000136 next.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency industry has changed by leaps and bounds throughout the past couple of years.</p>
<p>This is partly due to the fact that the market went through a parabolic rally that sent crypto into the mainstream and put it in front of the eyes of anyone who hadn’t heard about it before.</p>
<p>This includes institutions. Many are already involved, but the fact of the matter is that most of them are merely dipping their toes in the industry.</p>
<p>The reasons for that are multifold, but undoubtedly a contributing factor is the lack of precise infrastructure that’s both convenient and safe.</p>
<p>It’s also true that many retail traders are experiencing issues with finding a solution that is a one-stop shop and covers all of their crypto requirements.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://www.bifinance.com/home" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">BiFinance</a> steps into the picture.</p>
<h2>What is BiFinance?</h2>
<p>BiFinance puts forward an institutional-grade digital asset trading platform that unravels a multitude of high-quality digital asset targets and innovative investments while also focusing on research audit standards.</p>
<p>The company is operated by a team of very experienced professionals who’ve tried and tested the waters in both traditional finance and crypto for many years. This has put them in a leading position in terms of technology, abundant product lines, appropriate security risk control integrations, and maintenance systems.</p>
<p>In general, the team is laser-focused on its mission, which is to solve the problem of solving difficulties for small as well as medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>The platform offers a myriad of products but perhaps etched into the spotlight are its spot and derivatives trading offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bifinance_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265262" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bifinance_cover.jpg" alt="bifinance_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bifinance_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bifinance_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bifinance_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bifinance_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bifinance_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h3>Spot Crypto Trading</h3>
<p>The exchange offers spot cryptocurrency transactions for its users globally. They can buy various coins with a simple click and sell them just as easily.</p>
<p>Mainstream cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH are supported, as well as a range of others. The team at BiFinance puts a lot of effort into discovering new opportunities while also retaining its high level of integrity.</p>
<h3>Derivatives Crypto Trading</h3>
<p>Traders are able to develop and expand the depth of their derivatives trading with BiFinance’s products. The choices are multiple and versatile.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the exchange is also conducting compliance development when it comes to its derivatives trading. This includes perpetual contracts and futures. Moreover, the platform also plans to launch stable income products, which include deposits, interest-bearing instruments, and others.</p>
<p>That’s far from the only thing that the platform is offering, though. Users can also expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launchpad</li>
<li>DeFi Asset management</li>
<li>BiFinance earn</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Exciting Road Ahead</h2>
<p>Despite having developed a robust set of products already, the team at BiFinance is nowhere near being done.</p>
<p>Just recently, in April, BiFinance obtained permission for the US MSB license and is now officially holding this license. The registration serial number is 31000241154611. The company is also registered as a monetary service business entity in the US Bank of Constitution (BSA) 31CFR1022.380 (A)-(F).</p>
<p>In addition, the team participated in the Wikiexpo event held in Singapore and conducted multiple roadshows in the city-state.</p>
<p>In June, BiFinance officially submitted its application for a VASP license in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the company will start its Series B financing in August. Keep in mind that BiFinance was successful in holding a Series A, raising a total of $7.5 million.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the exchange will also be launching its very own native token called BFT. The launch is planned for the third quarter of this year, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>To find out more about BiFinance and start trading, please take a look at the <a href="https://www.bifinance.com/home" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitstamp has made the decision to halt trading for a number of cryptocurrencies, including SOL, SAND, and MATIC.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US-based users of the Bitstamp crypto exchange will no longer be able to make trades on several high-profile tokens, including Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and NEAR.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an unexpected <a href="https://blog.bitstamp.net/post/important-update-halt-of-axs-chz-ex-ny-mana-matic-near-sand-and-sol/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its official blog, Bitstamp said it would suspend trading for seven cryptocurrencies for its US customers starting August 29, 2023.</li>
<li>In addition to major tokens like SOL, MATIC, and NEAR, the suspension will also affect a cluster of metaverse gaming and entertainment tokens, including Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), Sandbox (SAND), and Chiliz (CHZ).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update for our US users <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4e2.png" alt="📢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Starting August 29: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments.</p>
<p>Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.</p>
<p>More info:…</p>
<p>— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bitstamp/status/1688846041129328641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<ul>
<li>Bitstamp explained its decision was influenced by “recent developments” in the US regulatory environment, although it did not go into specifics.</li>
<li>The suspension means that from August 29, the exchange will disable any new orders involving the seven tokens and their trading pairs and cancel all existing ones. However, Bitstamp clarified that users can still hold and withdraw the tokens.</li>
<li>The company also asked its US users to carry out any pending trades involving the affected cryptocurrencies before the August 29 deadline, following which it will not permit any more transactions on them.</li>
<li>The clamping down on SOL and the other tokens comes in the wake of reports that Bitstamp is actively looking for strategic investors to help in its expansion plans. In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/crypto-exchange-bitstamp-in-fundraising-talks-seeks-expansion" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">interview</a> with Bloomberg, Bitstamp CEO Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux stated the company had initiated fundraising plans in June aided by Galaxy Digital.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[PEPE Coin skyrockets by over 8% in the past 24 hours. Could this whale be the reason?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The PEPE meme coin witnessed significant activity on August 9, with a major crypto investor spending 1 million USDC to purchase 807 billion tokens.</p>
<ul>
<li>The PEPE coin price has had a rough seven days, see-sawing between a high of $0.00000128 and a low of $0.00000108.</li>
<li>But after <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-coin-plunges-5-daily-bitcoin-might-be-preparing-for-a-huge-move-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">shedding</a> off 5% from its price on August 8, Pepe took a turn, rising rapidly from $0.00000113 to $0.00000122. During this rise, the unnamed whale took a punt and splashed 1 million USDC ($1,000,300) on 807 billion PEPE coins, each priced at around $0.000001239.</li>

<li>With PEPE currently trading at $0.00000120, an 8.4% jump from the previous 24 hours, the whale’s meme coin stash is valued at approximately $968,000.</li>
<li>Ever since PEPE hit its all-time high of $0.0000044 on May 5, the coin has rarely gone <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-price-down-over-10-but-new-cowabunga-meme-coin-is-pumping/" data-wpel-link="internal">above</a> the $0.000002 level, but data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CoinGecko</a> shows that its trading volume has increased significantly in the last three days, rising from $53 million on August 7 to $132.1 million on August 9.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The agency says top banks are facing weaker profits and reduced availability of CRE credit.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big Three credit rating agency Moody’s has downgraded numerous regional banks in the United States due to weak earnings last quarter and sizable unrealized losses, according to the firm’s Monday note.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, banking giants including Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), US Bancorp (USB.N), State Street (STT.N) and Truist Financial (TFC.N) have been placed on review for potential downgrades.</p>
<h2>Stress in the Banking Sector</h2>
<p>As reported by <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/moodys-downgrades-10-us-banks-warns-possible-cuts-others-2023-08-08/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Reuters</a></em> on Tuesday, Moody’s note highlighted “profitability pressures” at many banks that are expected to hinder their ability to generate further capital. Banks downgraded by the firm include M&amp;T Bank (MTB.N), Pinnacle Financial Partners (PNFP.O), Prosperity Bank, and BOK Financial Corp (BOKF.O).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, high exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) poses a significant risk due to the nation’s high-interest rate environment. Last month, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-loses-30k-as-us-federal-reserve-hikes-interest-rates-by-another-25bps-this-weeks-crypto-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">rose</a> its benchmark rate to between 5.25% and 5.5% – its highest level since January 2001.</p>
<p>&#8220;This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate portfolios,” the note added.</p>
<p>According to Federal Reserve survey data from last week, U.S. banks reported both weaker loan demand and tighter credit standards in Q2.</p>
<p>The U.S. banking sector has already been plagued by a crisis of confidence this year, with Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank collectively collapsing in March. The latter fell as customers rushed for the exits when the bank reported that it had realized a $1.8 billion loss on its long-term bond portfolio.</p>
<p>Indeed, Moody’s warned that U.S. banks sitting on high unrealized losses face similar risks related to a crisis of confidence, especially given today’s high-interest rate environment.</p>
<h2>Government Gets Downgraded</h2>
<p>High rates are part of what has prompted Fitch Ratings – another top-rated agency – to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fitch-us-ratings-downgrade-is-fine-for-bitcoin-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">downgrade</a> the U.S. government&#8217;s credit to AA+ as of last month, away from the upper echelon shared with international competitors.</p>
<p>Given the country’s high debt-to-GDP ratio, the agency noted that the country would start struggling to manage growing interest payments as it rolled over existing debt at a higher borrowing rate.</p>
<p>The government’s annual interest payments have skyrocketed since last year and now approach $1 trillion. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, has told followers to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/novogratz-advises-investors-to-buy-bitcoin-as-federal-interest-payments-skyrocket/" data-wpel-link="internal">buy Bitcoin</a> in response.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Circle is directing its attention to international markets where there is a rising trend in adoption.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stablecoin issuer Circle is a US-based company, and 70% of its USDC adoption originates from non-US regions.</p>
<p>According to the estimations of Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, some of the fastest growing areas are emerging and developing markets, which are not in the country that has been facing severe regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Not Fixated on US</h2>
<p>Allaire took to X (formerly Twitter) to <a href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1688672056898928640" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">reveal</a> observing &#8220;strong progress&#8221; across Asia, LATAM, and Africa, highlighting the demand for &#8220;safe, transparent digital dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Circle isn&#8217;t the only company that has demonstrated not being particularly fixated on the US ecosystem. In fact, Tether&#8217;s chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, also echoed a similar sentiment when he earlier revealed the stablecoin company&#8217;s aim to position USDT as &#8220;a safe tool for emerging markets and developing countries, a life-life for many communities that are suffering from a heavy devaluation of their national currencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allaire&#8217;s remarks coincide with a reduction in the supply of the USDC stablecoin since the start of 2023 as a result of diminishing demand and a rise in redemptions. With redemptions surpassing issuance, concerns over USDC&#8217;s liquidity surfaced again. The Circle CEO also <a href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1688667728737959937" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">addressed</a> the situation and confirmed issuing $5 billion worth of USDC and redeeming $6.6 billion worth of USDC.</p>
<p>Doubling down on Circle&#8217;s expansion, Allaire revealed that the stablecoin issuer company was actively collaborating with several reputable financial institutions across key global regions.</p>
<h2>Shift in Stablecoin Landscape</h2>
<p>USDC has had a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circles-usdc-outflows-surpassed-10b-since-svb-collapse-tether-dominance-rises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">rocky start</a> shedding over 43% since the beginning of the year. The stablecoin, however, held up its market cap above $26 billion over the past few weeks following a brief slump below the level. This is despite Binance selling a significant chunk of the token, as recently revealed by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>The unexpected <a href="https://protos.com/brian-armstrong-revealed-binance-sold-all-its-usdc-in-coinbase-earnings-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">comment</a> by the exec came during Coinbase&#8217;s second-quarter earnings, during which he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Binance actually moved some of their funds from USDC into another stablecoin. I think the data we have in the last six or seven weeks, I believe, that the USDC market cap is up net of that. And so that’s an important data point.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A lookout for a different stablecoin follows the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/new-york-regulator-reportedly-stops-paxos-from-issuing-busd-but-is-it-just-fud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">order</a> to stop issuing the dollar-pegged BUSD stablecoin. Binance shifted its focus to TrueUSD (TUSD) as a solution for its stablecoin requirements. But TUSD lost its peg, and its issuance ceased by June 10th.</p>
<p>The rise of FDUSD, on the other hand, caught the attention of Tether&#8217;s Ardoino, who observed that USDT faced downward pressure, and its primary competitor, USDC, which is experienced significant redemptions instead of gaining from such a situation.</p>
<p>The change in the stablecoin landscape is further validated by this week&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-launches-usd-stablecoin-for-payments-and-transfers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launch</a> of PYUSD by global payments giant PayPal.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[CoinsPaid said that blockchain scoring proved ineffective against money laundering of stolen funds. 
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estonian crypto-payments service provider CoinsPaid found that the notorious hacking group Lazarus spent six months tracking and studying the platform before finally attacking on July 22nd.</p>
<p>ConsPaid collaborated with cybersecurity firm Match Systems to track the perpetrators&#8217; steps minute by minute, as well as identify what services and platforms were used to launder the funds. In a press release shared with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the platform said that Lazarus Group spent half a year trying to infiltrate the CoinsPaid systems and find vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Orchestrating $37.3M Theft</h2>
<p>Since March, CoinsPaid revealed having been hit by constant unsuccessful attacks of various kinds, ranging from social engineering to DDos and BruteForce. During the same period, key engineers of the company were approached by an entity purporting to be a Ukrainian crypto-processing startup presenting a set of technical infrastructure-related inquiries. This interaction was corroborated by three key developers within CoinsPaid.</p>
<p>In April and May, CoinsPaid encountered four significant assaults targeting its systems which sought unauthorized access to the accounts belonging to both the company&#8217;s employees as well as its clients. The spam and phishing activities against the team members were constant and highly aggressive, the press release stated.</p>
<p>The following month of June and July witnessed the orchestration of a malicious campaign that involved a combination of bribing and fictitious employment offers, all directed at crucial personnel within the company.</p>
<p>The attacker launched a meticulously planned and executed assault against the CoinsPaid infrastructure and applications on July 7th. The attack, which unfolded between 20:48 and 21:42, demonstrated an unprecedented surge in network activity, recording an engagement of over 150,000 distinct IP addresses.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hacker_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265133" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hacker_cover.jpg" alt="hacker_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hacker_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hacker_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hacker_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hacker_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hacker_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Tracing the Attack</h2>
<p>The primary objective of the culprits was to deceive a key staff member into installing software, enabling them to establish remote control over a computer by infiltrating and accessing CoinsPaid&#8217;s internal systems. Despite six months of unsuccessful attempts, the attackers eventually managed to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinspaid-suspects-north-koreas-lazarus-group-of-orchestrating-37-3m-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">breach</a> its infrastructure on July 22nd which resulted in the loss of $37.5 million.</p>
<p>The attackers used highly sophisticated and vigorous social engineering techniques to gain access to an employee&#8217;s computer. Recruiters from crypto companies reached out to CoinsPaid employees via LinkedIn and various Messengers, offering enticingly high salaries.</p>
<p>After one of its employees responded to a job offer posing to be Crypto.com, they received a test assignment that required the installation of an application with malicious code. Upon opening the test task, the employee&#8217;s profiles and keys were stolen from the computer to set up a connection with CoinsPaid&#8217;s infrastructure.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The access enabled the hackers to create authorized requests to withdraw funds from CoinsPaid hot wallets. But the perpetrators were not able to breach the hot wallets and acquire private keys to access funds directly. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Internal security measures triggered the alarm system and allowed us to swiftly stop the malicious activity and throw the hackers out of the company&#8217;s perimeter.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>CoinsPaid further stated that despite crypto companies complying with the KYC measures and using blockchain risk scoring systems to detect suspicious activity, the perpetrators still managed to launder the stolen funds successfully.</p>
<p>The company pointed fingers at the Lazarus group since the hackers used similar tactics in the Atomic Wallet <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hacked-largest-victim-reportedly-lost-2-8m-usdt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">heist</a>.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cypher Protocol, a Solana-based futures DEX, has been forced to pause its smart contract in the wake of an exploit that resulted in a loss of more than $1 million.</p>
<h2>The Why</h2>
<p>Late last night, Cypher’s devs announced that they had suffered a “security incident”, resulting in the need to pause their smart contract until a post-mortem was carried out. An appeal to the hacker was also made, promising a discussion on the next steps should the bad actor care to reply.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Cypher has has experienced an exploit/security incident. The smart contract has been frozen.</p>
<p>The team is currently working with individuals and investigating</p>
<p>To the hacker: We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps.</p>
<p>— cypher ©&#xfe0f; (@cypher_protocol) <a href="https://twitter.com/cypher_protocol/status/1688641036476731393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The exchange’s mission, which is proudly stated in Cypher Protocol’s Twitter bio, was also cause for mirth.</p>
<p>However, the irony doesn’t stop there. It turns out that the hack <a href="https://twitter.com/mtndao/status/1687917521247363072" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">occurred</a> during mtnDAO, a hackathon co-hosted by Cypher Protocol and Marginfi, another Solana-based project.</p>
<p>It appears we have a winner – although not by popular vote.</p>
<p>The exploit drained over 38k SOL tokens and more than 123k USDC, adding up to a total of $1,035,203 in ill-begotten gains.</p>
<p>In a rather perplexing move for the hacker, Binance and KuCoin were chosen for <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/4ZqYRfvPePGLpZCb6t1iq7gNMUwsrkcQoSAiDHq9gEYUve9t3b598Qf63uErtaoB1onScKf7VcmM3u8qVbAd3XK6" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">cashing</a> out. By choosing big exchanges with robust cybersecurity teams instead of the well-known crypto mixer route, the hacker runs a much bigger risk of being caught. However, it’s also possible that the exploit was carried out as an impromptu addition to the hackathon. If the funds are meant to be returned, anonymity may not matter to the exploiter as much.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the attack may have been carried out by someone in a country who does not cooperate with Western law enforcement, in which case ease of access to liquidity provided by big CEXs may be the only thing that matters.</p>
<h2>Reaching Out Via NFTs.</h2>
<p>Since the attack, users have been reaching out to the hacker by sending NFTs with brisk messages to the address involved.</p>
<p>Some of these messages are simple <a href="https://solscan.io/token/BhgF2oFyy3TDdMqK2XchMS2Q76TsdRw9ZhnMErdkEPRi" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">appeals to morality</a>.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back.”</em></p>
<p>However, other users opted for a terser “<em>Give it</em> <a href="https://solscan.io/token/BhgF2oFyy3TDdMqK2XchMS2Q76TsdRw9ZhnMErdkEPRi" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><em>back</em></a>,<em> you sh*tlord</em>”.</p>
<p>Although the size of the exploit is dwarfed by previous <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/thousands-of-wallets-compromised-in-ongoing-solana-based-hack/" data-wpel-link="internal">attacks</a> on the Solana network, a hack of this size can be a sink-or-swim deal for smaller projects like Cypher Protocol. It remains to be seen what the devs uncover about the attack and if a recovery is possible.</p>
