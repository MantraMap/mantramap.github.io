<p class="s8">Upward and downward trends are terms commonly associated with asset trading, including cryptocurrencies. As the name suggests, upward trends mark the movement of an asset in a positive direction, while downwards means the opposite.</p>
<p class="s8">Lately, crypto sensation, Uwerx has been moving in an upward trend. What is Uwerx, and why is everyone talking about it?</p>
<p class="s8">This article will discuss Uwerx and its potential to see if it can perform just as or even better than popular tokens like The Graph (GRT) and ImmutableX (IMX).</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx (WERX) The Profit Magnet</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx has been the buzz in the past few weeks. As it enters its fourth presale stage, the team is prepping the project ahead of the launch date with some changes. Instead of the initially proposed 5%, Uwerx will reduce transaction fees to just 1%. The WERX token price increased to $0.0225 on 10th of May (18:00 UTC). The launch price will shift slightly from its initial price of $0.09-$0.11 to $0.095-$0.115</p>
<p class="s8">The developers are excited and believe these changes will make users confident. As the project presale ends, the team will initiate a 25-year liquidity lock on developers&rsquo; tokens to prevent rug pull. They will also renounce smart contract ownership when the project lists on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p class="s8">This move is novel and is among the reasons Uwerx is attracting so much attention. An additional 1% has also been released by the team to buyers, bringing their token allocation to just 7%.</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx believes it should accommodate the fast-expanding freelance market, as reports show that almost 80% of large cooperations plan to increase their dependency on freelancers by 2031. </p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx will support a plethora of features on its network in anticipation of its large user base. Some of these features will include a certified escrow payment system, incentive packages to encourage productivity, and a strict no-third-party policy on clients.</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx will likely list on well-known exchanges soon thanks to help from SolidProof and InterFiNetwork, the audit approving bodies. The hard-cap presale will end on the last day of July 2023. The team has set next week as the launch date for its Alpha version of the project. According to the team, this Alpha version will increase productivity and promote transparency.</p>
<p class="s8">Approximately 427,500,000 million WERX tokens have been released for presale, and the project has completed its first, second, and third presale stages without a hitch. We recommend purchasing now as prices could reach $1.45 by Q3-Q4 2023 and $2.30 by Q1-Q2 2024.</p>
<p class="s8">Can You Keep Up with The Graph (GRT)?</p>
<p class="s8">In the past week, The Graph (GRT) has decreased by almost 8.15%, putting its current price at $0.13 and market cap at $1.1 billion. A price depreciation of 1.40% in the past two days might suggest a future decline in price. However, analysts remain confident it will reach $0.24 by Q1 2024.</p>
<p class="s8">The Graph (GRT) is an Ethereum-based global data bank that indexes and accesses blockchain data from storage networks. The platform can quickly, securely, and reliably organize data stored on its network through its data sorting protocol called Subgraph. Eventually, data stored on The Graph (GRT) can be categorized, transformed, and shared across various dApps.</p>
<p class="s8">The Graph (GRT) blockchain is run by an open network of users. With the aid of these users comprised of indexers, curators, and delegators, the platform can supply and organize data and even provide security to the network.</p>
<p class="s8">Join the ImmutableX (IMX) Train</p>
<p class="s8">After taking a significant blow of almost 14.18%, ImmutableX (IMX) is currently at $0.86 and has a market cap of $828,256,522. This Ethereum-based Layer-2 blockchain has shown tremendous growth in the past several months, and according to analysts, it could experience a bullish run and hit $1.30 by Q1 2024.</p>
<p class="s8">Through ImmutableX (IMX), users can mint, sell, and trade NFT assets with little training or knowledge. It offers instant trade confirmations, high-security layers, and low gas fees. NFTs built on the ImmutableX (IMX) platform can be sold or bought on any NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s8">Gamers and developers can instantly customize their favorite characters as digital assets and access trades, games, and applications. The platform is powered by a next-gen interface called Starkey. Starkey will provide additional levels of security and scalability to the network.</p>
<p class="s8">Indicators show that The Graph (GRT) and ImmuatbleX (IMX) might be profitable in the short term, but Uwerx has better long-term profit potential. </p>
