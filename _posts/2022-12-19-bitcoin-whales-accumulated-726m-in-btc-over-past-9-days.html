<p>After 14 months of dumping, BTC whales are at last beginning to accumulate.</p>
<p>According to the mainstream media, social media, and just about any other outlet, bitcoin is dying and will probably sink to new depths and might never recover.</p>
<p>However, according to behaviour analyst platform Santiment, bitcoin is possibly reaching a bottom - perhaps not in price yet, but at least as far as accumulation by whales is concerned.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ðŸ¤¯ Breaking: #Bitcoin's addresses holding between 100 to 10,000 $BTC have bought $726m in $BTC the past 9 days. Meanwhile, #stablecoin assets like $USDT, $BUSD, &amp; $DAI are also being bought quickly. This is a recipe for good things.

<p>There are 159 new addresses in only the last 3 weeks that hold between 100 to 10,000 BTC, and it is stated that this is the fastest growth in this particular address amount in the last 10 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Santiment also reports that stablecoins such as USDT, BUSD, and DAI are being bought up. &ldquo;Massive jumps&rdquo; in the USDT and BUSD wallets that contain from $100k to $10m have been seen.</p>

Binance USD's key addresses have collectively accumulated $104.9 million more in buying power in just the past 3 days, a +9% increase to what they were holding before December 10, 2022"
</li>
</ul>
<p>The $100k to $10m wallet addresses are key according to Santiment, and they cite the increases as &ldquo;absolutely massive upswings&rdquo;. The report ends by saying that &ldquo;anything can happen with prices&rdquo; and gives the reasons as the continuing FTX fallout, the Russia/Ukraine conflict, and covid.</p>
