<p>Former president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has unveiled an NFT collection on his official Truth Social account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection features the former president in a number of avatars, such as a superhero, an astronaut, and a Nascar racing driver.&nbsp;</p>
The Donald Trump NFT Collection&nbsp;
<p>Donald Trump has added another feather to his cap. The former president, known for launching branded products, has now launched an exclusive NFT collection. Mr. Trump had triggered considerable speculation earlier in the week when he stated that he would be making a &ldquo;major announcement.&rdquo; Many expected him to name a running mate for his presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump announced the launch of the exclusive NFT collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection features Mr. Trump in several avatars, such as an astronaut and a Nascar driver. Mr. Trump stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career. It would make a great Christmas gift. Don&rsquo;t Wait. They will be gone, I believe, very quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trump posted a clip featuring an animated version of himself in front of the Trump Tower in New York. The character rips open his shirt, revealing a superhero costume emblazoned with the letter T, as lasers shoot out from his eyes. The cards were described as similar to baseball cards but much more exciting. The NFTs will be priced at $99 each, and buyers will also be able to enter a sweepstake and stand the chance of winning a gala dinner or a game of golf with Mr. Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFTs will be minted on the Polygon blockchain, with 45,000 NFTs created during the initial run of the collection, according to its official website.&nbsp;</p>
Move Roundly Criticized&nbsp;
<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s announcement was roundly criticized across social media, with several high-profile Republicans also speaking out. Right-wing media commentator and former chief strategist for Mr. Trump, Steve Bannon, stated on his podcast,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this anymore. Anyone involved in the project &ldquo;ought to be fired today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, taking a jibe at Mr. Trump, stated on Twitter that he had a few major announcements of his own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had some MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS the last couple of weeks, too&hellip; Inflation&rsquo;s easing. I just signed the Respect for Marriage Act. We brought Brittney Griner home Gas prices are lower than a year ago 10,000 new high-paying jobs in Arizona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Others speculated that the NFT collection was to help fund the numerous legal battles that Mr. Trump is currently facing. The official website for the collection states that the funds generated through the collection would not be used towards the presidential campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These Digital Trading Cards are not political and have nothing to do with any political campaign. NFT INT LLC is not owned, managed, or controlled by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization, CIC Digital LLC, or any of their respective principals or affiliates.&rdquo;</p>

Previously Critical Of Crypto&nbsp;
<p>Donald Trump has previously held not-so-favorable views about the crypto space and digital assets. He stated that he was very wary of Bitcoin because of the threat posed to the US Dollar, going as far as to say that he viewed the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency as a scam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin just seems like a scam&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like it because it is another currency competing against the dollar. Essentially it&rsquo;s a currency competing against the dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That is what I have always said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Additionally, Melania Trump has also tried her hand at NFTs, although her NFT auction flopped in a big way, and had to deny claims that she had to purchase her own NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
