<p>London, United Kingdom, August 21st, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiba Memu, a dynamic new cryptocurrency meme coin supported by AI, is causing a stir as its presale surpasses the impressive $2 million fundraising milestone. This remarkable achievement was further spurred by the recent news it would list on BitMart, a renowned crypto exchange, all within the first month of the presale's launch.</p>
<p>The inception of the Shiba Memu AI stems from the team's previous experiences with exorbitant marketing agency fees. This motivated Shiba Memu to develop a self-promoting AI solution capable of adapting to various practical applications.</p>
<p>Presently at $0.021700 per token, Shiba Memu's price experiences scheduled increments every 24 hours due to the team's well-crafted smart contract. This mechanism is particularly appealing to presale supporters, as it ensures that the token purchase price remains lower than the eventual listing price on exchanges. For instance, if purchased today at $0.021700, the increase by the end of the 60-day presale would amount to 10%.</p>
<p>Those interested can acquire SHMU tokens via the official Shiba Memu website.</p>
<p>The Surge of Shiba Memu: Unleashing AI Potential</p>
<p>Shiba Memu's remarkable success can be attributed to its untapped AI potential.

It tailors its promotions accordingly, transforming the brand from a simple cute dog meme to an amusing and engaging one, infused with a sharp sense of humor. The project's forthcoming AI dashboards scheduled for Q4 further stimulate investor interest in meme coins with tangible utility.</p>
<p>The project's tokenomics demonstrate a robust structure, with 85% of tokens allocated to the presale, 10% to exchange listing liquidity, and 5% to development. This allocation empowers SHMU holders to actively participate in the future development of the dApp.</p>
