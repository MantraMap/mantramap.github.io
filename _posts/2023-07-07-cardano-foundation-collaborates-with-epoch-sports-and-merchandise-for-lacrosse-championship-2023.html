The limited run of commemorative lacrosse jerseys showcases a near-field communication (NFC) Epoch branded patch. This patch includes a digital jersey version embedded as a non-fungible token (NFT). By leveraging this technology, the physical garment becomes intrinsically connected to a secure blockchain, providing proof of the jersey&#8217;s authenticity. Epoch Sports and Merchandise have outlined their plans to release the remaining NFC-enabled Commemorative Jerseys, accompanied by connected NFTs, on the official web store of the 2023 World Lacrosse Championship. The NFC patches incorporated into the jerseys serve a dual purpose. They also grant the consumers access to a range of exclusive rewards and special offers. Cardano&#8217;s Collaboration Aims To Enhance IP Protection And Tackle Counterfeiting The technical collaboration between the Cardano Foundation, Epoch Sports, and Merchandise aims to promote blockchain adoption within the licensed merchandise industry while bolstering the protection of licensed intellectual property (IP). By securely linking NFC chips to a blockchain record in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), traditional licensed IP hologram tags on sports apparel will be replaced. According to the press release, this guarantees authenticity for purchasers and empowers license owners to combat counterfeiting effectively. For real-time visualization of all on-chain records on the Cardano blockchain, Pool.pm serves as a reference tool. Pool.pm provides an overview of the blockchain, allowing users to access the on-chain records. Frederik Gregaard, the CEO of the Cardano Foundation, said: Our work with Merchandise and Epoch Sports showcases the utility and accessibility of Cardano’s blockchain: any merchant can adopt blockchain solutions to give reassurance and confidence to customers that they are buying genuine articles. Diversifying blockchain adoption is a core part of the Cardano Foundation mission, and it’s fantastic to see more and more companies putting blockchain solutions into practice. Merchandise&#8217;s CEO, Alex Phelan, expressed enthusiasm about collaborating with the Cardano Foundation, highlighting it as a milestone in the licensed apparel industry. He emphasized that the partnership sets new intellectual property protection benchmarks and fosters fan engagement.
