					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin (LTC) is still trending low like the rest of the cryptocurrency market but one thing that separates the altcoin from the others is its obvious bullish case. Unlike the rest of the market, Litecoin looks set for another rally which will likely be propelled forward by the next halving. Litecoin Halving Presents Bullish Scenario Just like Bitcoin, the Litecoin halving happens every four years and cuts block rewards by 50%. The aim of this halving is to reduce the amount of new supply flowing into the market. And as demand rises, there is less supply to meet this demand, thus leading to scarcity and a surge in prices.

This halving, like the ones before it, carries the same promise of a rally for the digital asset. The last halving in 2019 saw LTC’s price bottom out around $62 and then rally to a local peak of $80 in the same month. LTC halving will happen in August &#124; Source: Nicehash If this year’s halving stays true to this trend, then the digital asset should be seeing some upside in the coming months. This could result in LTC clearing the $100 level once more as investors prep for the next leg-up. A 20% upside is attainable at this point, especially with the halving expected to happen in early August. So more than likely, the buyers will dominate the market for the next two months, leading to rising prices for Litecoin. LTC Outlook For 2023 Presently, the crypto market is seeing muted momentum as investors remain indecisive. For Litecoin, the upcoming halving remains a bullish event but the prospects for the months following the halving event do not look good given historical performances. Previous performance paint bull case for LTC &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com After each halving, LTC has seen a reversal in sentiment following the initial surge and the subsequent crashes have been more brutal than the uptrends. For example in 2019, LTC’s price crashed almost 50% in the month of September, one month after the halving was completed. This was because the bull market was yet to begin and the cryptocurrency fell back into lockstep with the rest of the market again.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) current sideways price action has left investors wondering what the future holds for the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency. The upcoming interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve (Fed) may pose the next big challenge for Bitcoin, according to the crypto market analysis firm Blofin Academy. Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB) Fallout: 70% Price Drop, But These Charts Reveal Its True Value Is Bitcoin Ready For The Heat Of Interest Rate Hikes? The US economy has shown considerable resilience in recent months, prompting the Fed to consider raising interest rates to prevent inflation. However, this could be bad news for the crypto market, as higher interest rates tend to make traditional investments more attractive, potentially leading to a decrease in demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The correlation between interest rates and Bitcoin&#8217;s price action has been observed in the past. When interest rates rise, investors tend to move their money into traditional investment vehicles such as stocks and bonds, leading to a decrease in demand for cryptocurrencies. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that Bitcoin has often been viewed as a hedge against inflation, which means that it could still hold some appeal for investors during times of economic uncertainty.  The next scheduled Fed meeting is set to take place on June 14, 2023, where the central bank will likely discuss the possibility of raising interest rates in response to the current state of the US economy.  Macro Determinants Leave Crypto Traders Waiting Noelle Acheson, owner of the &#8220;Crypto Is Macro Now&#8221; newsletter, has cautioned against investors piling into the crypto market at this time. While the upside potential for Bitcoin remains significant, Acheson suggests that there is currently no compelling reason for investors to take on additional risk. According to Acheson, there are few macro determinants at the moment, such as debt limit negotiations and Fed rate policy, which are leaving investors waiting for more clarity before making any major investment decisions. As a result, there is a sense of caution in the market as traders wait to see how these macro factors will play out. Despite the lack of clarity, Acheson notes that there is not much reason for existing crypto holders to sell their holdings. This suggests that the current wait-and-see period is not necessarily a sign of bearish sentiment in the market, but rather a period of caution as investors await more information. Acheson also notes that there may be some downside movement in the near term, but the belief in a potential rally is not strong enough to warrant the possibility of missing out on any potential gains. As a result, there has been some buying and selling in the market, but not enough to significantly increase volatility despite low volumes and liquidity. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,700, reflecting a 1.2% increase over the last 24 hours. However, the 50-day Moving Average (MA) has placed the largest cryptocurrency in a narrow range between $26,200 and $26,800. This means that Bitcoin may struggle to surpass its current trading range in the near term, as the 50-day MA is currently situated at the upper end of this range on the 1-hour chart, making it a challenging level to breach. While Bitcoin has experienced some upside movements in recent weeks, the current trading range suggests that further gains may be limited until there is a significant shift in market sentiment or the emergence of a bullish catalyst.

					<description><![CDATA[Politicians in the United States will likely strike a deal and raise the government’s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling for two more years. Amid this debate, the price of Bitcoin is firm but lower, tracking below the psychological $30,000 level as bulls recover after posting sharp losses mid-this week. The Debt Ceiling Debate There are reports that there will be more discretionary spending on the military and veterans with the reduction of other sectors. Moreover, there are unconfirmed reports that the Biden administration will likely not fund the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to boost collection, as laid out earlier. Instead, the immediate focus will be to hire more auditors and target wealthy citizens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up After Fed Rate Reveal, Correlation With Stocks Over? There are concerns that the Treasury Department and the United States government will default on their obligation as soon as the first half of June 2023. Even though highly unlikely, as the Treasury Department has said it will liquidate $119 billion of debt on that day, the market is watching how discussions pan out. Bitcoin is firming up after losses on May 24. As a deal is reportedly struck and consensus reached, politicians would once again lift the debt ceiling, sending mixed signals to the economy. Unlike in previous years when top cryptocurrencies were decoupled from the mainstream economy, things have changed as Bitcoin’s prominence rises. Will Bitcoin Benefit? BTC prices will likely rally if there is an instance of default brought about by politicians disagreeing on the way forward. On the reverse side, a deal that addresses concerns brought by the negotiating parties could signal confidence in the economy despite more debt on the table. This averts a crisis and keeps operations running, removing uncertainty and stabilizing the economy. In that case, the USD could strengthen, possibly reversing gains by Bitcoin bulls in the last two trading days. Still, the crypto community remains bullish on Bitcoin considering macroeconomic events and next year’s halving. After months of steady interest rate hikes, the United States Federal Reserve could slow down rate increments in the next meeting in mid-June. Their action could support the commodities and securities markets.

Miners are special nodes tasked with confirming transactions and decentralizing the network. If past price action can be used to predict future formations, BTC&#8217;s prospects look positive. Before the rally of 2020 to 2021, BTC prices bottomed up in 2018 and rose in 2019 before the halving event 2020. The same pattern may be repeated through to 2024 when Bitcoin halving occurs.

					<description><![CDATA[Arbitrum (ARB) has been making waves in the crypto world as it recently became the 4th largest ecosystem in the market. Despite experiencing a sharp decline of 70% since its airdrop, Arbitrum’s native token has continued to gain attention from investors, currently trading around $1.158, down from $1.1808 on April 18th. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Continues Downward Trend As Bears Maintain Control Arbitrum Defies The Odds According to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) researcher Deebs, Arbitrum has emerged as a major player in the crypto market, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) soaring to an impressive $2.3 billion. This puts it in 4th position by TVL, surpassing many of its competitors.  Additionally, since the launch of Arbitrum, the value of stablecoins has grown by over $500 million in just two months. At its peak, the network&#8217;s active user base reached over 600,000, surpassing Optimism (OP), a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain built by Ethereum developers, and nearly overtaking the blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications Solana (SOL).  Despite these impressive metrics, ARB’s price has experienced a significant drop of 70% since its airdrop and has had very little positive price action since. However, DeFi researcher Deebs believes that this dip in price may be a sign of a hidden gem in the crypto market. One of the main factors that make Arbitrum an attractive investment opportunity is its high TVL, user base, and liquidity. In fact, since its launch, Arbitrum has maintained the highest liquidity of all Layer 2 (L2) networks and is the third highest of all chains on DeFi Llama. Furthermore, while many other chains have a market capitalization to TVL ratio above 1, Arbitrum boasts one of the smallest ratios at 0.6. This means that the potential price upside for ARB is significantly higher than its competitors, making it an enticing investment opportunity for those looking for long-term gains. Additionally, ARB&#8217;s technology has been praised for its ability to address some of the key issues facing the crypto industry, such as scalability and high transaction fees. ARB&#8217;s use of cutting-edge technology such as Optimistic Rollups provides a solution to these problems, making it an attractive option for investors looking for a reliable network with great potential. Another positive sign for ARB is the amount of support it has received from major players in the crypto industry.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arbitrum (ARB) has been making waves in the crypto world as it recently became the 4th largest ecosystem in the market. Despite experiencing a sharp decline of 70% since its airdrop, Arbitrum’s native token has continued to gain attention from investors, currently trading around $1.158, down from $1.1808 on April 18th.</p>

<h2>Arbitrum Defies The Odds</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Deebs_DeFi/status/1662065395212378112?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According </a>to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) researcher Deebs, Arbitrum has emerged as a major player in the crypto market, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) soaring to an impressive $2.3 billion. This puts it in 4th position by TVL, surpassing many of its competitors. </p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-535209" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXrGbacAAIUQ8.png" alt="Arbitrum" width="777" height="534" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXrGbacAAIUQ8.png 777w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXrGbacAAIUQ8-460x316.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXrGbacAAIUQ8-768x528.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXrGbacAAIUQ8-750x515.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"/>
<p>Additionally, since the launch of Arbitrum, the value of stablecoins has grown by over $500 million in just two months. At its peak, the network&#8217;s active user base reached over 600,000, surpassing Optimism (OP), a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain built by Ethereum developers, and nearly overtaking the blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications Solana (SOL). </p>
<p>Despite these impressive metrics, ARB’s price has experienced a significant drop of 70% since its airdrop and has had very little positive price action since. However, DeFi researcher Deebs believes that this dip in price may be a sign of a hidden gem in the crypto market.</p>
<p>One of the main factors that make Arbitrum an attractive investment opportunity is its high TVL, user base, and liquidity. In fact, since its launch, Arbitrum has maintained the highest liquidity of all Layer 2 (L2) networks and is the third highest of all chains on DeFi Llama.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-535210" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXsbwaIAAwKEi.png" alt="Arbitrum" width="775" height="545" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXsbwaIAAwKEi.png 775w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXsbwaIAAwKEi-460x323.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXsbwaIAAwKEi-768x540.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FxDXsbwaIAAwKEi-750x527.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px"/>
<p>Furthermore, while many other chains have a market capitalization to TVL ratio above 1, Arbitrum boasts one of the smallest ratios at 0.6. This means that the potential price upside for ARB is significantly higher than its competitors, making it an enticing investment opportunity for those looking for long-term gains.</p>
<p>Additionally, ARB&#8217;s technology has been praised for its ability to address some of the key issues facing the crypto industry, such as scalability and high transaction fees. ARB&#8217;s use of cutting-edge technology such as Optimistic Rollups provides a solution to these problems, making it an attractive option for investors looking for a reliable network with great potential.</p>
<p>Another positive sign for ARB is the amount of support it has received from major players in the crypto industry. This includes partnerships with well-known crypto projects such as Uniswap, Aave, and Chainlink. These collaborations demonstrate that the industry recognizes the value of ARB&#8217;s technology and the potential it holds for the future of decentralized finance.</p>

<p>Overall, despite the recent drop in price, ARB&#8217;s strong fundamentals and growing network usage suggest that it is a hidden gem in the crypto market. Its partnerships with major players in the industry, as well as its innovative technology, make it a promising investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the potential of decentralized finance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The price of Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume, is down roughly 35% from Q1 2023 peaks. Even so, on-chain data from Etherscan shows that there has been a steady increase in the number of UNI holders in the past two days. As of May 13, there were 369,646 UNI holders. Since then, the number has increased to over 370,100 as of May 26. During this time, UNI prices have remained stable but relatively high. Based on the UNIUSDT chart, the prices have found support around $4.9. However, prices have increased by approximately 10% over the past two weeks, rising to $5.4. Although the number of UNI holders may not directly affect the prices, there is a clear correlation between the demand for UNI and the increase in token prices. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Continues Downward Trend As Bears Maintain Control Several factors could have provided tailwinds for UNI, the governance token of Uniswap.  Apple Jail Break On May 23, Uniswap’s mobile wallet was released from what Uniswap Labs, the team maintaining Uniswap, said was “Apple jail.”  With this jailbreak, users can download the Uniswap Wallet, that’s non-custodial like MetaMask.  Through this wallet, users can buy and sell various supported cryptocurrencies.  This announcement is bullish because as more users opt for Uniswap Wallet, the demand for the decentralized exchange could rise, increasing its dominance and stature.  While MetaMask remains the most dominant Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallet enabling the storing and trading of various tokens, even using processors like PayPal, the popularity of Uniswap could see Uniswap Wallet gnaw market share.  Presently, Uniswap Labs said their wallet could support the trading of tokens across Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. Uniswap To Launch On Base? Earlier on, the Uniswap contributors proposed the deployment of the DEX v3 on Coinbase’s Base.  Among supporters of this proposal is GFX Labs, one of the largest UNI holders and supporters of Uniswap’s expansion to other chains. Recently, GFX Labs voted for the launch of the DEX on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and MoonBeam.  Even so, before voting starts, the proposal will undergo a “temperature check-up” to gauge community support. If there is majority support, it will proceed to the next step. Uniswap v3 is the latest iteration of the DEX, introducing the concept of concentrated liquidity for higher capital efficiency and more return on investment (ROI) for liquidity providers.  Base is a layer-2, open-source, and EVM-compatible platform by Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

					<description><![CDATA[Toncoin (TON) has experienced a negative price decline, resulting in a bearish sentiment among investors of the altcoin. TON has been exhibiting a bearish strength on a monthly timeframe, based on data from CoinMarketCap.  Within the last 30-Day trading session, the asset is down by 15,67%, indicating a high bearish strength with low buying pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance As of the time of writing, the asset is experiencing a decline in value, as it’s down today by 2.76%. This downward trend has resulted in the asset, TON, reaching a low point of $1.91.  The decrease in value reflects a temporary setback in the market, indicating a decrease in investor confidence. It also detects a shift in the supply and demand dynamics surrounding the asset. Toncoin (TON) Bears Maintained Their Positions Toncoin (TON) witnessed a sharp price decline on May 23, from $2.03 to its present value of $1.89. This price decline represents a loss of 6.89%. This decline reflects the dominance of bearish sentiment in the market, which shows a lack of investor confidence and a shift in the supply and demand dynamics. According to the market sentiment indicator, the current market sentiment is bearish, while the Fear &#38; Greed index value is a neutral 49. Notably, a Fear &#38; Greed index value below 50 points to an increase in bearish momentum. Conversely, an important resistance level is noted at $2.080, representing a significant hurdle for potential upward movement.  Toncoin trades below the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The SMAs formed a Death Cross in the TON market on May 21, 2023.  This confirms the bearish sentiment present in the market, indicating a potential sell signal and further price decline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum oscillator value is 40.98 and points downwards. RSI is a popular indicator showing whether a cryptocurrency is oversold or overbought.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level If TON RSI drops below 30, it may ignite high selling pressure and further price decline. TON Demand Index and Bollinger Bands Signals Bearish Activities The TON/USDT trading pair demand index is at -0.449, suggesting relatively weak demand for the asset in the market. Note that a demand index below zero is generally considered a lack of buying pressure. It also indicates that the selling pressure outweighs the buying interest. In addition, the asset is heading toward the lower part of the Bollinger Bands indicator. This suggests an increase in selling pressure and high bearish momentum.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent note, JPMorgan strategists have made a prediction, suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar and revisit its former trading price of $45,000 due to the rising price of gold. This prediction comes amid Bitcoin&#8217;s price action of a blend of bulls and bears in the past week. Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen a 2.1% gain with a current trading price above $26,000. The current surge comes after Bitcoin previously fall that dropped its price below its previously ranging market price of $28,000. Bitcoin And Gold: A Correlation Bitcoin and gold have often been regarded as alternative investments by investors, and their prices have displayed a tendency to move in tandem. Given this, JPMorgan analysts note that the current gold price, hovering near $2,000 per ounce, implies a Bitcoin price of $45,000. This assumption is based on the idea that BTC will reach a similar standing as gold in the portfolios of private investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles To Recover and Remains Vulnerable To Fresh Decline JP Morgan wrote in a note: With the gold price rising above $2,000, the value of gold held for investment purposes outside central banks is currently valued at around [$3 trillion]. In turn, this implies a $45,000 price for bitcoin under the assumption that bitcoin equalizes gold in private investors&#8217; portfolios in risk capital or [volume]-adjusted terms. One key factor contributing to JPMorgan&#8217;s optimistic prediction is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled to take place between April and May 2024. The halving mechanism reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are produced, effectively doubling the production cost. The JPMorgan strategists believe this event will push Bitcoin&#8217;s production cost to approximately $40,000, acting as a lower bound and potentially driving the price upward. Drawing from historical data, JPMorgan highlights the bullish trajectory observed during previous halving events in 2016 and 2020. These events were accompanied by significant surges in Bitcoin prices, indicating the potential for a similar outcome following the next halving. As a result, JPMorgan sets an upper limit of $45,000 for BTC, indicating limited potential beyond the increase driven by the doubling of production costs. Reflecting On Ethereum (ETH) While Bitcoin takes the spotlight in JPMorgan&#8217;s prediction, the bank suggests that Ethereum (ETH) may face some selling pressure in the near term, extending beyond the Shanghai upgrade until mid-year. JPMorgan expects Ethereum to &#8220;somewhat underperform&#8221; BTC during this period. However, it&#8217;s essential to note that Ethereum&#8217;s performance is subject to a range of factors, including market dynamics and technological developments.

Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen more than a 2% gain, while the past seven days have seen a dip of 1.2%. At the time of writing, the top crypto currently trades at $26,823. Bitcoin’s trading volume has, however, ranged around $20 billion in the past 7 days, indicating a possible accumulation. Bitcoin currently has a trading volume of $13.1 billion in the past 24 hours.

<p>As a result, JPMorgan sets an upper limit of $45,000 for BTC, indicating limited potential beyond the increase driven by the doubling of production costs.</p>
<h2>Reflecting On Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p>While Bitcoin takes the spotlight in JPMorgan&#8217;s prediction, the bank suggests that Ethereum (ETH) may face some selling pressure in the near term, extending beyond the Shanghai upgrade until mid-year. JPMorgan expects Ethereum to &#8220;somewhat underperform&#8221; BTC during this period. </p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s essential to note that Ethereum&#8217;s performance is subject to a range of factors, including market dynamics and technological developments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, regardless of JPMorgan&#8217;s prediction, BTC is currently in a bullish trend recording an uptick. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen more than a 2% gain, while the past seven days have seen a dip of 1.2%.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A top SHIB whale added $1.18 million worth of Shiba Inu within 24 hours. Data from Etherscan.io reveals that this whale ranked as the nineteenth largest SHIB holder accumulating 140 Billion SHIB. The whale acquired the SHIB tokens in two separate transactions marking its second massive accumulation within 72 hours. SHIB Token Burns And Shibarium Launch Likely Behind Accumulation Shiba Inu network and users engaged in massive SHIB burn events in 2023. The burning mechanism aims to reduce excess tokens and boost SHIB&#8217;s price. However, no notable price increase has occurred since the token burn events.  Nevertheless, the top SHIB whales are accumulating the tokens ahead of the Shibarium launch and a possible price increase for the asset.

Shiba Inu Team Member Projects Timeline For Shibarium Launch A member of Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing team, LUCIE, shared her thoughts on the proposed mainnet launch of Shibarium in a Tweet.  Shibarium is a Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution created for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Its launch date is highly speculative, with several dates proposed in the past. However, LUCIE stated that she guessed the launch date would be in Q3 of 2023, while Shiba Inu founder Shytoshi Kusama projects in July. The exact launch date remains a mystery and LUCIE believes the Shibarium Mainnet Launch will happen between the second and third quarters of 2023.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Additionally, she believes that Shiba’s team remains confident about the launch, with multiple teams working on it and exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration.

Shiba Inu Price Outlook Despite the recent announcements concerning Shibarium’s launch, SHIB did not record much price fluctuation. It traded at $0.000009967 on May 1, 2023, before moving to $0.00001002 on May 2. However, by May 4, its price dropped to $0.000009896, losing some of its earlier gains. SHIB dropped to $0.000008695 on May 11, showing price volatility. The bulls attempted to rally on May 23, pushing its price to $0.000008899. However, SHIB met resistance returning to $0.000008519 on May 24 and is trading at $0.000008479 at press time today, depicting a 0.16% increase in 24 hours.  Despite the price gain, SHIB’s trading volume is down by 8%, a possible signal of traders&#8217; hesitation in the market. But the launch of the Shibarium mainnet in the ecosystem may be the price catalyst SHIB needs to reclaim its gains as it may boost SHIB usage.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data suggests a majority of the Bitcoin exchange inflows are currently coming from investors holding their coins at a loss. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Volume Is Tending Towards Losses Right Now According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the short-term holders are mostly contributing to these loss inflows. The &#8220;exchange inflow&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that&#8217;s currently flowing into the wallets of centralized exchanges. Generally, investors deposit to these platforms whenever want to sell, so a large amount of inflows can be a sign that a selloff is going on in the BTC market right now. Low values of the metric, on the other hand, imply holders may not be participating in much selling at the moment, which can be bullish for the price. In the context of the current discussion, the exchange inflow itself isn&#8217;t of relevance; a related metric called the &#8220;exchange inflow volume profit/loss bias&#8221; is. As this indicator&#8217;s name already suggests, it tells us whether the inflows going to exchanges are coming from profit or loss holders currently. When this metric has a value greater than 1, it means the majority of the inflow volume contains coins that their holders had been carrying at a profit. Similarly, values under the threshold imply a dominance of the loss volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow profit/loss bias over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have observed some decline in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflow volume profit/loss bias has had a value above 1 for most of the ongoing rallies that started back in January of this year. This suggests that most of the exchange inflows in this period have come from the profit holders. This naturally makes sense, as any rally generally entices a large number of holders to sell and harvest their gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance There have been a couple of exceptional instances, however. The first was back in March when the asset&#8217;s price plunged below the $20,000 level. The bias in the market shifted towards loss selling then, implying that some investors who bought around the local top had started capitulating. A similar pattern has also occurred recently, as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has stumbled below the $27,000 level. Following this plunge, the indicator&#8217;s value has come down to just 0.70. Further data from Glassnode reveals that the bias of the long-term holders (LTHs), the investors holding their coins since at least 155 days ago, have actually leaned towards profits recently. Looks like the indicator has a positive value right now &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator has a value of 1.73 for the LTHs, implying a strong bias toward profits. Naturally, if the LTHs haven&#8217;t been selling at a loss, the opposite cohort must be the short-term holders (STHs). This group seems to have a heavy loss bias currently &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter Interestingly, the indicator&#8217;s value for the STHs is 0.69, which is almost exactly the same as the average for the entire market. This would mean that the LTHs have contributed relatively little to selling pressure recently. The STHs selling right now would be the ones that bought at and near the top of the rally so far and their capitulation may be a sign that these weak hands are currently being cleansed from the market. Although the indicator hasn&#8217;t dipped as low as in March yet, this capitulation could be a sign that a local bottom may be near for Bitcoin.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data from Santiment suggests that altcoins across the entire cryptocurrency sector may be underbought right now. MVRV Of The Various Altcoins Suggests Underpriced Conditions According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, cryptocurrency assets have become underbought as traders are now capitulating following a failed price rebound. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;MVRV&#8221; (Market Value to Realized Value), which measures the ratio between the market cap and the realized cap of a given cryptocurrency. Here, the &#8220;realized cap&#8221; refers to a capitalization model for BTC where the value of any coin in the circulating supply is assumed to be not the current spot price, but the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. This model aims to calculate a sort of &#8220;fair value&#8221; for the asset. As the MVRV compares the market cap (that is, the current price) with the real value of the cryptocurrency, it can provide hints about whether the price is currently overinflated or not. Santiment has defined an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; zone and a &#8220;danger&#8221; zone for this indicator. As their names already imply, the asset in question becomes underpriced when the metric is in the former area, while it becomes overpriced in the latter one. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Here is a chart that shows the trend in the divergence of the MVRV from these zones for the various altcoins in the sector: The value of the metric seems to be above zero for most of the market &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter Whenever the MVRV divergence has a value of 1 or more, the indicator is said to be inside the opportunity zone. Similarly, the danger area occurs below a value of -1. While these are the two extreme zones, the metric being firmly inside either the positive or the negative zone (but not hitting either of these thresholds), still signals slight underbought or overpriced conditions, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level This means that the chances of bullish rebounds can become greater whenever the indicator enters positive territory. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the vast majority of the coins in the digital asset sector are at least inside the positive territory at the moment. This would imply that these coins may have become underpriced recently. Some of the altcoins are also outright inside the opportunity zone, suggesting that they may be offering low-risk buying opportunities right now. There are a few cryptocurrencies, however, that are inside the negative zone, with a couple of them even being inside dangerous territory. Such alts have more chances of registering a decline in the near future. Recently, the various altcoins have attempted to amass together a rebound, but so far, they have only seen failure. However, now that the prices have started to become undervalued, perhaps a break may be found soon. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,400, down 1% in the last week.
