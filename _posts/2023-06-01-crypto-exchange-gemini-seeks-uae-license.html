<p>US-based crypto exchange Gemini announced it seeks a crypto license in the United Arab Emirates, citing &ldquo;hostility and [a] lack of clarity&rdquo; on US regulations. </p>
<p>Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced on Wednesday that it will &ldquo;soon&rdquo; start the process of obtaining a crypto service license for customers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>

<p>In a blog post, the exchange said the UAE, as a forward-thinking, global financial hub, is fast establishing itself as a crypto hub. The company said its team has met with stakeholders throughout the region to learn more about local regulatory requirements, further stating that it aims for the &ldquo;adoption of crypto globally across 20 countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gemini said:</p>

<p>By applying for a license, we will be taking another step towards making Gemini a truly global company.</p>

<p>It is not yet clear where Gemini&rsquo;s base operations will be located, but Cointelegraph reports that the exchange has hinted at establishing headquarters in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Gemini co-CEOs, the Winklevoss twins, also told media outlet Zaywa that its decision was prompted by &ldquo;hostility and a lack of clarity&rdquo; regarding crypto regulations in the US.</p>
<p>The exchange announced last week that it plans to establish its European operations out of Dublin, Ireland.</p>
