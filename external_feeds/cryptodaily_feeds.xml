			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) completely blew the crypto market away when it launched a couple of years ago. However, the meme coin has yet to hit the long-awaited $1 mark, and according to experts, it won't do so anytime soon. On the other hand, Tradecurve has the whole market buzzing as it's set to bring a lot more to the market than just memes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Is Investing in Shiba Inu (SHIB) Really Worth the Risk?</p>
<p>Like many other meme coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) constantly faces volatile predictions and swings, leaving Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors unsure of what the new day will bring. And sure, if you take a peek at the Shiba Inu (SHIB) market cap, you might think that the coin is highly valuable. However, as fate dictates, the value of a meme coin like Shiba Inu (SHIB) is purely speculative and typically left in the hands of Twitter users and Redditors.</p>
<p>So, if you're thinking about long-term gains and stability, then Shiba Inu (SHIB) should not be on your mind. Even more so now, as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is struggling to break out of its new support level of $0.000008.</p>
<p>And as Shiba Inu (SHIB) enthusiasts are putting pressure on the meme coin more and more every day, it could face dramatic downfalls if it fails to go above its current support level. Consequently, experts predict a massive potential for the coin to drop down to $0.000007, which would be a major setback for both holders and the token itself.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Tradecurve (TCRV) Has the Potential to Compete With Tier 1 CEXes</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a new hybrid trading exchange that will bring major changes and opportunities to the crypto market. Its goal is to bring an easy-to-access and use trading platform with no entry barriers and KYC requirements.</p>
<p>Also, Tradecurve will provide something that hasn't been seen on the market until now &ndash; an all-in-one trading platform where people can trade stocks, commodities, crypto, and forex from one account. So, traders won't have to hop from one exchange to another to conduct their daily trades anymore; Tradecurve will combine all of that into one neatly-tied platform.</p>
<p>But how will all of this work? Well, the starting point to trading on Tradecurve is creating an account with only your email and making a deposit using whichever cryptocurrency you want. And once you're in, you'll be able to trade freely with high liquidity across thousands of assets. And all of that is possible due to the blockchain and using crypto deposits as collateral.</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) holders will have access to exciting benefits and features once they start trading on the platform. They will receive discounts on trading fees and can use their tokens to get discounted subscription fees for signal and AI trading bots.</p>
<p>In addition, holders can stake their tokens and receive passive income in return. Other benefits that only TCRV holders will be eligible for include high leverage, AI algorithmic trading, complete anonymity, VIP account service, and more.</p>
<p>So, thanks to the opportunities that Tradecurve is bringing to the market, investors are piling up more and more every day and buying the token while it is still in pre-sale. Currently, it is trading at $0.012 and is set to bring 50x gains before the pre-sale ends. Once the token is launched, it will bring another 100x gains to holders. And with all the benefits and options this platform brings, its further growth potential is out of this world.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The recent bear market has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, causing Bitcoin's value to plummet below $30,000. This was after the resurgence earlier in the year, which saw Bitcoin surpass the $20k mark.</p>
<p class="s5">As investors reassess their portfolios, they seek alternative assets that can offer high-yield potential. InQubeta, a crypto crowdfunding NFT platform, has emerged as an enticing option for those looking to diversify their investments and participate in the growth of AI start-ups.</p>
<p class="s5">Let's explore what InQubeta is and how it presents a unique opportunity for investors.</p>
<p class="s7">What Is InQubeta, And How Does It Work?</p>
<p class="s5">InQubeta is a crypto crowdfunding NFT platform that allows users to invest in AI start-up projects using QUBE tokens. It operates through an NFT marketplace where start-ups can raise funds and engage with their community by offering reward and equity-based NFTs.</p>
<p class="s5">It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and leverages the benefit of the leading smart contract network to create a seamless and secure investment ecosystem for AI start-ups and investors. Ethereum offers a robust ecosystem, and InQubeta&rsquo;s NFT marketplace is built on the ERC721 standard, providing a wide range of benefits such as greater flexibility, interoperability and functionality. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s5">By purchasing QUBE tokens, investors gain access to a unique investment ecosystem focused on supporting AI technology innovation and the next generation of start-ups. It is an opportunity to be part of the growth and success of AI-driven advancements.</p>

Firstly, it provides the potential for significant returns over time, as investors participate in the success of AI technology start-ups. Additionally, it grants access to a unique investment ecosystem centered around supporting innovation in AI technology. Moreover, by staking QUBE tokens on the platform, investors can earn rewards from the dedicated reward pool, offering an additional source of income and incentivizing long-term investment.</p>
<p class="s5">During the presale period, QUBE tokens can be purchased through the InQubeta website using various supported cryptocurrencies such as ETH, USDT, and BTC. The minimum investment amount for QUBE tokens is set at $50, making it accessible to a wide range of investors looking to enter the crypto crowdfunding space.</p>
<p class="s5">QUBE token holders can stake their tokens through the InQubeta staking dapp using supported wallets. By staking, investors can earn rewards from the 2% and 5% buy and sell tax that goes into a dedicated reward pool. This provides an opportunity for passive income generation and further strengthens the investment proposition of QUBE tokens.</p>
<p class="s5">Through the InQubeta NFT marketplace, investors can earn rewards by backing and investing in start-up projects that offer reward and equity-based NFTs. Start-up projects are evaluated based on their growth potential, alignment with InQubeta's values, and mission. Investors have access to resources for researching and evaluating start-up projects, including community insights, reviews from experienced investors, and AI technology experts.</p>

<p class="s5">QUBE token holders can stake their tokens through the InQubeta staking dapp using supported wallets. By staking, investors can earn rewards from the 2% and 5% buy and sell tax that goes into a dedicated reward pool. This provides an opportunity for passive income generation and further strengthens the investment proposition of QUBE tokens.</p>

Start-up projects are evaluated based on their growth potential, alignment with InQubeta's values, and mission.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins are famous for their higher chances of bringing wealth. We&rsquo;ve seen this play out in history with Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and numerous other meme coins. In case you&rsquo;ve not invested in any meme coin, now might be the best time to put your money on these two tokens.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re also looking to make some quick gains this year, Uwerx is a new crypto project on presale with a huge margin to make money in 2023.</p>
<p>Uwerx(WERX) Might Be The Biggest Project In 2023 </p>
<p>According to data, analysis reveals that the freelance community is bound to dominate the workforce, making up about 46.5% of the global working environment. This data shows that full-time workers are not the only recognized body globally, and the environment is becoming more welcoming of freelancers as equal professionals. </p>
<p>This level of recognition comes with the need for a system that can provide freelancers with the best resources and support. And it is precisely why a platform like Uwerx exists. Uwerxis a leading blockchain solution and a new project that aims to launch on the Ethereum blockchain. The crypto projects aim to introduce some innovations into the community.</p>
<p>These innovations include the unique built-in collaboration tool like video conferencing and project management. Another unique solution Uwerx brings is a personalized matching system that connects clients to the right skills and freelancers to the best jobs that suit their expertise.</p>
<p>Uwerx is a one-of-a-kind blockchain project, and it currently stands to be the best innovation we&rsquo;ve seen in the blockchain space in a while. InterFi Network has completed the network&rsquo;s audit approval, and investors are already convinced of the project's legitimacy. </p>
<p>Dogecoin(DOGE) Remains Relevant </p>
<p>Dogecoin is the first meme coin project in the crypto market, and it has indeed led the park of other meme coins. The meme coin has been a major market mover and paved the way for more meme coin projects to emerge. </p>
<p>Dogecoin still holds its position as the biggest meme coin project. It is 0.28% higher today, with a steady price of $0.0712. The general outlook for Doge looks good. However, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to look as good as Uwerx crypto on presale. </p>
<p>Shiba Inu(SHIB) Is A Must-Have Meme Coin In 2023</p>
<p>Shiba Inu is the next-in-line after Dogecoin in terms of relevance. It is one of the meme coin projects that offer many more to users asides from fun and entertainment. Shiba Inu provides a decentralized exchange system allowing users to swap their tokens quickly and cheaply. The platform is also working on launching its metaverse and providing more functionality for users. </p>
<p>Shiba Inu has seen positive growth paths over the past months, and investors are optimistic about future price pumps. The meme coin is currently 0.000008581 and ranked #15 by market cap.</p>
<p>More About The WERX Presale</p>
<p>WERX token presale has taken a positive trajectory right from its launch. The crypto project is currently on its Stage 4 presale and has raised massive amounts in such little time. Experts predict that at this rate, the token is expected to rise at least 10X before launch. Uwerx is a project that offers the best utility and high-profit potential.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum recently implemented its Shanghai/Shapella upgrade, which has been ground-breaking for its investors. How is this affecting staking?</p>
Successful upgrade but price decreases
<p>This incredibly important upgrade, implemented more than a month ago, permits ETH stakers to withdraw locked-up coins and contribute to increasing liquidity on Ethereum's network. The newfound liquidity also acts as a catalyst for encouraging developers' creativity resulting from new opportunities that diversified solutions provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, not all is rosy as Ether's value decreased by 14% within one month despite it being up by over half since January this year; market analysts attribute these fluctuations to investor sentiment surrounding potential economic fallout from recession risks and worries over the US banking crisis.&nbsp;</p>
Staking activity surpasses expectations
<p>Staking activity has surpassed expectations. According to BeaconScan, more than 18.5 million ether coins are now staked; there are also roughly 702,000 validators participating on the network earning average yields of approximately 5.5%. Consequently, through increased fees on its network, stakeholders are benefiting from higher yields, which are currently at their peak within the last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value of staked ether has grown significantly, whereas the overall supply has drastically decreased. This trend has compelled numerous investors to consider staking ETH as a worthy rival to U.S. Treasury bills as it offers an equivalent yield of 5% with a shorter duration of less than 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there was initially a backlog in withdrawing ether, the waiting time has now reached zero days, and entering the staking queue entails waiting for only 30 days. This development outperformed expectations from a month ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Ethereum's fees have risen steeply, staked Ether has also grown significantly, translating into higher returns for investors. Furthermore, Shapella's introduction has facilitated a remarkable increase in new depositors on the network. There has been an approximately 8% growth in unique depositors since April 12th as more individuals show willingness to lock up their funds for a return while keeping withdrawal options open.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The South Korean Prime Minister, Han Deok-soo, has called on high-ranking public officials to disclose their crypto holdings, with party members unveiling a new bill on Friday.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is of the view that including crypto in property, registration is the right way forward.&nbsp;</p>
Expanding The Scope Of Assets Subject To Reporting&nbsp;
<p>In a press conference held at the Sejong Government Complex, the Prime Minister stressed the importance of including crypto assets in the property registration of all high-ranking public and government officials. Currently, the public officials&rsquo; law requires public officials to disclose any assets such as stocks, bonds, and cash valued over 10 million Korean Won ($7572). However, under the current avatar of the law, cryptocurrencies and other digital assets do not have to be reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the new proposal, lawmakers have stated that cryptocurrency holdings held by public officials must be reported, regardless of their value. Furthermore, they have also suggested the imposition of a limit on how much any public official involved in the country&rsquo;s cryptocurrency ecosystem can invest. Lee Man-Hee, a right-leaning lawmaker, in a proposed amendment to the country&rsquo;s Public Official Ethics Act, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is necessary to expand the scope of assets that are subject to reporting to include virtual assets &mdash; this will help to ensure that public officials do not use their position to improperly accumulate wealth or conceal assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Han, in an interaction with reporters, stated that the issue of high-ranking government officials should include digital currencies in property registration can be discussed and decided in the country&rsquo;s national assembly. The Prime Minister added that personally, he believed that adding cryptocurrencies to property registration is the right thing to do.</p>
Registration Of Other Assets
<p>In an effort to support his stance, the Prime Minister drew parallels with the registration of other valuable assets, adding that under current rules, the registration of precious metals is mandatory. He added that similar requirements for cryptocurrency holdings could also be implemented. At present, there are no requirements that govern the disclosure of cryptocurrency holdings. It is up to each official to decide whether they wish to disclose their assets or not.&nbsp;</p>
The Kim Nam-kuk Scandal&nbsp;
<p>The proposal is seen as a way to address the ongoing scandal around a former lawmaker of the opposing Democratic Party, Kim Nam-kuk. The revelation of significant his significant cryptocurrency investments sparked several outbursts calling for a thorough investigation into how much cryptocurrency holdings lawmakers have and to include their registration in property registrations. The National Assembly member is currently being investigated for concealment of criminal proceeds, lax portals, and campaign finance violations by the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit. The investigation relates to the reported liquidation of around $4.5 million worth of cryptocurrency just before the implementation of the Financial Action Task Force&rsquo;s Travel Rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>South Korea has been working on creating a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and crypto firms operating in the country following the collapse of Terra Luna. The framework would help in enhancing transparency and fair trading practices in South Korean markets. Crypto investors and users from South Korea make up a significant chunk of the global crypto space, with the Korean Won being the third most-used currency for transactions after the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Han, in an interaction with reporters, stated that the issue of high-ranking government officials should include digital currencies in property registration can be discussed and decided in the country&rsquo;s national assembly. The Prime Minister added that personally, he believed that adding cryptocurrencies to property registration is the right thing to do.</p>
Registration Of Other Assets
<p>In an effort to support his stance, the Prime Minister drew parallels with the registration of other valuable assets, adding that under current rules, the registration of precious metals is mandatory. He added that similar requirements for cryptocurrency holdings could also be implemented. At present, there are no requirements that govern the disclosure of cryptocurrency holdings. It is up to each official to decide whether they wish to disclose their assets or not.&nbsp;</p>
The Kim Nam-kuk Scandal&nbsp;
<p>The proposal is seen as a way to address the ongoing scandal around a former lawmaker of the opposing Democratic Party, Kim Nam-kuk. The revelation of significant his significant cryptocurrency investments sparked several outbursts calling for a thorough investigation into how much cryptocurrency holdings lawmakers have and to include their registration in property registrations. The National Assembly member is currently being investigated for concealment of criminal proceeds, lax portals, and campaign finance violations by the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit. The investigation relates to the reported liquidation of around $4.5 million worth of cryptocurrency just before the implementation of the Financial Action Task Force&rsquo;s Travel Rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>South Korea has been working on creating a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and crypto firms operating in the country following the collapse of Terra Luna. The framework would help in enhancing transparency and fair trading practices in South Korean markets. Crypto investors and users from South Korea make up a significant chunk of the global crypto space, with the Korean Won being the third most-used currency for transactions after the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Despite the US facing default as soon as June, President Joe Biden clarified that he would &ldquo;not agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders&rdquo; while speaking at the final day of the G7 summit in Hiroshima. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As the US faces defaulting on its debt obligation, President Joe Biden said he will not agree to a &ldquo;deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk.&rdquo; Biden spoke at a press conference on Sunday following the annual Group of 7 (G7) summit in Hiroshima, Japan. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING: President Joe Biden speaking on the final day of the G7 summit"I'm not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistants at risk."https://t.co/q2ATjj9RFh📺 Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTube pic.twitter.com/PIf0O5tKXq</p>
&mdash; Sky News (@SkyNews) May 21, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The US president is under pressure to agree to a new budget as without a new budget deal; the US could default on its debt obligations as soon as June 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Biden, however, stressed that during a meeting with all four Congressional leaders before the summit, they agreed that the only viable path forward is by way of a bipartisan agreement. Biden said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my part. We put forward a proposal that cuts spending by more than a trillion dollars, and on top of the nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction that I previously proposed through the combination of spending cuts and new revenues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adding, &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s time for the other side to move from their extreme positions because much of what they&rsquo;ve already proposed is simply, quite frankly, unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>

Biden Won&rsquo;t Budge on Tax Breaks, Pharmaceuticals, and Crypto Traders
<p>In addition to refusing a deal that would protect so-called &ldquo;wealthy tax cheats&rdquo;, Biden listed many other areas where he would not agree to a deal.</p>
<p>He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to agree to a deal that protects, for example, a $30 billion tax break for the oil industry, which made $200 billion last year &hellip; while putting healthcare of 21 million Americans at risk by going after Medicaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The President will also refuse a deal that would protect the pharmaceutical industry at the cost of schoolteachers, assistants, and law enforcement officers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to agree to a deal that protects $200 billion in excess payments for pharmaceutical industries and refusing to count that while cutting over 100,000 schoolteachers and &mdash; and assistants&rsquo; jobs, 30,000 law enforcement officers&rsquo; jobs cut across the &mdash; the entire United States of America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Biden was clear on his stance against tax breaks and crypto traders, stressing:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly a hundred &mdash; excuse me &mdash; nearly 1 million Americans.</p>

Biden: The US Will Not Default on Its Debt Obligation
<p>Bitcoin.com reports Biden addressed concern over America being at risk of defaulting on its debt obligations. The possibility of the US defaulting became a widespread concern after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Treasury may run out of money to pay all the government&rsquo;s bills as soon as June 1 should Congress &ldquo;not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>President Biden is, however, confident that the US would not default, and all four congressional leaders reportedly agree with him. He reiterated:</p>

<p>America has never defaulted &hellip; on our debt &mdash; and it never will.</p>

<p>Biden&rsquo;s proposed budget for 2024 includes amendments to tax treatment for &ldquo;wash sales&rdquo; of digital assets and a 30% tax levy on energy used for cryptocurrency mining activities.</p>
Opinion
<p>Is the US shooting itself in the foot with its attitude toward the crypto industry? It is certainly not helping itself by trying its utmost best to &ldquo;suffocate crypto with high taxes.&rdquo; The regulatory approach by the SEC and other enforcement agencies has made it clear that the US wants to drive crypto from its shores. Companies such as Coinbase and Binance have been the target of the SEC while trying everything to abide by regulatory compliance but to no avail.</p>
<p>While the US tried everything in its power to stifle the industry, crypto firms are looking to other jurisdictions that would allow them to conduct their operations within a reasonable regulatory framework. The European Union&rsquo;s (EU) landmark MiCA regulation is not far from taking effect, and the UK is moving fast with a regulatory framework. We could very likely see the EU and UK become crypto hubs.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Certain projects stand out for their innovation, potential, and impact! As we embrace 2023, three projects have caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors: Tron (TRX), Polkadot (DOT), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).</p>
<p>These projects represent the best of the best in terms of technology, community, and vision. Let's explore the nitty-gritty of each project and discover why they are among the top contenders in the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>Tron: A Decentralised Digital Economy</p>
<p>Tron has emerged as a trailblazer in the crypto industry, aiming to revolutionise the digital entertainment sector. By leveraging blockchain technology, Tron seeks to create a decentralised ecosystem where content creators can directly connect with consumers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and empowering users with greater control over their data and digital assets.</p>
<p>One of Tron's key strengths lies in its scalability. With high throughput and low fees, the Tron network can handle a vast number of transactions, making it suitable for applications ranging from gaming to decentralised finance. The project's commitment to interoperability further enhances its appeal, allowing seamless integration with other blockchain networks and expanding its reach.</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin: Pioneering In Memes And Eco-Friendliness</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin, the cat-themed meme coin, has drawn a lot of interest as a cryptocurrency in presale that tackles significant environmental problems. By using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is recognised for its energy efficiency and ecologically favourable features, the project adopts a novel approach to mining. This demonstrates Big Eyes Coin's dedication to sustainability and establishes it as a trailblazing force in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The effects of Big Eyes Coin, however, reach beyond mining. The initiative is committed to making a beneficial impact on the globe and has put aside a percentage of its assets to help organisations that promote ocean protection. Big Eyes Coin just debuted its own casino, providing players with an interesting selection of play-to-earn (P2E) games, to further strengthen its presence in the cryptocurrency industry. This move adds a layer of entertainment and engagement while providing an additional revenue stream for participants. That&rsquo;s set to launch with 4,000 P2E games, users can expect a myriad and exciting gaming experience within the world of Big Eyes.</p>
<p>Polkadot: Unlocking The Power Of Interoperability</p>
<p>Polkadot has made waves with its ambitious mission to enable a multi-chain ecosystem that connects different blockchains and allows them to interoperate seamlessly. Designed to solve the scalability and interoperability challenges faced by blockchain networks, Polkadot's innovative technology aims to foster collaboration and resource sharing among diverse projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the core of Polkadot's architecture is its unique relay chain, which serves as a secure foundation for interoperability. Parachains, specialised chains that connect to the relay chain, enable independent governance and customisation while benefiting from the security and scalability of the overall network. This modular approach empowers developers to create and deploy their own blockchain applications while enjoying the benefits of interoperability.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Tron, Polkadot, and Big Eyes Coin have emerged as leading crypto projects in 2023, each offering unique innovations and contributions to the industry. Tron's focus on decentralised digital entertainment and scalability positions it as a promising contender. Big Eyes Coin's commitment to environmental consciousness and charitable initiatives sets it apart as a pioneering force. Polkadot's vision of a multi-chain ecosystem and interoperability showcases its potential to solve key challenges in blockchain technology. These projects exemplify the ongoing evolution and impact of cryptocurrencies in the current landscape.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>For years, trading success and profitability remain a big deal for traders. However, Tradecurve (TCRV) has emerged to change the story by providing traders with a first-of-its-kind hybrid and decentralised trading platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still in presale, Tradecurve (TCRV) is poised to make eye-popping gains and potentially surpass even established players like Monero (XMR) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in ROI. With a unique approach to blockchain technology and a growing community of enthusiastic investors, Tradecurve (TCRV) is quickly making a name for itself as the cryptocurrency to watch. This article unravels the unique potentials of Tradecurve (TCRV) and why it is quickly taking out Monero (XMR) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in ROI.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Monero (XMR) Lead Bear Market Despite Regulatory Pressure</p>
<p>Despite the overall bearish condition of the crypto market, Monero (XMR) is leading its peers with upward momentum as regulatory pressure tightens around its privacy-focused peer-to-peer solution. As of May 17, the Monero (XMR) token is trading around $151 after surging to $164 from a key support level of $131.</p>
<p>The recent surge in Monero (XMR)'s price is due to the growing demand for Monero (XMR)'s unparalleled privacy-focused and anonymity feature. These include ring signatures and stealth addresses that obfuscate transactions while protecting user identity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Monero (XMR) remains an unsuitable investment for many investors. Its privacy-enhancing feature has given rise to new regulations while countries and crypto exchanges enforce stricter rules and bans for using and transacting with Monero (XMR) and other privacy-conscious cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) Hype Fizzle Out as High-Value Projects Dominates</p>
<p>The hype around Dogecoin (DOGE) has fizzled out recently as investors have turned their attention to more high-value projects. The meme coin, created as a joke in 2013, saw its price soar to an all-time high of $0.73 in May 2021, but it has since fallen back to around $0.073, about a 90% loss.</p>
<p>One reason for this significant decline in Dogecoin (DOGE)'s value is its lack of underlying value. Unlike innovative projects like the Tradecurve (TCRV) protocol, Dogecoin (DOGE) is not backed by any real-world use case, application or asset. High supply and volatility also subject Dogecoin (DOGE) to wide price fluctuation, making it a risky investment for many people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) Protocol Surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) and Monero (XMR) as Hybrid Decentralised Platform Pique Mainstream Attention</p>
<p>Innovation is key to success - a reason why Tradecurve (TCRV) continues to lead its peers while providing a seamless and better way to trade. Gone are the days of juggling multiple accounts for different assets. With Tradecurve (TCRV), users can effortlessly trade crypto, stocks, forex, indices, and commodities, all from one convenient platform.</p>
<p>With its cutting-edge tools and capabilities, Tradecurve (TCRV) offers a decentralised, multipurpose and scalable platform accessible to everyone. Benefit from low latency execution, transparency, competitive trading fee, AI-integrated algorithmic trading systems, and social trading, all designed to optimise every trader's portfolio and experience.</p>
<p>At the core of Tradecurve (TCRV)'s thriving ecosystem is the TCRV token that grants users unlimited access to the platform's staking opportunity, reward and discount. Thus, it is easy to see why Tradecurve (TCRV) will potentially topple Dogecoin (DOGE) and Monero (XMR)'s ROI in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p>Interest in Tradecurve (TCRV)'s capabilities has zoomed its demand to the second phase. Its token is trading at $0.012. Experts are optimistic about its long-term success and ability to change decentralised trading forever. Sign up for the presale and stand a chance to be a part of next-gen trading technology.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market is a realm of constant evolution, where opportunities and trends can surge and die down with remarkable speed. In this constantly evolving landscape, users need early access to information to stay ahead of the curve. The later you are to trend or play, the less likely you are to make a profit, and here's an opportunity to stay early and position yourself for the massive inflow of value coming to the crypto market. </p>
<p>Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA) are undervalued, and you can expect some price pumps in the coming weeks leading to the bull market. However, the ultimate play for the next bull season is the newly launched presale project, Uwerx.</p>
<p class="s8">Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA)</p>
<p>Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA) are two cryptocurrencies with some of the most underrated growth metrics when assessing the next pumps of the bull market. Aptos(APT) recently launched, and it hasn't had time to grow for a project that emerged right before the FTX market chaos. The network has had an impressive price trend this year, and it's planning an upgrade to improve staking and participation on the network. This upgrade will allow delegated staking, where users can earn staking rewards without running a node themselves. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Cardano(ADA) has had the most upgrades of any blockchain network in the past two years. The Cardano community is dedicated to constantly improving the chain, and the network saw its most tremendous price jump after its smart contract upgrade in 2021. Since last year, the network has launched updates to make it a better alternative to Ethereum and provide support for cutting-edge crypto solutions like DeFi. With its latest upgrade, Cardano adds a scaling tool, Hydra Head, to make transactions on the chain even faster.</p>
<p>Both projects have been building in silence, and nothing speaks value louder than when the bull market begins to build momentum. However, we firmly believe the Uwerx token is a less risky bet as it's on presale and offers a unique solution to a derived market.</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx Presale Guarantees Massive Profit For Early Adopters</p>
<p>Uwerx is the most exciting blockchain solution we have seen in recent years. The platform easily edges out existing platforms in the freelance industry. The gig economy is dominated by firms more particular about the company's profit than creating value for users. For example, Upwork and Fiverr charge 10% and 20% for transactions initiated on their platform.</p>
<p>Uwerx easily becomes a better competition with its 1% flat fee across all contracts. Most of this fee would eventually go back to serve users via the liquidity pool and other means of creating value. Uwerx uses its native WERX token as the primary utility token allowing users to begin trading it once the platform launches.</p>
<p>However, smart investors have started entering the presale event to get in on the project early and make some profit by launch. You can join them, too, as the token goes for $0.0225 after a recent increase from $0.012. Price prediction analysis suggests that the token could go as high as $1.5 in Q3 of 2023; this is an opportunity you shouldn't miss for anything.</p>
<p>In addition, liquidity will be locked for about 25 years as a safety measure to keep funds available to users willing to trade tokens. Enter the presale now and earn up to 20% bonus tokens.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 26763 Support:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 22 May 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to trade within a relatively narrow range early in the Asian session as the pair reached the 27190.01 area before declining to the 26792.54 area, a move lower that represented a test of the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 29850 to 25810.&nbsp; Following recent selling pressure, related downside price objectives include the 26308, 26093, 25885, and 25604 levels.&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 27145, 27108, 26765, 26729, 26380, 26309, and 26203 levels during the recent depreciation, downside price objectives related to recent selling pressure around the 30500, 30050, 29850, 28334, and 27647 levels.&nbsp; Related downside price objectives include the 25474, 25442, 25124, 24705, 24440, 23208, and 22769 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Decentralized crypto mixing platform Tornado Cash recently suffered a significant attack on its governance. A malicious proposal recently subverted its governance system, providing the threat actor with complete control over the protocol.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The threat actor successfully shifted 1.2 million votes to a proposal with deceptive intent on May 20th. This initiative received more than 700,000 legitimate votes, enabling the attacker to fully command Tornado Cash governance. This incident was highlighted by @samczsun, a researcher at Paradigm, a research-driven technology investment firm.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">On 2023/05/20 at 07:25:11 UTC, Tornado Cash governance effectively ceased to exist. Through a malicious proposal, an attacker granted themselves 1,200,000 votes. As this is more than the ~700,000 legitimate votes, they now have full control.https://t.co/nY87XmrYgT pic.twitter.com/h9qjc3xRqz</p>
&mdash; @samczsun.com (@samczsun) May 20, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The attacker claimed their proposal employed logic akin to a previously approved community proposal. However, it concealed an insidious function. Once approved, the attacker utilized the emergencyStop function on the governance contract to modify the proposal logic, granting themselves falsified votes.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With total control, the attacker can now withdraw all locked votes, drain the tokens from the governance contract, and effectively "brick" the on-chain router. @samczsun's latest tweets on the matter suggest that the attacker has already withdrawn 10,000 votes as TORN tokens and liquidated them.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This diligently underscores the need for the diligent scrutiny and appropriate review of proposal descriptions and logic. A Tornado Cash community member known pseudonymously as Tornadosaurus-Hex confirmed the possible compromise of all governance funds and urged members to withdraw any locked funds.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Tornado Cash's team is now actively seeking Solidity developers who could help protect the protocol from further damage. They have also indicated the necessity for dialogue with Binance, as the exchange possesses more tokens held than the threat actor and may be able to help reverse the functions implemented through the exploit.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Tornado Cash case recently received support from major crypto policy and advocacy groups. The Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund jointly filed an amicus curiae brief in support of a partial summary judgment motion for the plaintiff against the U.S. Treasury Department.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash, asserting that it assisted the North Korean hacking group, Lazarus Group, in funneling roughly $7 billion worth of funds obtained from various exploits. The infamous Lazarus Group is notorious in the crypto sphere for stealing from prominent DeFi protocols. This accusation led to the arrest of Tornado Cash's creator, Alexy Pertsev, on money laundering charges in August, inciting public outcry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In retaliation to these widespread exploits, the sanction was imposed by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Tornado Cash, placing addresses purportedly connected with the mixer on its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. Consequently, it is illegal for U.S. persons to interact with those addresses under threat of substantial fines and imprisonment.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Data from CoinMarketCap reveals a significant decrease in Tornado Cash's activity following these developments, with transaction volumes declining by an average of 40% on an hour-to-hour within the last 24 hours. The reported loss of roughly 10,000 TORN tokens have been traced back to the threat actor's activities. The aftermath of this episode underlines the importance of rigorous code inspection and robust community governance in decentralized protocols.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Staking your cryptocurrency is an ideal way of earning a passive income while also supporting the network&rsquo;s operation. Though the idea is sound, it comes with certain disadvantages for the user who is staking - meaning, his share of cryptocurrencies would remain locked in a wallet for a period of time and would remain inaccessible, thus limiting the ability to use or trade them.</p>
<p class="s4">But innovation never sleeps and thus sprung the idea of liquid staking.</p>
<p class="s4">With it, two key players emerged, captivating the attention of investors and enthusiasts like LIDO and Cosmos. These innovative platforms offer a revolutionary concept known as liquid staking, which combines the benefits of staking with the flexibility of decentralized finance (DeFi). We will also discuss an upcoming player who&rsquo;s big into DeFi, a meme token called Big Eyes Coin.</p>
<p class="s8">What Is Liquid Staking?</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking provides a solution to this liquidity problem. With liquid staking, you can stake your cryptocurrency and still maintain its flexibility. Instead of locking up your funds, they are tokenized into "staking derivatives" that represent your staked assets.</p>
<p class="s4">Thus, liquid staking offers the best of both worlds: the ability to earn staking rewards and maintain liquidity, allowing you to use your assets in various ways within the crypto ecosystem. It provides more flexibility and accessibility compared to traditional staking, where your funds are locked up for a specific duration.</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking holds huge future potential, and investing in tokens that are at the forefront of this unique mechanism will reap huge rewards.</p>
<p class="s10">LIDO - Unleashing The Power Of Liquid Staking</p>
<p class="s4">Imagine you have some cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, or Kusama, and you want to earn rewards by staking them.</p>
<p class="s4">Here's where LIDO comes in. LIDO is one of the best platforms that help you stake your cryptocurrencies through liquid staking. With LIDO, you can stake your assets and receive something called st-tokens. These st-tokens represent your staked assets and are linked to them in a one-to-one ratio. So, if you stake 1 Ethereum, you'll receive 1 st-token.</p>
<p class="s4">The cool thing about LIDO's liquid staking is that it allows you to enjoy the benefits of staking, like earning rewards, while still having the flexibility to trade or use your st-tokens in the DeFi world. So, win-win for both the network and staker.</p>
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s10">What Is Liquid Staking On The Cosmos Hub Through Stride?</p>
<p class="s4">Stride, the leading liquid staking protocol within the Cosmos ecosystem, offers liquid staking for several Cosmos chains, including the Cosmos Hub. Stride allows users to stake their tokens and receive staking derivatives that can be freely traded or redeemed with Stride for the original tokens.</p>
<p class="s4">By adopting Stride's non-custodial liquid staking protocol, users maintain full control over their assets, providing greater flexibility compared to traditional staking methods. With over 80% market share in the Cosmos ecosystem, Stride contributes to the decentralization and security of the network while enhancing the liquidity and accessibility of staked assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Big Eyes Coin - A Promising Investment Opportunity</p>
<p class="s4">Big Eyes Coin has emerged as an exciting crypto project, capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts. With its upcoming launch on Uniswap, Big Eyes Coin aims to establish itself as a unique player in the market. The project boasts a range of top features, including a casino platform where users can trade their crypto for BIG tokens and participate in play-to-earn (P2E) games. With over $37 million raised during its presale and a projected increase in value, Big Eyes Coin presents an enticing investment opportunity.</p>
<p class="s4">For a limited period, you have the exclusive chance to acquire $BIG tokens at their remarkable stage 3 price. Buy BIG tokens now for $0.00017 per token.</p>
<p class="s4">We hope now you can answer like a pro when someone asks - What is liquid staking?</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking has emerged as a game-changing concept, offering users the benefits of staking combined with the flexibility of the DeFi ecosystem. LIDO and Stride within the Cosmos ecosystem are two of the best liquid staking platforms that exemplify the power and potential of this new technology, providing users with enhanced liquidity, accessibility, and control over their staked assets.</p>
<p class="s4">Furthermore, Big Eyes Coin presents an exciting investment opportunity, with its unique features and promising future. By investing in these coins, individuals can diversify their portfolios and potentially reap substantial returns.</p>
