<p>Germany has officially entered a recession after growth contracted in the first quarter. With Germany leading the European Union&rsquo;s economy, many expect that Germany could pressure the European Central Bank to cut rates to stimulate the economy. Low-interest rates act as rocket fuel for altcoins, and analysts predict it would cause Shiba Inu (SHIB) to rally and add more fuel to Tradecurve (TCRV), a hybrid exchange that has already posted impressive growth in the past weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) On-Track to Raise $20 Million in PresaleTradecurve (TCRV) remains on track to raise a staggering $20 million in its presale as demand spikes. It seems the market has begun to process the value proposition of this exciting new platform that has already announced its plans to onboard 100,000 traders within three months of launch. Tradecurve will provide high leverage, anonymity, and unfettered access to global markets, including forex, stocks, crypto, and commodities. This nascent challenger in the trading industry features transparent on-chain pricing, intuitional level liquidity powering excellent fills for traders, and, most excitingly, has integrated artificial intelligence trading algorithms accessible only to $TCRV holders. Tradecurve is a derivatives platform where users stay anonymous. It provides a haven for millions of retail clients worldwide who cannot access leveraged trading products due to shortsighted government regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts predict explosive growth for $TCRV expecting a 5,000% leap before the presale closes. They cited the protocol&rsquo;s AI speciality and its plans to introduce Proof of Reserves to validate these claims. Some analysts even compared it to the famous Binance Coin (BNB) ICO in 2017 that began at a price of $0.15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price PredictionShiba Inu (SHIB) benefitted from the memecoin mania that descended on Crypto Twitter recently. Still, the real hype has come from the impressive metrics posted by Shibarium, a layer two scaling solution built by the developers of Shiba Inu (SHIB). Shibaroium has executed more than twelve million transactions, and it will allow Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders to swap between the native ecosystem tokens $BONE and $LEASH with lower fees. Additionally, the chain will utilize $BONE for gas fees, and rumor is gas fees will be swapped for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and burnt. Analysts have forecast a range between $0.00001473 and $0.00001762 for Shiba Inu (SHIB), which appears slightly conservative given the amount of development currently taking place on the network. The release of Shibarium perfectly encapsulates the Shiba Inu (SHIB) philosophy of being a memecoin but also delivering utility.&nbsp;</p>
