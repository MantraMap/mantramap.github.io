The altcoin faced its last reversal from this support trendline on January 1st, which is also the starting point of ongoing recovery. The parabolic growth in ETH price accounted for a 33.3% rally within the last 3 weeks. In addition, significant growth in volume activity also highlights the buyers&#8217; strong interest in climbing to a higher level.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ascending trendline may assist ETH holders in maintaining an uptrend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the rising ETH price has recently regained the 200-day EMA slope</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.3 Billion, indicating a 76% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/dNStBj2d.png" alt="Ethereum Coin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.On January 14th, the coin price gave a massive breakout from the combined resistance of $1500 and 200-day EMA slope. Anyhow, the last time the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> was above the EMA was in April 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last two days, the coin chart has shown lower price rejection candles showing sustainability above the breach $1500 level. Today the coin price is 2.76% up and trying to follow up on the recent breakout. With sustained buying, the ETH price may rise another 5% to reach the $1670 resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is safe to assume the Ethereum coin price has witnessed a remarkable rally in a relatively short time. Therefore, it is likely the coin price may trigger a temporary pullback to stabilize the ongoing bull run.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the potential buyers should look:  out for the following resistance, such as $1670 and $1970 could be sweet work for sellers to wrestle trend control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential downfall may revisit the $1500 or $1420 support before the Ethereum price triggers the next bill cycle.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> soars into the overbought region, indicating buying activity needs to be stabilized to maintain a steady rally.?,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: Amid the recent recovery, the ETH price reclaimed the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200). Moreover, a bullish crossover of 20-and-100 days encourages more buying orders for Ethereum.</span></p>

The price of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/">crypto token</a> has reached its highest since November 11 when it hit $0.09 per coin. After witnessing an all-time low in 2022, the CRO token has increased by more than 51%, giving it a market valuation of more than $2 billion.</p>
<h2>Cronos (CRO) Price Surge</h2>
<p>Cronos (CRO) has achieved a monthly high of $0.083 in the previous 24 hours, amid the rising concerns of the company being on the brink of collapse, after its statement was issued, stating its workforce was being cut down by 20%. The announcement was released on Friday. As a direct result of the brewing bullish sentiment surrounding the token, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/">market capitalization</a> and 24-hour trading volume skyrocketed by 9.87% to $2 billion and 301% to $94 million respectively; demonstrating the growing interest in the market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135537" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/16233252/Screenshot-2023-01-16-233236.png" alt="" width="901" height="714" /></p>
<h2>Crypto.com&#8217;s Focus On Sustainability</h2>
<p>The concept of sustainability is gradually becoming more important in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> industry. In order to lower its overall energy usage and become friendlier to the environment, Ethereum made the switch to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism last year. This trend has been echoed by other crypto blockchains and protocols, with the latest being Crypto.com&#8217;s eight-year carbon removal agreement with Climeworks to neutralize the platform&#8217;s direct carbon emissions. The price of CRO saw a major uptick after the <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-purchases-technological-carbon-removals-to-advance-sustainability-efforts">announcement</a> was made on January 16.</p>
<p>In response to this development, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/crypto-com/">Crypto.com&#8217;s</a> President and Chief Operating Officer, Eric Anziani, stated that:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are committed to addressing the pressing climate challenge and continuously furthering our efforts.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></strong></em></p>
<p>In 2021, the platform made its first public pledge on the environment. Since then, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> has worked with carbon removal service providers, government officials, and even its own business partners like Shopify to evaluate, quantify, and plan for cutting back on its remaining emissions.</p>
<h2>Growing TVL &amp; Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The price of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cro/">CRO</a> has also increased as a direct result of the increased activity in the Cronos ecosystem. According to <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto-com">information</a> that was made public by DeFi Llama, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/tvl-total-value-locked/">total value locked (TVL)</a> in important Cronos dApps has been steadily increasing. For instance, VVS Finance has witnessed a rise of 12% in its overall TVL over the course of the past week. In a similar vein, the TVL for MM Finance, Single Finance, Beefy, and Veno Finance has increased by more than 20%. The TVL for Cronos is currently over $398 million, which is significantly lower than its all-time high of almost $4 billion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135540" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/17001425/Screenshot-2023-01-17-001409.png" alt="" width="1584" height="601" /></p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s worth mentioning that, in spite of the current upswing in the value of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a>, the company&#8217;s cash outflows have decreased by $12 million in the last 24 hours and by $156 million in the last 30 days. As things stand, the Cronos (CRO) price is currently being traded at $0.08132. This represents an increase of 11% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 28% during the week as per CoinGape’s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</p>

After facing multiple reversals from the pattern’s resistance trendline in the past six months, this bullish breakout hints at an early sign of trend reversal. Here’s how this chart pattern may influence the further price of SAND.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the channel patterns resistance trendline may set the SAND price to $1.5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown back below the trendline will weaken the bullish thesis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in SAND price is $409.6 Million, indicating a 10% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/b4LinSyH.png" alt="Sandbox Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent V-shaped recovery from the combined support of $0.38 and the pattern&#8217;s support trendline triggered a parabola rally in Sandcoin price. Amid this recovery, the altcoin price surged 83.5℅ to reach the current market value of $0.7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the rising SAND price breached multiple resistances and, just recently, the upper trendline of the channel pattern. This breakout shall offer suitable support for buyers to prolong the bullish rally. </span></p>
<p>Also Read- <a href="https://coingape.com/education/explained-what-is-physical-nft-and-how-to-sell-physical-items-as-nft/">Explained: What is Physical NFT? and How to Sell Physical Items as NFT</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, today, this altcoin is 3% down and triggered a minor pullback to stabilize the excess buying. This downfall may test the breached trendline and validate its sustainability above it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the post-retest rally may surge the sand price 15% higher to reach the $0.8 barrier. However, in theory, the channel pattern breakout may encourage a price rally to the highest swing top in the pattern. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, in a favorable bullish scenario, the SAND price may rise 114% higher to it hits $1.5</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal slopes rising high into the bullish territory reflect the market sentiment is gaining positive sentiment toward sandbox coins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band</strong>: the rising SAND price constantly hits the upper band of the indicator, reflects the buying activity is aggressive for the given time. This, a minor pullback, is required to stabilize the ongoing trend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandbox coin price intraday levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.69</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.8 and $1</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.645 and $0.53.</span></li>

It will help Binance regain institutional investors&#8217; confidence in the crypto exchange and the crypto market.</p>
<p>Institutional investors will have the option to post collateral with Binance Custody. As per the exchange, Binance Custody, an institutional-grade digital asset solutions platform, safeguards investors&#8217; crypto holdings.</p>
<h2>Binance Allows Institutional Investors Keep Collateral Off Exchange</h2>
<p>Institutional investors&#8217; confidence was hammered due to the collapse of crypto exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>. Sam Bankman-Fried appropriated customer funds through his crypto exchange FTX and trading firm <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alameda Research</a> causing the crypto market to crash further and investors to move away from the market.</p>
<p>Binance felt the impact on its products designed particularly for institutional investors. Moreover, institutional investors have not returned despite the latest rally in the crypto market.</p>
<p>Binance plans to allow institutional investors to keep the collateral for leveraged positions directly on Binance Custody. Crypto assets are kept held in cold wallets. Assets will become available for users once the trades are settled. Therefore, it will enable users to secure their crypto assets from hacks and exchange outflows during volatile market conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our clients are a lot more conscious of managing risks. We hear from our users that they love to trade on Binance, but at the same time they are getting ‘pressure’ from their internal risk control. For them to scale up further activities on Binance, they need to look for ways to help them diversify the on-exchange risks,&#8221; said Catherine Chen, the head of VIP &amp; Institutional at Binance.</p>
<p>Crypto exchanges need to work with external custodians to eliminate risks related to collateral ownership. Moreover, crypto regulations will help bring back institutional investors to the crypto market and introduce products to safeguard other investors and companies.</p>

<h2>Can Other Crypto Exchanges Follow?</h2>
<p>Binance being the largest crypto exchange is not just followed by crypto investors, but also by crypto exchanges. Other crypto exchanges may also follow suit and help bring back institutional investors to the crypto market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin saw an over 20% rally in the last 24 hours, but data suggest a lack of institutional participation in the crypto rally. Also, experts believe a recovery in the crypto market to $65K this year amid several events such as the Fed pivot. However, the recovery may not sustain without institutional investors&#8217; participation.</p>

The BTC price trend was able to build momentum and surpassed the psychological level of $20K.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours, the BTC price has been trading sideways after hitting a high of $21,345. However, on-chain data and analysts suggest more upside for Bitcoin. Can the BTC price rise above $65K by mid-2023?</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Turns Bullish</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price is trading strongly above the psychological level of $20K. However, the BTC price may witness some pullback due to the possibility of profit booking by investors.</p>
<p>In the daily timeframe, a breakout of the Bollinger Bands Squeeze in the last few days caused a massive rally in the Bitcoin price. As the bands are still diverging amid a rise in volatility, the BTC price will continue to move higher. However, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSI</a> indicates a high possibility of a pullback as it hit almost 90 in the overbought zone.</p>
<figure id="attachment_135473" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135473" style="width: 736px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-135473" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/16151801/BTCUSDT_2023-01-16_14-45-11.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="736" height="448" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-135473" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price in 1Hr Timeframe</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moreover, a crossover of 20-EMA over 50-EMA shows a continuation of the bullish trend. Finally, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bulls</a> have taken over bears and brought a recovery across the crypto market.</p>
<p>Crypto analysts <span class="account-inline txt-ellipsis">Michael van de Poppe and </span><span class="account-inline txt-ellipsis">Credible Crypto remain bullish on Bitcoin price. Michael van de Poppe believes the BTC price will pullback below $21K amid the bounce in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which is currently over 102.50.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you thought the run to 60k we had was aggressive wait till you see this 5th wave,&#8221; said Credible Crypto.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared two charts, a weekly and a monthly, predicting a Bitcoin price rally to $65K in mid-2023. As per Brandt, the BTC price will hit $25K and witness a correction to $18K. Thereafter, a rally to at least $65K can be witnessed. However, he also believes that it&#8217;s difficult to predict prices in the current market conditions.</p>

<h2>On-Chain Analysis of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>According to Glassnode <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1614763534315057152" target="_blank">data</a>, Bitcoin price is following its historical pattern despite experts remaining uncertain whether historical chart patterns apply to the current cycle.</p>
<p>Bitcoin traded below the 200-daily moving average (DMA) for 386 days in the 2018-19 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a>. Considering the last week&#8217;s rally, the BTC price is back above 200-DMA after 381 days.</p>
<p>Thus, there is a high possibility that Bitcoin has bottomed out and the next cycle has started. However, investors need to consider other factors before deciding to invest in the current market conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="628" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05230846/mana-and-decentraland-logo-1614900236158.webp" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="MANA token" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The metaverse tokens were one of the highest gainers of the early 2023 recovery rally. As a result, the Decentraland token(MANA) witnessed a significant inflow and triggered a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">U-shaped recovery</a> from the low of $0.287. Furthermore, the MANA has soared 136% since January 1st and currently challenges a multi-month resistance of $0.73. Is it safe to buy now?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Doji-type candle formation at $0.73  projects an intense supply pressure from above.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential pullback can tumble the MANA price by 14-22%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Decentraland token is $1.13 Billion, indicating a 132% rise.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/dSubZ6JO.png" alt="MANA Price" width="1814" height="778" /></strong>Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent recovery, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/decentraland/">MANA coin price</a> breached multiple resistances to sustain the higher levels of the price chart. Moreover, the steady growth in volume activity is accentuated by the buyers’ commitment to maintaining a steady rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the last two days, the MANA price has shown higher price rejection at the $0.73 resistance, suggesting the bullish momentum is getting exhausted. Therefore, potential buyers should be cautious before entering at this level, as the coin is likely to experience a minor pullback.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/education/explained-what-is-physical-nft-and-how-to-sell-physical-items-as-nft/">Explained: What is Physical NFT? and How to Sell Physical Items as NFT</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential correction is valid as this MANA price has witnessed exponential growth in a short period. Therefore, with the profit booking from short-term traders and stabilizing the ongoing rally, the MANA price could show a temporary downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the Decentraland token is down 2%, suggesting the ignition of the aforementioned reversal. This retracement could plunge the prices to $0.6 or 0.537 to recuperate the bullish momentum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, this downfall may offer a pullback opportunity for interested traders and reveal the formation of a famous bullish reversal pattern cup and handle.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> spiked into the overbought region, indicating this metacoin has witnessed an aggressive rally in a short period, and therefore a pullback can stabilize the excess buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the 200-day EMA moving around the $0.73 mark increases the resistance power of this level.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MANA coin price intraday levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.69</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.73 and $0.823</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.676 and $0.6</span></li>

The official Twitter account of the Shibarium blockchain introduces some basic concepts to the Shiba Inu community about the Shibarium before its launch. As a result, both SHIB and BONE tokens skyrocketed in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Shibarium Beta Launch Is Almost Here</h2>
<p>Shibarium Network, the official Twitter account for the Shibarium blockchain, in a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ShibariumNet/status/1614754595233832961" target="_blank">tweet</a> on January 16 revealed that the preparation for the Shibarium Beta launch is almost complete. The Shiba Inu community will get the Shibarium soon.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;Introduction to Shibarium: Shiba Inu&#8217;s Layer 2 Network — Rejoice </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a rel='nofollow'  class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShibArmy?src=hashtag_click">#ShibArmy</a></span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">! Shibarium Beta is about to be launched, and through this article we want to introduce some basic concepts in order to provide clarity to the community.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The Shib Inu ecosystem&#8217;s official accounts and core developer Shytoshi Kusama have been dropping hints about the launch of Shibarium in early 2023. The Shiba Inu team in an official blog revealed some basic concepts about the Shibarium blockchain and its launch.</p>
<p>While a final date for the Shibarium Beta launch is not revealed, the team said &#8220;we are approaching the finishing touches for Shibarium&#8217;s Beta launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shibarium’s Layer 2 blockchain will solve the problem of scalability and performance limitations of current existing blockchain networks. The SHIB ecosystem tokens SHIB, LEASH, and BONE will be the only tokens required for the Shibarium. It will have advantages in the metaverse, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dApps</a>, and gaming, with the evolution of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web3</a>.</p>
<p>Validators and delegators will have an instrumental role in the Shibarium blockchain. Validators will improve security by locking BONE tokens and operating Heimdall Validator and Bor block producer nodes.</p>
<p>As earlier announced, <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-official-shibarium-account-update-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BONE will remain</a> the only token selected to pay for gas transactions and reward Validators and Delegators within the Shibarium protocol. Moreover, all transactions on the Shibarium network will <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-shiba-inus-shibarium-beta-launch-almost-here-says-official-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burn more SHIB tokens</a>, which will drastically reduce SHIB <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/circulating-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulating supply</a>.</p>
<h2>SHIB and BONE Price Skyrockets</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) price jumped nearly 6% in the last 24 hours and over 20% in the last 7 days, with the price currently trading at $0.00001079. The 24-hour low and high are $0.00000985 and $0.00001099, respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) price skyrocketed over 15% in the last 24 hours. The BONE price is currently trading at $1.39, after hitting a 24-hour high of $1.42.</p>

The new exchange will focus on trading bankruptcy claims filed by crypto enterprises like Mt. Gox, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/celsius-2/">Celsius</a>, BlockFi and the latest FTX.</p>
<h2>Trading Bankruptcy Claims</h2>
<p>The announcement of the fundraising comes two months after the collapse of the crypto giant <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, which left more than a million debtors without their money. According to the pitch <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/7k8oW7r/gtx-pdf">deck</a>, the new exchange makes use of the current circumstances by providing depositors with the opportunity to transfer their FTX claims to GTX and earn immediate credit in the form of a token called USDG. The name of the exchange is a play on the acronym &#8220;FTX.&#8221; In fact, one of the pitch decks for GTX begins with the sentence &#8220;because G comes after F.&#8221;</p>

<p>GTX intends to fill the void in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> and enter the stock securities lending sector, which is estimated to be worth 2 trillion dollars. Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam, the founders of CoinFlex, a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> that is in the process of restructuring, have joined forces with the Three Arrows team to form a partnership. Other notable individuals, such as CTO Kent Deng, a former employee of Alibaba, Tencent &amp; Huawei and CMO Leslie Lamb &#8212; a former head of institutional sales at Amber Group, are also involved in the new project.</p>
<h2>3AC&#8217;s GTX Launching Soon</h2>
<p>Before the debacle of the Terra ecosystem in November of last year, Three Arrows Capital was one of the top hedge funds in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> industry. However, it currently suffers enormous losses as a result of the event. On January 5, the liquidators of 3AC were given permission by Singaporean authorities to serve subpoenas on the 3AC founders via Twitter. This authority was granted in response to an order from a bankruptcy court in the United States.</p>
<p>According to the decks, GTX will use Coinflex&#8217;s technology to establish the exchange, and a legal counsel to manage the onboarding of claims for all of the recent crypto companies that have gone bankrupt, such as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/blockfi/">BlockFi</a> &amp; Voyager. The new exchange is planning to begin operations likely in the month of February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="630" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/27235634/convex-finance-coin-social.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="CVX" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the majority of major cryptocurrencies, the convex finance coin started its recovery rally a bit late, that is, from the second week of January. However, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> made up for the lost time, as it witnessed a nearly perpendicular growth in the last ten days. This bullish reversal from the $3 psychological, psychological support surged the prices 64% to its current level of $4.9. Moreover, the buyers are currently trying to surpass the $5 barrier, which could encourage a further price rally</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Convex finance coin has been rising for ten consecutive days</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the $5 resistance may drive the CVX price by 22%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the Convex Finance Token is $12.3 Million, indicating a 45.2% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/q/QPTTCAv9.png" alt="Convex Finance Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Convex finance coin breached multiple resistances during the recent recovery rally, one of which was the downsloping trendline of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>. The altcoin wobbled within this bullish continuation pattern for the past five months before giving a bullish breakout on January 14th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish breakout accelerated the bullish momentum and assisted buyers in hitting the $5 psychological barrier. Moreover, the evident rise in volume activity defines a sustained rally, increasing the likelihood of prolonged recovery.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-7-crypto-marketing-firms-of-the-year/">Top Crypto Marketing Firms / Agencies 2023; Here’s Best Picks</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, a daily candle closing above the $5 resistance will accelerate the bullish momentum and encourage an uptrend continuation to $6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the higher price rejection attached to today&#8217;s daily candle indicates the exhaustion of bullish momentum. Therefore, if the CVX price remained below $5, it is more likely that it would witness a temporary pullback. This potential correction may revisit the $4.44 or $3.7 before resuming the price rally.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: The<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/"> daily RSI slope</a> skyrocketed into the overbought region, indicating aggressive selling in the market. Therefore a potential correction may stabilize the price trend before it continues to rise higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the rising CVX price showed a sudden spike above crucial EMAs(20, 50, and 100), gaining additional support for a potential pullback.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curve Finance Coin Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $4.9</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $5 and $6</span></li>

Recently, Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time.">market cap</a> has surpassed that of both Visa and MasterCard put together, thanks to the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency&#8217;s</a> recent price surge beyond the $20,000 threshold. However, there are a few on-chain metrics that are singalling red flags, indicating a possible hindrance to Bitcoin&#8217;s newfound price rally.</p>
<h2>Sell Pressure From Bitcoin Miners</h2>
<p>According to a hypothesis that was presented by a crypto analyst in a <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63c4306225ae9f606a879aff-An-increase-in-the-MPI-metric-indicates-an-increase-in-bitcoin-sales-by-miners">post</a> on CryptoQuant, Bitcoin miners could be exerting sell pressure on the market right now. The &#8220;Miners&#8217; Position Index&#8221; (MPI), which gauges the ratio between the miner outflows and the 365-day moving average of the same, is the prime indicator pertinent to this scenario.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;miner outflows&#8221; is used to describe the aggregate amount of Bitcoin that all of these chain validators are currently moving out of their wallets. In most cases, miners withdraw their coin stockpiles from reserves with the intention to sell them off on the open <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>. Because of this, a high value of the outflows may indicate that this group is currently disposing of substantial sums of BTC.</p>

<p>As a result of the MPI&#8217;s comparison of these outflows with their annual average, the value of the indicator can inform how the present miner&#8217;s selling compares with the average for the past 365 days. If the value of this indicator is high, it indicates that miners are selling at a greater degree than is typical at the moment. On the other hand, if the value of this metric is low, it may suggest that there is less selling pressure coming from these <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> validators than the mean for the previous year.</p>
<p>The following chart illustrates the movement of the Bitcoin MPI over the course of the last year and a half:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135526" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/16191247/MUVHnAz9_54bb8cfbd7394ac41216fc1a94b173af4897b78e1c3c50eaa24925cbae16518a.png" alt="" width="1280" height="806" /></p>
<h2>Incoming Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dump?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s Market Price Index (MPI) has recently experienced a sharp increase, as can be seen in the graph shown above. It has recently reached a value of roughly 4, which is the largest level that the indicator has seen since April of 2022. The fact that the metric has such a high value may indicate that miners are extracting a significantly higher volume of coins than is typical, and as a result, may be exerting an unusually high level of selling pressure on the market at the present moment. The previous time the indicator noticed high values were back during the collapse of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, when Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price saw a strong downward trend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135527" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/16191252/Qjl8X0NE_0b2f70741309beff5af7d1b17a8cc6a0a3f4ecae448f87258280ab8a1e20a0ed.png" alt="" width="1280" height="806" /></p>
<p>As things stand, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC) price</a> is currently being traded at $20,811. This represents an increase of 0.37% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 20.81% during the week as per CoinGape’s crypto market tracker.</p>

However, data depicts that the crypto whales are moving millions of XRP tokens amid the price jump.</p>
<h2>Whales scoop 123 million XRP</h2>
<p>As per the whaleAlert, multiple whale addresses cumulatively have moved around 429 million XRP tokens (approx worth $167 million) in the last 24 hours. The single largest whale transaction recorded has been of moving 209 million XRP (approx worth $81 million).</p>
<p>However, crypto whales went on to add $49 million worth of Ripple’s native token (123 million XRP) in multiple transactions. A whale address in a single transaction scooped 94.3 million XRP tokens (approx worth $38 million) from the Binance crypto exchange. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>XRP has been constantly printing green indexes over the past several weeks. <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-price-surge-ahead-whales-activity-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price have surged</a> by 12% in the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $0.385, at the press time. Ripple’s native token’s 24 hour trading volume has spiked by 55% to stand at $1.3 billion.

<p>Meanwhile, the transaction tracker has recorded several whale selling XRP transactions as well. Several whales cumulatively move 97 million XRP tokens (approx worth $37 million). It should be noted that all these whales sent their XRP holdings to the Bitstamp crypto exchange.</p>
<h2>BSC Whales on accumulation spree?</h2>
<p>WhaleStats reported that XRP token has emerged as the second largest crypto held by dollar value by the top 1000 BSC whales. The biggest of the BSC whales are now holding around $27.6 million worth of XRP. However, the LYO token is still the largest token held by these whales.</p>
<p>As per the data, XRP has landed on the tally of the<a href="https://www.whalestats.com/analysis-of-the-top-100-bsc-wallets/trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> top 10 cryptos puchased</a> by the largest BSC whales.

The developers have recently dropped the news of preparedness for the upgrade&#8217;s launch in March. The upgrade will mean that the staked Ethereum will be open for withdrawals. Meanwhile, the number of staked ETH hit a major milestone on Monday, along with the number of active Ethereum validators.</p>

<p>In this context, the Lido DAO token (LIDO) price saw huge gains in the recent past. The Ethereum liquid staking protocol benefitted with the anticipation around Shanghai upgrade. Compared to the $1 price range it maintained until the end of 2022, LIDO had recently doubled to around $2.10 currently.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Active Validators At Half A Million</h2>
<p>Ahead of the Shanghai upgrade, the ETH staked reached a major milestone. Ethereum had hit 500,000 validators whereas the <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1614869567695908865">total ETH staked</a> reached 16 million figure. While the recent price recovery in the crypto market translated into rise in ETH price, the cryptocurrency could be in for further rise ahead of the upgrade. As of writing, ETH price stands at $1,544, up 0.70% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">CoinGape price tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest that the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-chart-hints-9-pullback-enter-this-discounted-price/">next level of price resistance for ETH</a> could be found at $1,650. In the current rally seen since the New Year&#8217;s, the coin rose to a high of $1,573. While the previous resistance of $1,500 has been broken, it remains to be seen how long the cryptocurrency will take to breach the next resistance level. In the lead up to the Shanghai upgrade, it appears there is high chance of ETH breaking the resistance level.</p>

The move comes after the bankruptcy court approved the sale of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> subsidiaries, including FTX Japan and FTX Europe last week.</p>
<h2>Monex Group To Buy FTX Japan</h2>
<p>Monex Group Inc. expressed interest in buying FTX&#8217;s Japanese subsidiary FTX Japan, <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergAU/status/1614943408782557184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Bloomberg on January 16. The financial services firm has shareholders including <a class="Ui2TZ WCMfob oRJe3d" tabindex="0" role="link" data-ti="overview" data-ved="2ahUKEwiJ_tnBg8z8AhUuTGwGHZfQDn0QnZMFegQIWxAC"><span class="yKMVIe" role="heading" aria-level="1">Michael Novogratz&#8217;s </span></a>Galaxy Digital, Oasis Management, Nomura Asset Management, Invesco, and The Vanguard Group.</p>
<p>During an interview, Monex Group CEO Oki Matsumoto revealed that the company is interested in buying FTX Japan. He said it is always a “very good thing” if the number of crypto exchanges competing against his crypto exchange Coincheck declines. However, he didn&#8217;t disclose if Monex is bidding for FTX&#8217;s Japanese subsidiary.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-court-allows-ftx-to-sell-jap-european-subsidiaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX received court approval</a> to sell its Japanese and European subsidiaries, as well as other businesses, to return money to its creditors. According to a court filing, 41 parties have expressed interest in FTX Japan, with 25 entering confidential agreements with debtors.</p>
<p>As Japan continues to ease crypto regulations, Japan’s crypto market could grow massively with an increase in adoption. Moreover, companies may start to buy digital coins as investments and use non-fungible tokens for marketing.</p>
<p>Monex has been expanding globally and into new areas of business. It also owns Coincheck, Japan&#8217;s one of the top crypto exchanges, which is preparing to list on the Nasdaq Exchange.</p>
<h2>FTX Japan Plans To Return Customer Funds</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, FTX Japan had around $139 million in cash and deposits as of November 21. The exchange plans to <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-to-return-customer-funds-in-february-but-theres-a-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return customer funds</a> in February with the help of affiliated exchange Liquid Japan.</p>
<p>Customers will be able to withdraw their crypto assets from Liquid Japan after opening a new account. However, withdrawal may face delays due to a security audit, incorporating controls, reconciliation, and reviews.</p>

The owner of the house with a cryptocurrency theme, &#8220;CryptoHouse,&#8221; has reduced the price by more than 20% in recent months as they try to sell the property.</p>
<p>The &#8220;CryptoHouse,&#8221; as it is known on the flashing neon sign in the kitchen, was put up for sale in October last year for $1.2 million. However, as of January 5, it is now being offered for $949,000.</p>
<h2><b>CryptoHouse features Bitcoin and Ethereum wallpapers</b></h2>
<p>The four-bedroom, three-bathroom house has a spacious, open floor plan that listing agents boast is perfect for shrewd investors in the property description.</p>
<p>Its tasteful wallpaper choices include several <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a></strong> (NFTs) from the vintage <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/9-amazing-facts-about-bored-ape-yatch-club-nfts-that-you-didnt-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a></strong> (BAYC).

Also, these are mysteriously and perplexingly absent from the description. Each of the home&#8217;s four rooms has a themed wallpaper, including one for <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a></strong> (BTC), <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-is-vitalik-buterin-discover-eth-founders-home-net-worth-and-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a></strong> (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

He mentioned that their team assisted the Huobi team to freeze the hacker&#8217;s accounts in order to recover Bitcoins. However, Justin Sun, shadow owner of <a href="https://coingape.com/huobi-korea-severs-ties-with-parent-firm-will-ht-token-tank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huobi exchange</a> also shared details about this event.</p>
<h2>Binance Huobi foils hackers&#8217; attempt</h2>
<p>CZ stated that Binance detected <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-company-that-lost-84m-in-the-harmony-hack-recovers-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harmony One hacker</a> fund movement which earlier tried to launder through Binance. However, the hackers&#8217; accounts were frozen in both attempts. CZ and the team assist the Huobi team to freeze accounts.</p>
<p>He highlighted that in this course of actions around <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-moving-to-65k-heres-what-on-chain-data-and-analysts-suggest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">124 Bitcoin</a> (approx worth $2.5 million at press time). Binance CEO called it CeFi helping Defi SAFU. CZ added that both crypto exchange security teams are in constant contact with each other.</p>
<p>Justin Sun, TRON founder and Huobi’s shadow owner stated that they are proud of this <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1614901672102465538" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with Binance</a>. He called it a prime example of how CeFi can team up and work together in order to keep the crypto industry safe. However, he made sure that both exchanges will continue to work together to protect funds.</p>
<p>Earlier, a crypto tracker reported that the North Korean Lazarus Group was moving heavy amounts of digital assets over the last weekend. It mentioned that the group moved around 41k Ethereum (approx worth $63.5 million). The hackers under Railgund before consolidating funds to deposit these funds on three different exchanges.</p>
<h2>Will this event reassure investors?</h2>
<p>This development can be labeled as a positive event for the digital asset market as investors&#8217; sentiments were on a decline due to multiple scams and collapses last year.</p>
<p>However, the crypto market can see recovery as investors pick up the space. The cumulative market cap regained the $1 trillion level. Bitcoin price has surged by a whopping 22% in the last 7 days.</p>

<p>The fear and greed index can be used to evaluate stock market fluctuations and whether or not stocks are fairly priced. The theory is based on the idea that excessive fear tends to lower stock prices while excessive greed tends to have the opposite effect. To gauge investor sentiment in the stock market, CNNMoney created a fear and greed index. The website Alternative.me also created a crypto fear and greed index to measure investor sentiment in the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a></strong> market.</p>
<p><iframe title="What Is The Crypto Fear And Greed Index? (Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index)" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xwv0abKb2h8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>How to Understand the Fear and Greed Index in Crypto Markets</b></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptocurrency markets</a></strong> are heavily influenced by the emotions of buyers and sellers who actively trade in the market, so one piece of bad news can ruin the market or one piece of good news can send it to a new high. The emotions of<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/investing-in-nfts-a-beginners-guide-to-the-risks-and-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> buyers and sellers</a></strong> have a significant impact on and influence the markets for cryptocurrencies, which further results in a &#8220;Fear&#8221; and &#8220;Greed&#8221; type of situation. Multiple factors can cause such market sentiments to arise.</p>
<p>When major corporations begin to take an interest in <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a></strong>, &#8220;<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fomo-fear-of-missing-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fear of Missing Out</a></strong>&#8221; (FOMO) develops, which tempts the other retail participants in the market to make rash decisions. As a result, if people are bullish or act in a similar way under particular circumstances, there is a great chance to profit or take positions that are appropriate.</p>
<p>The crypto Fear and Greed Index enters the picture at this point. This index&#8217;s primary objective is to assess the current market sentiments among digital <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">token</a></strong> traders and assist them in determining their next course of action. It should be noted that the Fear and Greed Index does not respond strongly to long-term bull runs, but rather to recent global news events and transient fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<h3><b>Key Characteristics of the Fear and Greed Index</b></h3>
<p>Here are the characteristics of the fear and greed index:</p>
<ol>
<li>Evaluates the participants&#8217; market sentiment for cryptocurrencies.</li>
<li>Utilizes a number of metrics, including volatility, market momentum, volume, and very important social media sentiment.</li>
<li>Analyze market sentiments during periods of intense fear or excessive greed.</li>
<li>Aids participants in the cryptocurrency market in making informed decisions.</li>
<li>The index is calculated on a yearly, monthly, daily, and weekly basis.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>How the Fear and Greed Index Works</b></h3>
<p>Some investors use the fear and greed index as a tool to assess the market. It is predicated on the idea that excessive fear can cause stocks to trade for significantly less than their intrinsic values while unrestrained greed can cause stocks to be bid up significantly above what they should be worth. Since the index promotes a market timing strategy rather than a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/crypto-trading-strategies-heres-all-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy-and-hold strategy</a></strong>, some skeptics discredit the index as a reliable investment tool.</p>
<p>To determine how much fear and greed are present in the market, the fear and greed index looks at seven different variables. As follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stock Price Momentum:</strong> A measure of the Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (S&amp;P 500) versus its 125-day moving average (MA).</li>
<li><strong>Stock Price Strength:</strong> The ratio of stocks hitting 52-week highs to those hitting 52-week lows on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).</li>
<li><strong>Stock Price Breadth:</strong> A comparison of trading volumes in rising and falling stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Put and Call Options:</strong> The extent to which put options lag behind call options, indicating greed, or outperform them, indicating fear.</li>
<li><strong>Junk Bond Demand:</strong> Gauging appetite for higher risk strategies by measuring the spread between investment-grade and junk bond yields.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> CNN calculates the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) by focusing on the 50-day moving average.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Haven Demand:</strong> The difference in returns between stocks and government bonds.</li>
</ol>
<p>These seven variables are evaluated on a scale from 0 to 100. By averaging all of the indicators equally, the index is calculated. Anything higher than 50 indicates greater than normal greed, while a reading of 50 is considered neutral.</p>

<h3><b>Factors that Fear and Greed in the crypto market</b></h3>
<p>The following metrics serve as the basis for the Fear and Greed Index in crypto markets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Volatility</li>
<li>Volume</li>
<li>Surveys</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>Trends in Google Search</li>
<li>Dominance</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Volatility</h3>
<p>The fear increases with volatility. Extreme price swings for digital tokens are a sign of a jittery market and little interest from investors. The index calculates volatility and then compares it to the average over the previous 30 or 90 days.</p>
<h3>2. Volume</h3>
<p>More market greed is reflected in higher buy volumes. Consequently, more traders participate as cryptocurrency volume increases. Using the averages from the previous 30 or 90 days, the index calculates the current volume.</p>
<h3>3. Surveys</h3>
<p>User and investor opinions are most important and have a significant impact on the price of digital tokens. The market becomes overly greedy as a result of the index&#8217;s upward acceleration due to more positive surveys.</p>
<h3>4. Social media</h3>
<p>Information based on cryptography is extremely time-sensitive, and the various social media platforms frequently play a significant role. Social media sites like &#8220;<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-is-elon-musk-discover-tesla-founder-investments-net-worth-and-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a></strong>&#8221; have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency markets. Instead, one tweet has the power to set the tone for the market or crash it completely.</p>
<h3>5. Trends in Google Search</h3>
<p>The final value of the Fear and Greed Index also includes Google search trends. More market greed is likely to be observed the more interest there is in digital tokens. For instance, rising Google BTC searches have been accompanied by sharp price fluctuations in digital tokens.</p>
<h3>6. Dominance</h3>
<p>As far as cryptocurrency markets go, Bitcoin is the face of them. The Fear and Greed index thus measures the power of Bitcoin in the entire market in order to assess the general sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. The market is more likely to be fearful when Bitcoin has a higher dominance, and greedier when Bitcoin has a lower dominance.</p>

<h2><b>Pros of a Fear and Greed Index</b></h2>
<p>It is a trustworthy indicator of market changes, as suggested by behavioral economists. For instance, the Dot Com bubble was an instance in which consumer greed dominated the market and resulted in an internet bubble.</p>
<p>It can be utilized as a tool for selecting investments. Using this index, an investor can leverage buying and selling opportunities. Extreme anxiety among investors can signal a buying opportunity, while greedy investors can signal that a market correction is overdue.</p>
<h2><b>Cons of a Fear and Greed Index</b></h2>
<p>It is viewed less as an investment research tool and more as a barometer for market timing. Market volatility is increased by frequent stock trading as a result of fear and greed indexes. They add that historical evidence demonstrates that such a strategy yields less favorable results.</p>
<h3><b>How Do Fear and Greed Impact Investor Decisions?</b></h3>
<p>Fear and greed are the two main emotions that affect investors, and many investors are emotional and rash. According to some research, fear and greed can prompt change by causing us to ignore reason and self-control. Fear and greed are potent motivators when it comes to people and money.</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has undoubtedly been in a bearish trend since the end of 2022, and the biggest coins, including BTC, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a>, ETH, and SOL, have continued to experience huge losses due to worries about the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/is-ftx-crash-an-end-of-crypto-how-this-debacle-unfolded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact of the FTX</a></strong>, inflation, and liquidity concerns. The Fear and Greed Index can be of great assistance in assessing the sentiment of the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger crypto market</a></strong> and forecasting future movements with useful insights to deal with situations where the market is experiencing prolonged bearish trends.</p>
