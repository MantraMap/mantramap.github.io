<p>Duba, UAE, 6th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Today, LandX has deployed smart contracts for the final stage of the LandX testnet launch. The &ldquo;Dress Rehearsal&rdquo; testnet went live on Ethereum&rsquo;s Goerli network.</p>
<p>The testnet token launch will take place from the 7th December 2022 and will be conducted in four stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stage 1 - 7th Dec 2022 - LNDX Launch For Omega Farmers (Discord Group)</li>
  <li>Stage 2 - 10th Dec 2022 - LNDX Launch For Alpha Farmers (Discord Group)</li>
  <li>Stage 3 - 13th Dec 2022 - LNDX Launch For Whitelisted addresses&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Stage 4 - 16th Dec 2022 - LNDX Launch on Uniswap Decentralized Exchange</li>
</ul>
<p>Allocations are limited and will be made on a first come first serve basis. The final stage of the testnet will be very similar in functionality to the mainnet deployment.</p>
<p>Following the testnet token launch, the trading competition will go live. From the 16th of December, investors will be able to compete for thousands of dollars in prizes. The top ten investors that gain the most from an ROI perspective will earn cash prizes (full terms to be confirmed at launch).</p>
<p>To participate in the testnet users are welcome to use the testnet USDC faucet at https://landx.fi to get an allocation of USDC to trade and stake LandX testnet products. Note that testnet funds do not hold value and are used for testing purposes only.</p>
