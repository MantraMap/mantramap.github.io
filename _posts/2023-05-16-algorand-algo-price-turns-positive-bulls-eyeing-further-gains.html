Algorand (ALGO) has recovered from the bearish trend seen at the end of February 2023. From February 21 till May 8, ALGO recorded a loss of 45.13%, dropping to a low of $1.592. Despite the crash, buyers still pushed up the price of ALGO by more than 6% in the past few days. Traders are optimistic and are eyeing the next move in the current trend, while the bears are slowing building momentum by holding their strong short position. Will The Bulls Maintain This Current Bullish Momentum? The sustainability of ALGO&#8217;s current price trend relies on several factors. Market conditions, such as supply and demand dynamics, overall economic factors, and external events, can generally influence the price. However, the current market sentiment is bullish, while the Fear &#38; Greed Index is 45, indicating neutral. This means the market&#8217;s state is stable, and the volatility is not high. Within the last 24 hours, Algo&#8217;s general market cap gained 1.57%, rising to over $1 billion. The 24-hour trading volume surged by 15% overnight, rising to about $33 million.

As more investors and traders buy the asset, the increased buying pressure can lead to a rise in its price. The increase in trading volume suggests improved liquidity for the asset, which tend to attract more investor to the market.  ALGO Technical Analysis The price is below the 200-Day and 50-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This suggests that ALGO market sentiment is still bearish; the selling momentum is stronger than the bull&#8217;s buying momentum. However, the asset might rebound if the bulls increase their momentum, as green candles are showing today in the chart. The Relative Strength Index oscillator is showing 40.18. This means the asset is currently at neutral levels; the pressure from bulls and bears is normal.

The histogram confirms the bullish sentiment as its showing green candles and also above zero. ALGO trades between its primary support and resistance levels of $0.1587 and $0.1853, respectively. The next key zones are the support level &#8211; $0.0992 and the resistance level &#8211; $0.2427. Recent Development In The Algorand Ecosystem Alogrand recently introduced a new plugin-based tool for enhancing Blockchain Data Access named Conduit. Conduit aims at providing improved access to blockchain data. It is an upgrade to the conventional one-size-fits-all Indexer, designed as a modular plugin-based tool.  This plugin empowers decentralized applications (DApps) by offering precise and tailored data retrieval capabilities, all while maintaining cost-effective deployment options. Such developments on the network could increase adoption and utility and, in time, boost ALGO&#8217;s price. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com
