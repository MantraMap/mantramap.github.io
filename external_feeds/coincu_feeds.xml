<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Paxful&#8217;s new interim CEO, Roshan Dharia, aims to strengthen operations and explore strategic alternatives.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform previously experienced a short conflict between former CEO Ray Youssef and co-founder Artur Schaback over the use of exchange funds in early 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>The conflict led to blocked salaries and resignations from certain teams and contractors, and Yousseff allegedly shut down Paxful on his own accord before stepping down.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On May 30th, Paxful announced that Roshan Dharia will be the company&#8217;s interim CEO. </strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1024x640.jpeg" alt="Paxfuls Interim CEO" class="wp-image-191104" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1024x640.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-300x188.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-768x480.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-750x469.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1140x713.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Breaking News: Paxful&#039;s Interim CEO Promises Brighter Future for Crypto Traders! 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The new CEO will be responsible for enhancing operations and identifying strategic alternatives. Roshan Dharia expressed his excitement about his new role, stating, &#8220;I am thrilled to become the CEO of Paxful. I plan to hit the ground running and build on the innovative technology created by the Paxful team.&#8221; Roshan previously served as a senior executive at TrustToken, which is well-known for being the creator of TrueUSD (TUSD), the fifth-largest stablecoin in terms of market capitalization.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="646" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1.jpeg" alt="Paxfuls Interim CEO 1" class="wp-image-191106" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1.jpeg 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1-300x194.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1-768x496.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Paxfuls-Interim-CEO-1-750x485.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Breaking News: Paxful&#039;s Interim CEO Promises Brighter Future for Crypto Traders! 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Interestingly, the onboarding of the new CEO was not without controversy. The former CEO &#8211; Ray Youssef, took to Twitter to criticize the company&#8217;s decision to appoint Roshan. Youssef tweeted, &#8220;PF has a new defi CEO…expect a token soon.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting that Ray Youssef has no involvement in Paxful&#8217;s business decisions, and he advised users to approach Roshan directly with any concerns.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paxful has a new defi ceo. Expect a token soon.

</div></figure>



<p>Paxful has had some issues in the recent past. Youssef had a disagreement with co-founder Artur Schaback over the use of exchange funds in early 2023. This led to blocked salaries and resignations from certain teams and contractors. Yousseff allegedly shut down Paxful on his own accord when it halted services on April 4th. He subsequently resigned from his role and committed his funds to a public trust that would be used to repay users.</p>

<p>It was on May 31 that the co-founder of the RPG series Illuvium, Kieran Warwick, released a statement in the Discord community that he had raised an additional $10 million in funding from Framework Ventures.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="645" height="331" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png" alt="Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures" class="wp-image-191102" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png 645w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" title="Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The money raised will accelerate the development of this game. This transaction is completed through a token, which will be locked for two years and will not be included in the commit, so it will not participate in the distribution of benefits.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Illuvium is an entirely decentralized collectible and role-playing game built on the Immutable X L2 network. Illuvium is about to launch a public beta with three interactive AAA games: Zero (city builder), Overworld (monster world), and Arena (arena).</p>



<p>Founded last year by Kieran and Aaron Warwick, this RPG has created a game that rewards players with the chance to discover and capture NFT creatures, known as Illuvials, in combat. The game incentivizes players to have a stake in the project, as the Illuvium network allows in-game fees to be paid out to staked token holders as ongoing rewards.</p>

<p>In March 2021, Illuvium successfully raised $5 million in a seed round led by one of the oldest venture capital funds in the decentralized finance, Framework Ventures. The project has also received financial support from IOSG Ventures, LD Capital, Delphi Digital, YBB Foundation Ltd, Stake Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, Lotus Capital, Blocksync Ventures, Bitscale Capital, Quantstamp, Yield Guild Games, Bitcoin.com, …</p>



<p>In mid-April 2022, Framework Ventures, a backer of Illuvium and Stardust, said it would invest $200 million in blockchain game projects following the launch of a $400 million fund.</p>

<p>The exchange initially sent a series of test transactions involving all these assets to Alameda on May 23, with the transactions being worth $10 each. These transactions were intended to return FTX and Alameda&#8217;s frozen funds on the OKX platform. In March, OKX seized $157 million in cryptocurrency assets after FTX collapsed in November 2022. The latest transfers continue OKX&#8217;s efforts to return these funds to their rightful owners.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Alameda Research is transferring its leftover funds to Coinbase. In the past week, the bankrupt firm has transferred $10 million worth of USDT from its cold wallets to Coinbase Prime and deposited $31.2 million to the U.S.-based exchange. According to Arkham Intelligence, Alameda has transferred more than $250 million to Coinbase over the past month.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>A Coinbase user&#8217;s statement about a privacy violation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not receive much support from the judge.</em></li>



<li><em>The ruling strengthens the IRS&#8217;s authority over financial data collection, potentially setting a precedent for future privacy challenges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US District Court Judge Joseph N. Laplante dismissed Coinbase user James Harper&#8217;s request to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to obtain personal data from <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191053-former-coinbase-settles-charges-with-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> in a ruling.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-1024x575.png" alt="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data" class="wp-image-191078" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-1024x575.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-750x421.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The IRS obtaining his data through subpoenas does not violate Harper&#8217;s right to a fair hearing or protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>



<p>However, in his most recent judgment, Laplante sided with the IRS, and he stated that Harper had no standing to claim an interest in the records under the Fourth or Fifth Amendments. Harper&#8217;s claim of a privacy violation was further weakened by the judge&#8217;s assertion that Coinbase was the rightful custodian of Harper&#8217;s account documents.</p>



<p>Judge Laplante noted that Harper voluntarily disclosed his information to Coinbase. Additionally, the company&#8217;s privacy policy warns against possible government expropriation, and this significantly undermines Harper&#8217;s view that disclosure to Coinbase is voluntary.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="885" height="497" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png" alt="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data" class="wp-image-191079" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png 885w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-300x168.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-768x431.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" title="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This reaffirms the broad authority that the IRS has, allowing it to issue subpoenas in a variety of circumstances. The ruling strengthens the IRS&#8217;s right to collect financial data, potentially setting a precedent for future privacy challenges.</p>



<p>In addition, the judge dismissed Harper&#8217;s claim of a breach of due process and stated that Harper did not have any property rights to the record. Even if he had such rights, the summons would be significantly restricted, requiring court approval.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the plaintiff, James Harper, opened accounts on exchanges like Coinbase in 2013 and received Bitcoin as income for his consulting work. In 2016, the IRS issued a subpoena to this exchange seeking anonymous taxpayer information, which Coinbase initially denied, leading to a second legal pursuit by the IRS to ensure compliance.</p>

<li><em>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has requested a Bahamas specialty waiver after Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) proposed new criminal charges against him for violating an extradition agreement.</em></li>



<li><em>Some charges could be dropped if the Bahamas objected.</em></li>

<p>Former FTX SBF CEO has challenged his criminal charges after being extradited from the Bahamas. The US Department of Justice is <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/148/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking a specialty waiver</a> from the Bahamas to allow certain cases to proceed.</p>



<p>Since the SBF was extradited last December, prosecutors have filed a number of alternative indictments against him on new charges.</p>



<p>SBF, which<a href="https://news.coincu.com/186038-sbf-asks-us-judge-drop-criminal-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has pleaded not guilty</a> to criminal charges, including bank fraud, is awaiting trial in October. The crypto prodigy was formally arrested in the Bahamas and later extradited to the United States, where he is currently located under house arrest at his parents&#8217; home in California.</p>



<p>The FTX founder recently countered a number of criminal charges against him, arguing that the government had &#8220;inappropriately added&#8221; &#8220;several new, unrelated allegations without concurrence.&#8221; that was the clear intention of the Bahamian government.&#8221; He has offered to dismiss 10 of the 13 criminal charges against him.</p>

<p>US prosecutors say they will not pursue certain charges against the founder of FTX if the island nation says they violated the terms of his extradition. They acknowledged in court documents filed Monday that some charges could be dropped if the Bahamas objected.</p>



<p>Although prosecutors argued that Bankman-Fried could not challenge the charges based on his extradition, they noted that the Bahamian government could prevent parts of the case from continuing. The judge is expected to hear arguments on the matter on June 15.</p>



<p>Prosecutors said the Bahamas was the only party involved in the Bankman-Fried trial that could raise valid objections to the newer charges on grounds related to the extradition agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC announced that former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi and his brother had agreed to settle allegations of insider trading.</em></li>



<li><em>Wahi received a two-year jail term earlier this month after pleading guilty to similar criminal counts.</em></li>



<li><em>In Wahi&#8217;s insider trading case, Coinbase has not been accused of any misconduct.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The brothers were detained last year on suspicion of wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with an insider trading scam. The SEC filed insider trading accusations on the same day. According to the SEC&#8217;s release on Tuesday, the two agreed to disgorge their earnings and pay interest.</p>



<p>They pled guilty to the allegations brought by the Department of Justice, and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186281-former-coinbase-manager-2-years-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ishan Wahi</a> now faces a 2-year term, while Nikhil Wahi is serving a 10-month sentence. The SEC said that the brothers&#8217; criminal fines satisfied the civil case settlements and that it would not pursue any further penalties.</p>



<p>Wahi&#8217;s SEC cooperation agreement covers his own case as well as any relevant judicial or administrative process or inquiry started by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party, implying that he may participate in the separate probe.</p>

<p>SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal said in a statement that the suspected conduct is not new.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We allege that Ishan and Nikhil Wahi, respectively, tipped and traded securities based on material nonpublic information, and that’s insider trading, pure and simple. The federal securities laws do not exempt crypto asset securities from the prohibition against insider trading, nor does the SEC. I am grateful to the SEC staff for successfully working to resolve this matter,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The SEC alleged in its initial complaint against Wahi last year that the tokens at the center of the insider trading allegations were unregistered securities, which means the SEC could try to hold Coinbase liable for facilitating the sale of unregistered security investments for the tokens that the company eventually listed.</p>



<p>The settlement ended the court action that was supposed to determine whether nine of the cryptocurrencies at the core of the dispute were, in fact, securities, as the SEC alleged. Ishan Wahi contended in his first answer to the SEC complaint that the tokens were not securities.</p>



<p>Coinbase postponed any SEC action last month by suing the agency for a response to a petition for crypto-specific regulations. The case is being fought by the SEC.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, Bybit has been expanding its services. Earlier on May 2, it announced it would start offering crypto lending services to users. In March, the company partnered with Mastercard to offer a new debit card for crypto payments.</p>



<p>Bybit also proceeded to grow its activities after acquiring regulatory permits in Kazakhstan. On May 29, the exchange announced that it had received pre-approval from Kazakhstan&#8217;s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA) to serve as a digital asset trading facility and asset holding service provider at the Center.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The CFTC&#8217;s Division of Clearing and Risk published a staff recommendation on the risks associated with growing digital asset clearing.</em></li>



<li><em>In the future, the agency is expected to play a stronger role as an industry watchdog.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) employees are <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8708-23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encouraging</a> corporations to be mindful of and aggressively prevent dangers from clearing digital asset transactions.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1674.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="639" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1674.png" alt="CFTC Determined To Prevent Emerging Risks In Cryptocurrency" class="wp-image-191047" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1674.png 960w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1674-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1674-768x511.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1674-750x499.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="CFTC Determined To Prevent Emerging Risks In Cryptocurrency 32"></a></figure></div>


<p>The CFTC&#8217;s Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR) issued the advisory on Tuesday, stating that it would place a special emphasis on emerging risks in cryptocurrency in response to an increase in the number of its supervised entities clearing such trades. These hazards include possible conflicts of interest, cyber-threat prevention, and how corporations manage the physical delivery of digital assets in transactions requiring delivery.</p>



<p>According to the agency:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;DCR expects DCOs and applicants to actively identify new, evolving, or unique risks and implement risk mitigation measures tailored to the risks that these products or clearing-structure changes may present.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The derivatives regulator oversees crypto futures directly and has enforcement authority over fraud and manipulation of spot markets for trading non-security crypto assets.</p>



<p>It is anticipated to play a larger role as an industry watchdog in the future, but legislation to increase its jurisdiction has yet to pass through Congress. When such a regulator gives a public warning about particular behaviors, it is often followed by punishment in that field.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184605-cftc-issues-largest-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFTC</a> has already taken major enforcement actions against cryptocurrency companies, most recently against Binance&#8217;s global operations.</p>

<p>CFTC earlier authorized the Eurex FTSE bitcoin index futures, with trading for US-based investors commencing yesterday.</p>



<p>The trade started early on 17 April outside of the US. The contract was created in partnership with FTSE Russell and Digital Asset Research (DAR).</p>



<p>US players may now take advantage of expanded trading and hedging options. This includes increased access to more participants and liquidity pools during European, North American, and Asian business hours.</p>



<p>With this approval, Eurex becomes the first exchange in Europe to offer bitcoin index futures. The new futures contracts are traded in both euros and US dollars, have a contract multiplier equal to one Bitcoin (BTC), and settle in cash with no position limitations on expiration.</p>

<p>Alex Svanevik, CEO of the blockchain data platform Nansen, stated on Twitter on Tuesday that his business had made the &#8220;extremely difficult decision&#8221; to decrease the number of its workforce. According to the article, around 30% of the firm&#8217;s employees would be laid off.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This week we announced the extremely difficult decision to reduce the size of the Nansen team.<br><br>I’m endlessly grateful to the incredible people we are parting ways with. They will go on to achieve great things, and we&#39;ll ensure they get a soft landing, with severance and support.</p>&mdash; Alex Svanevik <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f427.png" alt="🐧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@ASvanevik) <a href="https://twitter.com/ASvanevik/status/1663565124970610688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 30, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to LinkedIn statistics, the firm, which was founded in 2020, employed between 51 and 200 people prior to the layoffs. This personnel enabled the business to evaluate more than 100 million wallets across blockchains such as Polygon and Ethereum for its customers, which included media outlets like Bloomberg and The Block, as well as crypto-centric funds such as Polychain.</p>



<p>But the end has arrived, and it is now time for Nansen to slash operating expenses as well, with one out of every three workers being forced to hunt for new employment. Other consequences of a bear market that, although it seems to have ended in terms of pricing, is still reaping victims at the upper echelons of the crypto-sphere.</p>



<p>The two primary reasons for the decision, according to Svanevik, are the fact that Nansen has expanded beyond its original scope and the consequences of the &#8220;crypto winter,&#8221; which adversely harmed the whole digital assets business during 2022.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673-1024x683.png" alt="Nansen Cuts 30% Of Staff Due To Difficult Market Context" class="wp-image-191044" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1673.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Nansen Cuts 30% Of Staff Due To Difficult Market Context 37"></a></figure></div>


<p>The first is an expansion and growth of the group&#8217;s operations, while rivals have already opted to curtail significantly. The CEO said that the business would revert to the fundamental operations that distinguished Nansen&#8217;s inception.</p>



<p>He adds a few additional words to the second reason:</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Although we&#8217;ve seen diversification of revenues via enterprise and institutional customers in the last year, our cost base is too high relative to where the company is today. We do have several years of runway, but our priority is to build a sustainable business.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We believe we need to make organizational changes to create the right conditions for those who stay with us,” Svanenik continued.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Svanevik further claimed that he accepts full responsibility for the errors committed but that Nansen is still a young and learning organization. He also emphasized his company&#8217;s goal to build &#8220;the best workplace in crypto.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite the changes, Svanevik believes the firm still has many years to create a viable operation. Nansen is far from the first digital asset company that has had to decrease its employment due to the &#8220;crypto winter.&#8221; The first significant wave of layoffs in the crypto industry occurred in January 2023.</p>



<p>Genesis, a subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group, revealed at the start of the year that it is decreasing its personnel by 30% due to the FTX contagion. Just a few days later, the biggest publicly listed cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, announced a similar layoff of up to 900 workers.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange has spoken to some of its professional customers about a setup enabling them to use bank deposits as collateral for margin trading in spot and derivatives. Swiss-based FlowBank and Liechtenstein-based Bank Frick have been mentioned as potential intermediaries for the service. </p>



<p>Institutional digital-asset traders have been pressing for change after the abrupt collapse of FTX late last year left many with huge losses. Crypto exchanges operate differently than traditional finance in that they not only facilitate trading but also keep assets in custody, settle transactions, and offer credit, increasing the risk of widespread pain should they fail. </p>



<p>Safe custody and segregation of client assets have also been the focus of Asian and European regulatory proposals, while Nasdaq Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., and Fidelity Investments offer or build crypto custody solutions for institutions.</p>

<p>According to sources, the proposed setup hasn&#8217;t been finalized and could change, but under one version of the proposal Binance has discussed, clients&#8217; cash at the bank would be locked up through a tri-party agreement. At the same time, the exchange lends them stablecoins to serve as collateral for margin trading. </p>



<p>They said that the cash kept with the bank could then be invested in money-market funds to earn interest, helping compensate for the cost of borrowing crypto from Binance. The move by Binance comes as centralized cryptocurrency exchanges face growing pressure from clients seeking ways to guarantee they&#8217;d be insulated from potential failure.</p>
