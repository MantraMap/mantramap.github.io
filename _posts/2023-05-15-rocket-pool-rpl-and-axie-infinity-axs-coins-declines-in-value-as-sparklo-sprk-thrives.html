<p>Every day, the crypto market springs up a new trend, and every day, investors seek means of navigating the market for profit. While coins like Bitcoin (BTC) have become huge and established, there are other coins showing promise of achieving the heights of established tokens.</p>
<p>Today, Rocket Pool (RPL) and Axie Infinity (AXS) are losing the faith of investors as their price value continues to go down in numbers. However, that cannot be said for Sparklo (SPRK) which is currently in its presale phase and gathering momentum as more investors look at investing in the project.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool (RPL) Experience Sharp Downward Trend in 24 Hours</p>
<p>The last 24 hours have seen Rocket Pool (RPL) lose -3.2% in its price value. This recent development is contrary to Rocket Pool's (RPL) rallying price in recent weeks. Standing at a current price of $46.38, Rocket Pool (RPL) is in a healthy run barring the downturn of the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rocket Pool (RPL) has experienced a +2.71% increase in price value in the last week and a 10.73% increase in the last 30 days. However, it is yet to be seen whether the latest downturn could signify the beginning of a bearish run.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool (RPL) has recently deployed an Atlas upgrade which lowered the amount of collateral required for Ethereum staking. This upgrade saw a rally in price. However, it looks like the effect of the upgrade has died down at the moment.</p>
<p>The market cap of Rocket Pool (RPL) stands at $896.51M and a trading volume of $8.13M in the last 24 hours. The circulation supply is 19.33M.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Axie Infinity (AXS) Continues to Witness Dwindling Price Action</p>
<p>In the past year, Axie Infinity (AXS) has maintained a constant loss in the price of the token. While the last 24 hours have seen Axie Infinity (AXS) lose -1.9% of its price value, the trend is a long-established one as it has lost -3.6% in the last 7 days, -18.7% in the last 14 days and -11.0% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Standing at a current price of $7.59, Axie Infinity (AXS) has also witnessed dwindling statistics outside the market as the number of gamers that play the Axie Infinity game has gone down. Sources from Asia reported that Axie gamers in the Philippines are abandoning the Axie Infinity (AXS) game as they no longer make as much profit as they once did.</p>
<p>The market cap of Axie Infinity (AXS) is $877.924M while the trading volume of the last 24 hours is $29.996M. The circulating supply is 115.661M.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) Thrives as More Investors Troop in to Invest in the Project</p>
<p>Sparklo has continued to entice crypto investors as word spreads of the potential that the Sparklo project harbors. Still in its presale phase, Sparklo will be the first investment platform that allows investors to invest in real-world assets like Silver, Gold, and Platinum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sparklo project will be an innovative blockchain investment platform with the potential to be the next blue-chip cryptocurrency in the industry. At just a price of only $0.017 per SPRK token, investors can jump on the presale phase before the price surges to an all-time high.</p>
<p>As most experienced investors know, investing in projects early is where significant gains are made. What's more, investors stand to get a 30% bonus once they purchase the token from now till the 5th of May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that investors will be getting 1300 SPRK when they purchase 1000 SPRK. That's why you need to take advantage of the ongoing bonus and purchase the coin now. After the 5th, the bonus won't be given again to those that buy the coin.&nbsp;</p>
