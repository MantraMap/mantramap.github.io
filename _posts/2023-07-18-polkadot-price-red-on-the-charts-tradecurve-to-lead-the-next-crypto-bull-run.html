<p>Despite the latest crypto market recovery, Polkadot (DOT) has been trading in the red region losing all its gains from the beginning of 2023. The charts have shown a notable decline in the price of Polkadot, leaving investors curious about its future trajectory. However, analysts have predicted that another token, Tradecurve (TCRV), will lead the next crypto bull run.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Polkadot (DOT) Price Analysis: Why Is Polkadot Going Down?
<p>Over the past week, the price of Polkadot l has been range-bound, fluctuating between $5.00 and $5.50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the launch of Polkadot 2.0, the token has faced significant bearish pressure, evident in the long wick on its July 6th candlestick, suggesting selling pressure during intraday rallies. According to CoinMarketCap, the current price of Polkadot stands at $5.12, reflecting a 6.34% decline over the past seven days.</p>
<p>Although Polkadot's price has dipped below the moving averages recently, there are indications of a potential recovery as the token experiences a modest 0.88% increase in the last 24 hours. Moreover, trading volume on the network has witnessed an 8.30% surge within the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Currently, Polkadot has surpassed the 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $5.05, yet it still remains below the 200-Day SMA at $5.72.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A positive sign would be a breakout above the $5.15 mark, signaling solid demand. In such a scenario, the bulls would likely attempt to drive the pair towards $5.64. On the downside, if bearish pressure lingers, the token could drop to $4.74.</p>

Tradecurve (TCRV) To Lead The Next Crypto Bull Run
<p>As Polkadot gears up for a rebound, market experts have predicted that Tradecurve could lead the next crypto bull run, surpassing the likes of Bitcoin. The market's belief in the potential of Tradecurve stems from its plan to bridge the crypto and traditional financial sector.</p>
Why Tradecurve (TCRV) Can Rally By 100X
<p>While platforms like Binance and Coinbase already offer derivative options and futures for cryptocurrencies, Tradecurve seeks to expand this offering by incorporating a wide range of instruments from the traditional financial market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These instruments encompass commodities, indices, stocks, ETFs, forex, and cryptocurrencies, enabling traders to access a more diverse and comprehensive portfolio. Tradecurve gains the ability to tap into the OTC derivatives market worth over $632 trillion in 2022. It does so by introducing derivatives tied to traditional financial instruments,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve also has other features like copy trading, AI algorithmic trading, high leverage, and a metaverse trading academy. Tradecurve has attracted significant attention. This is with a projected price surge of 50x during the presale phase and up to 100x upon the launch of the trading platform,&nbsp;</p>
Experts Opinion: Time To Take Advantage
<p>Currently trading at $0.018, a 100X price increase could propel the token's value to $1.8, potentially propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization before the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Savvy investors have recognized the opportunity and have already acquired millions of TCRV tokens, positioning themselves early for potential gains.</p>
