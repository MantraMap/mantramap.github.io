<p>Bloomberg reports the new office will open later this year and will be led by Sriram Krishnan, one of the firm&rsquo;s general partners. &nbsp;</p>
<p>a16z said in a statement:</p>

<p>While there is still work to be done, we believe that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation. The UK also has deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and a strong entrepreneurial culture.</p>
<p>It is home to more &ldquo;unicorns&rdquo; than Germany, France, and Sweden combined; to some of the world&rsquo;s largest financial markets and pools of capital; and to highly-sophisticated, world-class regulators. All of these make the UK strongly positioned to lead in web3.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Sunak welcomed the firm&rsquo;s decision and underscored the UK&rsquo;s commitment to establishing the country as the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s Web3 centre.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we cement the UK&rsquo;s place as a science and tech superpower, we must embrace new innovations like Web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the economy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Crypto Firms Are Being Driven Offshore
<p>The US SEC recently launched severe regulatory action against two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. On June 5, the agency filed suit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for alleged securities violations. The following day, the agency filed a similar case against Coinbase. It charged the exchange with &ldquo;the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The US&rsquo;s aggressive approach led the market to spiral, with major altcoins seeing double-digit losses.</p>
UK&rsquo;s Regulatory Approach
<p>Recognising the need for regulatory guidance, crypto firms such as Coinbase have long asked the US to provide clarity regarding crypto assets. The US has, however, been reluctant to comply, which only creates further tension in the industry.</p>
<p>Crypto firms have, therefore, been testing the waters in other countries where guidance has been offered.</p>
<p>When Prime Minister Sunak was still Chancellor of the Exchequer, he made it clear that he would guide the UK into becoming a safe space for digital assets where innovation and industry development are encouraged. While the UK has been lagging in regulatory guidance compared to the European Union, it has recently published several planned regulations.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury Committee released a report in May advising the government to regulate retail crypto trading not as financial assets but as gambling instruments. The Committee said that unbacked mainstream crypto assets and their inherent volatility pose a risk to investors and threaten economic stability.</p>
<p>Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) released a set of crypto marketing rules that take effect on October 8.</p>
<p>Under its stricter marketing guidelines, the agency banned incentive bonuses, free NFTs and airdrops for promotional purposes and introduced a &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period for first-time crypto buyers.</p>
