<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A memo was recently sent to Democrat Committee Members informing them of what is expected of the United States House Committee on Financial Services regarding cryptocurrencies. This memo was circulated before the joint meeting between several relevant U.S. House Committees including House Financial Services Committee and House Agriculture Committee which was held on May 10th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the ‘key messages’ highlighted in the memo, Vaughan believes that Democrats are only trying to </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WayneVaughan/status/1656361299733803009"><span style="font-weight: 400">destroy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> crypto with all that they are requesting.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Democrats are trying to kill crypto and Bitcoin. Sad. <a href="https://t.co/MkHkn1QCma">https://t.co/MkHkn1QCma</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Wayne Vaughan (@WayneVaughan) <a href="https://twitter.com/WayneVaughan/status/1656361299733803009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the key messages embedded in the memo include assertions from the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services that all cryptocurrencies are securities, just as Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has been </span><a href="https://coingape.com/sec-vs-cftc-gary-gensler-wants-to-treat-all-pos-crypto-as-securities/"><span style="font-weight: 400">propagating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Also, it is expected that the House Committee supports the U.S. SEC in everything that pertains to crypto regulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The memo addressed Republicans who are proposing a cut in the budget by making allowance for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the crypto space. This set of individuals was described as being unserious about protecting investors and consumers. Markedly, this further highlights the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-cftc-to-regulate-crypto-sec-chair-drops-hints/"><span style="font-weight: 400">competition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> between CFTC and SEC on the superior authority over the crypto space.</span></p>
<h2><b>Tussle of Power Between CFTC And SEC</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of focusing on releasing pro-crypto regulation in the coming month, committee Republicans have been advised to stick to passing a clean debt ceiling bill. However, a new US Supreme Court consideration has been mulling the idea of </span><a href="https://coingape.com/us-supreme-court-agrees-to-abolish-us-sec-cftcs-powers/"><span style="font-weight: 400">curbing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the power of both regulatory entities over the crypto market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two regulatory watchdogs have been initiating several enforcement actions on crypto-related platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Global crypto leader Binance together with its CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao was indicted some months ago by CFTC over regulation violations. Kraken <a href="https://coingape.com/kraken-to-shut-down-this-feature-as-settlement-with-sec/">suffered a similar fate</a> in the hands of the U.S. SEC, and so did American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase which received a Well Notice from the same regulator. It is worth noting that the SEC still has an </span><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripples-new-prediction-on-end-date-of-sec-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ongoing case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with Ripple over the categorization of XRP as securities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another key message in the memo stated that there has been mass non-compliance with regulatory laws amongst crypto firms. Furthermore, it was clarified that there is no need for additional laws other than the existing ones.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="800" height="480" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/11022313/BTC.png" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are ongoing rumors that the United States government has just parted with 9800 Bitcoin (BTC) in a sale that reportedly raked in $277 million. The supposedly sudden </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WhaleWire/status/1656353977821196288?cxt=HHwWgMCz5djKxvwtAAAA" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of that quantity of BTC in the crypto space caused the value of the coin to begin its depreciation and is currently trading at $27,687.83 down by a marginal gain of 0.84%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the U.S. government sold the BTC, the price of the digital currency shot up beyond $28,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the rumors, the U.S. government will still have a total of over 200,000 BTC. However, if the decision to sell this massive BTC in the long run is reached, it may cause the price of Bitcoin to plunge further down to less than $10,000. Such huge BTC sales usually causes mixed directions amongst crypto enthusiasts especially those who holds a significant percentage of the coin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time around, several responses to the WhaleWire tweet indicates that the Bitcoin sales, if  true, will be a welcome development. In the mean time, BTC is still taking a bullish stance and has a medium level of volatility based on today&#8217;s price </span><a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-price-analysis-multiple-resistances-put-btc-price-under-10-downside-risk/"><span style="font-weight: 400">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<h2><strong>U.S. Government Selling Confiscated BTC</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This happens to be the second time the government is selling this same quantity of BTC. As per a screenshot shared by WhaleWire on Twitter, three weeks ago, the U.S. government sold 9800 BTC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of these cryptocurrencies were seized in what the government called criminal operations. In November 2022, about 50,000 BTC were confiscated from crypto criminal James Zhong. Notably, this was not the first time that such an incident is happening. Way back in 2014, the federal government also sold off 30,000 BTC which it secured from the same source.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time, American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase was tapped as the platform which the government leveraged to complete the sales. Again in March, it was reported that about 40,000 BTC in wallets linked to the U.S. government were </span><a href="https://coingape.com/nearly-40000-bitcoins-belonging-to-us-government-are-on-the-move/"><span style="font-weight: 400">on the move</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was however, discovered that a significant portion of the coins were being transferred internally while the others were on Coinbase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During that time, Glassnode noted that “approximately 9,861 $BTC seized from the Silk Road hacker have been sent to our Coinbase cluster.”</span></p>

Buterin has been an important figure in the blockchain world since he co-founded ETH in 2014, and his influence over the direction of the project can not be understated. As such, any news related to Buterin and Ethereum tends to cause a stir among investors and traders alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to a May 10 </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1656297861536169984?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400">tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Lookonchain, &#8220;0xD04d&#8221; a wallet address linked to Vitalik Buterin transferred 3,500 ETH worth about $6.56 million to another address &#8220;0x9e92&#8221; in its last tranche of transfer to the wallet address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, the information also reveals that the Buterin-linked wallet has since December 2022 made a total transfer of 17,800 ETH amounting to about $33 million.</span></p>
<h2><b>Is a sell-off incoming?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recently, there have been rumors circulating that Buterin is planning to sell a significant portion of his ETH holdings, which could have a major impact on the market. For one, it is not clear whether Buterin is actually planning to sell any of his Ethereum holdings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While there have been rumors to this effect, there has been no official confirmation from Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation. Likewise, even if the founder was to sell some of its ETH, it is not clear how much of an impact it would have on the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recall that a few days ago, Ethereum Foundation and Buterin </span><a href="https://coingape.com/historical-data-suggestethereum-foundation-vitalik-buterin/"><span style="font-weight: 400">moved over </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">15k ETH to Kraken. This move raised FUD in the crypto community with many thinking that an ETH price and meme coins crash could be coming.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ethereum co-founder Dumps Memecoins</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Earlier in March Vitalik </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-creator-vitalik-buterin-dumps-multiple-memecoins-is-a-crypto-crash-imminent/"><span style="font-weight: 400">sold most of the shitcoins in his wallet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> prompting the coins including MOPS, CULT, and SHIK amongst others to get rekt. Vitalik&#8217;s action was criticized by crypto Twitter as the community argued that the selloff impacted the low-value projects and the investors who owned them</span></p>

<p>The House Financial Services Committee has scheduled two crucial hearings as US-based crypto firms plan to move offshore amid regulatory crackdowns and the banking crisis risking an economic catastrophe.</p>
<h2>US House Blames Biden Administration for Crypto Regulatory Unclarity</h2>
<p>The U.S. House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion &amp; House Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development have <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408758" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">scheduled</a> the hearing &#8220;<b>The Future of Digital Assets: Measuring the Regulatory Gaps in the Digital Asset Markets</b>&#8221; on May 10.</p>
<p>Republicans Warren Davidson and Mike Flood have written a letter to the Biden Administration’s Council of Economic Advisors asking for clarity on &#8220;how the FedNow Instant Payment System and a Central Bank Digital Currency could provide a more inclusive financial system than digital assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also seek answers over a recent shift in position regarding the benefits of digital assets and distributed ledger technology. The House Financial Services Committee has blamed the Biden Administration, especially action against crypto by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Mike Flood asserts digital assets are crucial for the digital economy in the future, but recent crackdowns and lack of regulatory clarity are making firms move offshore.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Digital assets are at the heart of our digital economy’s future, but the Biden’s Administration’s response is driving innovators out of America and into the hands of international competitors. </p>

<h2>Musk&#8217;s Tweet Sparks NFT Rally</h2>
<p>The entry-level price for the collection on crypto markets quickly increased from 3.75 ETH ($6,920) to 5.70 ETH ($10,371), as seen by statistics from the leading <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a>. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://nftpricefloor.com/milady" rel="nofollow">information</a> obtained, sales of Milady NFTs increased by a factor of 500% over the previous twenty-four hours as of Wednesday afternoon, and the floor price increased by nearly half.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s not the first time that Musk has used Twitter to cause a jump in digital asset prices; the Milady meme comes as the most recent example. After Musk <a href="https://coingape.com/elon-musk-changes-twitter-logo-to-dogecoin-doge-price/">updated</a> Twitter&#8217;s official logo to feature the popular canine meme depicting a Shiba Inu dog, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">price of Dogecoin</a> rallied over the course of the previous month.</p>

<h2>Milady NFT&#8217;s Past Controversy</h2>
<p>In recent times, the Milady <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/">NFT collection</a> has been shrouded in numerous controversies. The NFT prices dropped drastically last May after the inventor of Milady Maker &#8212; Charlotte Fang &#8212; admitted that she ran a pseudonymous Twitter account in which she sent racist and abusive messages.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK, full disclosure: I was Miya. And its toxic baggage that’s hurting Milady community &amp; poisoning the vibe. I apologize about trying to hide the past account—Miya has nothing to do with Milady Maker &amp; should stay that way so I’ll be stepping down from the team from here.</p>

<p>Miladys are a type of profile-pic (PFP) NFT that consists of around 9,823 NFTs displaying faces like those of young children with anime-styled wide eyes.</p>

From the peak of $0.000208, this downfall tumbled the coin price 61.7% to hit the $0.00008 psychological support. However, with the recent uptick in the crypto market, the buyers are likely to rechallenge the dynamics resistance trendline and determine whether the LUNC price will prolong this correction or trigger a new recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the overhead resistance trendline is intact the LUNC price may witness a longer correction`</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the trendline will reflect a shift in market sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $99.8 Million, indicating an 85% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/sJXq7n3z.png" alt="LUNC Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falling LUNC coin price recently found support at the psychological level of $0.00008. bullish reversal from this support has surged the prices 15.2% up to currently trade at the $0.000092 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained buying, the coin price may rise another 10% to challenge the overhead resistance trendline. The prices have turned down thrice from this dynamic resistance indicating the traders are aggressively selling at bullish pullbacks.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-cryptos-private-sale/">Best Cryptos Private Sale For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the coin holders should keep a close eye on this trendline for any signs of rejection that will indicate the resumption of the correction phase which most likely plunge below the last swing low of $0.00008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakout above the trendline will hint at an early sign of trend reversal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> reverted from the oversold region reflects that market participants are accumulating the coin at discounted prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exponential Moving Average:</strong> the 20-and-50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> acts as a dynamic resistance to assist sellers to prolong the bearish fall.</span></p>

With the massive LUNC burn by the protocol near the <strong>Terra-LUNA crisis anniversary</strong>, the total LUNC burn has surpassed <strong>57 billion</strong>.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic (LUNC) Burn Rate Rises</h2>
<p>On May 1, <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-burns-billions-terra-classic-tokens-massive-price-rally-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance burned 1.27 billion LUNC</a> as part of its monthly LUNC burn mechanism. After Binance burn, the total LUNC burn reached 55 billion and burns contributed by Binance reached <strong>31.83 billion</strong> LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>The LUNC burn rate continue to rise after the Binance burn, as the community burned new millions of LUNC through the new project <strong>DFLunc Protocol</strong> as it begins to attract attention. It is a DeFi protocol consisting of multiple smart contracts and aims to deflate LUNC supply through a continuous burn mechanism.</p>
<p>DFLunc Protocol is also a validator for Terra Classic that allows users to mint its <strong>DFC</strong> token only by burning LUNC tokens. It utilizes two smart contracts based on <strong>CosmWasm</strong> — DFLunc and CW20-DFC. Users burn LUNC by paying <strong>USTC</strong> as protocol fees to mint DFC tokens.</p>
<p>The protocol has divided its plan into different stages that ultimately aimed toward the growth of its validator on the Terra Classic chain.</p>

<p>With the protocol keep burning LUNC, the total burned by the community has now reached 57 billion LUNC tokens. As per the transactions seen by CoinGape Media, the protocol is still burning LUNC through its <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finder.terra.money/columbus-5/address/terra1u27kgxl68z39vvzgdkxccu6aqdwwayf0samuwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact address</a>.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Prepares for Massive Upside Move</h2>
<p>Along with these burns, the <strong>Joint L1 Task Force</strong> preparing to <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-set-core-upgrade-price-soars-over-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrade the Terra Classic network</a> to <strong>v2.0.1, </strong>which includes <strong>Cosmos SDK v0.45.13</strong> <strong>Columbus-5</strong> and <strong>Tendermint v0.34.24</strong> upgrade and minimum initial deposit for governance proposals, and enhanced code maintainability.</p>
<p>The Terra Classic blockchain will halt at block 12,812,900, estimated on May 17 at 14:03 UTC. It is followed by the Cosmwasm 1.1.0 Parity upgrade on May 31 to allow projects and builders across Cosmos and Terra Luna 2.0 to once again build on the Terra Classic chain. The Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) was already opened with other chains earlier, but there are still several developments left as the <a href="https://coingape.com/official-terra-classic-lunc-revival-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terra Classic Revival Roadmap</a> planned by core developer Edward Kim.</p>

The total aggregate assets of the Group total at least $81,833.149,345, while total liabilities amount to $ 79,390,359,036 of which US$ 79,372,401,626 relates to digital tokens issued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While commenting on the update, Tether&#8217;s CTO, Paolo Ardoino highlighted that the firm’s net profit is evidence of the platform&#8217;s strength and stability. Additionally, Ardoino stated that the firm will continue to assess the risk-adjusted return on all assets regularly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, he said Tether intends to make more modifications as the broader economic situation changes and the market cycle develops as part of its routine, and continuing risk management operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly, the update comes shortly after the company </span><a href="https://coingape.com/tether-reports-700m-profit-zero-commercial-paper/"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a $700 million profit in Q4 of 2022.</span></p>
<h2><b>Tether’s Increases Reserve Despite Controversies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite its profit, it is important to note that Tether has been the subject of some controversy and scrutiny in the past, particularly regarding the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/tether-refutes-allegations-of-inadequate-stablecoin-reserves/"><span style="font-weight: 400">transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of its reserve holdings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In August, an article suggested that crypto companies are not quite transparent when it comes to their financial statements. In response to these concerns, Tether has taken steps to increase transparency by releasing regular attestations that provide information about the composition of its reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, Tether was </span><a href="https://coingape.com/tether-bitfinex-usdt-banking-access-wsj/"><span style="font-weight: 400">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of utilizing forged paperwork and shell firms to get banking access when they were unable to access the international banking system.</span></p>

Earlier, Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, delivered his opening remarks saying &#8220;The goal here is to make law.&#8221; Steil recalled US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler&#8217;s response to the Committee, stating that there were no clear no rules for crypto market.</p>

<h2>No Clear Rules For Crypto</h2>
<p>Recalling Gensler&#8217;s response on his view on future of crypto regulation, Bryan Steil <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i43Ckphd9vo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Gensler failed to explain a path forward. The hearing, titled &#8220;The Future of Digital Assets: Measuring the Regulatory Gaps in the Digital Asset Markets,&#8221; featured Marco Santori, Chief Legal Officer, Kraken exchange as well as Michael Blaugrund, Chief Operating Officer, New York Stock Exchange. Both the executives explained before the subcommittee the need for clear crypto laws in the United States.</p>
<p>Steil went to the extent of saying Gensler apparently did not even trade a digital asset himself ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;May be one of the only things we learned was that Chairman Gensler never traded a digital asset himself. We don&#8217;t know what Gensler&#8217;s plans are and there&#8217;s no clear rules in front of us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Santori said his company was finding it difficult to operate in terms of determining resources without a comprehensive Federal plan on the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>. Adding to this, Blaugrand said the SEC should find an on-ramp to allow existing cryptocurrencies to come into the regulatory framework, describing the current scenario as a &#8220;chicken and egg problem.&#8221;</p>

This pattern created a consolidation phase for over three weeks and its end meeting on a bearish note intensifies the underlying selling momentum in the market. Here’s how long the BTC price is threatened to correct under the influence of this pattern.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index plunged to 52% reflecting fear sentiment among traders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $25000 support stands as a crucial accumulation phase for market participants.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $15.3 Billion, indicating a 5.43% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/ylkmXXmd.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Analysis " width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the potential target for short-sellers when the asset price breached the support trendline is the same price distance present between the largest swing high within the pattern shot from the breakdown points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, under ideal conditions, the Bitcoin price is poised for a 13.5% downfall to hit the $24600 mark. However, the potential downfall may face significant support at a 4.2% down level at $27000 or a 10% down level at $25200.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-web-3-phones-and-their-specifications/">Top Web 3 Phones And Their Specifications</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the Bitcoin price is 2% on intraday and currently trades at $28242. This sudden rise is likely associated with the lower-than-expected annual <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-ethereum-price-rises-as-us-cpi-inflation-falls/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">U.S. CPI data</a> for April 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the price currently retests the breached support trendline to check price sustainability after the breakdown. If the sellers manage to hold below the flipped trendline, Bitcoin is likely to hit the aforementioned targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, on the upside, the buyers need to breach the triangle’s pattern both support and resistance trendlines retake trend control</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> acts as dynamic resistance undermining the efforts of buyers to reach a higher level.</span></p>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> wavering below the midline reflects the sellers are having a dominant hand</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $28178</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $31200 and $34600</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $27000 and $25000</span></li>

The order was acquired by Su Zhu, who was a co-founder of the now-defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/three-arrows-capital/">Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</a>.</p>
<h2>$6 Million In Question</h2>
<p>After the failure of the fund a year ago, the former CEO of BitMEX has been vehemently tweeting against Su Zhu and his co-partner Kyle Davies, mostly seeking for the 6 million dollars that he believes is entitled due to the fund&#8217;s collapse following the <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-ust-repeg-proposal-price/">Terra UST</a> debacle.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Bitcoin, Ethereum Price Rises As US CPI Inflation Cools To 4.9%" href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-ethereum-price-rises-as-us-cpi-inflation-falls/" rel="bookmark">Bitcoin, Ethereum Price Rises As US CPI Inflation Cools To 4.9%</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The ruling that was issued by Judge Sandra Looi Ai Lin of the Harassment Court stipulates that Hayes will not be permitted to establish contact with Zhu through any means, and that he is prohibited from releasing &#8220;any identity information.&#8221; According to the injunction, Hayes can have the ruling delivered to him through his Twitter account.</p>
<h2>Arthur Mocks 3AC Founders</h2>
<p>The 38-year-old crypto entrepreneur has publicly criticized about 3AC&#8217;s debacle and even mocked their future endeavors. In one of these tweets, dated May 2, Hayes stated that they owed $6 million to him which apparently went ignored.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Awe that&#39;s sweet, is that your way of using symbolism to represent the $6 million you owe me? 1 Oyster = $1 million &#8230; <a href="https://t.co/ehWJ4wUfXB">https://t.co/ehWJ4wUfXB</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1653333363401584642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to documents filed with the court, 3AC is responsible for paying individual claimants in excess of one billion dollars. In the interim, Zhu and Davies made preparations to develop <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/opnx/">OPNX</a>, a platform that enables investors to trade bankruptcy claims for defunct businesses such as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/celsius-2/">Celsius</a>, BlockFi, etc. Meanwhile, Hayes has established his own crypto fund called Maelstrom.</p>

The wager comes in the midst of mounting concerns about the possibility of a recession that can exert pressure on international markets.</p>
<h2>Royal Group Bearish On US Stocks</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/uae-s-royal-group-shorts-us-stocks-on-global-recession-fears" rel="nofollow">report</a> published by Bloomberg, the multinational conglomerate helps to manage one of the most enormous family fortunes in the world through a huge network of subsidiaries. In addition, the investment firm initially intended to invest as much as $10 billion in equities and other assets located in the United States and Europe that had been battered by fears of a global recession.</p>

<p>However, things have taken a sharp turn as the Royal Group has now adopted a more negative stance on US equities and moved most of its portfolio into short-term US Treasury bonds. Reports suggest that the company, which is chaired by the National Security Adviser of the United Arab Emirates &#8212; Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan &#8212; is also increasing its investments in commodities and cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s goal is to capitalize on the jittery market sentiment that has developed as a result of the failure of four US institutions and the growing likelihood of a slowdown in economic activity around the world. At press time, there was no clear information on the stocks or sectors Royal Group was betting against.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Price In Danger?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price of Bitcoin</a>, with few exceptions, has generally mirrored the performance of the US stock market. Earlier, cryptocurrencies have been impacted by greater market turbulence, whether it was brought on by the COVID-induced market meltdown in March 2020 or the Black August in 2011.</p>
<p>However, one could argue that in recent times, the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has behaved in a manner that is inverse to that of Wall Street. Bitcoin showed a positive reaction to the banking crisis that occurred in the United States, which resulted in the demise of many notable banking institutions like <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/silvergate-capital/">Silvergate</a>, Signature &amp; <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/silicon-valley-bank/">Silicon Valley</a>. Moreover, the flagship cryptocurrency appeared to decouple itself from the overall market fall.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not the wider US equity market will have an impact on the price of Bitcoin depends on the key question &#8212; if there will even be a so-called recession in the first place. As things currently stand, Bitcoin’s price is exchanging hands at $28,116 with a market cap of $545 billion.</p>

However, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released the annual <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-ethereum-price-rises-as-us-cpi-inflation-falls/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation</a> for April at 4.9% which is lower than the market expectation of 5% causing an uptick in the crypto market. Thus, the SUI price received a significant inflow and reclaimed the $1.17 chart level as support, creating a fake breakdown scenario in the market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hourly chart shows a new higher low formation in SUI price indicating an early sign of trend change as per Dow Theory.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout from the $1.17 resistance intensifies the underlying buying pressure for an 8% rise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the SUI  coin is $626.6 Million, indicating a 37% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/UgXLnszC.png" alt="SUI Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hourly time frame chart, the <a href="https://coingape.com/sui-token-unlocks-more-exchange-listings-can-it-breach-1-4/">SUI price</a> shows a massive breakout from the $1.17 resistance with a significant surge in trading volume. This bullish breakout clearly undermines the breakdown mentioned above and indicates the buyers are currently moving the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the aggressive short-sellers who entered at $1.17 must have gotten trapped with the recent price surge and their stop loss would bring more buying orders in the market. Thus, if the coin price shows sustainability above the $1.17 barrier and interested traders can look for a long-entry opportunity. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the bullish momentum persists, the SUI price may witness a sharp 8% rise to challenge the next significant resistance of $1.27.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> back above the midline reflects a sustained buying pressure in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With the price jump, the SUI price reclaimed the 20 and 50 <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>, offering an additional confirmation for buyers.</span></p>

The frenzy around the cryptocurrency is now spread to various other memecoins, while the rest of the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> has been in a lull as Bitcoin price saw sideways movement in the past few weeks.

<p>On Wednesday, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> saw positive momentum as it went past $28,000 mark following the US CPI data. For the month of April 2023, the annual US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation came in at 4.9%, lower than the 5% expected figure. Whereas PEPE, with a 103% rise over the last 7 days, has been witnessing sideways pattern since its Binance listing.</p>

<p>In terms of asset listing of PEPE, the two major platforms that are yet to take the initiative are Robinhood and Coinbase. Popular influencers in the crypto market are speculating on the prospect of Robinhood listing the memecoin next.</p>

This comes just before the court hearing for Kwon&#8217;s travel document forgery charges in Montenegro is set for May 11.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon Assets Frozen</h2>
<p>The assets include Kwon&#8217;s Seoul residence, real estate, imported cars, securities deposited with Mirae Asset Securities, deposits with Woori Bank, and crypto assets in cryptocurrency exchanges. Authorities also alleged that Kwon and Terraform serviced unregistered financial securities.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decision means Kwon cannot move or sell the assets and properties equivalent to the amount of his alleged illegal profits, which will be confiscated following a guilty verdict.</p>
<p>The director of Seoul Southern District&#8217;s joint financial crimes team told The Wall Street Journal last week that Kwon could face over 40 years in prison if convicted, the heaviest sentence given to a financial crime in South Korea&#8217;s history.</p>
<h2>Charges Against Terra Founder</h2>
<p>The Terra founder is facing charges of orchestrating a cryptocurrency fraud both in the US as well as South Korea. He was <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-ceo-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-airport/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested</a> on March 23, 2023, in Podgorica, Montenegro.</p>
<p>Kwon has denied all the allegations against him, stating that mistakes were made in the Terra-Luna crypto project managed by his Terraform Labs, but they were not designed to deceive investors. However, according to the latest reports, there have been incidents that <a href="https://coingape.com/do-kwon-knew-about-terra-luna-collapse-beforehand-heres-proof/">prove Kwon knew beforehand</a> about the collapse of the network.</p>
<p>Eyes are on the court hearing in Montenegro for Kwon’s travel document forgery charges that will take place tomorrow. Overall, with this move, it appears that the South Korean authorities are taking a strong stance against white-collar crimes in the country.</p>

Moreover, the annual core inflation rate drops to 5.5% in April after rising 5.6% last month.

<h2>US Consumer Price Index (CPI) Falls To 4.9%</h2>
<p>The CPI inflation rate increased to 4.9% in April, as compared to the market consensus of 5%. It is the lowest since April 2021. The <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-jumps-lower-than-expected-us-cpi-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual inflation in March fell to 5%</a>, indicating a possible Fed pivot in the coming months as inflation cooled. However, the US Fed raised interest rates by another 25 bps and increased risks for banks and the economy. The cooling inflation will the Fed a green signal to cut rates soon as the debt ceiling and banking crisis risks looming.</p>
<p id="description">The energy index decreased by 5.1%, and the food index increased by 7.7%. Compared to the previous month, the CPI rose 0.4%, much higher than 0.1% in March but matching market expectations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the core inflation rate also fell to 5.5% in April from 5.6% in the prior month, matching market estimates. The fall in both CPI and core inflation rate led the market to rally higher, with futures linked to US stock market indexes rising almost 1% and the crypto market reverse losses.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin, Ethereum Price Rebounds</h2>

The pullback is showing sustainability above the 61.8% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> indicating the investors are interested in buying this memecoin at a dip. Here’s what the technical analysis project about the potential rally in the PEPE price</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a massive rally, the significant correction was important for Pepecoin to check price suitability and recreate the bullish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completion of ascending triangle pattern may kickstart a new bullish recovery </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the PEPE is $1.42 Billion, indicating a 292.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6sMJB7x6.png" alt="Pepecoin" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-price-analysis-crucial-levels-to-watch-as-pepecoin-enters-correction-mode/">Pepecoin price</a> is currently hovering above the combined support of $0.00000184 and 61.8% FIB level trying to obtain suitable footing at this level. The 61.8% FIB level may not reflect a healthy retracement but can offer a strong launchpad to raise the prices higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the narrow consolidation above the $0.00000184 shapes an ascending triangle pattern in the hourly chart. This pattern is one of the famous bullish continuation patterns which increases the underlying buying momentum in the coin.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-cryptos-private-sale/">Best Cryptos Private Sale For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this pattern, the Pepecoin price is likely to breach the $0.0000021 neckline resistance offering a signal to resume a bullish recovery. This breakout could surge the PEPE price to the $0.0000027 mark and encourage buyers for further growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below the pattern’s support trendline will offset the bullish thesis and trigger a longer correction phase</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20 <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope near the $0.0000021 neckline increases the resistance strength of this level.</span></p>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The diminishing gap between the falling <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) lines reflect the decreasing bearish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pepecoin Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.00000191</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Down</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.0000021 and $0.00000235</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.00000185 and $0.0000016</span></li>

<p>On Tuesday, May 9, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz announced moving their operations outside the US citing a difficult regulatory environment. The Bitcoin bull and billionaire investors said that following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, the US regulators have taken a high-handed approach to regulating the crypto market. In a conference call, after the company&#8217;s first-quarter earnings, Novogratz said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I look at the short term, we still have a regulatory headache in the United States. I don&#8217;t see that breaking anytime soon. We still have a hangover, as well, from the denting of trust that FTX and other bad actors in the space created&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further added that digital assets have entered into a period of &#8220;stasis&#8221; currently in the US since the regulatory and financial watchdogs will continue to &#8220;regulate with lawsuits&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Crypto Firms Rushing Out of the US</h3>
<p>As said, the US regulators have been going heavily after crypto firms post the FTX fallout. It has also been targeting some of the top players like BinanceUS, Coinbase, Kraken, and many others.</p>
<p>Galaxy Digital is now building a team of traders in Hong Kong, where regulators are taking crypto-friendly measures to encourage more firms to set up a base. Of course, Hong Kong recently said that there won&#8217;t be any <a href="https://coingape.com/hong-kong-regulator-warns-crypto-firms-wont-allow-light-touch-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8216;Light Touch&#8217; approach</a> and that crypto firms will have to follow the existing rules. More and more crypto firms are choosing Hong Kong because they are bringing regulatory clarity into place.</p>
<p>Galaxy Digital is not the only crypto giant looking to shift base out of the US. In an interview earlier this week on Monday, May 8, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that the firm is evaluating UAE as a potential crypto hub.</p>
