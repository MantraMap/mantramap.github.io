<p>Fidelity has adopted digital assets more quickly than the majority of other major financial firms, and in October it announced plans to add 100 more <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> professionals to bring the total size of its digital asset team to 500.</p>

<p>In spite of the prolonged <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/#:~:text=A%20bear%20market%20refers%20to,and%20a%20strong%20market%20downtrend.">bear market</a>, Fidelity is continuing to expand its holdings in the space. The waiting list for Fidelity Crypto, a cryptocurrency product oriented toward retail clients, was opened back in November by the conglomerate.</p>
<h2>Fidelity&#8217;s Crypto Push</h2>
<p>In April, the firm made headlines when it announced that they are considering <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> for inclusion in its 401(K) plans as a potential investment option. It was then requested by three <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> senators that the decision to enable retirement plan members to invest in cryptocurrencies be reconsidered and negated. According to the senators, the industry has grown increasingly &#8220;volatile, tumultuous and chaotic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally in October, Fidelity Digital Assets started facilitating the trading of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> for its institutional customers as well. The new disclosures that Fidelity has made in relation to the metaverse are certainly noteworthy given the fact that the company manages assets worth $2.7 trillion.</p>

If the coin price rebounds from this level, we can consider this support as a high accumulation zone. However, can a potential recovery lead SOL price to $15</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish reversal from the $11 may drive the Solana price by 15% higher/</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily- candle closing below the $11 mark will invalidate the bullish thesis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $121.2 Billion, indicating a 15% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is Solana&#8217;s price falling? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the FUD surrounding Solana due to the FTX crypto exchange crash, the SOL market value suffered a significant blow and plunged to the $11 mark. However, recently as the crypto market has been going through a state of uncertainty, the Solana coin remained weak and continued the downward journey. Moreover, this current downfall must be backed by the news that <a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/solana-most-famous-nft-projects-announce-migration-to-new-chains/">Two Solana’s NFT projects</a>, DeGods, and yOOts, are departing from its blockchain. Moreover, the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/DeGodsNFT/status/1607156858019794944?s=20&amp;t=No10u24aGLEuvYRoQ37eHw" rel="nofollow">DeGods announced</a> that they would be joining Ethereum; meanwhile, the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/y00tsNFT/status/1607156616201392128?s=20&amp;t=0nl9_w9q8u6IE1ZodnuF7w" rel="nofollow">yOOts</a> will be joining Polygon. These NFT projects leaving Solona must have increased negatively in the crypto market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Price Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/N3DxlwGv.png" alt="Solana Price " width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent downfall in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/solana-price-prediction-rsi-divergence-hints-upcoming-recovery-in-sol/">Solana price</a> turned down from the $15 barrier. Within the past two weeks, this altcoin tumbled 26% and plunged back to the November bottom support of $11.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the falling price, backed by decreasing volume, indicated a temporary pullback. If the bullish replenished at the $11 support, the buyers might reattempt to break the $15 barrier. Furthermore, a mid resistance of $12.75 will stands as a tough hurdle to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily candle closing below $11 accelerates the bearish momentum for a deeper downfall.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> concerning the last swing low to $11, the daily RSI slope is higher than the last time. A bullish divergence in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a> reflects the increasing buying pressure and higher change of bullish reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s:</strong> the large gaps between the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) reflect and aggressive and established downtrend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $11.19</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $12.75 and $15</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $11 and $10</span></li>
</ul>

And, although a short ETH price rally was observed following that, the upward trend was soon cut off by the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> collapse and weak technical indicators. A recent price analysis further shows that, there can be more pain left for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> in the coming days of 2023.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH) Price Drop?</h2>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63a9930dc144852b811060f6-Lack-of-Demand-in-Ethereums-Market">data</a> obtained from CryptoQuant, the Transaction Count metric (30-day EMA) has been continually in a downtrend since May 2021 and has recently marked a new low. In general, bearish stages of the market are typically followed by much-decreased activity from the market players, which results in a lower transaction count metric.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133086" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/27012114/nJjBL_27dd8171ecccc5675ee939bcee54c9cdd994a58ad339d832cb7b0c7c7b8f0f32.png" alt="" width="1280" height="806" /></p>
<p>In addition, as can be seen in the chart, each abrupt downward trend in the Transaction Count metric was accompanied by a substantial price drop. This remained the case throughout Ethereum historically. The metric has recently suffered a large drop, which may indicate that there has been a lack of activity. As a result, there is a high possibility that the price may soon see another significant drop to the key support level of $1000.</p>
<h2>ETH Reserves On Decline</h2>
<p>The Ethereum Exchange Reserve on-chain <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/eth/chart/exchange-flows">indicator</a> also reveals that the ETH reserves on <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchanges</a> have decreased by more than 30%. As a result, investors are growing their positions and further decreasing price activity.</p>

<p>Currently, Ethereum is trading at $1,215 with a gain of 4% in the past seven days, as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">CoinMarketCap</a>. Even though the crypto community is seeking a relief rally leading up to the new year, there has been almost no change in the prices. Multiple analysts are of the opinion that the Ethereum (ETH) price will continue to fall further.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the BUSD exchange rate has hardly budged from its steady one-dollar per unit valuation, over the course of the previous week. Earlier last month, several reputed media outlets reported that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">top crypto exchange Binance</a> had dabbled in money-laundering activities and its reserves comprised majorly of their BUSD coins.</p>
<h2>XRP At #3 In 2023?</h2>
<p>Currently, in third place, is another stablecoin project <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/usdt/">USDT</a> with a market capitalization of $66 billion. For, XRP to clinch the third spot, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> needs to multiply four times its current market value; in order to topple the stablecoin king. Although uncertainties cannot be ruled out in crypto, it&#8217;s to be noted that XRP&#8217;s price momentum significantly depends on the ongoing SEC lawsuit whose verdict is yet to come out.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the current <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/">market capitalizations</a> of XRP and BUSD are around $18 billion and $17.3 billion respectively. XRP leads by barely a slim margin of $700 million as it trades at $0.358, with a 3.5% gain in the last seven days according to recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" rel="nofollow">data</a>.</p>

This bullish breakout from downtrend-carrying resistance hints the market sentiment is shifting from selling on rallies to buying on dips. An upcoming retest phase(pullback) to validate whether this breakout is genuine.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:  </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A descending trendline breakout sets prices for a 22.5% rise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the possible retest phase gives a daily candle closing below, the bullish thesis will get invalidated</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $118.5 Million, indicating as 137% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why LUNC Price Rising?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the LUNC price shows a directional recovery, registering 22.5% growth in the last five days. This price rally is backed by several factors, including Edward Kim and Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson&#8217;s newly formed </span><a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-price-skyrockets-10-heres-why-more-rally-is-expected/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Joint L1 Task Force&#8217;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These core developers of Terra Classic shared their first proposal to work on Layer-1 Terra Classic blockchain development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-validator-classycrypto-burns-13-million-lunc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing burn activity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also fueled in for rising LUNC price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">LUNC Price Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/AbwLNwyB.png" alt="Terra Classic Coin" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-core-developers-edward-kim-zaradar-submits-proposal/">LUNC</a> daily time frame chart showcased a steady downfall under the influence of a descending trendline. Furthermore,  this dynamic resistance bolstered sellers for nearly three months by maintaining an established downtrend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the sudden price jump, the LUNC coin showed a bullish breakout from the dynamic resistance trendline and local resistance of $0.00015. Thus, this breakout signals an early sign of price recovery if the prices show sustainability above the breach trendline.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, after a possible retest phase, the following rally may push the prices 22.5% higher to hit $0.000195-$0.0002 resistance.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, the technical setup in ideal condition should lead a bull run to the $0.00037 barrier.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> jumped above the neutral line and also reflected the market sentiment supported by the potential price growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> along with $0.00015, the LUNC price breached the 20-day EMA support, which offers an additional edge for market buyers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra Classic Coin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.000158</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.000165 and $0.000198</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.00012 and $0.0001</span></li>

It has experienced almost all the different facets of a financial turmoil, starting from the demise of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/luna-2-0/">Terra ecosystem</a> in May to the latest fiasco of the FTX <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>. However, according to popular crypto influencers Guy Turner from Coin Bureau, and Altcoin Daily&#8217;s brother-duo Aaron &amp; Austin Arnold, the falling prices have yielded better opportunities to investors for the upcoming 2023 bull run.</p>
<h2>Top 3 Cryptos For 2023</h2>
<p>In a recent interview that was broadcasted on Youtube, Turner was asked about his most favorite <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> for the coming year. In response, Turner named Cosmos, Algorand, and Aave as his top three choices.</p>
<p>The crypto youtuber further stated that he adores <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cosmos/">Cosmos (ATOM)</a> due to its interoperability function and the massive community that acts as the backbone of the project. He was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s an amazing project. I love the Cosmos, I think the project has some really cool tech [and] there&#8217;s a great team behind it.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Will Ripple’s XRP Price Pump To $1 In The Massive 2023 Rally?" href="https://coingape.com/ripples-xrp-price-pump-to-1-massive-2023-rally/" rel="bookmark">Will Ripple’s XRP Price Pump To $1 In The Massive 2023 Rally?</a></em></p>
<p>ATOM which is Turner&#8217;s top pick, currently ranks 24th as per total <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization-2/">market capitalization</a>, and trades at around $9.12, according to crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<h2>Algorand&#8217;s Untapped Potential</h2>
<p>Following that, Turner endorsed <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/algorand/">Algorand (ALGO)</a>, noting that the coin has the potential to be a significant participant in the subsequent bull market. After reaching an all-time high of $3.28 four years ago and having lost more than 95% of its value since then, ALGO is currently trading at $0.168.</p>
<h2>DeFi Still To Run 2023</h2>
<p>In third, came his liking for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/aave/">Aave (AAVE)</a>, which is a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi platform</a> that enables individuals to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. With a total market value of $783 million, Aave is regarded as one of the top 50 most-valuable crypto projects among the many trying to capitalize on the DeFi craze.</p>
<p>After plummeting 92% from its top of $666.86 in May 2021, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> is currently trading at $55.67, at the time of writing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The majority of assets on the cryptocurrency market have been showing unremarkable chart patterns in recent weeks after the FTX upheaval subsided, with Bitcoin (BTC), the primary representative of the market, recording record-low volatility.

<p>As highlighted by crypto analyst IncomeSharks on December 25, Bitcoin hasn&#8217;t moved outside of the 16,600 USD to 16,900 USD area since December 16, following a sharp decrease after the crash of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-crypto-exchange/">FTX</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the FTX crash had increased pressure on the price of bitcoin, which had been seen dropping since its 2022 high of $47,905 recorded on March 28. It is still unable to move significantly in any direction. The analyst referred to this as &#8220;do nothing December.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Will the price of Bitcoin soon rise?</h2>
<p>Fictitious cryptocurrency guru, Stockmoney Lizards, claimed on December 25 that a breakthrough of Bitcoin was only a matter of time since it was creating double falling wedges, a pattern that normally signals that bulls may be gearing up for a rally, as reported by Finbold.</p>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-10k-or-100k-in-2023/">Is It $10K Or $100K For Bitcoin Price In 2023?</a></p>
<p>Bitcoin failed to continue the ABC down-driving pattern, according to crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, who also noted that Bitcoin &#8220;used to spend 32 days to complete the &#8216;B&#8217; wave and then break to the downside with a new bottom.&#8221; It has, however, been delayed for a while.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralised finance (DeFi)</a> token appeared to be &#8220;trying to establish a runway,&#8221; according to IncomeSharks. He expressed hope &#8220;for the price to take off&#8221; at the same time as the Bitcoin price remained flat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, respected cryptocurrency analyst Vince Prince noted that Bitcoin formed the &#8220;Merry Christmas Cycle&#8221; in 2022, the same pattern that appeared over the previous three Christmas. This might be indicating the end of the bear market and the beginning of the new Christmas cycle, which may reach a peak of around $1.8 million by Christmas 2026.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>However, BTC has demonstrated faster funding rates recovery following the FTX implosion than after past capitulation events, including Covid and the China crypto ban. Despite the fact that BTC is still down 64.79% from the year&#8217;s high in March, it is still showing moderate improvements on its monthly charts, rising by 1.63%.</p>

You can not play long-term games in the market unless you safeguard your position and minimise your risks.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Your portfolio should have a minimum exposure to very risky assets so that everything is not wiped out in the case of an unlikely event.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">There are several approaches to lowering the overall risk of your portfolio. You can diversify your assets, hedge against financial events, or use stop-loss and take-profit orders, etc.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Risk Management Strategies:</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Risk management comprises anticipating and recognising the financial risks associated with your assets in order to mitigate them. Investors then use risk management strategies to help them manage the risk exposure of their portfolio.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">After recognising investment risks, traders and investors employ risk management measures, which include a variety of financial practises.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">1. Stop-Loss Orders</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Given the volatile nature of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>, you need to have an exit strategy even before you buy a digital asset. An exit strategy is essentially a predetermined price at which you will sell your assets. It can be on either the lower or upper side of the spectrum.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Stop-loss orders allow you to sell your cryptocurrency automatically if it hits a set price, reducing possible losses. It is a simple but effective way to reduce the danger of huge losses. You can programme limit orders to automatically trigger at your limit price, whether you want to profit or set a maximum loss.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">2. Diversification</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Rather than putting all of your eggs in one basket, diversifying your portfolio by investing in a variety of different cryptocurrencies is one way to reduce risks.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">A diversified portfolio will not be heavily invested in any one asset or asset class, reducing the risk of large losses from a single asset or asset class.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">3. 1% Rule</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">According to the &#8220;1% rule,&#8221; you should not risk more than 1% of your total capital on a trade or investment. So, if things go sideways, even if the value of that asset goes to 0, your financial stability is not compromised.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">4. Managing Emotions</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">The market is driven by investor sentiment. That&#8217;s why we have a bull market and a bear market. It is very important to stay aware of your own emotions and not become a victim of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or panic selling.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">You will have to develop a sense to recognise fear and hype in the market and avoid getting speculations and emotions mixed up with your investment decisions.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">5. DYOR</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Nothing beats hard-core, in-depth knowledge and understanding of an asset before you decide to invest in it. Getting the fundamentals right is the first step to success in the market. That is why you should DYOR (Do Your Own Research).</p>

While other <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altcoins</a> show limited price action amid the market uncertainty, LUNC price has rallied nearly 25% since last week.</p>
<p>However, the LUNC rally hasn&#8217;t stopped yet and more upside momentum is likely to be seen in the next few days.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Price Rally Continues</h2>
<p>After falling to its August low of $0.0001269 last week, Terra Classic (LUNC) price continues to move higher. The positive sentiment has returned to the Terra Classic community as the FUD subdues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Terra Classic core developers Edward Kim and Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson have formed a new developer group &#8220;<a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-core-developers-edward-kim-zaradar-submits-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joint L1 Task Force</a>&#8220;. Also, Edward Kim has shared the first proposal by the group to work on Layer-1 Terra Classic blockchain developments.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133050" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133050" style="width: 702px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/zYLV4y1h/"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-133050" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26184321/LUNCUSDT_2022-12-26_18-42-38.png" alt="Terra Classic (LUNC) Price in Daily Timeframe" width="702" height="427" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133050" class="wp-caption-text">Terra Classic (LUNC) Price in Daily Timeframe. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the last 24 hours, the Terra Classic recorded over 10% upside move as the LUNC price breaks above the descending channel. In the daily timeframe, the price action indicates that the LUNC price was moving in the descending channel since October and break above the channel on December 24.</p>
<p>The RSI has also bounced from the oversold region and reached 50. Thus, the LUNC price trend is showing strength and can likely have more upside momentum.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a strong resistance near $0.00016. If the LUNC price breaks above the resistance, a rally above $0.0002 is more likely in the short term. Currently, the price is consolidating above $0.000155 for an upside move. A year-end rally in the crypto market could easily push Terra Classic.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price and Rising Burn Rate</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic burn rate has increased recently amid <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-validator-classycrypto-burns-13-million-lunc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive burn by validators</a> and Terra Classic projects. The total LUNC burned has reached over 36.5 billion LUNC tokens. The community, excluding Binance, has burned over 80 million LUNC tokens in December.</p>
<p>The rumor of <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-price-news-coinbase-purchase-terra-classic-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase listing LUNC</a> has also contributed to the rally. The trading volume has jumped over 120% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, several important decisions are taken by the community such as <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-community-passes-crucial-proposal-is-lunc-price-0-0005-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passing Proposal 11111</a> to repeal Proposal 10983 to influence LUNC price.</p>

As a result, the top Meme cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://coingape.com/cryptocurrency-price-today-polygon-shiba-inu-bitcoin-up-pancakeswap-plummets/">Dogecoin and Shiba Inu</a> coin have shown limited growth since last week. However, the technical chart revealed some trading setups that may provide entry opportunities for traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market Leaders</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-10k-or-100k-in-2023/">Bitcoin price</a> currency trades at $16841 with an intraday gain of 0.07; meanwhile, the Ethereum price exchange hands at $1217, with an intraday loss of 0.08%.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu Coin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133061" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26185717/Screenshot_20221226_185537.png" alt="" width="1737" height="500" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shiba Inu daily time frame chart shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/heres-why-shiba-inu-coin-next-recovery-cycle-may-hit-0-00001/">falling wedge pattern</a>. This bullish continuation pattern offers a strong direction rally upon the break out of its resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the prices had recently bounced back from the support trendline, which should ideally bolster buyers to challenge the overhead trendline. However, amid the ongoing uncertainty, the SHIB price has been sideways for more than a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/g/g0tvdB49.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly this short range represents a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a> in the four-hour chart. A breakout from this pattern&#8217;s resistance and will signal the end of the consolidation face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This breakout may drive the Shiba Inu coin 5% higher to retest the wedge pattern trendline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below the triangle pattern&#8217;s trendline may tumble the price 6% down to hit the lower trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, the area inside the triangle pattern can be considered as no trading zone.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133067" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26190144/Screenshot_20221226_185513.png" alt="" width="1728" height="500" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent downfall in the market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/dogecoin-price-loses-monthly-support-of-0-074-will-it-fall-further/">Dogecoin price</a> plunged back to the local support of $0.07. Moreover, this price support has rebounded this memecoin twice, validating it as an active accumulation zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 20th, the DOGE price rebounded from $0.07 support and surged 11.5% higher to challenge the 0.078 resistance. However, with the current indecisiveness among the market participants, the coin price wavers within the mentioned levels and currently trades at $0.075.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/azUDjMnJ.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a bullish breakout from the $0.078 resistance signals the replenished bullish momentum and may start a fresh recovery rally to challenge the $0.11 barrier.</span></p>

Users who have a MegaSwap account can trade on the Bitget platform through ten well-known DEXs and eight powerful channels.</p>
<p>Users can benefit from the best of both worlds thanks to this feature. However, it combines the flexibility and variety of <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a></strong> with the safety and practicality of CeFi.</p>
<p>Bitget&#8217;s CEO, Grace Chen, says</p>
<blockquote><p>“MegaSwap is an important step taken by Bitget in building a unique safe, dynamic and robust trading experience to reach critical mass.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Bitget announces Megaswap<br />
</b></h2>
<p>While DEXs are becoming more and more popular among investors who want to quickly get their hands on a wider variety of tokens, CEX users enjoy secure trading experiences with a variety of products and services. DEX trading, though, is not for everyone.</p>
<p>Many users are put off from using DEXs by the knowledge gap. Also, lack of protection for assets stored on Defi wallets. Given this, MegaSwap is created to meet user demands for convenience and security trading, while also gaining from a wide range of assets and high liquidity, enabling users to integrate a centralized trading experience in Defi markets.</p>
<p>By streamlining the payment of gas fees, MegaSwap not only combines the benefits of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEX</a> and DEX but also makes trading even simpler. In order to make trading as easy as possible for users. MegaSwap automatically converts gas fees from stablecoin balances in user accounts.</p>
<h3><b>Bitget&#8217;s non-custodial wallet was stolen</b></h3>

They can use <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralised exchanges</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">crypto wallets</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/">decentralised exchanges</a>, and even online payment systems like PayPal, Robinhood, and Venmo, depending on their interests. In this article we will be talking about purchase of Ethereum using PayPal.</p>
<p>Since 2020, customers of PayPal have been able to buy, sell, and store Ether (ETH) and other <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> via the platform&#8217;s e-wallet. PayPal provides a trustworthy choice for buyers in nations with banking prohibitions and other entry obstacles for trading digital currencies, in addition to making the transaction less dangerous for newcomers. However, making direct purchases through the platform has its disadvantages that might affect the investor experience.</p>
<p>There are variety of options to buy Ethereum with PayPal, each and every cryptocurrency investor may be sure to find a method of purchase that suits their preferences. Here are some of the most popular and simple ways customers can pay with PayPal for their ETH purchases, along with the advantages of each.</p>
<h2>Buying Ethereum directly through the PayPal app</h2>
<p>The crypto button, which PayPal added in 2020, enables customers to purchase, trade, and hold cryptocurrencies as well as learn more about the complete investment process. The website only permits investors to swap the four most popular cryptocurrencies: <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH), due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-consensus-heres-all-you-need-to-know/">What is Consensus in Crypto? Here’s All You Need To Know</a></p>
<p>One of the simplest methods to buy and possess Ethereum is instantly through the PayPal network. Opening a PayPal account and selecting a cryptocurrency to buy are prerequisites for anyone interested in buying cryptos on PayPal.</p>
<p>The rules governing cryptocurrencies are stringent. Therefore, before approving any cryptocurrency transactions, PayPal normally needs all of its customers to go through the Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process and accept the platform&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<p>Documents must be issued as part of this process in order to prove user identity. Copies of an individual&#8217;s government-issued identification card, proof of address, and bank links are some of the documents frequently used in this procedure. A W-9 tax form is likewise a crucial record that&#8217;s required of inhabitants of the United States.</p>
<h2>How much Ethereum can investors buy on PayPal?</h2>
<p>PayPal enables investors to buy or sell ETH on a weekly basis for as little as 1 USD to as much as 100,000 USD. The transaction fees are based on the total amount spent. The table that follows lists various fees for different purchases.</p>

<p>Although simple and safe, purchasing ETH directly from PayPal has disadvantages that some cryptocurrency buyers may find bothersome, especially those who value having complete control over their own holdings. The limits of this process are discussed in the following section.</p>
<h2>Limitations one faces when purchasing Ethereum using PayPal</h2>
<p>Ethereum can be readily purchased, sold, and held using PayPal&#8217;s platform by cryptocurrency investors in the United States and around the world. However, unlike local crypto exchange like Gemini and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>, PayPal does not provide consumers full control of their own wallets.</p>
<p>PayPal only allows users to hold cryptocurrency as an equivalent to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fiat-money/">fiat money</a>. As a result, an investor is unable to sell their assets to third parties or transfer money between different accounts on or off PayPal.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only option to get your money back from coins you bought using this method is to sell them on PayPal. One of the main issues for most purchasers wondering how to purchase Ethereum using PayPal is Paypal locking. Despite the significant drawback, this approach is still the best choice for novice investors who are still learning and are unable to manage the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>s&#8217; complex interface and rules.</p>

<p>As previously indicated, PayPal enables customers to buy ETH for as little as $1, making it a great choice for newbies who want to gain experience while assuming the least amount of risk. For the majority of newbies, the purchase process is also made less intimidating by being a well-known and reliable site.</p>
<h2>PayPal to purchase Ethereum on eToro</h2>
<p>The eToro brokerage is another tool for investors to rapidly purchase Ethereum currencies.</p>
<p>Starting in 2019, this platform, which was first used as a Contract for Differences (CFD) brokerage platform, will facilitate the purchasing, selling, and holding various crypto assets. Trading CFDs enables investors to make money off price changes without having to own the underlying product.</p>
<p>eToro enables investors to trade Bitcoin, Dash (DASH), Ripple (XRP), ETH, and other cryptocurrencies swiftly and effectively, even though it still does not include all cryptocurrencies. Similar to other cryptocurrency exchange platforms, eToro is simpler to use than those, making it the best choice for novice investors. It also offers up to 14 different cryptocurrencies and their CFDs.</p>
<p>In addition, customers can buy digital assets whenever it&#8217;s convenient with eToro, which provides more control over the cryptocurrency they trade than PayPal does.</p>

<h2>Pay with PayPal at unofficial cryptocurrency exchanges</h2>
<p>Traders have the option of buying their cryptocurrency on one of the several unofficial exchange markets. On specific exchange platforms, buyers can find vendors who accept PayPal as a means of payment based on their interactions and search results.</p>
<p>One of the numerous simple ways to buy Ethereum with PayPal that allows for direct transactions is through peer-to-peer trading. Buyers acquire full control over the coins they buy and are free to choose whether to hold, transfer, or trade them to friends and other buyers because the seller is another ETH holder.</p>
<p>To use some of these alternative coin exchanges&#8217; services, users must first register with the site. Registering with Bittrex, Poloniex, Coinbase, HitBTC, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a>, and other trustworthy cryptocurrency exchange sites is a good idea.</p>
<p>P2P trading is one of the riskiest techniques to use if not done through a DEX because the likelihood of being conned is pretty significant. To avoid falling victim to con artists, it is advised that all buyers use prudence in all of their transactions.</p>
<p>Engaging with trustworthy merchants is the only method to reduce the likelihood of being scammed. Before making a trade, users should do extensive research and understand as much as they can about the terms and conditions of such platforms.</p>

<h2>Is Ethereum a worthwhile investment?</h2>
<p>Despite being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap behind Bitcoin, Ethereum still has a high level of volatility. In comparison to the most recent entrants in the market, the coin&#8217;s value can be regarded as stable. However, the ability of developers to create <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/">decentralised apps (DApps)</a> on the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>, which obviously has a positive impact on its utility, does affect price behaviour with Ethereum. Users who want to interact with any DApp must pay in ETH as well as developers who wish to use the network.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#8217;s extensive price history and broad range of applications highlight its potential as a reliable store of value.</p>
<p>In any case, Ethereum, like any other cryptocurrency, increases in value according to public perception. The price is not entirely associated with any physical good or money, and it is subject to significant fluctuations due to outside forces like governmental restrictions and media attention.</p>
<p>The majority of investors suggest contemplating going a bit longer with ETH and holding in the anticipation that the price would rise over the long term for this reason. However, novice cryptocurrency traders should only invest with money they won&#8217;t regret losing if the worst happens.</p>
<p>Goals for investors should also be taken into account. For instance, unlike what the media occasionally claims, cryptocurrency is not a get-rich-quick scam.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">How to Get a Job in the Web 3.0 and Metaverse Industry?</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Since Web3 and Metaverse are relatively new and evolving industries, opportunities in this sector are somewhat limited as compared to those in more established industries. However, making a career in this industry is not very hard given that you have relevant skill sets and knowledge.</p>
<h4 style="color: #252525">Here are a Few Steps to Getting a Job in the Web3 and Metaverse Industry:</h4>
<h3 style="color: #252525">1. Gain Required Knowledge and Skill Sets</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">If you want to succeed in this industry, you must have a very good understanding of computer science and programming. You&#8217;ll need to know everything there is to know about blockchains, distributed ledger technology (DLT), peer-to-peer or decentralised protocols, virtual and augmented reality, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFT</a>s, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/smart-contract/">smart contracts</a>, and so on.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">If you want to become a developer in this space, you need to have strong coding skills along with knowledge about Web3 technologies.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">If you want to go on the creative side of the spectrum, you will have to choose a niche and then acquire relevant skill sets.

It is an e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba, If everything goes according to plan, the project should launch online around the upcoming New Year&#8217;s shopping extravaganza.</p>
<h2>Alibaba to create TaoLive City</h2>
<p>Taobao has frequently released products related to the metaverse since the start of the year. Taobao and Diantao, another one of Alibaba&#8217;s live-streaming e-commerce apps, collaborated to create TaoLive City during the Double 11 Shopping Festival last month. There are streets of commerce and advertisement screens in this virtual world. With a virtual avatar, users can immediately enter this brand-new <a href="https://coingape.com/year-ender-top-3-metaverse-trends-to-watch-of-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>virtual environment</strong></a> where they can shop, enter contests, and interact with other users.</p>
<h3>Tissot also joined the platform</h3>
<p>TaoLive City is a virtual environment that was jointly developed by Alibaba&#8217;s live-streaming e-commerce apps. There are streets of commerce and advertisement screens in this virtual world. With a virtual avatar, users can immediately enter this brand-new virtual environment. However,  where they can shop, enter contests, and interact with other users.</p>
<p>TaoLive City, which features eight scenarios including a beautiful Ferris wheel and commercial streets, has a cyberpunk aesthetic. There are many different live-streaming rooms, each with its own characteristics. Over ten Taobao live streamers and brands like Tissot have joined the platform. This year&#8217;s Double 11 Shopping Festival also featured TaoLive City and Alifish, an online platform for copyright trading services introduced by Alibaba.</p>
<h4>Baidu AI Cloud also promotes its own product</h4>
<p>In addition to promoting Alibaba&#8217;s products. However, Baidu AI Cloud also markets its own products in apparel, home, digital, and other industries. Similar solutions are being promoted by NetEase&#8217;s Metaverse Department. Although, it is anticipated that NetEase Yaotai, a metaverse app similar to Baidu&#8217;s XiRang, will be released in the near future.</p>
<p>Although they are also promoting the related business. However, other well-known Chinese companies like Tencent, JD.com, Meituan, Pinduoduo, and Kuaishou have not yet developed any products. PICO VR headsets are receiving all of ByteDance&#8217;s Douyin&#8217;s energy in an effort to achieve success.</p>

The proposal will bring back 10% remint from the 0.2% burn tax and add to the community pool, instead of 50% remint. Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim opposed Proposal 10983 as it could end the <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-binance-to-likely-end-its-terra-classic-lunc-burn-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNC burn mechanism by Binance</a>.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community Passes Proposal 11111</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic community currently votes on Proposal 11111 &#8220;<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://station.terra.money/proposal/11111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repeal Proposal 10983</a>&#8220;. The proposal aims to repeal Proposal 10983, which increased funding for the community pool with 50% of the 0.2% burn tax instead of 10% for on-chain development.</p>
<p>Proposal 11111 has passed the threshold, with almost 82% votes in favor and 2% votes against the proposal. Also, 12% and 4% voted &#8220;No with veto&#8221; and &#8220;Abstain,&#8221; respectively.</p>
<p>Almost 39 validators have supported the proposal and 3 oppose the proposal. Validators with the most voting power Allnodes, Interstellar Lounge, and LUNC DAO voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; to the repeal of Proposal 10983.</p>
<p>Allnodes in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Allnodes/status/1607055246752206851" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on December 26 announced their support for Proposal 11111. Moreover, the validator believes the community must bring back the 1.2% burn tax as no positive changes in volume have been seen since reducing burn from 1.2% to 0.2%.</p>
<p>Terra Classic core developer <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-edward-kim-on-reopening-ibc-channel-proposal-10983-other-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edward Kim warned the communit</a>y about Proposal 10983. He said the proposal can make Binance CEO “CZ” revoke the LUNC burn mechanism. Binance is burning its trading fees on LUNC spot and margin trading pairs for its contribution to the community.</p>
<p>Binance has burned over 20 billion LUNC tokens. While the community, other exchanges, and projects have together burned 16 billion LUNC tokens.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price Rally Continues</h2>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) price has rallied massively last week. The LUNC price has soared nearly 10% in the last 24 hour, with the current price trading at $0.0001565. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001434 and $0.0001574, respectively.</p>
<p>The rumor of <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-price-news-coinbase-purchase-terra-classic-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase listing LUNC</a> has also contributed to the rally. The trading volume has jumped over 110% in the last 24 hours.</p>

However, <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/3-reasons-to-buy-ripplexrp-this-new-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> is on a constant decline due to increased selling pressure in the market. Meanwhile, the latest optimistic updates from the<a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-can-sec-still-save-hinman-docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ripple vs SEC lawsuit</a> have helped the XRP to stay on the tally of the top crypto whales.</p>
<h2>BSC whale pumps XRP trading vol</h2>
<p>As per the data provided by WhaleStats, XRP landed on the tally of the top 10 tokens by trading volume among the 100 and 500 biggest BSC whales over the past day. However, Dogecoin is still the most traded token among the biggest BSC whales. XRP 24 hour trading volume has spiked by 90% to stand at $403 million.</p>
<p>WhaleAlert reported that several crypto whales have moved 287 million XRP (approx worth $100 million) in multiple transactions over the past 24 hours. Around 100 million XRP (approx worth $34.7 million) has been moved from Ripple to an unknown wallet. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP news here</strong></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the largest transactions recorded by the tracker have been of moving 152 million XRP (approx worth $52.3 million).</p>
<h2>Key price level to watch</h2>
<p>XRP price has surged marginally over the past 24 hours. Ripple’s native token is trading at an average price of $0.352, at the press time. XRP is still holding a market cap of more than $17.6 billion while facing a lawsuit from the US SEC.</p>
<p>However, an expert has laid down key <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/DefendDark/status/1607282565806792706" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">XRP price levels to watch</a> ahead.
