<p>On-chain data gives compelling reasons why <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-developers-roll-out-new-ultra-bullish-innovations-ahead-of-2023/">Cardano</a> is trading at a substantially discounted price. In a blog post on Monday, Santiment argues that ADA has grown, but the price hasn’t kept pace in 2022. Does this mean the token will moon in 2023?</p>



<h2 id="h-metrics-point-to-ada-being-underpriced"><strong>Metrics Point To ADA Being Underpriced</strong></h2>



<p>Cardano is dramatically undervalued compared to Ethereum, Solana, and other top competitors.</p>



<p>Blockchain analytics firm Santiment published a blog post highlighting some signals that ADA sellers are slowly getting exhausted. There are fewer coins at a loss on the blockchain on every ADA price downswing, meaning the selling power is continually declining.</p>



<p>Another reason to be optimistic is the decreasing trading volumes. This is typically one of the strongest trend reversal signals in crypto markets. As this trend continues, the bears or bulls gradually lose their grip leading to a trend reversal. Such a scenario could be witnessed for ADA in 2023, especially if the broader crypto market is recovering. Santiment analysts believe ADA’s price will “increase in value” based on the aforementioned indicators, though it&#8217;s not guaranteed.</p>



<h2><strong>Is ADA Bullish Or Nah?</strong></h2>



<p>It’s been quite a rough year for markets, and crypto hasn’t been spared in the fallout.</p>



<p>The near-term outlook for Cardano looks bleak. Despite Santiment suggesting the coin is trading far below its actual value.</p>



<p>ADA cryptocurrency is down 2.59% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.2514. At its peak in September 2021, it traded at $3.09, according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko.</p>



<p>Even as new entrants join the market and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sharks-scoop-up-83-million-worth-of-ada-even-as-price-continues-to-head-south/">sharks accumulate</a>, the global macro environment, dwindling investor confidence, and recent price action hint that there’s no apparent reason for the ADA narrative to flip bullish anytime soon.</p>

<ul>
<li>The rebranded Terra Luna token has surged double-digit with record inflows.</li>



<li>Binance’s Terra LUNA airdrop distribution to LUNC holders could be behind the gains.</li>
</ul>



<p>LUNC – the original crypto of Terra Luna – jumped 16% on Dec.27 to an intraday high of $0.0001848, beating Bitcoin to become the top performer in the festive season. On the other hand, the flagship crypto was trading at $16,787 in the same period, per CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>In December, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-second-round-of-terra-luna-airdrop-distribution-to-terra-classic-lunc-and-terraclassicusd-ustc-holders-6c9ca64a94064973a273328edc99019a">announced</a> that it had completed the second round of airdrop distribution to Terra Classic (LUNC) and TerraClassicUSD (USTC) holders. The announcement added that the next distribution would come in Dec. 2022 or June 2023. Besides, there have been significant activities on the blockchain. Among them, the Terra Classic Shuttle bridge will reportedly ‘‘sunset’’ at the end of January 2023.</p>



<p>In that regard, Terra Classic urged users to ‘‘<em>strongly bridge assets back to Terra using classic-bridge.Terra.money before January 31 for the funds not to disappear.</em>’’ The announcement, however, noted that assets affected do not include the transfers via Wormhole of IBC. Assets bridged through the two platforms will be available on Terra Bridge Classic up to May 30, 2023.</p>



<h2 id="h-lunc-records-high-inflows-defying-reports-its-founder-do-kwon-is-still-at-large"><strong>LUNC Records High Inflows Defying Reports Its Founder, Do Kwon, Is Still at Large</strong></h2>



<p>In the same period, Terra Classic has recorded a surge in inflows – rising to $1.1 billion on Dec.27 from a low of $861 million on Dec.26 – representing an increase of 27%. Pundits argue the surge could be tied to the efforts by Terra Classic to revive the ecosystem since its spectacular collapse in May.</p>



<p>A token burn mechanism is part of the efforts to reduce the circulating LUNC supply. The burn has received support from industry players, including Binance – which has agreed to burn LUNC and margin trading fees.</p>



<p>LUNC bullish sentiment is despite reports that Terra co-founder Do Kwon was hiding in Serbia to escape fraud charges levelled against him by The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors, who have been following him for months. On-chain data further confirmed that the disgraced blockchain entrepreneur had cashed out $120,000 worth of BTC from Luna Foundation Guard while in hiding.</p>

<ul>
<li>The much-anticipated metaverse has suffered a string of losses ranging from dwindling daily users to billions wiped off its market capitalization.</li>



<li>After investing billions in the project, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta lost almost 75% in value as its augmented reality division recorded losses in each quarter.</li>



<li>Investors across metaverse platforms are optimistic that just like the crypto winter ravaging the whole sector, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.</li>
</ul>



<p>If wishes were granted on the metaverse, the first would be to delete the year 2022 from the history books and push on with the highs of 2021.</p>



<p>The metaverse had resonated in crypto spaces for a while but boomed in late 2021 when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg joined the train announcing a metaverse platform and changing the company’s name to Meta.</p>



<p>This year may have crushed the hopes of many as the metaverse recorded a series of unfortunate events. Leading the pack is Meta&#8217;s poor outing this year. Their flagship game, Horizon Worlds, has fallen short of users&#8217; expectations. Things got out of hand when it was revealed that Meta’s staff were unhappy with the game.</p>



<p>Away from Horizon Worlds, Meta’s virtual reality division <a href="https://zycrypto.com/meta-reports-a-3-67-billion-loss-in-its-metaverse-division-signaling-more-problems-for-the-company/">lost</a> over $3 billion in the third quarter of 2022, a shocking increase from its second-quarter loss of $2.7 billion. Meta’s financial losses led to the company letting go of about 13% of its employees after Zuckerberg announced that it would sack 11,000 employees.</p>



<p>Following Meta closely are Sandbox and Decentraland, who were tipped to become the future of the metaverse after early prospects. After losing thousands of daily users this year, both platforms have recorded a combined loss, almost hitting $10 billion, with Sandbox losing $4.4 billion while Decentraland lost $4.92 billion.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel"><strong>Is there light at the end of the tunnel?</strong></h2>



<p>After an abysmal 2022 by the future of the internet, several users have lost their early bullish drive in the sector. However, executives and creators in the sector remain hopeful that just like the crypto winter and seasonal bear market, the downtrend in the metaverse will soon be an old story. </p>



<p>Despite record losses this year, Zuckerberg has asked users to keep the faith alive because of the “<em>countless possibilities</em>” that come with the metaverse. On the technology, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/zuckerberg-optimistic-metaverse-will-pick-despite-2b-quarterly-losses/">acknowledged</a> the fact that graphics are not so great at the moment but restated his commitment to a “<em>better experience in the future</em>.”</p>



<p>Sebastien Borget, the co-founder of Sandbox, has expressed optimism in the small successes recorded this year across metaverse platforms and hopes for a greater 2023 in the industry.</p>

<p>The ranging inflation figures witnessed in 2022 have plunged households across the globe to contend with rising food, rent, and energy prices. The stubborn inflation has compelled multiple central banks to embrace contractionary monetary policies. The macroeconomic tool has aimed at reducing the money supply – cash and readily cashable funds circulation in the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Primarily, the majority of central banks, such as the Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of England (BoE), have raised interest rates to cool the demand fueling inflation by making borrowing expensive for borrowers. The hawkish policy imposed to curb inflation has influenced the pricing of risky assets.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency assets are no exemptions from the reaction to the aggressive monetary policy, particularly after consistently remaining uncoupled from the leading risk and uncertainty indicators. The price movements in the global crypto market have displayed an observable reaction to each interest hike announced by the Fed and BoE to rein inflation.</p>



<p>Investors of high-risk assets consider higher interest rates to imply a lower appetite for high-return assets such as crypto assets. With the cryptocurrency market increasingly correlated to the stocks, the bearish steam portrayed by the crypto in 2022 is a consequence of the worsening macroeconomic outlook.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-impact-of-interest-hikes-on-the-crypto-market"><strong>Impact of Interest Hikes on the Crypto Market</strong></h2>



<p>A review of the recent crypto market downtrend reveals the impact of the interest hikes. In particular, the Federal Reserve meeting on January 26 plunged Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price by 6% from the $38,000 support level to $35,600 in a day. The adverse impact of the Fed&#8217;s tight monetary policy traces to the FOMC December 14-15 minutes released on January 5, 2022. The publication eroded BTC, the largest crypto asset per CoinMarketCap data, price by $3200 to exchange at $43200 in hours. The reaction to the interest rate increase sank BTC price by 10% to $41,500 a few days later.  </p>



<p>Since the FOMC publication early this year, BTC has led other crypto assets on a longer-term bloodbath. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $797 Billion, a 75.36% loss in total value from one year ago, according to CoinGecko data captured in Figure 1 below. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tOZIcz_5Wj3uhYRJfIqGUPbCCtrOiBJc7p92Jxtam1rcgDXri4HSxVgk8EzoRrg0FvRI5Ps0E9Clh1vU3U0Gw6qDuaYxjmLYf1SbNmdDpWYNGd7Z392YEqq2YPljbzwsXd6LirjOzsPkX2C1F_R0Q7x47_Lc5htmvnkU4M_gOKScHqXqJUpvnuB2ometM2jbjOrkvm6EjA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The downward spiral displayed above is an accumulative effect of the Fed&#8217;s increasing hawkishness, delivering a depressive market sentiment to crypto investors. The hawkish stance demonstrated by Fed in 2022 is the driving factor of downswings witnessed in risky assets and turning 2022 into a bearish year of the global crypto market.</p>



<p>Fed&#8217;s decision to raise the federal benchmark rate by 25 basis points on March 16 2022, to a target range of 0.25%-0.50% wielded power over the crypto market, with its total value plummeting to $1.788 trillion. The market capitalization slipped to $1.286 trillion in the subsequent May 4 announcement to increase the target range to 0.75% and 1% and reduce its balance sheet through treasury and mortgage-backed securities disposal.</p>



<p>The elevated inflation led to a 75 basis points increase on June 15, raising the target range to 1.5% &#8211; 1.75%. The crypto market reacted to the higher Fed&#8217;s fund rate with a $411 billion decline to a total value of $875.772 billion. </p>



<p>The July 27 review through the Consumer Price Index illustrated that inflation rose to 9.1%. It compelled the Fed to announce a 0.75% increment to the target range of 1.5% and 1.75%. It coincided with the BoE&#8217;s 50 basis points increment of the interest rate- the highest in 27 years. The two largest single-rate increments brought widespread consequences that restricted the total crypto market value to $899.752 billion.</p>



<p>The crypto market gained bearish steam following the September 21 announcement when the Fed replicated the previous increment in July of 0.75%, pushing the target range to 2.25% &#8211; 2.5%. Similarly, BoE replicated the half-point increment in July, targeting a 2.25% benchmark rate to arrest the climbing inflationary pressure that has outpaced other major economies. It prompted the projection of looming recession threats with a sizable value of crypto assets eroded.</p>



<h2><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>



<p>Surging inflation rates witnessed across major economies have defied the tight monetary policies. In particular, the BoE is concerned with the deteriorating economic outlook acknowledged by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) during the CPI reading indicating inflation burst to 10.1%. The re-emergence of double-figure inflation dashes hopes of a dovish monetary policy from the BoE.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, BoE&#8217;s governor, Andrew Bailey, admitted that a substantial interest rate hike is imminent, with inflation unlikely to fall amidst higher energy bills in winter. The Federal Reserve is under immense pressure from the September CPI reading released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, indicating an 8.2% rise. The soaring inflation reported in the UK and US constitutes ground for consecutive tighter monetary policies that will have widespread consequences for high-risk investments. Higher benchmark interest rates in Fed and BoE rate-setting announcements will accelerate further crypto meltdown in the last quarter, making 2022 a bearish year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coinbase Institutional predicts that BTC and ETH could surge in 2023.</li>



<li>The exchange is also optimistic about the future of DeFi and self-custody wallets.</li>
</ul>



<p>Coinbase Institutional has released a series of predictions on Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, and crypto mining in its <em>2023 Crypto Market Outlook report. </em>The exchange predicts significant growth in major cryptocurrencies, particularly BTC and ETH, next year. Not so for the non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies besides Ethereum. The research predicts an extended crypto winter in the segment.</p>



<p>The report said, &#8220;<em>We expect digital asset selection will transition towards higher-quality names like bitcoin and ether based on factors (of) sustainable token economics, the maturity of respective ecosystems, and relevant market liquidity</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Coinbase attributed the selection to macroeconomic factors, including high inflation rates, rising borrowing costs, and low equity earnings. According to the research firm, the bearish outlook comes despite relief from the earlier-feared economic recession in the US. Elevated job numbers and government-backed stimulus is boosting the economy, and riskier assets could see a steady recovery next year.</p>



<p>Regarding risk assets, the platform noted that the correlations between cryptocurrencies and traditional risk assets remain. &#8220;<em>We assign a low probability to the chances that crypto performance will decouple from traditional risk assets in the first few months of 2023, particularly without a differentiated catalyst</em>.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="h-ethereum-s-dominance-could-be-challenged-in-2023"><strong>Ethereum&#8217;s dominance could be challenged in 2023</strong></h2>



<p>The 57-page report foresees that the dominance of the second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, could change next year. Furthermore, it raised concerns about the blockchain&#8217;s reliance on layer-2 solutions, citing fraud and a lack of interoperability.</p>



<p>Overall, Coinbase believes that altcoins could take a long time to recover in 2023 due to the impact of deleveraging – referring to attempts by corporations to reduce their debt – following the recent events in the sector. Specifically, with the collapse of FTX, DeFi platforms that had loaned their assets to market makers on the exchange were affected and may have to wait longer before receiving funds.</p>



<p>Coinbase Institutional believes we could see notable expansion in DeFi and self-custody wallets. The report praised DeFi for its on-chain and auditable properties, which could attract investors moving away from the not-so-transparent centralized exchanges. That does not mean that DeFi is free from drawbacks. The report shows rising cases of smart contracts exploits, price volatility, and the demand-supply imbalance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Former US President Donald Trump expresses delight over his newly released NFTs and says the art is “sort of cute.” </li>



<li>The NFTs, which sold out in 12 hours, have raked in over $1 million though Trump claims he does not see it as an investment.</li>



<li>NFT lovers praise Trump, and they want more political actors to mint art in the coming months.</li>
</ul>



<p>People in several works of life have released non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for many reasons ranging from investments, value, artistic expression, etc.</p>



<p>Former United States Commander-in-Chief says his newly released NFTs were motivated by his love for the art as the images of him were “<em>sort of cute.” </em>In an interview with One America News, he said the release was not a form of investment but rather an artistic endeavour. </p>



<p>“<em>I didn&#8217;t view it as an investment. I viewed it as &#8211; I thought they were cute. For $99, you&#8217;re getting these visions that are very beautiful and interesting, I think, and I viewed it that way much more so than as an NFT,” </em>said Trump.</p>



<p>Trump went further, revealing that he had no prior knowledge about how digital art works before releasing the NFTs, which depicted him as a hero.</p>



<p>“<em>Well, I knew nothing about them, and then a group came and I loved the art. They showed me the art. You know, it&#8217;s sort of comic book art when you think of it, but they showed me the art and I said, gee, I always wanted to have a 30-inch waist.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Trump <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-is-selling-superman-themed-nft-trading-cards/">released</a> his NFTs, which depicted him as a superhero, astronaut, and cowboy, in December amid several criticisms. Despite the talks, the card was sold out in an incredible 12 hours for about $99 in the initial release, and it is reported to have raked in over $1 million to the creators.</p>



<h2 id="h-bad-year-for-nfts"><strong>Bad year for NFTs</strong></h2>



<p>Like the wider digital asset market, 2022 was terrible for digital art compared to landmarks attained in 2021. From poor volumes to a general waning interest by collectors, NFTs fell short in all metrics this year. NFT marketplace giant OpenSea recorded a sharp decline this year as trading volume dropped from $3 billion in September 2021 to $350 million in September 2022.</p>



<p>The fall of NFTs worsened as metaverse platforms <a href="https://zycrypto.com/metaverse-projects-struggle-as-trading-volumes-plunge-by-nearly-80-casting-doubt-over-the-industry/">recorded</a> fewer daily users and creeping NFT purchases compared to the previous year. Despite the fall, celebrities and other media personalities have continued to drop more projects, with more users hoping for a pickup in 2023.</p>

<p>The Ripple and SEC case continues to take new turns as it approaches settlement. Crypto-focused investment firm Paradigm Operations LP&#8217;s application to join the case as an amicus curiae has gotten further backing from an interested attorney.</p>



<p>Lewis Rinaudo Cohen, the co-founder of blockchain-focused law firm DLx Law LLP, has filed a motion to appear as &#8216;pro hac vice&#8217; on behalf of the investment firm. Attorney James K. Filan, a prominent XRP community influencer, first noted the development.</p>



<p>Pro hac vice is a legal term for adding an attorney to a case in a jurisdiction where they are not authorized to practice. Cohen noted in his filing that he is a member in good standing with New York and DC bars. The filing adds that he is not facing any pending disciplinary action in any state or federal court, keeping with legal protocol.</p>



<p>Paradigm first filed its amicus brief in November in a show of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-coinbase-asks-court-for-permission-to-support-ripple/">support for Ripple</a>. An amicus curiae, also known as a “friend of the court,” is an individual or organization not a party to a legal dispute. The third party can assist the court by providing relevant information, expertise, or insight. </p>



<p>Previously, lawyer Rodrigo Seira filed a motion requesting to appear as pro hac vice on behalf of Paradigm Operations LP in the case. Attorney Michelle Kallen of Jenner &amp; Block LLP also filed a similar motion.</p>



<h2 id="h-xrp-community-members-hungry-for-a-close-of-the-case"><strong>XRP community members hungry for a close of the case</strong></h2>



<p>Members of the XRP community have pointed out that the filings may have come too late. This is because they may no longer impact the judge&#8217;s decision. Some opine that the filings may be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-eager-to-receive-verdict-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-as-attorney-sets-tentative-settlement-date/">stalling the case</a>, which has already gone on for too long.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ripple and the SEC have filed their final briefs requesting summary judgment in the case. The entire XRP community is focused on when presiding judge Analisa Torres will make her ruling on the case.</p>



<p>Attorney Filan has predicted that this ruling may come in around March 2023. If this ruling arrives in favour of Ripple, the community expects the price of XRP to skyrocket as investor confidence returns.</p>



<p>The expectation is tied to the regulatory clarity that XRP will have with such an outcome. In contrast, an outcome favouring the SEC would largely enable the SEC to go after more crypto firms. XRP trades at around $0.36, down 2.18% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Cardano, the third largest proof of stake cryptocurrency, continued to fall during the weekend as traders took leave to celebrate the Christmas holiday. At press time on Sunday, ADA was trading at $0.2596 after a 0.68% drop in the past 24 hours, with the coin’s trading volume plunging by roughly 36.28%, according to data by CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>Ostensibly, this holiday season hasn’t exactly been filled with cheer for crypto investors. Apart from battling inflation and market volatility, a recession seems to be looming ahead, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-sentiments-reveal-historically-bullish-indicator-has-surfaced/">keeping cryptos</a> such as Bitcoin, Ethereum Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu enmeshed. Since tapping an all-time high of $3.10 last November, Cardano has plunged by over 91.64%, the highest among all the other top 10 cryptos by market cap.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-sharks-accumulating-ada-rapidly"><strong>Cardano Sharks Accumulating ADA Rapidly</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the brutal winter, Cardano sharks seem to be splurging more money towards ADA at current discounted prices. According to on-chain and social metrics platform Santiment, ADA key shark addresses now hold 4 billion ADA after accumulating 331M more since the FTX implosion. Sharks for this particular cryptocurrency as addresses which hold 10,000-100,000 ADA.</p>



<p>As per the firm, whereas these addresses have been accumulating steadily since June 2021, they seem to have taken this level of dip buying to a new level since the FTX fallout in early November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Addresses holding 10k to 100k </em><em>ADA</em><em> have added $83M worth of coins since November 7</em><em><sup>th</sup></em><em>,”</em> wrote Santiment. Notably, this cohort currently holds its largest percentage of supply in 1.5 years, that is, since June 2021.</p>



<h2><strong>Key Metrics Encourage Investors</strong></h2>



<p>Besides large addresses adding to their bags, over 200,000 new Cardano wallets have been added in November alone. According to data provided by the Cardano Foundation, the overall number of wallets has risen to 3.80M from just under 3.62 million at the start of November. The cryptocurrency network also recounts <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-reigns-as-the-most-developed-crypto-asset-as-ada-leaps-forward/">explosive growth</a> since 2021, with the number of smart contracts based on Plutus, a smart contracts platform by Cardano, surging by 394% to 4,445.</p>



<p>Furthermore, roughly 7.30M native tokens are already running on Cardano after a 192% spike in the past year, with the number of transactions surpassing 56.9 million, up 139% from 2021. Although these developments are yet to show in price, large investors are likely to continue purchasing ADA with the incentive to hold it for longer as their focus increasingly shifts from value rather than hype-driven investments.</p>

<p>SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, has been putting up a price rally in the past few hours. According to crypto market intelligence platform Santiment, this rally could continue until short traders change their negative sentiment on the popular altcoin. </p>



<p>Santiment noted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1595238974187896832?s=46&amp;t=loWArq4Eobuhv-4uUzjN0g">tweet</a> that, at present, Solana does not have a lot of big believers seeing as fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) saw traders start placing massive short bets for SOL on Binance about four days ago.</p>



<p>However, the price of SOL seems to have bottomed out at $11.02 and rebounded to over $12.70 over a 15 hours period, Santiment noted. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;There are not a lot of big #Solana believers, even as its price bottomed out at $11.02 and rebounded to $12.70 over the past 15 hours. This #FUD could cause more rebounding until traders slow down their nearly unanimous bets against $SOL&#8217;s price,&#8221; Santiment wrote. </em></p>



<p>Much of the negative sentiments around Solana and SOL have originated from Solana&#8217;s ties to the collapsed FTX exchange. The Solana Foundation detailed in a recent <a href="https://solana.com/news/solana-facts-ftx-bankruptcy">blog post</a> that it had approximately $1 million worth of cash or equivalent assets on FTX as of Nov. 6 that are now stuck.</p>



<p>The post also revealed that FTX and sister firm Alameda Research holds over 50 million SOL. While most of the SOL stands vested, it did not stop investors from fearing the worst and looking to exit their SOL and other Solana ecosystem token positions on exchanges. </p>



<h2 id="h-solana-blockchain-ecosystem-is-still-advancing-with-developments"><strong>Solana blockchain ecosystem is still advancing with developments</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the price surge on the day, SOL has been down about 50% in the last month and around 92.4% since the start of the year. This has, however, not stopped development from going on in the Solana ecosystem. </p>



<p>Earlier last month, Solana Labs released an update to the Solana blockchain node software. In a tweet, co-founder of the blockchain startup Anatoly Yakovenko <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1594024294056484864?t=1TJGBecOc_jb8n1kjUSsng&amp;s=19">urged</a> validators to upgrade to the new node software version, adding that the update should fix all Solana network outage issues caused by UDP-based protocols&#8217; overload.</p>



<p>Previously, the problem had caused prolonged shutdowns and restarts of the Solana network. According to data from Solana blockchain explorer Solscan, 60.82% of 2,341 validators on the blockchain have upgraded to the latest node version. Around 11% and 7.5% are still running two former versions of the node software.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), has been recording a price surge following a remark made by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that the central bank is likely to slow down its interest rate hikes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1598095504797487105?s=46&amp;t=aeh2ddUGk3MnGKOnOI2Csw">analysis from Santiment</a>, the rare encouraging 2022 announcement saw BTC cross $17,000 and ETH cross $1,300 for the first time since the middle of November.</p>



<p>Santiment added that with interest rate hikes potentially slowing down, the crypto market may see strong bullish support in the days before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Jerome Powell made a rare encouraging 2022 announcement for markets today. With interest rate hikes potentially slowing, crypto &amp; equities immediately responded by surging. We may see strong bullish support leading up to the Dec 13-14 FOMC meetings,&#8221; Santiment said in the tweet.</em></p>



<p>The Fed was expected to announce its last rate hike for 2022—an anticipated 0.5 percentage points hike as opposed to the four previous 0.75 percentage point hikes so far in the year—during the meeting.</p>



<p>Santiment had previously <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1597397104317456384?t=qtlrUoc-YvlDC5_L5EMcqw&amp;s=19">noted</a> that Bitcoin whales have been showing &#8220;moderate signs of accumulation&#8221; in the past few days even as the market was trying to recover from the FTX exchange collapse contagion. The whales accumulated 43,888 BTC in five days, reversing a 13-months streak of cumulative dumping.</p>



<h2 id="h-bearish-sentiments-continue-to-linger-for-the-crypto-market"><strong>Bearish sentiments continue to linger for the crypto market</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the price spike that was kick-started by Powell&#8217;s encouraging remark, some analysts maintain that the crypto market is still underlyingly bearish. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/bitcoin-btc-price-tops-17000-for-the-first-time-in-two-weeks.html">told CNBC</a> that the latest rally is likely just a bearish retest.</p>



<p>He opined that the rally is a fake out as the price of BTC has currently hit resistance at $17,000 and is likely to go lower from there as the price run is a result of over-leveraged short traders covering their positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the wavering investor confidence, BTC has continued its upsurge. The flagship crypto is trading at $16,644 down 2.13% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing. Other tokens among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap have also all been trading in the green. Meanwhile, Powell&#8217;s announcement also saw the stock market record an upswing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jack Dorsey, Changpeng Zhao, and Vitalik Buterin top the list of industry executives who gave the industry a positive look in 2022.</li>



<li>Bad actors like Sam Bankman-Fried, Do Kwon, Avraham Eisenberg, etc., gave the market negative trends through their actions at certain points of the year. </li>



<li>Congress, the SEC, FTC, and other regulatory bodies are not left out of the ups and downs of the crypto market in 2022.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>As the digital asset industry wraps up for the year, several players are responsible for the positive and negative outlook of the market in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the positive line are <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jack-dorseys-first-ever-tweet-nft-that-sold-for-2-9m-ends-up-with-a-top-bid-of-just-96/">Jack Dorsey</a>, Mark Zuckerberg, and Vitalik Buterin, among others. Co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, made laudable contributions to the growth of web3 this year. Dorsey sponsored several web3 projects, including Bluesky, a decentralized social networking platform giving users control of their data.</p>



<p>In December, he gave 14 BTC to Nostr, another decentralized social media platform, alongside other efforts in BTC mining like solar and renewable energy mines.</p>



<p>Co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has pushed the development of blockchain technology to new levels. Notable among others is the Ethereum Merge, which saw the second-largest network <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">transition</a> to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism reducing energy consumption by over 98%.</p>



<p>Buterin has also been a supporter of young web3 developers this year, urging them to improve the technology in wallets and stablecoins. </p>



<p>Meta’s CEO Zuckerberg led at the forefront of the development of the metaverse this year. Although it was a bad year for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/meta-reports-a-3-67-billion-loss-in-its-metaverse-division-signaling-more-problems-for-the-company/">metaverse</a> and Meta, Zuckerberg kept the faith and continued to push developers to make the most of the opportunity to create an augmented reality for users.</p>



<p>After taking several losses running into billions this year, Zuckerberg still believes in Meta and its metaverse division pledging that the technology will get better in 2023.</p>



<h2 id="h-bad-actors-billions-gone-into-thin-air"><strong>Bad actors: billions gone into thin air</strong></h2>



<p>This year was riddled with digital asset scams as well as major decentralized applications filing for bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been the most notorious bad player in the industry this year following the collapse of FTX. SBF was seen as a successful figure in crypto spaces, but the story changed since the implosion of FTX, which is reported to have caused investors $2 billion in losses.</p>



<p>Do Kwon, the founder of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-says-alameda-instigated-terras-downfall-suggests-ftxs-collapse-is-deserved/">Terra blockchain</a>, was also in the bad books after its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD lost its peg with the dollar. Kwon has since gotten on Interpol’s Red Notice and is facing a class action suit, although his whereabouts remain unknown.</p>



<p>Avraham Heisenberg, the infamous Mango Markets hacker who wiped off $100 million from the platform, is among the top crypto bad actors of 2022. Although the platform recovered some funds, it made investors wary of decentralized applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC, ETH, XRP, and ADA record an uptick in value entering Christmas week. </li>



<li>On the other hand, DOGE is still struggling post-Elon Musk poll and traded lower by 8% in the past 7 days.</li>



<li>With the new year approaching, bulls are pushing their favourite coins to start the year on a high note.</li>
</ul>



<p>Digital asset enthusiasts have seen promise amid a turbulent market following a slight positive movement in the price of several top cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) showed positive signs of a breakout after its price increased by 1% over the weekend, trading at $16,890 but still short of the $17,000 resistance level. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand had a better weekend going up by 4% and trading at $1,223. </p>



<p>Cardano (ADA), which has performed poorly like other major assets this year, also saw slight gains over the weekend and has continued to be in the green zone on Monday. On the other end is the red zone currently hosting a large number of top assets.</p>



<p>Leading the pack is Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin (DOGE), still trading short sequel to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-takes-biggest-hit-falls-18-following-elon-musks-twitter-poll/">Musk’s Twitter poll</a> last week. DOGE has been down 8% over the past week, with its price hovering around $0.075.</p>



<p>Heavier losses hit Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Quant (QNT), and other assets in the last seven days. Solana fell 15%, exchanging hands at $11.85, while DOT plummeted 14%. Also recording double-digit losses are QNT and Avalanche (AVAX) losing 12% and 10% respectively ending the week at $105 and $11.78.</p>



<p>The recent losses in these top assets have been attributed to several factors, including the aftermath of the implosion of FTX and the wider bearish performance of the financial market.</p>



<h2 id="h-bulls-look-to-2023"><strong>Bulls look to 2023 </strong></h2>



<p>After a bad run this year, bulls have their eyes locked on 2023, with many already displaying new metrics on why their assets will soar in the new year. In the cryptoverse, the Ripple (XRP) community has been one of the loudest voices on the prospects of their coin, with bulls anticipating it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-tops-a-three-year-high-above-1-amid-new-turn-in-ripple-lawsuit/">breaking into $1</a> in Q1 2023.</p>



<p>Despite the current setbacks, DOGE fans still hope for their anticipated Twitter use cases like incorporated payments to push the price to a new level. Like XRP, the DOGE community has predicted the coin to hit $1 in 2023. Market leaders BTC and ETH have both lost over 50% of their market cap with investors hoping for a recovery in Q1 2023.</p>

<p>Ethereum, the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is set to come out ahead of Bitcoin in the next bull market, according to Bloomberg’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone.</p>



<p>Despite Bitcoin and other risk assets deflating considerably in the past year, McGlone noted in the latest market outlook report that Ethereum <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-discloses-three-landmark-opportunities-for-crypto-in-2023/">exhibited more resilience</a>, suggesting that it “may be a top candidate to continue outperforming the firstborn crypto.”</p>



<p>Since tapping all-time highs in November 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped roughly 76% and 75%, respectively. Notably, Ethereum’s annual volatility is about 1.3x that of bitcoin. Thus, while Ethereum is still deeply undervalued, McGlone noted that at a ratio of 0.08, the ETH/BTC cross rate remained the same as in May 2021 when the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index was about 20% higher, tilting ETH towards resuming appreciation if volatility tells us anything.</p>



<p><em>“Our graphic shows the trend of the No. 2 crypto outperforming No. 1, which appeared coincident with the rise of risk assets. This year’s 30% drop in the Nasdaq is part of a receding tide, including about a 65% decline in Ethereum to Dec 16,”</em> he wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RD4oT4N2vnO9YmzGUXDFFEdiCy6mcljgjmSJ3MnV9cdyrs13ABGjYYawnKFzhoSeMvvnALzjkzGHyjL4b-jYpeOlX35sV4ZPzWldvHoO-zOwZGkUh_cQRZ4tJHJemdF9rp4NEwwdeFq1mMa_AELHb0PgFgnsn_SEirfkTgFnD50IwNJSRKZkclroRRqwdu8Y8r13H3ueQQ" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-ethereum-s-holy-grail"><strong>Ethereum’s Holy Grail</strong></h2>



<p>According to the pundit, Ethereum’s resilience and projected outperformance against the top crypto-asset are largely tied to mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>“<em>Migration into the mainstream is our key takeaway and once the dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressures, Ethereum is more likely to resume doing what it has been&#8212;outperforming,”</em> Glone added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum has been at the centre of focus in the past year as crypto adoption gathers steam globally.&nbsp;Although the crypto was modelled like bitcoin in its early years, Ethereum went a step further and now powers a wide range of applications through smart contracts -becoming a darling to institutions, developers and enthusiasts who believe that it&#8217;s a valuable altcoin with real-world use cases.</p>



<p>In the past year, thousands of projects and companies, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/paypal-teams-up-with-metamask-to-enable-ethereum-purchases-in-the-us/">such as PayPal</a>, have enrolled their services on the network seeking to make a footprint in the Metaverse, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous applications (DAOs).</p>



<p>The demand for Ethereum has largely been depicted in the rise of its market dominance. In 2021, Ethereum’s market dominance rose as high as 22%, suggesting it could “Flippen” Bitcoin at some point.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s migration from Proof-of-Work to a more eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake consensus blockchain earlier this year has also boosted its appeal to governments and institutions worldwide as the push for lesser carbon footprints rages on.</p>



<p>Ethereum was trading at $1,212 after a 0.36% increase in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $16,851 after adding 0.44% in the same period, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>The crypto market could be poised for a price rise going by historical market sentiment data pointed out by the crypto market intelligence tracking platform Santiment.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1593713589113610240?t=8-Z3v8QnNxamUjGtPmFXnA&amp;s=19">tweet</a>, Santiment noted that fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the crypto market had reached their most negative level in five months. This is indicated by the fact that conversations relating to crypto on all major social platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and Telegram, are leaning towards a major bearish bias.</p>



<p>According to the analysis, such levels of negativity have historically increased the probability of future price rises.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Conversations relating to current market conditions on Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and Telegram indicate a major #bearish bias. This historically increases the probability of future price rises,&#8221; Santiment said.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, the metric is not the only bearish indicator Santiment anticipates contributing to a crypto market price bounce. The platform has <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1594767648625131523?t=zpVzSHB1KJuoQws5MuAWRg&amp;s=19">pointed</a> out that the Bitcoin (BTC) market has been seeing many traders finally liquidate their assets as its price has fallen to a two-year low.</p>



<p>The massive exodus of investors has resulted in the BTC market seeing the lowest level of transactions made while in profit since Nov. 2019. According to Santiment, bounces also typically occur when this happens in the market.</p>



<h2 id="h-ftx-collapse-is-still-the-leading-source-of-crypto-market-negative-sentiments"><strong>FTX collapse is still the leading source of crypto market negative sentiments</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-deliberate-move-shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-blames-binance-for-ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a> and the market contagion it sparked have continued to be the major cause of the crypto market&#8217;s unravelling in recent weeks. The market jitter has now reached Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary Genesis, a liquidity provider to FTX. </p>



<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-21/crypto-firm-genesis-warns-of-possible-bankruptcy-without-funding">report</a>, the crypto derivatives trading and lending firm has mentioned that it is considering filing for bankruptcy if it cannot raise around $1 billion in fresh funding from investors.</p>



<p>Aside from affected crypto firms, the collapse has been rocking the already shaky trust regulators had for the crypto market. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Tina Smith, and Richard Durbin recently wrote to Fidelity Investments to reconsider their plans to introduce Bitcoin exposure to workplace retirement plans it manages.</p>



<p><em>“The recent implosion of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, has made it abundantly clear the digital asset industry has serious problems,” the Senators said. </em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-treasurys-yellen-more-effective-oversight-needed-crypto-markets-2022-11-16/">stated</a> that the failure of FTX and its impact on crypto investors &#8220;demonstrates the need for more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets.&#8221;</p>
