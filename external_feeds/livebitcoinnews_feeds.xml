										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to risky assets like crypto, Singapore banks <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/singapore-banks-exposure-bitcoin-insignificant-163349646.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">are no longer required</a> to hold 1:1 in collateral, but rather 1.25:1. What this means is that for every $1 in cryptocurrency, a financial institution needs to hold $1.25 in regular cash. This is designed to ensure there are enough reserves in place to cover losses or other problems should the crypto industry decide to crash and burn all over again.</p>
<h2>Singapore Is Trying to Stop Future Crypto Problems</h2>
<p>2022 was one of the worst years for the crypto market. Many assets – including bitcoin, the world’s largest and most popular – fell by more than 70 percent from their all-time highs, many of which were achieved in November of 2021. During that time, it seemed like crypto was on top of the world and there was nothing that could ever bring it down.</p>
<p>We were wrong. The digital currency arena fell like it never has before. This bear market wiped away not millions or billions of dollars, but rather trillions as the crypto space fell from a valuation of about $3 trillion in early 2022 to just over $800 billion by the end of the year. It was sad, it was ugly, and above all, it was embarrassing, especially for all those who had been touting the space for several months or years and claiming it was going to bring a financial revolution to light.</p>
<p>Singapore – widely recognized for its strict financial tactics – wants to make sure it’s fully prepared for any losses or other significant damage the crypto space might seek to dole out in the coming future. Senior minister in charge of the Monetary Authority of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam explained in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pending the finalization of the framework, MAS requires Singapore-incorporated banks to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight for exposures to riskier crypto assets such as bitcoin and ether. Based on MAS’ minimum total capital adequacy requirement of ten percent for systemically important banks incorporated in Singapore, this means that Singapore-incorporated banks are required to hold $125 of capital against an exposure of $100 to a crypto asset like bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>The country has been privy to the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">rise and fall of FTX</a>, one of the world’s largest and most powerful digital currency exchanges. The company came crashing down in mid-November and has sent heavy ripples flowing through the digital currency arena. The company has caused many other firms, such as Block Fi, to be <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/block-fi-is-the-latest-crypto-company-to-go-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">hit hard and file</a> bankruptcy.</p>
<h2>Lesser Measures for Other Tokens</h2>
<p>Shanmugaratnam further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>For less risky crypto assets, such as tokenized corporate bonds that meet a set of conditions to ensure that they pose the same level of financial risks as traditional corporate bonds, the prudential treatment is similar to that applied to the traditional non-tokenized asset.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Senator of Wyoming Cynthia Lummis says <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-senator-lummis-ftx-collapse-145524462.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">what happened with FTX</a> is exactly why Congress needs to begin paying attention to cryptocurrency. She cited the bipartisan bill she established in early 2022 with New York congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand (a democrat from New York) and said U.S. regulators need to give the bill their full attention so that what happened with the exchange can never happen again.</p>
<h2>Cynthia Lummis on the Future of Crypto in Congress</h2>
<p>Lummis is known for her heavy support of the crypto space and her attempts to introduce crypto legislation to the mix. Discussing the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">recent fall of FTX</a>, Lummis commented with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope it&#8217;s highlighted with members of Congress who have not taken the time to learn more about this asset class. That it&#8217;s time for them to learn more about it so we can engage in proper regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>She stated FTX was widely involved in the establishment of the new Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), which has the support of several legislators including Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Senator Debbie Stabenow (a democrat of Michigan) and republican Arkansas congressman John Boozman.</p>
<p>Sadly, FTX has brought a lot of embarrassment not just to the crypto space, but to politics. FTX founder and head executive Sam Bankman-Fried was often sitting down to testify before members of Congress to discuss the potential for newfound regulation in the space. After his company fell, Bankman-Fried admitted that he only did this for publicity purposes, and that he has no desire to push crypto regulation given that in his mind, it often gets in the way.</p>
<p>Discussing her bipartisan bill, she says that it needs to be changed and adapted to account for what’s occurred with the exchange. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>That bill needs to be rewritten in a way that is more effective and neutral as to business models, but very, very focused on consumer protection.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also said that Sam Bankman-Fried was very persuasive in his personality and overall demeanor. His charm is what allegedly allowed him to play around with the company’s finances and with customer funds for so long.</p>
<h2>What Will Happen in the New Year?</h2>
<p>Lummis didn’t think anything would happen with her bill prior to the end of 2022 given that Congress was on the verge of breaking for various holidays. Now that we’re back in January, she’s confident something important can happen. She stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we reconvene in January with the new Congress, I&#8217;m very hopeful that Lummis-Gillibrand will be high on our legislative agenda… Now that people have seen what happened with FTX, hopefully, they have staffers saying, &#8216;Okay, would Lummis-Gillibrand in their legislation have addressed this?&#8217; So, they can use it as a framework… for looking at how we could have prevented FTX, and how we could prevent future failures as colossal as FTX.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman is taking a lot of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/hedge-fund-billionaire-bill-ackman-walks-back-endorsement-of-questionable-cryptocurrency/ar-AA14F25w" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">flak for his support</a> of a digital currency called Helium. Many users on Twitter and other social media platforms are calling him out for his alleged ignorance and claim that Helium is nothing but a Ponzi scheme.</p>
<h2>Bill Ackman Gets Jumped on for His Helium Praise</h2>
<p>The crypto space is filled with vast opportunities, some of which are real and some of which aren’t. Many players out there say you really need to keep your eyes and ears open regarding which could be fake, and which might lead to trouble down the line. The crypto space – while growing rapidly and offering all kinds of new doorways to investors – is also marred with scams and bad actors that traders really need to be aware of.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Ackman sent out a series of tweets that said crypto could bring a lot to the financial table. While he may have been right, many felt his messages were ill-timed given that they came not long after the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">collapse of FTX</a>. The exchange is likely to go down as one of the biggest embarrassments to ever occur within the realms of the digital currency arena, and it is alleged that executives used customer funds to purchase luxury condos in the Bahamas for themselves.</p>
<p>In his message, Ackman singled out a few specific digital currencies to be lauded. One was Dimo, and the other Helium. He cited the latter as the prime example of something that can build “value over time.”</p>
<p>Following the release of these tweets, crypto fans and enthusiasts were quick to jump on what they felt was an apparent lack of knowledge. They said that Helium had told several lies about itself in the past, and they were shocked to see Ackman cite it as such a powerful and positive example of crypto.</p>
<p>Crypto critic and former actor of “Gotham” fame Ben McKenzie commented in a response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Helium lied about its [sic] users and made $6,500 a month after getting $365 million from @a16z. Umm, Bill [you] okay?</p></blockquote>
<p>Cory Klippenstein – the CEO of bitcoin exchange Swan Bitcoin – was also quick to jump on Ackman, stating in a message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bill, NO. The Helium token was an actual Ponzi scheme.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crypto researcher Jacob Silverman mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is this thread from a year ago? Helium has been widely discredited by people who looked at its janky tokenomics.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Reasons for the Tweets</h2>
<p>Ackman was quick to defend himself, saying he wasn’t trying to pump any specific coin, but rather aiming to boost the idea of tokenization. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In retrospect, HNT was overvalued as the Helium network has not yet generated sufficient demand to justify the high initial HNT valuations. Crypto projects suffer the same basic laws of economics as other businesses.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s happened again, folks. Another digital currency company has filed for bankruptcy protection. This time, it’s Block Fi, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/28/1139431115/blockfi-ftx-bankruptcy-chapter-11" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">crypto lending platform</a>, which was reported to be <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-crypto-firm-block-fi-next-in-line-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">heading in this direction</a> back in late December.</p>
<h2>Block Fi Is the Latest Crypto Firm to Crash</h2>
<p>Ironically, the company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-discusses-his-bailout-of-crypto-firms/" data-wpel-link="internal">was one of the few</a> to be “saved” by FTX earlier in the year, though now that its savior is crashing and burning before the eyes of the public, Block Fi no longer has what it takes to remain still, and the company is going under like so many others.</p>
<p>In a letter to customers, the company wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rest assured, we will continue to work on recovering all obligations owed to Block Fi as promptly as practicable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prior to the declaration, Block Fi had halted withdrawals and requested that all traders working with its platform refrain from submitting deposits.</p>
<p>The company’s co-founders Zac Prince (CEO) and Flori Marquez (COO) announced that they were troubled by the direction their company was now being forced to take as a direct response to the problems associated with FTX. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are deeply saddened to see the devastation that is cascading across an industry that we love and believe in, touching the lives of so many people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many months ago, Block Fi – like so many crypto companies – was dealing with ongoing hardships thanks to the falling prices of the world’s most renowned coins. Bitcoin, for example, which was trading at a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021, has fallen into the $16K range at press time, thus losing more than 70 percent of its value. In total, the crypto space has lost more than $2.2 trillion in valuation.</p>
<p>At the time, the firm was approached by FTX, which proposed specific bailout terms that the enterprise found appropriate. Both Prince and Marquez said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, we found a great partner in FTX US, who shares our commitment to clients.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, what’s going on now with FTX is causing heavy ripples throughout the space, and the fiasco surrounding the now disgraced crypto exchange is likely to be labeled as one of the most embarrassing to occur within the borders of digital currency.</p>
<h2>FTX Has Caused Several Problems</h2>
<p>For the past three years, FTX was considered a golden player in the crypto arena, and its founder and head executive – Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius by many, but that all faded in mid-November of last year when the exchange said it was experiencing a “<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">liquidity crunch</a>” and needed cash.</p>
<p>The company approached its larger rival Binance for help, but when that company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">refused to provide</a> necessary aid, FTX was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">forced into bankruptcy proceedings</a>, and its founder instantly resigned from his position. It was a sad, and altogether <em>scary</em> sight to see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DCG (Digital Currency Group) – the crypto company that owns Grayscale – is <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-teeters-grayscale-owner-dcb-reveals-debt-145958704.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">allegedly $2 billion in debt</a>, giving traders and crypto analysts a lot to be anxious about.</p>
<h2>DCG Is Allegedly Dealing with Tons of Debt</h2>
<p>Barry Silbert – the man who founded DCG – stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have weathered previous crypto winters. While this one may feel more severe, collectively we will come out of it stronger.</p></blockquote>
<p>The goal was to try and calm people’s nerves, though this is easier said than done given that this crypto bear run appears to be unlike anything the space has ever experienced or seen before. Right now, bitcoin – the world’s number one digital currency by market cap – has lost more than 70 percent of its overall value.</p>
<p>In November of 2021, for example, the currency rose to a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit. However, since then, the currency has fallen into the mid-$16K level. Many other digital currencies have followed suit and the space has lost more than $2.2 trillion in overall valuation. It’s a sad, and above all, scary sight to see; one that puts many investors in a state of harsh worry.</p>
<p>The news regarding DCG was first brought to light on Twitter by crypto commentator TradFiWhale, who reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>DCG&#8217;s Grayscale business is extremely valuable. DCG doesn&#8217;t want to fire sale this, so, they will likely let Genesis go under. Genesis likely filing for bankruptcy. I think creditors will eventually get most of [the] money back, and DCG will survive with a black eye and marred reputation.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to the news getting out, DCG issued its own tweet trying to bring people’s concerns to a lower position. It wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The impact lies with the lending business at Genesis and does not affect Genesis’ trading or custody businesses. Importantly, this temporary action has no impact on the business operations of DCG and our other wholly owned subsidiaries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, Silbert went onto a podcast to try and shed light on the situation. He was asked by the podcast host if Genesis was going to take “cryptocurrency down.” Silbert responded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the difficult industry conditions, I am as excited as ever about the potential for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology over the coming decades, and DCG is determined to remain at the forefront.</p></blockquote>
<h2>FTX to Blame?</h2>
<p>The entire crypto space has been suffering since the beginning of 2022. However, things allegedly got a lot worse when last November, golden child FTX – long considered one of the best and most popular digital currency exchanges in the world – fell into oblivion.</p>
<p>The company experienced a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">sudden liquidity crunch</a> that saw it seeking aid from rival Binance. When the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">latter refused to help</a>, the company was forced <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">into bankruptcy</a> and its head executive (Sam Bankman-Fried) resigned from his post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ben Mezrich is an author who wrote the book, “Bitcoin BTC Billionaires,” which talks about the rise of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/winklevoss/" data-wpel-link="internal">Winklevoss Twins</a> from their early days trying to develop what would eventually turn into Facebook to their adult lives as some of the biggest bitcoin bulls out there.</p>
<h2>Ben Mezrich Is Writing a New NFT Book</h2>
<p>Right now, the book is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/personalfinance/e2-80-98bitcoin-billionaires-e2-80-99-author-ben-mezrich-takes-on-amazon-self-publishing/ar-AA14j1Hf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">being adapted into a film</a> and is in pre-production, meaning things are still being planned out and the project is in its earliest stages. Overall, Mezrich has seen many of his books adapted for the screen, and he acknowledged his position of power in a recent interview, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m in a situation right now where I can easily sell anything simply because I have so many things under production.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Mezrich is working on a new book that will talk about the non-fungible token (NFT) craze. The novel will be fiction and detail the strife and troubles of an artist, a scammer, and a trader trying to get rich with NFTs. Interestingly, Mezrich has spent some time dealing with NFTs himself, having recently sold roughly 7,000 individual units of personalized (digital) art. At today’s prices, those tokens are worth nearly half a million dollars, and he gave about 2,000 other units away.</p>
<p>Anyone holding those tokens will receive screenplay royalties once his book is optioned into a movie or television program. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>My goal is that the Ben Mezrich NFT project becomes a place where other authors are going to launch book-related projects, and the goal is eventually big-name authors and brand-new authors who maybe would not have had the chance to do something like this are going to be able to rather than just try to send a manuscript off to a publisher, to take the bones of a manuscript, show it to an NFT community, and launch an NFT drop around it. If people like it, you are essentially having the community fund your ability to write a book that the community then owns or buys. I don&#8217;t really see us as competing with publishers as much as Amazon Kindle.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Writing About Very Rich People</h2>
<p>Mezrich is a graduate of Harvard and holds a degree in social studies, which he earned in 1991. He has mostly developed a writing career telling stories about billionaires or rich people that earned their keep through odd or interesting ways. In his interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As an artist – and I sometimes consider myself an artist — as a writer, we see value in the works we create. The idea that that value can translate into something digital, truly digital that you still own, is neat, and so that was the first inkling of it. They were talking to me about it, but I wasn&#8217;t going to do anything about it.</p></blockquote>

<li>Bitcoin cash is facing barrier near the $105 and $108 resistance levels against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above the $100 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $100 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $104 and $105 to continue higher in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is climbing above $100 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-steady-increase-to-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $105 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $95 level. BCH started a recovery wave and was able to clear the $98 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $99 and $100 resistance levels. Recently, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $100 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is now trading above the $100 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-downside-break-below-100-seems-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $104 level. The next major resistance is near the $105 level, above which the price may perhaps rise towards the $110 level. Any more gains above $110 and $112 could set the pace for a move towards the $120 level in the coming days.</p>
<p>An immediate support on the downside is near the $100 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $95 swing low to $104 high.</p>
<p>The first major support sits near the $98 level. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $95 swing low to $104 high. The next major support is near $95, below which the bears might aim $90. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $88 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Changpeng Zhao – the man behind famed digital currency exchange Binance – has pledged <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/11/25/terra-luna-20-binance-ceo-reveals-huge-2-billion-fund-after-ftx-meltdown-crashed-the-bitcoin-and-crypto-price/?sh=20081532753b" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">roughly $2 billion to help</a> save the digital currency arena.</p>
<h2>Binance Is Looking to Save the Crypto Space</h2>
<p>The crypto space has been failing as of late. Bitcoin, for example, has lost more than 70 percent of its overall value since it reached its new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021. In general, crypto has lost more than $2.2 trillion in valuation, and many companies have either had to file for bankruptcy or have disappeared from the world of trading and digital coins for good.</p>
<p>One of the biggest fiascos to emerge from all this hype and drama was FTX, the once-glorified crypto exchange that rose through the ranks to become one of the most prominent digital currency trading companies out there. Beginning in 2019, FTX was only three years old, but was labeled the golden child of the space.</p>
<p>This all changed in mid-November when after <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">experiencing a liquidity crunch</a>, the company was forced into <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">bankruptcy rather suddenly</a>, and its head executive (Sam Bankman-Fried) resigned from his post. For a while, it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">looked like Binance was</a> going to be the company that saved it from the darkness, but this wasn’t meant to be.</p>
<p>The money provided by Binance will allegedly go towards supporting several different companies and projects within the industry’s borders. According to a blog post issued by the exchange:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mandate of this new effort is to support the most promising and highest quality companies and projects built by the best technologists and entrepreneurs that, through no fault of their own, are facing significant, short-term, financial difficulties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, Binance was saying it would only pledge $1 billion, though this quickly changed. Changpeng Zhao wrote on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Binance allocated another $1 billion [in Binance&#8217;s dollar-pegged stable coin] to the industry recovery initiative. It&#8217;s not the end of crypto. Far from it. It&#8217;s the beginning of a new chapter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not everyone is crazy about the idea. Cory Klippensten – a known crypto skeptic – said of the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obviously, a CZ-led recovery fund won&#8217;t be any better than an SBF-led effort to &#8216;save crypto.’ All it means is more money pumped into the casino to fuel greater fool gambling on inherently worthless non-bitcoin crypto tokens. If CZ succeeds in further centralizing the non-bitcoin crypto industry, it will only make it more prone to collapse or regulatory capture.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Not Everyone&#8217;s Convinced This Will Work</h2>
<p>Liron Shapira – a crypto market commentator – also expressed doubt, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a scenario where this particular fund does much to stop the inevitable collapse. The idea of an insurance fund against a structural, cascading collapse never works. At best, it can keep delaying by another day which is the whole way the Ponzi works in the first place. The more money they burn through, the longer they can keep it going.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Lee of Fundstrat fame believes that what happened with the now disgraced <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto exchange FTX</a> should not reflect on bitcoin <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-crypto-crash-bitcoin-invest-untouchable-fundstrat-tom-lee-2022-11" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">or the industry in general</a>. He still believes in the power of crypto and doesn’t think the arena should suffer because of what a few bad actors have done.</p>
<h2>Tom Lee on Bitcoin and FTX</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Lee commented that the current bear run the crypto space is enduring is similar with the one it experienced in 2018. He said that bear run came to an end sooner than people anticipated. He commented that the space showed valid recovery in the following years, and he’s confident the same thing will happen this time around.</p>
<p>He further stated that the FTX fiasco isn’t likely to deliver a heavy-enough blow to the crypto sector given that bitcoin has historically always delivered solid returns. He further mentioned that this isn’t necessarily a bad thing in that many illicit firms and companies have now been permanently cut out.</p>
<p>Lee commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s an important moment for the industry. I think it is cleaning a lot of and cleansing a lot of bad players, but do I think crypto is dead? No, I think there [are] a lot of people throwing gasoline in a crowded theatre and yelling ‘fire,’ and it&#8217;s just going to be important for those who really like what decentralization and bitcoin are doing.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further mentioned that 2022 was a horrendous year for the crypto sector. Aside from many companies filing bankruptcy or disappearing from the space, the bitcoin price has suffered heavily. In November of 2021, for example, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap rose to a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit. Now, however, the asset is trading in the mid-$16K range, meaning it’s lost more than 70 percent of its value in about 12 months.</p>
<p>Lee said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s been a horrific year for crypto. Nobody has made money in crypto in 2022. We first read about bitcoin in 2017, and we recommended people put one percent of their funds into bitcoin at the time. Bitcoin was under $1,000. That holding today would be 40 percent of their portfolio without rebalance.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto Could Come Out Stronger</h2>
<p>Despite all the trouble the space has endured over the past year or so, he says his firm is still advising clients not to turn their backs on bitcoin and to invest in the digital asset in small doses so they can experience rewards once the market comes back. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, does bitcoin still make sense for someone who wants to sort of have some sort of ballast? Yes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Lee said the crypto companies that survive the FTX drama will be like the banks that survived the 2008 financial collapse.</p>
