            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recently launched XRP20 ($XRP20) presale has now raised over $1.1 million, with less than 50% of the allotted tokens remaining for purchase.</p>
<p>Branded as &#8220;the next evolution of XRP,&#8221; <a href="https://bs_b791c467.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=xrp20-presale-raises-1-1m-with-less-than-50-of-tokens-now-remaining-could-it-pump-higher-than-xrp" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20 ($XRP20)</a> aims to provide investors with a second chance to buy a token inspired by the original XRP.</p>
<p>With the presale heating up, some speculate whether $XRP20 could pump higher than $XRP once it makes its DEX debut in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>XRP20 Presale Surges Past $1m Milestone as Hype Intensifies</h2>
<p>The ongoing XRP20 presale has surged past the $1 million mark, with early investors snapping up over half of the token allocation.</p>
<p>XRP20&#8217;s presale has seen increasing demand over the past week as fear of missing out (FOMO) intensifies among investors seeking exposure to this new token.</p>
<p>Investors can purchase $XRP20 tokens for just $0.000092 – a price point 30 times cheaper than $XRP&#8217;s all-time low of $0.0028.</p>
<p>This premise has struck a chord with those who missed out on XRP’s early days.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264979" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-9.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="277" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-9.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-9-300x138.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-9-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>If XRP20 continues gaining traction at this pace, there’s a growing belief that the soft cap of $1.85 million could be hit in the next seven days.</p>
<p>This has further fueled the hype around XRP20, with the <a href="https://t.me/XRP20_coin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">project’s Telegram channel</a> seeing impressive membership growth.</p>
<p>Not only that, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHr-AhYfIok&amp;pp=ygUFeHJwMjA%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">crypto YouTuber Jacob Bury</a>, who boasts an audience of over 20,000, has released several videos discussing his optimism about XRP20.</p>
<p>Time will tell if XRP20 can maintain momentum after its presale concludes, but for the time being, interest continues to build from the investment community.</p>
<h2>Development Team Leverages XRP Nostalgia with “Second Chance” Branding</h2>
<p>A key aspect of <a href="https://bs_b791c467.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=xrp20-presale-raises-1-1m-with-less-than-50-of-tokens-now-remaining-could-it-pump-higher-than-xrp" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20’s</a> marketing strategy is its “second chance” branding, which taps into nostalgia and regret among investors who missed out on buying the original $XRP before its bull run.</p>
<p>By promoting the token as the &#8220;next evolution of XRP,&#8221; XRP20&#8217;s team lays the groundwork for possible post-listing growth.</p>
<p>Although there’s no direct link between the two projects, the team hopes to leverage the power of the original $XRP in the hope of achieving similar success.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264978" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-9.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="300" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-9.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-9-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-9-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>For context, $XRP’s initial bull run saw the token’s price rise by an incredible 137,000% between February 2017 and March 2018.</p>
<p>As seen with the early presale growth, XRP20&#8217;s marketing strategy is working well, with investors from around the world piling in to snag tokens before the allocation is depleted.</p>
<p>With XRP&#8217;s price down 33% in the past three weeks, XRP20&#8217;s launch coincides with recent declines in the original token&#8217;s value &#8211; potentially allowing the new token to capitalize on investor interest.</p>
<h2>Key Features Like Staking &amp; Token Burning Attract Early Investors</h2>
<p>Beyond effective branding, some of the core features of the XRP20 token have also generated excitement among investors.</p>
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://xrp20coin.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20’s whitepaper</a>, staking is a vital part of the ecosystem, with 40% of the total token supply reserved for staking rewards.</p>
<p>This sizable allocation provides consistent tokenized rewards for those who lock up their tokens while also reducing the circulating supply of $XRP20 at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-12.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264977" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-12.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="207" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-12.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-12-300x103.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-12-50x17.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>XRP20’s team has also implemented deflationary mechanisms like a 0.1% transaction burn fee and an additional 10% of the token supply set aside for burning.</p>
<p>These strategies help increase scarcity – and thereby the price prospects for $XRP20.</p>
<p>All in all, XRP20’s appealing staking rewards and deflationary dynamics are proving enticing for presale investors hoping to capitalize on its early-stage growth potential.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price just formed a golden cross chart pattern over the 200 day window. This has only happened twice before on BTC's chart, and both times preceded bull runs to new all time highs.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin was trading between $29,000 and $29,100 early Monday after a mild five-day slump and a month down 4.26%. But the leading cryptocurrency&#8217;s price tumbled at a level high enough to flash the bullish charting signal after March and June&#8217;s big pumps.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin price lazily range-traded amid unprecedented <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/weird-signal-bitcoin-5-day-volatility-inversion-with-wall-st-what-does-it-mean-for-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">low volatility</a> late last week, its moving averages over different time ranges began to shift. Just briefly, the 50-day moving average crossed over the 200-day moving average. That&#8217;s what charting specialists among day traders <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">call a</a> golden cross.</p>
<figure id="attachment_264968" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-264968" style="width: 816px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_10-52-05.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-264968" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_10-52-05.jpg" alt="photo_2023-08-08_10-52-05" width="816" height="228" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_10-52-05.jpg 816w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_10-52-05-300x84.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_10-52-05-768x215.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_10-52-05-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-264968" class="wp-caption-text">Source: FXStreet</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Charts Rare Golden Cross Pattern</h2>
<p>Golden crosses are bullish indicators. They suggest recent price action has deviated so far from the 200-day average that the market is reevaluating the floor price level. When this happens with Bitcoin, it can lead to bubble-like melt-ups.</p>
<p>The BTC 50-day moving average has been riding the 200-day MA close since November. But it finally <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">broke above</a> the slower moving average on August 4. Since then, Bitcoin&#8217;s 50-day moving average has fallen and given some space back to the longer trend.</p>
<p>A golden cross of the 50 and 200-day moving average for BTC has only happened twice before! This is the third golden cross of this kind in the crypto&#8217;s entire history as a traded asset.</p>
<h2>A Long-Term Bullish Trend Reversal Signal</h2>
<p>Both previous Bitcoin golden cross patterns preceded significant price run-ups for BTC to new all-time highs. The first one happened in early 2016 and signaled the 2016 &#8211; 2017 bull run.</p>
<p>The second was in the second half of 2019 and preceded the 2020 &#8211; 2021 bull run, so it&#8217;s a long-range indicator. If the current signal is portentous, it could still be some months before the rally it will have portended begins.</p>
<p>That means investors still have time to plan their <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/whats-the-cheapest-day-of-the-week-to-buy-bitcoin-we-asked-google-bard/" data-wpel-link="internal">accumulation strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Both golden crosses happened near the Bitcoin cyclical price bottom. The first one, in 2016, happened some months after the bottom, and the second one in 2019, a few months before the bottom.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has made some major strides in recovering in 2023, but it remains below 50% of its previous record high.</p>
<p>Crypto investors who just bought and held BTC massively <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-massively-outperforms-crypto-hedge-funds-in-2023-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">outperformed crypto hedge funds</a> in 2023.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Since the deadline has passed, Curve has extended a 10% bounty for the remaining funds to the public as promised.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hackers behind the recent exploit of several pools on the decentralized exchange Curve Finance have returned approximately 73% of the stolen crypto assets, accounting for about $52.3 million.</p>
<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1688404426825117697?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> Monday that Curve Finance lost $73.5 million in the hack. With the amount recovered so far, the exchange is looking to recoup the remaining $19.7 million.</p>
<h2>Curve Finance Recovers $52M of Stolen Assets</h2>
<p>Eight days ago, Curve Finance <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/curve-finance-hacker-returns-5-4-million-but-crv-dumps-15/" data-wpel-link="internal">suffered</a> a reentrancy attack that affected four pools using a certain version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract programming language Vyper. The hack extended to several decentralized finance protocols, including Metronome, Alchemix, and Ellipsis.</p>
<p>On August 3, Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix contacted the attackers via an on-chain message, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/curve-finance-offers-10-bug-bounty-to-attackers-behind-vyper-50m-exploit/" data-wpel-link="internal">offering</a> a 10% bug bounty in exchange for the return of 90% of the stolen assets. The platforms promised to cease pursuing the case with law enforcement if the assets were returned before 08:00 UTC on August 6.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the proposal would force the protocols to offer a public and give the reward to whoever identifies the hackers in a way that leads to their conviction in court, per the message.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after the proposal, one of the exploiters <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8#tokentxns" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">sent</a> 4,819 ether (ETH) worth $8.9 million to Alchemix after <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0af1d34ec0bb67a99f0148863558e4c84804349415801874876a17f85e4290e1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">asking</a> the protocol team to confirm their wallet address to avoid making a wrong transfer.</p>
<h2>Curve Extends Bounty for Remaining Funds</h2>
<p>Over the weekend, the attackers returned most funds to the affected protocols. PeckShield explained that Alchemix received all of its lost assets, amounting to $22 million in ETH and alETH, while JPEG’d, another affected protocol, received $10.1 million in WETH.</p>
<p>In addition, white hat hackers returned the $13 million taken from Alchemix during the exploit, and Metronome received $1.4 million, adding to the $5.4 million returned by c0ffeebabe.eth on August 31. It is worth noting that JPEG’d and Metronome hackers returned 90% of the funds, keeping the remaining 10% as Curve offered.</p>
<p>Since the deadline has passed, Curve has <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1688221472815284224?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">extended</a> a 10% bounty for the remaining funds to the public as promised. The exchange noted that the offer would end if the exploiter chose to return the funds in full.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Solana saw the highest inflows among the altcoins, clocking its most bullish week in 16 months.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The summer period&#8217;s lackluster trading activity is evident as digital asset investment products recorded outflows of $107 million this week. The profit-taking has gathered tremendous pace lately, with weekly trading volumes in investment products 36% below the year-to-date average.</p>
<p>The wider on-exchange market has experienced a more significant decline, with volumes down 62% relative to the year-to-date average, according to the latest edition of CoinShares&#8217; weekly report on digital asset fund flows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutional investors have continued to focus on Bitcoin and <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-143-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-6d46f78754c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">witnessed</a> outflows of $111 million. This marks the largest weekly outflows since March as regulatory tensions escalated in the US.</li>
<li>CoinShares also revealed that the outflows into short bitcoin have stopped for the first time in 14 weeks, indicating that institutional investors have stopped betting against crypto despite the summer doldrums.</li>
<li>Ethereum, too experienced outflows amounting to a total of $6 million, contributing to a combined outflow of $117 million for both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past week.</li>
<li>There is an apparent improvement in sentiment towards altcoins, which has helped counterbalance the outflows in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li>
<li>Solana witnessed its most significant influxes, reaching a total of $9.5 million, representing the highest amount of weekly inflows since March 2022.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Cardano ecosystem has grown significantly despite ADA's inaction. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano (ADA) has shown promising indications of growth in Q2 despite lackluster market activity. Emerging infrastructure such as stablecoins, programming languages, and wallets are helping Cardano developers to craft advanced applications enriched with enhanced user experiences, according to a new report by Messari.</p>
<p>The blockchain intelligence platform reported that the Cardano ecosystem has managed to diversify with newer protocols that have contributed significantly to various activity metrics even as ADA&#8217;s price and market cap suffered a drawdown during the period.</p>
<h2>Cardano Ecosystem Growth: Q2</h2>
<p>According to Messari&#8217;s <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-cardano-q2-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> titled &#8216;State of Cardano&#8217; for the Q2 edition, the average transaction rose by 8.5% compared to the previous quarter, going from $0.117 to $0.126. Despite this consecutive quarterly rise, the average transaction fee in USD remains 50.8% lower year over year, primarily due to decreased ADA prices compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Transaction activity also surged in the second quarter of the year. Average daily transactions increased by approximately 2% QoQ from 67,500 to 68,800. Messari highlighted that the growth is crucial as movement in transactions and active addresses are typically correlated, but have deviated slightly in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Over the last five quarters, there has been a consistent increase in the ratio of transactions to active addresses, indicating heightened user engagement compared to earlier periods. During Q2, the Transaction / Active Address ratio reached 1.19, marking a sequential rise of 6.1% and a year-over-year surge of 13.2%.</p>
<p>For the third successive quarter, Cardano has witnessed growth in its average daily dapp transactions. Dapp usage surged with a notable 49.0% increase from the previous quarter in Q2, maintaining an average of 57,900 daily transactions.</p>
<h2>Surging Blockchain Activity</h2>
<p>Cardano&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) saw a 9.7% quarter-over-quarter rise, reaching $151.7 million. This growth in TVL is particularly noteworthy given the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ada-at-critical-support-massive-move-expected-three-things-to-watch-cardano-price-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">decrease</a> in ADA&#8217;s price. Furthermore, the layer-1 smart contract platform&#8217;s year-to-date TVL has soared by 198.6% (in USD), propelling it from the 34th to the 21st position among all networks in 2023.</p>
<p>Minswap, which happens to be an automated market maker (AMM), continued to hold its position as the liquidity king of Cardano DeFi, concluding the second quarter of the year with a TVL of nearly $50 million and over 32% dominance.</p>
<p>The report also noted that the stablecoin infrastructure is yet another factor fueling this TVL run on the blockchain. Data also suggest that Cardano&#8217;s stablecoin market cap climbed up from 54th to 37th in 2023.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Spark's stance on VPN usage courts criticism from the DeFi community. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MakerDAO&#8217;s recently launched lending platform, Spark Protocol, has courted significant backlash over its decision to ban VPN users on the front end. The initial motive was to prevent US-based users from accessing the platform. But it prohibits anyone from using a VPN regardless of whether or not they are situated within the US.</p>
<p>This has sparked strong reactions from privacy advocates.</p>
<h2>War on Privacy</h2>
<p>MakerDAO ramped up the yield on the DAI stablecoin from 3% to 8% as part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/RuneKek/status/1688235137178509312" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">implementation</a> of the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate (EDSR).</p>
<p>Following the modifications in yield, on-chain data identified a peculiar transaction from an individual wallet involving the transfer of over 14.3 million DAO stablecoin into MarkerDAO by a single crypto participant. The transfer was speculated to have been conducted to take advantage of the 8% yield, which is offered through MakerDAO&#8217;s lending platform, Spark.</p>
<p>While Maker restricted users in the United States from accessing the crypto lending platform, what caught many by surprise was an <a href="https://www.sparkprotocol.io/terms-of-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">update</a> on Spark Protocol&#8217;s terms and conditions cautioning against employing VPNs to bypass the restriction.</p>
<p>The notification read,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Use of the credit protocol functions of the site by persons who are currently or ordinarily located or resident in the United States is strictly prohibited, regardless of the user&#8217;s IP address. Utilizing a virtual private network or other method to conceal a user&#8217;s United States residence is also strictly prohibited and may result in permanent blocking of the use of the site in connection with blockchain addresses suspected of being tied to a United States residence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For the uninitiated, Spark Protocol was launched in May this year, which offered users up to 8% in annual returns by lending DAI. It was created as a soft fork of Aave v3 by a blockchain company rolled out by the Maker Foundation called Phoenix Labs.</p>
<h2>Reactions</h2>
<p>Popular DeFi analyst Chris Blec <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1688236822399217666" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">expressed</a> his strong disapproval, emphasizing that it essentially functions as a comprehensive prohibition on VPNs worldwide, extending beyond the borders of the US.</p>
<p>Blec highlighted a clear distinction between blocking access for US residents and imposing a broader prohibition on individuals globally who utilize VPNs to safeguard their privacy. He characterized this broader move as a significant encroachment on the concept of privacy, likening it to an active campaign against the fundamental notion of personal privacy.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA["For various reasons, the procedure became irrelevant, and therefore the sides agreed to dismiss the claim," the pensioner's lawyer said.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Esther Freeman &#8211; a 70-year-old Israeli resident who turned a $3,000 BTC investment into over $320,000 in 2021 &#8211; has terminated the legal battle with Bank Hapoalim. The latter was unwilling to accept her crypto profits, casting doubts on the source of the funds she used to hop on the Bitcoin bandwagon.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Her investment is currently worth approximately $160,000 due to the price decrease of the leading digital asset over the following years.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dismissal of the Case Less Than Two Years After its Start</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Israeli pensioner </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/israeli-bank-refuses-to-deposit-over-300000-earned-from-a-bitcoin-investment-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">made the headlines</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in November 2021 when her initial $3,240 investment in Bitcoin rose to an astonishing $324,000. She revealed that she entered BTC&#8217;s ecosystem in 2013, meaning it took her eight years to see her stash reach that level. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I listened to my son and nephews, to the young guys, and said that an attempt would be made. Without any knowledge on the subject, in the real innocence of an ordinary citizen,&#8221; she explained the reason behind her decision. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And while it sounded like Freeman had won the lottery jackpot, she encountered unexpected issues with Bank Hapoalim, which refused to deposit the profit. The financial institution claimed that her initial investment in Bitcoin was made in cash, which could have originated from illicit procedures. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The characteristics of virtual (i.e., digital) currencies allow them to be transferred anonymously and unsupervised, often bypassing the need to use the financial factors that apply to the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regime,&#8221; the bank added at the time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Freeman appointed an attorney and filed a lawsuit against the entity, insisting that she had been a loyal client over the years. She also asserted that the money would help one of her children to buy an apartment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite her efforts, though, Freeman seems to have had little success in her legal battle against Bank Hapoalim and recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/hkskmbas2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">dismissed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the case.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The lawsuit against the bank has been dismissed. The bank acted from the beginning in accordance with its obligations according to law, including the Anti-Money Laundering Law,&#8221; the monetary organization stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It also pointed out its policies, according to which it should not be forced to accept funds generated from crypto investments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Freeman called the bank&#8217;s claims &#8220;unfounded.&#8221; Her lawyer &#8211; Shaul Zioni &#8211; confirmed the termination of the lawsuit, adding that the Israeli authorities are currently looking to establish a mechanism to regulate such transfer of funds. He did not disclose whether the pensioner was able to deposit the profits at some point.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Profit is not so Whopping any More</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is interesting to note that the USD representation of Freeman&#8217;s Bitcoin investment is now quite different from its peak in November 2021. Calculated by current prices, her stash is approximately worth $160,000, or a 50% decrease.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is hard to predict whether the investment could rise to such a level again in the future. However, there are many pending developments in the crypto industry that could propel another bull run for the primary digital asset should or when they see the light of day.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The possible approval of a spot BTC ETF in America, a probable adoption coming from a giant corporation (such as Tesla or Apple), or the highly-anticipated Halving in 2024 could be some of the contributing factors.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[DAO, GMT, ICP, BMEX, APT, and SAND token unlocks are lined up this week. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto tokens worth upwards of $212 million are set to unlock this week. According to the latest data, five projects &#8211; Dao Maker (DAO), STEPN (GMT), Internet Computer (ICP), BitMEX (BMEX), Aptos (APT), The Sandbox (SAND), according to data compiled by DropsTab.</p>
<p>The token unlocks could potentially create some significant sell pressure.</p>
<h2>Token Unlocks: Weekly Edition</h2>
<p>The DAO Maker Token is the governance token of the DAO Maker ecosystem built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The token unlock of 20.82 million DAO, representing 7.41% of the total supply, is <a href="https://dropstab.com/insights/vesting" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">scheduled</a> for August 9th.</p>
<p>GMT is the native token of a WEB 3 lifestyle app called STEPN which has &#8220;Social-Fi and Game-Fi&#8221; elements. The token unlock of 87.92 million GMT, accounting for 1.47% of the total supply, is also set for August 9th.</p>
<p>ICP is the native utility token of layer-1 blockchain Internet Computer and is used to facilitate network governance and reward participants. It&#8217;s scheduled for an unlock of 3.31 million ICP, which is over 0.7% of the total supply, on August 11th.</p>
<p>BMEX is a functional utility token designed for use on the crypto exchange, BitMEX. More than 18.5 million of BMEX, representing 4.12% of the total supply, will be unlocked on August 11th.</p>
<p>APT, the native token of a layer 1 blockchain <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/aptos-apt-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Aptos</a>, that uses the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is scheduled for another unlock event on August 12th involving the release of 4.54 million APT, which is around 0.45% of the total supply.</p>
<p>SAND, the ERC-20 utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain and used throughout The Sandbox ecosystem, is slated to witness an unlocking event on August 14th, during which 308.46 million SAND or 10.28% of the total supply will be released.</p>
<p>Collectively, this week will see the unlock tokens worth over $212 million.</p>
<h2>Pressure on Price?</h2>
<p>Token lockup, often called a vesting period, is essentially a specific timeframe during which tokens are restricted from being traded or liquidated. The length of this interval is determined by the team&#8217;s chosen approach and can extend for multiple years in certain instances.</p>
<p>Hence, the release of crypto tokens usually amplifies selling pressure on the assets, influenced by both the number of unlocked tokens and their influx into cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>Previous unlocks, too, have demonstrated more declines amidst new tokens entering the market. All five assets have already been experiencing significant bearish pressure.</p>
<p>APT was the biggest loser of the five tokens, seeing its value decline by more than 8% over the past month. DAO also recorded a decline of nearly 5% during the same period, followed by SAND with a little over 4%. Other tokens, such as GMT and BMEX, also noted an underwhelming price performance and were down by 3.7% and 2.4%, respectively in the last month. ICP was the highest gainer among all, with a minor decline of 1%.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan police officers have reportedly raided a warehouse belonging to the recently launched crypto project Worldcoin, carting away documents and machines for investigative purposes.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://kahawatungu.com/police-raid-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-warehouse-in-nairobi-over-data/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> by local media KahawaTungu, police officers showed up at the Nairobi-based warehouse over the weekend with a search warrant and multi-agency officials. They left with equipment believed to store data collected by Worldcoin.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin Nairobi Warehouse Raided</h2>
<p>Recall that the Kenyan government <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/kenya-authorities-suspend-worldcoin-activities-over-data-privacy-concerns/" data-wpel-link="internal">ordered</a> the suspension of all activities related to Worldcoin’s registration and the distribution of its native token WLD on August 2, less than two weeks after the project’s launch. Relevant agencies want to investigate the legality and authenticity of the project’s launch.</p>
<p>Worldcoin was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-launches-wld-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> in July as a decentralized identification project to differentiate humans from artificial intelligence bots. Using a proof-of-person concept, the project claims to preserve privacy while combating income inequality.</p>
<p>The most controversial part of the Worldcoin project is the requirement for users to prove their humanity online by scanning their irises through a biometric verification device called Orb and afterward receive free WLD tokens. While the project’s team, led by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, stated that the Orb does not store users’ data, the method has sparked concerns about privacy violations.</p>
<p>The machines seized from Worldcoin’s Nairobi warehouse were taken to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis and investigations. Data Commissioner Immaculate Kassait said Worldcoin’s parent company, Tools for Humanity, did not reveal its true intentions during registration.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin Not Registered in Kenya: Government</h2>
<p>The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority has also expressed concerns about Worldcoin’s registration activities, alerting residents that the project is not regulated in the country. While Worldcoin claims its operations comply with Kenyan regulations, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki has told Parliament that the project is not registered as a legal entity.</p>
<p>Worldcoin announced that it chose Kenya as the first African country to begin its operations because of the nation’s growing tech space and the significant number of Kenyans who trade crypto. The entity also operates in the UK, Germany, Spain, and Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, data protection agencies in various regions, including France, Germany, and the UK, have begun examinations into the crypto project to ensure no data regulations are violated.</p>
