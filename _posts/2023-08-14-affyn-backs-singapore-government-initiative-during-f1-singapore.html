<p>Singapore-based Web 3 gaming firm Affyn is set to participate in the annual Grand Prix Season Singapore (GPSS), a 10-day event supported by the Singapore Tourism Board that culminates during the&nbsp; Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix weekend. According to the team statement, Affyn entered a strategic partnership with GPSS to present a metaverse event to the fans of the Grand Prix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;"We are proud to partner with GPSS as it underlines Affyn&rsquo;s intent to bolster Government initiatives and bring Web 3.0 development to the next level,&rdquo; said Affyn CEO Lucaz Lee. &ldquo;As the only official Web 3.0 company partnering with GPSS, an event supported by STB, it is an incredible opportunity to drive awareness of developments in the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event, titled &lsquo;Web 3.0 | Art Meets Metaverse&rsquo;,&nbsp; is set to run on Saturday, 16th September 2023, at Suntec City&rsquo;s Synthesis from 1 PM to 4 PM (local time). The event will include NFT exhibitions from artists around Singapore, a celebrity-hosted panel talk show and experiential zones that allow guests to delve into the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Singapore rising as a crypto hub in the East, the involvement of crypto in such a global sporting event blends well in maintaining its verve as the leading crypto hub in Asia. The event aims to educate non-crypto fans on the developments of the metaverse in the art world, dive into discussions on the state of the metaverse industry, interact during the exhibition and learn from experts via their talk shows. In addition, attendees can interact and share with other enthusiasts and dive into how blockchain and the metaverse affect art in the real world today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other news, Affyn-based gaming title Nexus World Land City will be launching its third wave of land parcels starting August 23.&nbsp; Players will have the chance to claim their land parcels in eight cities, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Manilla, Sydney, and Zurich.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto companies&rsquo; relationship with F1 extends
<p>Despite the recent departures of FTX and Tezos, who sponsored the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team and Scuderia AlphaTauri, respectively, crypto partnerships with F1 teams have grown, as evidenced by Affyn&rsquo;s Singapore GP event. Earlier this year, British F1 team Williams Racing entered a strategic partnership with Kraken Exchange to launch a competition to see NFTs showcased around this year's Singapore GP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other crypto partners in F1 include Bybit, sponsoring Redbull Racing Team in a $150 million deal and Stake.com, an Alfa Romeo Formula One Team sponsor.&nbsp;</p>
