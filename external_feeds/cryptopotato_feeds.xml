			            <description><![CDATA[The SEC's instruction is so unclear that even an "army of securities lawyers" could not say which crypto assets classify as securities, Cuban argued. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American businessman, philanthropist, and television personality &#8211; Mark Cuban &#8211; lambasted the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for providing misleading guidance regarding which digital currencies could categorize as securities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The agency has not been kind to the crypto sector and recently filed lawsuits against two of the largest exchanges &#8211; Binance and Coinbase. It also claimed that some leading digital assets, including BNB, SOL, ADA, and MATIC, operate as unregistered securities.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC Treats Crypto Differently</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The billionaire and owner of The Dallas Mavericks &#8211; Cuban &#8211; is yet another individual who believes the Commission has not done enough to properly supervise the cryptocurrency sector and determine which tokens classify as securities and which as commodities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In one of his recent Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1667914770651987970" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">posts</a>, he claimed that the watchdog&#8217;s public statements on the matter differ from the official position on its website. Cuban added that the lengthy guidance does not give information regarding &#8220;what is or is not a security in the crypto universe.&#8221; He went further, stating one wouldn&#8217;t be able to find out the status of the different digital currencies even with &#8220;an army of securities lawyers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American thinks the SEC has double standards when speaking of crypto and other aspects of finance. He <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1667153158106226692" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a> last week that the Gary Gensler-spearheaded agency had called the stock loan industry &#8220;opaque&#8221; and required additional transparency. Unlike the digital asset sector, though, it did not categorize &#8220;stock loans&#8221; securities and did not file lawsuits against brokers or banks. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;They should do the same thing with crypto as an effort to determine which aspects of crypto are securities and which are not and the best way to regulate the industry and protect investors. I think their difference in approach is emblematic of their intent for one industry vs another,&#8221; he concluded.<br />
</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The agency&#8217;s unfriendly attitude toward the industry intensified last week. For starters, it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-plummets-after-sec-sues-binance-for-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange &#8211; Binance, the CEO &#8211; Changpeng Zhao (CZ), and the American subsidiary of the company &#8211; Binance.US.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The main accusation is that the platform operated &#8220;unregistered national securities exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies.&#8221; According to the regulator, Binance&#8217;s unlicensed products include certain lending offerings, a staking program, the native token BNB and a fiat-backed stablecoin BUSD. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">continued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with its harsh actions with another lawsuit against Coinbase a day later. It alleged that the latter served as a broker, national securities exchange, and clearing agency without obtaining the necessary authorization.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It also claimed that well-known cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) are securities, accusing Coinbase of offering trading services with them.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Coinbase has elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors&#8217; interests and over compliance with the law and the regulatory framework that governs the securities markets,&#8221; the Commission stated. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that Binance&#8217;s CEO &#8211; Changpeng Zhao &#8211; and Coinbase&#8217;s &#8211; Brian Armstrong &#8211; remained unfazed by the accusations. The former </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1665742100845961217" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tweeted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> his signature number &#8211; &#8220;4,&#8221; urging his followers not to trust fake news or any sort of misleading information.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[JP Morgan served Epstein and Epstein-related entities from January 1998 through August 2013.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">JP Morgan has agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class-action lawsuit from the victims of Jeffrey Epstein – the famous American financier and sex offender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The plaintiffs claimed that JP Morgan laundered money and thereby enabled sex trafficking on behalf of Epstein while he was still a client of the bank.</span></p>
<h2>JP Morgan Aiding Money Laundering?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230612240332/en/JPMorgan-Chase-and-Jane-Doe-1-Reach-Agreement-to-Settle-Lawsuit-in-Epstein-Matter" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">joint statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the largest bank in the United States and victims’ attornies said on Monday that both groups had “reached an agreement in principle to settle the putative class action lawsuit related to Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The agreement is subject to court approval, and will not involve JP Morgan admitting liability in the case. “The parties believe this settlement is in the best interests of all parties, especially the survivors who were the victims of Epstein’s terrible abuse,” read the statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/investing/jpmorgan-epstein-victims-settlement/index.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, David Boies – one of the victims’ attornies – said that over 100 women are expected to receive compensation for Epstein’s abuse. More victims who filed through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation program are likely to be compensated following similar settlements with two other banks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Victims&#8217; lawyers called the settlement “life-changing and historic” given how a major financial institution is participating in shutting down sex trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Money, which for far too long flowed with impunity between Jeffrey Epstein’s global sex trafficking enterprise and Wall Street’s leading banks, is decisively being used for good,” said Sigrid McCawley, managing partner at Boies Schiller Flexner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Epstein’s victims reached a $75 million settlement deal with Deutsche Bank, with which there is expected to be an overlap with JP Morgan in the victims it helps compensate, according to Boies. </span></p>
<h2>How Does Bitcoin Compare?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin’s loudest critics often point to the blockchain as a lawless landscape enabling money laundering, </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/senator-warrens-bill-will-hurt-crypto-not-russia-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">sanctions violation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and terrorist financing. Last year, ex-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-has-failed-as-an-alternative-money-says-former-fed-chairman/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that Bitcoin has no underlying value besides “ransomware, or something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, data from Chainalysis shows that the proportion of Bitcoin transactions being used to facilitate financial crime is falling over time. Furthermore, though illicit crypto volume appears to be </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/illicit-crypto-transactions-in-2022-surpassed-20-billion-for-the-first-time-chainalysis/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">rising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in absolute terms, the U.S. Treasury Department has </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fiat-is-far-more-common-than-bitcoin-for-money-laundering-confirms-us-treasury-department/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the dollar remains king when it comes to money laundering. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The lira's crash and the restrictions on purchasing dollars and gold with the local currency have made USDT even more attractive to Turks.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some residents of Turkey have reportedly revived their interest in the cryptocurrency market, more specifically in the stablecoin USDT, following a new decline in their national currency and fears that severe inflation could start looming again across the country. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The downtrend of the Turkish lira (which has been evident in the past few years) intensified shortly after Recep Erdogan won the presidential elections, securing himself another five years as the political leader. He is known as a fierce critic of digital currencies, whereas his opponent Kemal Kilicdaroglu (who collected two million votes less than Erdogan) shared pro-crypto views.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Turks Turn to Crypto</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to recent Bloomberg </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/turkish-investors-looking-for-haven-turn-to-stablecoin-tether-1.1931285" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">coverage</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, residents of the Eurasian country have shifted their focus towards the largest stablecoin by market capitalization &#8211; USDT &#8211; at the beginning of May, ahead of the presidential elections. The interest has remained high even after their completion, which saw Erdogan </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/28/europe/turkey-president-runoff-polls-erdogan-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">win</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by getting 52% of the votes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One possible factor pushing the people of Turkey toward the cryptocurrency industry could be the depreciating national currency that recently hit a record low against the American dollar. Currently, 1 TRY equals $0.042, whereas it was worth approximately $0.15 at the beginning of 2020 (at the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">USDT has turned into a safe haven for some locals who try to preserve their wealth amid the worrying inflationary environment. The asset maintains a consistent peg with the US dollar, and it provides a relatively safe and simple way in which Turks can join the crypto sector.</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, domestic regulators have restricted the purchase of dollars and even gold with the lira, giving crypto a more notable status. Ebru Güven &#8211; university lecturer and former banker &#8211; shed more details:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Investing in stablecoins allows people to keep the value of their wealth; it&#8217;s one of the ways to hold on to some value when inflation is this high. This is the only motivation for people to buy stablecoins right now.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Response From the Locals</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Concerned about the lira&#8217;s condition, some Turkish residents have distributed all their savings into the cryptocurrency market. One example is the 28-year-old graphic designer &#8211; Batuhan Basoglu &#8211; who revealed:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Just before the election, I felt the urge to convert my Turkish lira to US dollars due to the uncertainty surrounding the currency&#8217;s future. To safeguard myself against this risk, I purchased Tether.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Data <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1661781497827803136" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">presented</a> by the cryptocurrency analytics provider &#8211; Kaiko &#8211; showed that USDT trading volume on BtcTurk spiked at the end of May (when Erdogan won the Presidential elections).</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_254770" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-254770" style="width: 633px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a style="font-weight: bold; background-color: transparent;" href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/USDT-trading-volume.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-254770" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/USDT-trading-volume.png" alt="USDT trading volume" width="633" height="400" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/USDT-trading-volume.png 733w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/USDT-trading-volume-300x189.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/USDT-trading-volume-50x32.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-254770" class="wp-caption-text">USDT trading volume on BtcTurk, Source: Kaiko</figcaption></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dessislava Aubert &#8211; an analyst at the company &#8211; told Bloomberg that the last time Turks were so intrigued by the stablecoin was in 2020. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stablecoin ecosystem has also been impacted by America’s war on crypto, with a clear divergence happening between the top two issuers.</p>

<h2>Tether Keeps Minting</h2>
<p>Circle’s USDC was once favored by institutions, but with an ongoing industry-wide crackdown, the demand for the stablecoin is dwindling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Circle was heavily <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circles-usdc-outflows-surpassed-10b-since-svb-collapse-tether-dominance-rises/" data-wpel-link="internal">impacted by exposure</a> to the now-bankrupt Silicon Valley Bank. USDC de-pegged at the time in early March, causing a massive loss in confidence.</p>
<p>USDC supply has declined by almost 50% since June 2022, when it peaked at around $56 billion. As a result, its market share has also taken a hit, tanking to 22%, whilst Tether’s has increased to a commanding 64.5%.</p>
<p>The total stablecoin market capitalization is currently $129.3 billion, according to CoinGecko. It represents almost 12% of the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization though it, too, has shrunk considerably during the bear market.</p>
<p>On June 12, Glassnode reported that USDT and USDC continue to leave centralized exchanges, with both stablecoins hitting a monthly high for outflow volumes.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The flight to safety from exchanges, especially Binance, has increased following the SEC’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-ceos-see-wealth-crushed-after-secs-twin-lawsuits/" data-wpel-link="internal">twin lawsuits</a> and enforcement action last week.</p>
<p>However, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1667554966662266883" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">cautioned</a> investors not to read too much into Binance outflow figures from analytics platforms because they use TVL (total value locked), which includes decreases in crypto asset prices.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets have calmed over the weekend as the consolidation continues. There has been virtually no change in total capitalization over the past 24 hours, as it remains at $1.09 trillion.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">BTC prices</a> have held steady at $25,800, while Ethereum has dipped marginally to $1,735 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, BNB has been hit the hardest, having lost 25% over the past week. Binance Coin was trading at its lowest price this year at $222, having dropped another 5% at the time of writing.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission went ham on crypto exchanges last week by filing toothy lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. While crypto exchanges and altcoins are in the hot seat, the regulator is leaving BTC and ETH alone, at least for now.</p>
<p>When news of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase hit markets, the prices of all assets plunged across the board. BNB <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-coin-price-analysis-bnb-crashes-10-on-sec-lawsuit-is-250-in-sight/" data-wpel-link="internal">crashed 10%</a> in 24 hours. It lost another 5% on Sunday and kept dumping on Monday to a multi-month low at $223.</p>
<p>Bitcoin prices plummeted from the $27,100 handle Sunday to $25,750 Monday. But the world&#8217;s oldest and most well-capitalized cryptocurrency blockchain recovered quickly.</p>
<h2>BTC and ETH Rally with SEC&#8217;s New Suits Priced in</h2>
<p>BTC bounced back to above the $27,000 level on Tuesday, even as news of a second SEC lawsuit <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-sec-claims-these-coins-are-securities-in-the-lawsuit-against-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">against Coinbase</a> spread.</p>
<p>Although the agency increasing enforcement activities against the crypto industry harmed crypto prices last week, it appears BTC and ETH will emerge from the regulatory heat unscathed. Bitcoin is already up 2.75% on the five-day window, with the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits priced in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ethereum had a massive rally with the latest SEC news priced into the market. Ether prices on crypto exchanges jumped from $1,800 at 1:30 pm UTC Tuesday to a high of $1,890 before the session turned over. That was a cool 5% intraday gain for the second-largest crypto.</p>
<h2>SEC Leaves Bitcoin, Ether, and Ripple Alone</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The SEC has named these 19 tokens as securities throughout the Binance + Coinbase filings.</p>
<p>This could have massive implications for these tokens, and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Some quick thoughts.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (1/9) <a href="https://t.co/kYQTK8lvoe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/kYQTK8lvoe</a></p>
<p>— Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) <a href="https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1666644256696729600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The legal theory of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuits against the two major crypto exchanges hinges on a 90-year-old law. The Securities Act of 1933 <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1884/pdf/COMPS-1884.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">was</a> written to protect investors in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash.</p>
<p>Between the Securities Act and the &#8220;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Howey test</a>&#8221; from a 1946 Supreme Court decision, the SEC intends to persuade U.S. courts that many cryptocurrencies offered for sale and exchange by Coinbase and Binance meet the legal definition of securities.</p>
<p>If the SEC&#8217;s theory prevails in court, then Coinbase, Binance, and any other crypto exchange would be required by the U.S. federal government to register with the agency and comply with the rules they set to protect retail investors.</p>
<p>But even in that worst case outcome of these legal battles, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-xrp-not-named-a-security-in-the-secs-case-against-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple</a> may emerge unscathed. The SEC didn&#8217;t bother to name them as securities in either the Binance or Coinbase lawsuit.</p>
<p>Retail investors, as well as institutions, are apt to see less risk and more upside in these cryptocurrencies as a result. The SEC&#8217;s reluctance to push its luck with these commodities is incredibly bullish for XRP, ETH, and BTC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Coinbase experienced significantly greater withdrawals for ETH than BTC last week. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Glassnode published a report on Monday breaking down investors’ on-chain behavior after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued two of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The report acknowledged a boost to the number of short-term crypto holders sending their balances onto exchanges. </span></p>
<h2>Exchange Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-24-2023/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> echoed findings from </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-sees-massive-outflows-following-sec-lawsuit-data/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> showing that Binance experienced significantly higher withdrawals immediately following the SEC’s Monday filing. The platform’s Bitcoin and Ethereum balances have fallen by 40,200 BTC (5.7%) and 324,000 ETH (7.1%) respectively over the past 7 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Binance’s stablecoin balance took the biggest hit, declining by $1.6 billion (20.9%) over the past week. Since FTX’s collapse in November 2022, Binance’s stablecoin balance has fallen a whopping 75% from $26 billion to just $6.5 billion today – largely spurred by another </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-will-happen-to-binance-if-sec-manages-to-kill-busd/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">SEC crackdown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> against its Paxos-issued BUSD stablecoin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The exchange still holds some of the largest reserves of any entity on-chain, and their BTC and ETH balances are still quite substantial,” clarified Glassnode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase – which was sued the day after Binance for multiple securities law violations – faced relatively smaller Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals of just 2300 BTC (0.5%). However, Ethereum withdrawals were much more pronounced at 291,000 ETH (8.0%), possibly indicating heightened investor fear around the company’s staking-as-a-service product. </span></p>
<h2>Behavior By Cohort</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Investor behavior surrounding exchanges also seemed to differ by cohort: transactions of under $10 million comprised consistent withdrawals, while those over $10 million were consistent deposits, with net inflows ranging between $15 million to $30 million per day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This suggests that very large entities (such as institutions) are more affected to a greater extent by the SEC news as compared to smaller entities,” wrote Glassnode. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, short-term crypto holders are showing heightened activity, accounting for 76% of recent BTC deposit volume (versus the typical 60%). Such deposits accounted for 0.93% of short-term holders’ total held balances on exchanges. By contrast, long-term holders showed “no discernible reaction to the news.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Analysis from CryptoQuant </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-short-term-holders-not-willing-to-cash-out-amid-sec-fud-data/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that even short-term holders are reluctant to sell their coins too heavily, as the cohort is waiting for a chance to realize more profit from its purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entire crypto market slid after the SEC’s lawsuits last week, with heightened pain among coins specifically </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-sec-claims-these-coins-are-securities-in-the-lawsuit-against-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">targeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the agency’s Coinbase filing: Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Can you tell the difference between a human and an AI-based language model?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence is venturing into the mainstream quicker than ever before, with AI-based chatbots such as OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT booming in popularity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also had a considerable effect on the cryptocurrency industry, as a bunch of AI-related cryptocurrencies (and not so related) soared in value in the beginning of 2023, as the AI mania was just gathering steam.</p>
<p>Now, a gamified approach to the popular Turing Test is revealing some fascinating results as to how far AI-based chatbots are getting. But first, let&#8217;s get a few clarifications out of the way.</p>
<h2>What is the Turing Test?</h2>
<p>Originally called <em>the imitation game </em>by Alan Turing back in the 1950s, the test aims to detect a machine&#8217;s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human.</p>
<p>To those unfamiliar &#8211; Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, philosopher, cryptanalyst, and logician. He held a particular influence on the development of theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>Over recent months, however, the Turing test has faced some scrutiny in its classic version. That&#8217;s when someone decided to gamify the model.</p>
<p><em>Human or Not? </em>is an interesting &#8220;game&#8221; where you get to chat with someone &#8211; an AI or a human and decide which one was it at the end of the game. You have 2 minutes to ask as many questions as you want or to have whatever conversation you feel like.</p>
<h2>38% Couldn&#8217;t Tell the Difference</h2>
<p>We tried the game ourselves and ran two instances of it. During the first one, we pretended that we are the bot to prompt some perhaps more interesting answers, but it felt a bit obvious.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254871" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1.jpg" alt="response_human_or_not" width="653" height="866" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1.jpg 653w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-226x300.jpg 226w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-38x50.jpg 38w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /></a></p>
<p>The second one got dark really quickly. We opened with a friendly &#8220;Hey,&#8221; and our conversation partner escalated the situation immediately.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254872" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.jpg" alt="response_human_or_not_2" width="685" height="820" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.jpg 685w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-251x300.jpg 251w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-42x50.jpg 42w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></a></p>
<p>At that point, we felt we were once again talking to a bot, but it turned out it was a human. In hindsight, one of the most popular concerns of people is that an AI would take over humanity, so this might also have been rather obvious. We got 1 out of 2 correct, and we&#8217;ll run with it.</p>
<p>However, it appears that a whopping 38% of users <a href="https://mpost.io/38-of-participants-fail-to-identify-human-or-ai-in-the-largest-turing-style-experiment/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">were unable</a> to make any difference. The sample size is also quite significant &#8211; a reported 1.5 million users.</p>
<h2>AI Getting Smarter?</h2>
<p>To be completely honest, our experience with the game was somewhat scuffed, and it felt that two minutes are less than enough for a conversation that would allow anyone to make an educated guess.</p>
<p>With that being said, it goes without saying that AI-based language models are getting better.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is not the only example, as competition grows fiercer by the day.</p>
<p>And with this, we have to ask ourselves &#8211; how will AI impact the crypto industry? While it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess, we&#8217;ve already asked ChatGPT itself. Find out more in our piece:</p>

<p>And yet, take everything a chatbot tells you with a grain of salt because they still have quite a lot of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chatgpt-has-a-big-misconception-about-bitcoins-ath-price/" data-wpel-link="internal">limitations</a>.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The whitelisted wallet permitted to liquidate the loan has been funded with $30 million in USDT to prevent a shortfall on Venus.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BNB Chain core team is set to take over a substantial Binance Coin (BNB) loan position belonging to the decentralized lending platform Venus Protocol as it approaches its liquidation threshold.</p>
<p>The $150 million BNB loan belonged to a hacker who exploited a cross-chain infrastructure on the BNB Chain in October 2022, resulting in the loss of more than $100 million in crypto assets.</p>
<h2>BNB Chain to Take Over Venus’ $150M Loan Position</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1668173035759697921?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to the BNB Chain team, $30 million in Tether (USDT) has been sent to the whitelisted wallet exclusively permitted to implement the liquidation to prevent a shortfall on Venus and provide additional support during the process. The wallet was selected through a governance proposal released a month after the BNB Chain hack.</p>
<p>During the attack, the exploiter <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-how-the-multi-million-bnb-chain-hack-went-down-paradigm-researcher/" data-wpel-link="internal">manipulated</a> security proofs and minted two million BNB tokens, worth $560 million at the time, from thin air. The hacker capitalized on a vulnerability related to the “iavl hash check” within the BNB cross-chain bridge.</p>
<p>With the stolen BNB, the exploiter borrowed $150 million worth of USDT and USD Coin (USDC), leveraging a 900,000 BNB position against Venus. Although the BNB Chain team <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-smart-chain-paused-following-600-million-bnb-hack-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">temporarily paused</a> the bridge and eventually resumed operations, the position has remained in place, with the loan still active.</p>
<p>In November, the duo passed a proposal to authorize only the core team to liquidate the position to mitigate the impact on the broader market in the event of such. Due to the deteriorating health rate of the loan and the possibility of a further drop in BNB’s price, the whitelisted wallet has begun preparations to liquidate the position.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The whitelisted wallet was initially funded with $30M in USDT with the assurance of preventing shortfall on Venus and providing additional support through this Venus governance approved mechanism,” the Venus team <a href="https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol/status/1668142791505977344?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Preventing Cascading Effects</h2>
<p>Liquidating the loan without the whitelisted wallet may trigger cascading effects on the BNB Chain and cause unnecessary damage to the market, Venus, its users, and the BNB token, which has already <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-coin-bnb-dumps-to-6-month-low-bitcoin-btc-fails-at-26k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">declined</a> significantly since the U.S. SEC’s legal action against crypto exchange Binance.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the BNB Chain team executed a hard fork after the hack to secure the bridge between the BNB Beacon Chain and the BNB Smart Chain.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Predicting the next cryptocurrency to explode, buying early, and retiring as a millionaire is difficult, but some have made it.</p>
<p>Even though it might be harder to do with small investments in big projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum, meme coins have proven again and again that it&#8217;s doable, even with a tiny investment. Of course, the risks associated with it are higher, but there are many stories of people turning $1 or $2 into millions through meme coins like SHIB or PEPE.</p>
<p>In this post, we take a look at some examples of hitting the jackpot with SHIB and speculate on what the next Shiba Inu crypto asset could be, reviewing two upcoming meme coin projects &#8211; <a href="https://bs_c4d54499.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AiDoge</a> and <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a>.</p>
<h2>From Small Holder of Shiba Inu Coin to Multi-Millionaire</h2>
<p>In October 2020, a trader decided to invest in Shiba Inu (SHIB) on the off chance it became the next Dogecoin &#8211; which at the time was also a fraction of its value today, but had been around since December 2013 and had some early success.</p>
<p>That unknown trader &#8211; tracked only by his wallet address and Etherscan data &#8211; bought $17 worth of SHIB tokens.</p>
<p>At the time, the Shiba Inu price was approximately $0.0000000001 &#8211; ranging at around that valuation throughout the month. That’s nine zeroes after the decimal point.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254881" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-9.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="720" height="327" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-9.jpg 720w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-9-300x136.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-9-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p>A year later, the Shiba Inu coin price hit its all-time high in October 2021, at a price of $0.00008854 &#8211; shortly before Bitcoin and Ethereum also hit their ATHs of just over $69,000 and just under $5,000. That’s four zeros after the decimal point.</p>
<p>Taking the ratio of the two, that’s an 885,400x increase &#8211; so even a $1 investment would’ve almost made him a millionaire. Selling his $17 investment at the perfect top would’ve netted him $15 million.</p>
<p>According to reports, he took some profit on the way up, gradually scaling out of his position &#8211; no trader can time the exact bottom or top of the markets &#8211; and his overall realized profit was $6.5 million.</p>
<h2>Supermarket Warehouse Manager Becomes a Crypto Millionaire</h2>
<p>A similar rags-to-riches story made it into the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/09/shiba-inu-millionaire-retires-at-the-age-of-35-after-8000-bet/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> as, in that instance, the identity of the trader was known.</p>
<p>Rob invested $8,000 in Shiba Inu coin and sold relatively early &#8211; some of the earliest SHIB holders could’ve even become multi-billionaires &#8211; cashing out $500,000 after a few months of holding. The final blow-off top for SHIB increased his profit to $1 million.</p>
<p>The list of stories goes on, and according to the NY Post, one trader did earn $1 billion from a $7,850 investment in SHIB. Another cashed out $5.4 million after 14 months of holding.</p>
<h2>Investing in New Coins Early</h2>
<p>While there are also tales of people that bought the top and lost money, the key to success in trading is to buy low, sell high. The above traders all took a risk before the rest of the heard on a new cryptocurrency that was early in its roadmap.</p>
<p>New crypto presales and pre-ICO projects are launched regularly, and in 2023 meme coins have been the ones to watch &#8211; a new asset named after Pepe the Frog minted many millionaires in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Just like SHIB and DOGE before it, new meme coins like PEPE, SPONGE, WOJAK, and others have had exponential price increases and created generational wealth for holders that get in and out at the right time.</p>
<h3>Two Meme Coins to Watch</h3>
<p>Two upcoming meme coins to watch in the weeks to come are <a href="https://bs_c4d54499.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AiDoge</a> (AI) and <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a> (WSM).</p>
<p>AiDoge blends meme coins with another popular crypto trend right now &#8211; artificial intelligence &#8211; as the first ‘meme to earn’ platform in which users generate AI-based memes from text prompts.</p>
<p>Meme creators using its tools earn its native coin AI as a rewards token. The presale for AI sold out in record time last month after raising a huge $14.9m. It is now set to be listed on its first crypto exchanges on June 19, 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a> is set to tokenize the meme stocks movement that kicked off the GameStop and AMC short squeeze and build on its existing following on Instagram and Twitter &#8211; which has even been noticed <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">by Elon Musk</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-11.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254882" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-11.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="1080" height="510" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-11.jpg 1080w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-11-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-11-1024x484.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-11-768x363.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-11-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></p>
<p>Popular crypto influencer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7KWE-36lwc" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Michael Wrubel</a> recently reviewed the WSM presale for hits 310,000 subscribers and many analysts have shared their positive predictions.</p>
<p>Wall Steet Memes has raised over $6m in just over two weeks, showing that investors are placing plenty of faith in the project.</p>
<p>While they may not all replicate the success of Shiba Inu and create millionaires, new meme coins typically have greater upside as a short-term trade than the big caps like BTC and ETH, and AI and WSM appear to be two of the hottest to watch right now, given the performance of their pre-sales. Of course, the risks associated with investing in meme coins is certainly higher than that of investing in Bitcoin or other established projects.</p>
