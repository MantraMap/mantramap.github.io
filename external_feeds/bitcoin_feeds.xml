The warning followed the collapse of crypto exchange FTX which &#8220;left hundreds of thousands, even millions of unsecured creditors with little to no recourse in recovering their money,&#8221; the regulator stressed.</strong></p>
<h2>Philippine SEC Warns About Unregulated Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p>The Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an advisory Friday warning the public against transacting with unregistered cryptocurrency exchanges. The regulator wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>SEC strongly warns and advises the public against transacting with unregistered and unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges reachable and deemed operating in the Philippines.</p></blockquote>
<p>The advisory followed the collapse of crypto exchange FTX which &#8220;left hundreds of thousands, even millions of unsecured creditors with little to no recourse in recovering their money,&#8221; the Philippine SEC described.</p>
<p>The regulator proceeded to remind investors that an entity is required to register with the SEC if it intends to conduct business in the Philippines. &#8220;SEC is the registrar and overseer of the Philippine corporate sector; it supervises more than 600,000 active corporations and evaluates the financial statements (FS) filed by all corporations registered with it,&#8221; the advisory details. Moreover, &#8220;securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the Commission,&#8221; the regulator emphasized.</p>
<p>The Philippine SEC explained that unregistered crypto trading platforms &#8220;offer different products and schemes which are high risk and sometimes fraudulent,&#8221; adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>A number of unregistered cryptocurrency exchanges are deliberately targeting Filipino investors and borrowers through online advertisements in social media and unlawfully allowing Filipinos to access their online platforms and permit the enrollment, creation, or registration of client accounts through online means.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Philippine central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), maintains a list of virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that are licensed to operate in the country. As of Nov. 30, there are 19 companies on the list.</p>
<p>They are ABA Global Philippines (aka Coex Star), Appsolutely, Atomtrans Tech, Betur (aka Coins.ph), Bexpress, Bloom Solutions, Coinville Phils, Etranss Remittance International, Frenetic, I-Remit, Moneybees Forex, Paymaya Philippines, Philbit Money Changer and Remittance Services (aka Philbit), Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (aka PDAX), Rebittance, Topjuan Technologies, Wibs PHP, Xenremit, and Zybi Tech (aka Juan Cash).</p>
<p>The Philippines is among the countries with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/vietnam-philippines-india-china-among-top-countries-for-crypto-adoption-chainalysis-global-index-shows/">highest crypto adoption</a>, according to blockchain data analytics firm Chainalysis. The central bank also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/philippine-regulator-warns-the-public-of-engaging-with-foreign-crypto-service-providers/">regularly warned</a> investors about engaging with unregistered crypto service providers. In August, the BSP announced that it will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/philippines-will-stop-accepting-crypto-license-applications-for-3-years-regulator-says/">stop accepting</a> crypto license applications for three years starting in September.</p>

Interest rates moving up. Stock market to crash sending gold and silver higher,&#x201D; Kiyosaki described.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Expects Gold and Silver to Soar When Stock Market Crashes</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, says the prices of gold and silver are about to soar. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Monday that the price of gold is now over $1,800 while silver is over $24, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Inflation moving up. Interest rates moving up. Stock market to crash sending gold and silver higher. May be last chance to buy gold and silver at these low prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has been telling investors to buy gold, silver, and bitcoin for quite some time. <span style="font-weight: 200;">He previously emphasized that he only invests in physical gold and silver &#x2014; not gold or silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</span></p>
<p>Many people on Twitter reminded Kiyosaki that he has been giving the same warning for years. Some disagreed with the famous author, expecting the price of gold to drop from the current level.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gold & silver prices plunge as Fed continues raising interest rates,&#x201D; Kiyosaki <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-stocks-bonds-real-estate-will-crash-as-fed-continues-rate-hikes-advises-buy-bitcoin-before-fed-pivot/">explained</a> in October, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Raising interest rates will kill economy. Stock, bond, real estate will crash. Fed will pivot. Buy gold, silver & bitcoin before Fed pivot.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-world-war-iii/">cautioned</a>: &#x201C;Gold, silver, bitcoin may protect your wealth &#x2026; but not your income.&#x201D; He noted: &#x201C;As economy crashes, stock markets go bust, pensions crash and unemployment rises a side hustle may provide you income &#x2026; Your side hustle may grow into the next Amazon or bitcoin.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the famous author said he expects people who own gold, silver, and bitcoin to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoin-investors-to-get-richer-when-fed-pivots-prints-trillions-of-dollars/">get rich</a> when the Fed pivots and prints trillions of dollars. In July, when the price of silver fell to around $20, he called silver the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-discusses-best-investment-value-today/">best investment value</a> today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kiyosaki often recommends <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-why-he-buys-bitcoin-citing-pension-funds-inflation/">buying bitcoin</a> alongside gold and silver. He recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-im-a-bitcoin-investor-when-btc-hits-new-bottom-i-get-excited/">clarified</a> that he is a bitcoin investor, not a trader, so he gets excited when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> hits a new bottom. In September, he urged investors to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-urges-investors-to-get-into-crypto-now-before-biggest-economic-crash-in-world-history/">get into crypto now</a>, before the biggest economic crash happens.</p>

The company’s stock has lost 96.34% year-to-date and on Dec. 12, the bitcoin miner “advanced negotiations with a third party to sell certain assets” in order to “strengthen its balance sheet and improve its liquidity.”</strong></p>
<h2>Argo Blockchain Requested a Suspension of Stock Trading Pending an Official Announcement</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Dec. 27, 2022, the publicly-listed bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ARBK:NASDAQ">ARBK</a>) announced that it has requested the suspension of trading its shares via Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange as well.</p>
<p>Argo detailed that it believes trading will resume after the company makes an important announcement on Dec. 28. Argo disclosed that the announcement is “expected to be released before [the] opening of trading on Wednesday.”</p>
<p>Argo is one of many bitcoin mining operations that has suffered a great deal financially from the crypto winter. During the first week of Nov. 2022, Argo’s stock was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/publicly-listed-bitcoin-miner-argo-blockchains-stock-gets-downgraded-firm-offloads-close-to-4000-bitmain-miners/">downgraded</a> by the financial institution Canaccord Genuity and Jefferies analysts.</p>
<p>Another publicly-listed bitcoin mining competitor Core Scientific <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/core-scientific-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-firm-plans-to-continue-mining-bitcoin-to-pay-down-debt/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, and in late Sept. 2022, Compute North <a href="https://bkdata.com/business-bankruptcies/mcallen-texas/09-22-2022/compute-north-90288">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. <a href="https://twitter.com/Mostafa45638060/status/1606990390623899648?s=20&amp;t=dX79CifsDZVWnSkls6jLRg">Stats show</a> that publicly traded mining firms collectively have debts of more than $4 billion.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Argo <a href="https://twitter.com/wsfoxley/status/1601283443739938816?s=20&amp;t=sXoVVzUfn3I3139XJbqziQ">accidentally published</a> documentation that said it was voluntarily filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. However, <a href="https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/argo_blockchain/news/rns/story/x5gmplw">documents</a> from Dec. 12, 2022, indicate the miner is in “advanced negotiations with a third party to sell certain assets.”</p>
<p>The company further said Argo “is hopeful that it will be able to consummate the transaction outside of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States, although there is no assurance that the company can avoid such a filing.”</p>

The DSS is still seeking to apprehend Emefiele despite losing its bid to have a Nigerian court sanction the arrest. </strong></p>
<h2>Nigerian Court Refuses to Back Arrest Plot</h2>
<p>As the controversy surrounding the failed arrest of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor Godwin Emefiele continues to hog the limelight, a new report by Sahara Reporters said operatives from Nigeria’s Department of State Services (DSS) have an order to &#8220;arrest him on sight.&#8221; In addition, the report, which relies on the testimony of unnamed sources, said operatives are also monitoring movements at the CBN headquarters as well as at the Emefiele family residence in Lagos.</p>
<p>As explained in the <a href="https://saharareporters.com/2022/12/24/exclusive-nigerias-central-bank-governor-emefiele-secretly-returns-us-hides-away-abuja">report</a>, the DSS’ unconfirmed plan to arrest Emefiele, who was part of Muhammadu Buhari’s entourage to the US-Africa Leaders’ Summit, came a few weeks after a Nigerian High Court judge, John Tsoho, turned down the security agency’s bid to have the CBN governor arrested. In his judgment, Tsoho <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/dss-loses-bid-to-arrest-cbn-governor-emefiele/">reportedly</a> slammed the DSS for attempting to use a deceptive lawsuit &#8220;to deprive a person [Emefiele] of his liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Opponents of CBN&#8217;s Cashless Policy Want Emefiele Removed</h2>
<p>However, the court&#8217;s ruling has seemingly not stopped the DSS from seeking to arrest Emefiele, whom it accuses of funding terrorists. Rumors suggesting that the DSS still wants to arrest the official have reportedly forced the CBN governor to avoid public gatherings including a scheduled appearance before Nigerian legislators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emefiele has refused to return to Nigeria claiming heart ailment. He was supposed to return to Nigeria yesterday after travelling with [President Muhammadu] Buhari to the US-Africa Leadership Summit in Washington DC,&#8221; an unnamed source reportedly said.</p>
<p>The source also speculated that Emefiele will continue playing hide and seek with the DSS before eventually leaving his position as CBN governor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.legit.ng/business-economy/economy/1510667-terrorism-financing-real-reasons-dss-arrest-cbn-governor-godwin-emefiele/">report</a> by Legit suggested that Emefiele&#8217;s troubles with the DSS are instigated by politicians dissatisfied with the CBN&#8217;s decisions, including the recent introduction of new naira banknotes. Another <a href="https://tribuneonlineng.com/why-dss-want-emefiele-out-coalition/">report</a> speculated that the DSS plot to arrest the CBN governor is being backed by groups opposed to the central bank&#8217;s cashless policy.</p>

Moreover, analysts note that most of the technical bottom indicators used to predict bitcoin prices have failed to forecast whether or not the bottom is in.</strong></p>
<h2>Rainbows and S2F: The List of Technical Indicators That Failed to Predict Bitcoin&#x2019;s Bottom</h2>
<p>A month ago, crypto supporters <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/after-more-than-380-days-crypto-supporters-celebrate-surviving-the-second-longest-bitcoin-bear-market/">celebrated</a> enduring one of the longest and harshest bitcoin bear markets since the 2013-2015 bitcoin bear market. At the time, the 2013-2015 bitcoin bear run was the longest downturn but today, the current crypto economy&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/2022s-market-review-crypto-economy-loses-1-4t-top-10-token-knockouts-terras-collapse/">contraction period </a>is set to surpass the 2013-2015 crypto retrenchment.</p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://twitter.com/StockmoneyL/status/1607501940136501249?s=20&t=F-pmXBun-cQiIdn6d8cpUA">longest bottom phase</a>, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rainbows-log-charts-and-s2f-bitcoins-2022-bear-market-has-broken-the-communitys-most-popular-price-models/">reported</a> 144 days ago how a number of technical indicators failed this year to predict bitcoin&#x2019;s future U.S. dollar value. One of the biggest price model failures mentioned this year was the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, which was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/plan-bs-stock-to-flow-price-model-denounced-by-vitalik-buterin-says-model-can-be-harmful/">denounced</a> by Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano and ETH-co-founder Vitalik Buterin last June.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">"We need more pain before we make a bottom"</p>
<p>My man, we've seen:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>With all the so-called &#x2018;greatest&#x2019; technical indicators failing miserably, many crypto proponents are still writing forum posts and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=bitcoin%20bottom%20&src=typed_query">social media threads</a> about bitcoin&#x2019;s confounded bottom. For instance, on Dec. 27, the Twitter account Crypto Noob <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoNoob_1/status/1607627447180349441?s=20&t=F-pmXBun-cQiIdn6d8cpUA">tweeted</a>: &#x201C;Bitcoin is currently trading in the oversold zone. Which is historically where the bottom forms. Do you think <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has bottomed out?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Questions and posts like these are littered across crypto-focused forums and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. On Reddit, the subreddit forum r/cryptocurrency features a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zwfq0p/is_the_bear_market_bottom_in_information_from/">post</a> that highlights how technical bottom indicators have failed, and the author of the post details that the analysts have &#x201C;no clue&#x201D; and this time &#x201C;IS different.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The post&#x2019;s author &#x201C;u/Beyonderr&#x201D; explains how eight technical indicators were not reliable to bitcoin traders this year. For example, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) was supposed to signal oversold levels and bitcoin&#x2019;s bottom, but Beyonderr says &#x201C;this was not true this year.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Other unreliable technical indicators Beyonderr mentioned include the monthly MACD (moving average convergence/divergence), the Rainbow price chart, the 200-week moving average, the 100-week moving average X 20-week moving average, the Pi cycle indicator, the Hash ribbons indicator, and the average percentage drawdown from a cycle&#x2019;s high.</p>

<p>Moreover, Beyonderr mocked the S2F price model by calling it the &#x201C;Meme bonus&#x201D; indicator. &#x201C;The worst indicator of them all, Plan B&#x2019;s horrible Stock-to-flow model. Add it to the failed pile,&#x201D; Beyonderr wrote. The post on r/cryptocurrency also mentioned that there may be four indicators that suggest the bottom &#x201C;might be in,&#x201D; at least according to Beyonderr.</p>
<p>The indicators Beyonderr cited include signals like &#x201C;time in the market,&#x201D; the &#x201C;Puell Multiple,&#x201D; the &#x201C;Mayer Multiple,&#x201D; and the &#x201C;MVRV Z-score.&#x201D; Meanwhile, a great number of people on social media platforms like Twitter wholeheartedly believe the bottom is awfully close to being in, but so far most technical signals have just been unreliable deviations.</p>

While a barrel of oil is coasting along at prices between $80.12 and $85 per unit, Goldman Sachs analysts think oil will reach $110 per barrel for Brent oil, and strategists from Morgan Stanley also believe oil will reach $110 a barrel by mid-2023. The founder of Praetorian Capital recently warned a barrel of oil could jump a lot higher next year.</strong></p>
<h2>Market Strategists Expect Oil Prices to Jump Considerably in 2023, Some Warn That $100-a-Barrel Oil Should Be Expected Next Year, Others Say a Barrel of Crude Could Surpass $200</h2>
<p>Reports show that Wall Street is bullish about oil in comparison to equities, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">cryptocurrencies</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silver-and-gold-precious-metals-stored-value-this-year-outperforming-crypto-assets-in-2022/">precious metals</a>. Oil jumped a great deal in value this year amid the rising inflation and the start of the Ukraine-Russia war. On March 8, 2022, the same day gold reached its all-time price high, a barrel of Brent traded for $126 a barrel. Following the 2022 high, oil slipped to $96 per barrel eight days later on March 16. It then crept back up again throughout April and May, and by June 8, a barrel of Brent was around $122 per unit.</p>

<p>Since that day, a barrel of crude Brent oil dropped 31% against the U.S. dollar, dropping to the $85 barrel range on Dec. 27, 2022. Despite the drop, numerous investors and Wall Street types believe oil will be the best investment next year. The hedge fund manager and founder of Praetorian Capital, Harris Kupperman, is one market strategist that thinks oil will “crush” all other investments in 2023. Kupperman’s portfolio opinion, <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/oil-will-crush-all-other-investments">shared</a> on Quoth the Raven’s substack, not only says oil will surpass all other investments, but Kupperman expects a barrel to jump above $200.</p>
<p>“My strongest held view is that 2023 is the year of oil crushing all other CUSIPs,” the Praetorian Capital founder wrote. “Once again, I think it’s important to repeat that if you haven’t stress-tested your portfolio for oil prices north of $200, you’re going to suffer dearly when that should come to pass.”</p>
<p>Kupperman is not the only investor expecting bullish oil prices next year. The investment publication The Motley Fool <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/17/a-bull-market-is-coming-for-oil-in-2023-3-top-stoc/">highlights</a> that Jeff Currie, the Goldman Sachs global head of commodities, believes Brent will reach $110 next year. In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley shared the same view about oil prices rising in 2023. &#8220;We remain constructive on oil prices driven by recovering demand (China reopening, aviation recovering) amid constrained supply due to low levels of investment, risks to Russia supply, the end of SPR releases, and [the] slowdown of U.S. shale,” Morgan Stanley’s commodity analysts noted.</p>

<p>Jay Hatfield, the CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/oil-prices-predictions-for-2023-164454199.html">detailed</a> on Dec. 23 that his firm expects $80-$100 a barrel “while the Ukrainian war continues.” Hatfield also said that he expects China’s oil demand to “recover as it emerges from zero-Covid lockdown policy.&#8221; A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2022/12/07/report-expect-a-return-of-100-oil-in-2023/?sh=6d016e754b9e">report</a> published by Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR) warns $100 a barrel oil prices will return in 2023. EIR’s report cites the increase will come to fruition due to the sanctions of Russian oil and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) supply management.</p>

The incident resulted in the theft of digital assets belonging to the pool and its clients worth a combined total of $3 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Chinese Authorities Launch Investigation Into Crypto Mining Pool Hack</h2>
<p>A subsidiary of the coin minting company Bit Mining has been targeted in a hacking attack, the company said in a press release. The affected entity is a leading bitcoin mining pool, <a href="https://btc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Btc.com</a>, which in the past week accounted for over 2.5% of the pool distribution and has a share exceeding 4% on annual basis.</p>
<p>According to the announcement published Monday, Dec. 26, the platform was hit on Dec. 3, 2022. As a result, $2.3 million worth of digital assets owned by the company and another $700,000 in asset value belonging to its clients were stolen.</p>

<p>The cyberattack has been reported to law enforcement in Shenzhen, China on Dec. 23. The Chinese authorities launched an investigation into the incident and are collecting evidence with the support of relevant agencies, Bit Mining detailed and further emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company will devote considerable efforts to recover the stolen digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The mining firm said that some of Btc.com&#x2019;s crypto assets have already been secured. It also pointed out that after discovering the breach, it implemented technology designed to better block and intercept hackers, assuring:</p>
<blockquote><p>Btc.com is currently operating its business as usual, and apart from its digital asset services, its client fund services are unaffected.</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides the top-10 mining pool, which provides mining services for bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), ether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), and litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>), Bit Mining Limited also owns the mining device manufacturer Bee Computing and operates coin minting facilities.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese government cracked down on the industry in the spring of 2021, Bit Mining has sought to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bit-mining-to-deploy-another-2500-bitcoin-miners-in-kazakhstan/">expand</a> its activities in Kazakhstan, which has become a major crypto mining hotspot. In August of this year, the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bit-mining-secures-9-3-million-registered-direct-offering-from-institutional-investors/">announced</a> it had secured a $9.3 million registered direct offering from institutional investors.</p>

<p>Currently, on Dec. 26, 2022, cryptoquant.com <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=log&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line">metrics</a> show there&#x2019;s 2,151,925 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> held on centralized exchanges. 51 days ago on Nov. 5, around 2,508,773 bitcoin were sitting on crypto trading platforms. On that day, there was roughly 22,528,626 ether held on centralized exchanges and today there&#x2019;s 4.48 million fewer as exchanges currently hold <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/eth/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=log&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line">18,045,150 ETH</a>.</p>
<p>Using current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> exchange rates indicates around $11.53 billion was removed from trading platforms. In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> a large sum of stablecoins was withdrawn from exchanges as well over the last 51 days. Just days before FTX collapsed there was $35.20 billion in stablecoins like USDC and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> held on trading platforms.</p>
<p>Since then, however, $7.669 billion worth of stablecoin assets has been removed. Although, the withdrawals have slowed down a great deal since Dec. 20, 2022, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> deposits have increased. Onchain statistics further show that bitcoin exchange outflows tapped their lowest levels since June 2022. Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) withdrawals slowed on Dec. 20 as well, but haven&#x2019;t really increased much. However, stablecoin withdrawals continue.</p>

In tandem with the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, and stablecoin withdrawals, top-ten crypto assets like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, DOGE, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> also saw significant withdrawals since Nov. 5.</p>

Upland will allow Argentine fans to have a bigger connection with AFA history, presenting the opportunity to acquire digital representations of several properties of the league, including clubs, games, historical moments, and even tickets.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Argentine Soccer Association AFA to Establish a Presence in the Metaverse</h2>
<p>The Argentine Soccer Association, AFA, the institution that manages the national soccer league, is now entering the metaverse. The organization has partnered with Upland, a real-life mapping metaverse project, to allow its users to enter the metaverse and experience the benefits of a closer connection with teams and celebrated players.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.afa.com.ar/es/posts/la-asociacion-del-futbol-argentino-presenta-a-upland-como-socio-estrategico-para-el-desarrollo-del-metaverso-de-la-liga-profesional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> issued by the AFA, Upland&#8217;s partnership will include digital representations of all the teams of the league, including players, tickets, games, historical moments, and exclusive moments of the platform. This will also ostensibly allow the league to attract younger, Web3-focused fans, and digital collectors from the soccer world, as well. The four-year deal is the first agreement of the AFA of this kind and aims to bring additional revenue to the Argentine Soccer League through the sale of multiple licensed digital assets.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Secondary Markets</h2>
<p>However, this metaverse experience won&#8217;t be only unidirectional, as the platform will allow the resale of these digital collectibles by the fans, establishing a secondary market. The Argentine Soccer Association expects this to improve the relationship that the institution has with its fans, and internationalize the national league after the national Selection won the FIFA World Cup, recently held in Qatar.</p>
<p>Claudio Tapia, President of the AFA, celebrated this partnership because it will take advantage of the metaverse&#8217;s emergent technologies. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This agreement allows us to partner with the best creators of technology and new digital products and thus generate a new source of income for all participating clubs. We welcome Upland as a new commercial partner of our Association and of the Argentine Professional Soccer League.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other soccer leagues of the world, as well as some of their teams, have already jumped on the metaverse bandwagon. The Spanish Laliga, the national soccer league in Spain, is already immersed in metaverse-related initiatives, having <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dapper-labs-and-spanish-soccer-league-laliga-launch-memorable-moments-nft-platform-laliga-golazos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/spanish-soccer-league-laliga-partners-with-globant-to-support-new-web3-and-metaverse-initiatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnerships</a> with Globant and Dapper Labs to expand its metaverse presence and establish markets for licensed digital products.</p>

To back this promise, the singer reportedly claimed he is even willing to do &#8220;a world tour just to pay them all back.&#8221; Akon, however, conceded during an interview that he should &#8220;have gotten more things in place before promoting it [Akon City].&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Singer Ready to Do a World Tour for Token Holders</h2>
<p>Rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) singer and music producer, Akon, reportedly promised to reimburse disillusioned supporters who have been waiting for refunds from his token of appreciation (TOA) campaign. The Senegalese-American artist also told TOA holders that he is prepared to use his own funds to ensure this promise is honored.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dead serious. I would do a world tour just to pay them all back,&#8221; the award-winning artist reportedly said.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019, Akon&#8217;s TOA was given to his early financial backers. The TOA was not only a precursor to the akoin cryptocurrency but it also reportedly gave supporters an opportunity to acquire the crypto. However, after more than two years of waiting, some early backers have lost faith and are now asking for refunds.</p>
<p>Although he seemingly acknowledged that some supporters have lost faith in the project, Akon suggested during an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63988368">interview</a> with the BBC that his ambitious but much-delayed mega-construction project — Akon City — is still on track. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/akon-city-akoin-cryptocurrency/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, construction of the initial phase of the singer’s &#8220;futuristic cryptocurrency-themed city&#8221; was expected to commence sometime in the second half of 2020.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the singer’s reported multibillion-dollar project, Akon’s team revealed that the initial phase, which included the construction of hotels, a school, a waste facility, and a solar power plant, would be complete by the end of 2023. However, according to the BBC report, the site of Akon’s mega city has now become grazing land for goats.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Akon City Dream Still Alive</h2>
<p>During the interview, Akon — who blames the Covid-19 pandemic for causing the delay — conceded that he should &#8220;have gotten more things in place before promoting it.&#8221; The singer is nevertheless adamant that his project, which has been &#8220;co-signed by the current [Senegalese] president&#8221; is still alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I plan to retire in that city. I don&#8217;t like to use the word the king of the city. But that&#8217;s what it will turn out to be,&#8221; Akon reportedly said.</p>
<p>During the interview, the R&amp;B singer was also asked to respond to investor concerns about the legality of using a cryptocurrency in a jurisdiction regulated by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). He said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to make sure that however we involve crypto within the city is in a way that it lines up with all the rules and regulations.</p></blockquote>
<p>As explained in the BBC report, the BCEAO has not only warned of the dangers of using crypto but has reportedly called it illegal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when asked if the akoin cryptocurrency is still the preferred medium of exchange in the envisaged city, Akon promised to have this &#8220;figured out by the time the city&#8217;s up, that&#8217;s for sure.&#8221;</p>
