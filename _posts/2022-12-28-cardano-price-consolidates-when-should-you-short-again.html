The Cardano price had increased over the weekend, but the coin showed lateral price movement at press time. Over the last 24 hours, ADA has dipped about 0.2%. The ADA has gained 4% in the last week, indicating a positive trend. According to the technical outlook, the Cardano price has not yet reversed its price action. The downtrend continues despite the coin securing minor gains over the last few days. The buying strength remained low, which depicted lower accumulation as well. Cardano bounced back from oversold territory, but the selling momentum was still strong. With the Bitcoin price falling and fluctuating between $16,900 and $16,600, altcoins have also seen choppy and undecided price movements. Following major market movers, ADA traded between $0.26 and $0.27, with the altcoin falling below the $0.25 price mark in the last 24 hours. The market has presented signs where buyers can make an entry to make some gains over the shorter trading timeframe. The trading volume of Cardano was low, indicating a lack of buyers. ADA is trading 91% below its all-time high secured in the last year.
