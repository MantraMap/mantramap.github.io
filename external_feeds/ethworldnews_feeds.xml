<ul><li>A Bahamian magistrate has issued orders to extend the remand of Sam Bankman-Fried.</li><li>The former FTX CEO was expected to drop his extradition fight today in court.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF was reportedly shaking in the courtroom.</li><li>He will return to the Bahamas’ notorious Fox Hill prison.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Following a rather chaotic hearing today at the Nassau courthouse, Bahamian magistrate Shaka Serville ruled that Sam Bankman-Fried will not be extradited to the United States yet. The magistrate has issued orders to remand the former FTX CEO in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried intended to waive his extradition</strong></h2>



<p>The news comes as a surprise given the widespread reports of Sam Bankman-Fried’s intention to surrender himself to U.S custody. According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-sent-back-to-bahamas-jail-.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a>, even the Bahamian prosecutor acknowledged SBF’s intention to waive extradition. As per the report, Sam Bankman-Fried demanded to see a copy of his federal indictment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was reportedly shaking in the courtroom. His defense attorney informed the court that Bankman-Fried’s presence in the court came as a “shock” to him. “I did not request him to be here this morning,” the attorney said. The former crypto billionaire will be taken away to Fox Hill prison in a heavily guarded convoy following the magistrate’s orders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>No relief in sight for Sam Bankman-Fried</strong></h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was first remanded to the notorious Fox Hill prison last week after the court&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-denied-bail-ftx-judge-bahamas-sbf-fraud-case/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rejected</a>&nbsp;his bail plea citing a flight risk. Given that he needed medical care, SBF was kept in the medical unit of the prison. The prison is known for its precarious condition. Lack of hygienic cells, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and medical care among other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the rejection of SBF’s bail application, his attorneys indicated that they would fight extradition at today’s hearing. However,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>&nbsp;emerged over the weekend that signaled that the former FTX CEO was ready to drop his extradition fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Binance&#8217;s American division successfully bid $1.022 billion for assets under bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital.</li><li>The deal could fast-track unlocking customer funds after Voyager collapsed in July 2022 due to market conditions and exposure to Three Arrows Capital.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX bid $1.4 billion for Voyager&#8217;s asset before SBF&#8217;s crypto exchange crashed in November.</li></ul>



<p>BinanceUS sealed a deal to buy Voyager Digital assets after the crypto broker froze withdrawals and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022. The official statement published on Monday said that BinanceUS was the highest bidder with $1.022 billion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@BinanceUS</a> was selected highest and best bid in Voyager’s reopened bankruptcy asset auction. Once the deal is completed, Voyager users will finally be able to access their digital assets on the <a href="https://t.co/Wc26vMosC4" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/Wc26vMosC4</a> platform.<br><br>Read: <a href="https://t.co/gBK5m3kcYn" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/gBK5m3kcYn</a></p>&mdash; Brian Shroder (@BrianShroder) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianShroder/status/1604825059813920770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to BinanceUS, the bid considered the “fair market value” of Voyager’s crypto portfolio. The massive $1 billion deal also accounted for an incremental value equal to $20 million.&nbsp; BinanceUS noted that should &#8220;sets a clear path forward for Voyager customer funds to be unlocked as soon as possible&#8221;. This means that Voyager users could see their crypto assets returned earlier than previously expected.</p>



<p>The agreement with BinanceUS is subject to a bankruptcy hearing on January 5, 2023, per Monday’s <a href="https://blog.binance.us/voyager-binance-us/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.binance.us/voyager-binance-us/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The sale to Binance.US will be consummated pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan, which will be subject to a creditor vote and is subject to other customary closing conditions. Binance.US and the Company will work to close the transaction promptly following approval of the chapter 11 plan by the Bankruptcy Court.</p></blockquote>



<p>FTX under Sam Bankman-Fried successfully bid $1.4 billion for Voyager&#8217;s assets back in September but the deal fell through after SBF&#8217;s crypto exchange shuttered in November. </p>



<h2>Voyager Digital Crash</h2>



<p>Voyager Digital collapsed around mid-2022 following a downturn in the crypto asset prices and the collapse of several centralized finance digital asset entities. Previous reports cited exposure to bankruptcy crypto hedge fund <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-creditors-july-18/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-creditors-july-18/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Three Arrows Capital</a> (3AC) as another major reason behind Voyager’s tumble.</p>



<p>Voyager’s future was further dimmed after Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto empire imploded in November. The crypto broker previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyager-digital-3ac-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured</a> a $485 million credit line from Alameda Research, SBF’s quantitative trading behemoth. </p>



<p>Other CeFi crypto companies like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-bankruptcy-files-chapter-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlockFi</a>, Celsius, and FTX also filed for bankruptcy amid the 2022 bear market citing liquidity constraints, market volatility, and exposure to other virtual currency entities. </p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to surrender to U.S. extradition laws as authorities prosecute the former FTX crypto exchange founder for fraud and money laundering. Bankman-Fried will appear before a Bahamas court later on Monday to reverse his earlier decision, per reports from three media outlets.</p>



<p>Bahamas authorities arrested SBF on December 12 following a formal request from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutors. Sam Bankman-Fried appeared before a judge and contested extradition to the United States where he faces several allegations of fraud and money laundering. SBF’s $250,000 bail request was also denied, EthereumWorldNews reported.</p>



<p>Reports from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/17/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-will-not-contest-us-extradition-in-alleged-fraud-case-source-says.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/sam-bankman-fried-reverse-decision-contesting-extradition-source-2022-12-17/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/12/17/sbf-prison-bahamas/" rel="nofollow noopener">Washington Post</a> cited sources close to Bankman-Fried who claimed that the fallen founder no longer planned to fight extradition to the U.S. Bahamas Fox Hill prison staff were also cited as sources.</p>



<p>As previously reported, SBF’s extradition hearing will take place on February 8, 2023, barring any changes. Sam Bankman-Fried could remain in Bahamas custody until then, in a prison that many describe as harsh and unforgiving.</p>

<h2>DOJ Filed Eight (8) Charges Against Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>Indeed, the former FTX CEO was charged on eight counts including fraud on customers, lenders, and investors. SBF also faces money laundering charges and campaign finance violations.</p>

<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed a complaint against SBF with damning allegations. CFTC officials accused Sam Bankman-Fried of diverting billions in customer funds to Alameda Research, his trading giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the CFTC, Alameda was already insolvent by May/June 2022 when Terra collapsed. The CFTC alleged that Alameda’s use of customer funds drastically <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/">increased</a> after Luna and UST’s $40 billion wipeout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding users and lenders alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>An exploiter stole around $2.5 million in cryptocurrencies from Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium.</li><li>The team confirmed that a hacker withdrew liquidity pool tokens from its admin wallet on Friday.</li><li>The hacker swapped the stolen digital assets from Solana to Ethereum, per on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. </li></ul>



<p>Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium was exploited on Friday for around $2.5 million in digital assets, the project confirmed via a Twitter thread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Solana DEX, the project’s admin wallet was compromised and liquidity pool (LP) tokens were withdrawn without the team&#8217;s authorization. Raydium said the exploiter assumed “owner authority” in order to drain funds from the LP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nansen confirmed that LP tokens were stolen from the Solana DEX, including some $⅙ million in SOL. Further investigations into the matter are underway, said the team.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Raydium Hack Spells Further Turbence For Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem</h2>



<p>Raydium’s TVL exceeded $45 million despite today’s $2.5 million hack, per data seen on the DEX’s liquidity pool dashboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Friday’s hack on the DEX highlighted pressure in Solana&#8217;s decentralized finance ecosystem. Solana DeFi was thrown into uncertainty after the crash of FTX. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried back’s Solana development, including massive investments in projects like Serum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solana’s total value locked (TVL) fell below $300 million shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11. The Solana Foundation also lost tens of millions stuck on the crypto exchange after withdrawals were paused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFTC, SEC, and U.S. Attorneys from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) have since <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> Bankman-Fried with fraud and money laundering.

<ul><li>Audit Firm Mazars recently halted operations for massive crypto exchanges, including Binance, Crypto.Com, and KuCoin, following FTX&#8217;s Collapse, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>.</li><li>Previous audit reports have been taken down from their website. </li><li>Binance saw a withdrawal of $1B earlier this week following fears of investigations from the US Justice Department. </li></ul>



<p>Audit Group Mazars is halting any work with crypto clients such as Binance, the world&#8217;s current largest crypto exchange. The crypto sector has been under enormous scrutiny recently following the fallout of the significant crypto exchanges FTX and FTX.US. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg </a>report, previous audit reports are currently inaccessible on Mazar&#8217;s website, as the links are broken.</p>



<p>The accounting firm, Mazars, was hired by Binance to conduct a &#8220;proof of reserves&#8221; report. A Binance statement on Friday confirmed that Mazars had indicated they would temporarily pause all work with global crypto clients, including clients such as Crypto.Com, KuCoin, and Binance.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221208065048/https://veritas.mazars.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20221208065048/https://veritas.mazars.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">website </a>responsible for crypto audits appears to be shut down, and Mazars has not issued any further statements.</p>



<p>Most big crypto exchanges, such as Crypto.Com, KuCoin, and Binance, have worked with Mazars to provide audit reports on their reserves in November, following the fallout of crypto exchange FTX.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Binance saw a withdrawal amount of over $1BN as fear in centralized exchanges is at an all-time high. &#8220;Over the past week, Binance passed a stress test that should give the community extraordinary comfort that their funds are secure,&#8221; Binance said on Friday, confirming it was able to fulfill recent withdrawals &#8220;without breaking stride.&#8221;</p>



<p>The following outflow followed due to recent probes by the U.S Justice Department holding Binance under investigation on Money Laundering and Tax Avoidance charges.</p>



<p>Binance previously confirmed it holds more than $60B in assets, ensuring that the funds should be sufficient to honor all withdrawals. Still, it is yet to provide a disclosure of its liabilities. This figure has also been confirmed by Nansen Data which shows that Binance has over 55.6B in asset reserves.</p>



<p>According to a statement shared by Binance on Friday, the exchange confirmed that it has attempted to reach out to multiple large auditing firms, including ones in the Big Four, which are currently unwilling to conduct a proof of reserve for a private company.  Binance is still looking for a firm willing to do so. The exchange did not commit to a timeline on when this would be achieved. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The OKB token shot up in value after Twitter CEO Elon Musk followed OKX&#8217;s account, the crypto exchange behind OKB.</li><li>OKB&#8217;s price rose as high as 7% by press time on the speculations that Musk might unveil crypto payments for Twitter.</li><li>Elon Musk does not follow Binance, another crypto exchange that invested $500 million in equity for his Twitter takeover.</li></ul>



<p>OKX utility token pumped in asset value after traders noticed Elon Musk followed the company’s account on Twitter. OKB is the native token for the OKX cryptocurrency exchange. Users can trade with OKB, using the coin to pay for fees and digital asset transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OKB surged over 72% on the back of Elon Musk’s follow. The token traded for around $24 at press time, per data pulled from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/okb" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinGecko</a>. It’s unclear why Musk followed OKX on the social network. OKX notably advertises its partnership with European Football giants Manchester City on Twitter.</p>

<p>Some crypto participants on Twitter speculated that the OKX follow affirms upcoming web 3.0 payment integrations for the social network. Musk is a known supporter of Dogecoin, a popular crypto meme coin also known as DOGE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hopes that Twitter will roll out support for several blockchain networks only increased after Elon purchased Twitter for $44 billion. Crypto exchange Binance invested $500 million in equity for Musk’s massive Twitter buy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao previously said Twitter&#8217;s best bet was to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-twitter-cryptos-dogecoin-bnb/">integrate</a> multiple blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Musk also suggested that payments on Twitter were a “no brainer”.</p>



<h2>Twitter Announces NFT Trading</h2>



<p>Twitter announced NFT trading days after Elon Musk bought the company in October. The feature promised to allow NFT traders to view, buy, and sell digital collectibles from their Twitter timeliness. Twitter’s so-called “NFT Tweet Tiles” <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/musks-twitter-nft-trading-tweet-tiles/">rolled</a> out on October 27 in beta for select Apple iOS and web users.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Elon Musk Riles Journalist With Suspensions</h2>



<p>Crypto participants noticed the following amid online tension between Musk and several journalists on the social network. Users were outraged after Twitter suspended several accounts of reporters who cover the tech billionaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asides from journalists, Twitter also suspended several other accounts including ElonJet, a profile that tracks Musk’s private jet. Musk claimed these accounts failed to comply with privacy policies and doxxing laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute was appointed to the committee for unsecured FTX creditors.</li><li>Wintermute and eight other members form the committee, according to a court document seen by EthereumWorldNews.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. on November 11, 2022.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Crypto market maker Wintermute was appointed to the unsecured creditor&#8217;s committee for FTX, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to the court document seen by EthereumWorldNews, the committee comprises nine members including Wintermute and GGC, and an entity owned by Genesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankruptcy filing revealed over a million creditors of the collapsed crypto exchange. SBF&#8217;s firm reportedly owes the top 50 creditors around $3 billion. Alameda Research had $8 billion in liabilities on the exchange, per a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complaint</a> from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>



<h2>Unsecured Creditors Committee</h2>

Ltd.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Appointing a creditors committee is common with Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws in the United States. After crypto lender Celsius filed Chapter 11 back on July 13, the bankruptcy court <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-creditor-committee-misconduct/">appointed</a> the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors days after on July 27.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Charged With Fraud</h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on December 13, 2022. Bahamas law enforcement received notice of criminal charges from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). </p>



<p>Prosecutors <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> SBF with fraud and money laundering. The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also filed similar charges. According to the CFTC&#8217;s complaint, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reallocated</a> FTX customer assets to Alameda Research, his trading firm. </p>



<p>FTX CEO John Ray told Congress that Alameda exposed client funds to huge margin trading losses.  The CFTC alleged that Alameda&#8217;s liabilities on FTX exceeded $8 billion. Charges from the SEC also accused SBF of defrauding customers, lenders, and investors. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was spotted in police custody outside a Bahamas court on December 14, 2022. The judge denied his lawyer&#8217;s request for a $250,000 bail. SBF&#8217;s next court date is February 8, 2023. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Alameda&#8217;s liabilities with crypto exchange FTX were masked on the orders of Sam Bankman-Fried, CFTC officials alleged.</li><li>Nishad Singh, a top executive in SBF&#8217;s crypto empire, supposedly developed code that redirected Alameda&#8217;s billions in liabilities to a &#8216;weird Korean account’.</li><li>The CFTC, DOJ, and SEC all charged Bankman-Fried with several counts of fraud following his arrest in the Bahamas. </li></ul>



<p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried allegedly colluded with other top executives to obscure billions in Alameda liability on the now bankruptcy crypto exchange. The findings made by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said SBF diverted his trading firm’s liability to a “weird Korean account”.</p>



<p>According to the CFTC, Alameda Research blew up around May/June 2022 after the firm failed to meet margin calls and loan obligations. Crypto prices slumped around the same time due to Terra’s implosion. Celsius and Three Arrows Capital also collapsed shortly after, further crippling crypto asset prices and triggering mass liquidations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried told FTX executives to re-engineer Alameda’s assets and liabilities to “the weird Korean account” or “our Korean friend’s account”, per the CFTC’s filing. At the time, Alameda Research&#8217;s liabilities on the crypto exchange were estimated at $8 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A separate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/ftx-executives-used-korea-account-to-mask-giant-alameda-liabilities?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> from Bloomberg alleged that Nishad Singh oversaw this process. Singh’s Github account deployed code linked to the so-called “Korean Account”. Sources previously claimed that SBF and Singh were in charge of the code used at the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alameda was afforded nigh-uncapped lending privileges via the Korean account, the CFTC filed. The federal regulator also alleged that an “allow negative flag” line of code <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/">allowed </a>Alameda to trade assets without actually holding sufficient funds or balances.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Founder Under Fire From CFTC, DOJ, and SEC</h2>



<p>Three U.S. authorities charged former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried with fraud and money laundering. Following his arrest on December 13, the U.S. prosecutors from the Southern District of New York (SDNY), the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/">SEC</a>), and the CFTC all filed <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">charges </a>against SBF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bankrupt crypto tycoon was remanded at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services (BDOCS) after a judge denied him bail. SBF will appear before a judge on February 8, 2023, as part of the prosecution and extradition process. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Alameda Research also had unlimited access to customer accounts among other special privileges at the FTX crypto exchange.</li><li>The CFTC&#8217;s complaint against Sam Bankman-Fried cited insider information, chat logs, and internal conversations as evidence for its lawsuit.</li><li>Charges were also filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. </li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said that Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading behemoth, was insolvent as of May/June 2022 despite allegedly using customer funds to finance debts and loans.</p>



<p>On Tuesday following SBF’s arrest, the CFTC filed a formal complaint against Bankman-Fried for committing fraud among other crimes. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">filed </a>charges against SBF on December 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the CFTC, Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives gave special access to Alameda. SBF’s trading firm was exempt from liquidation rules thanks to specific code written into FTX’s trading engine, per the complaint. The regulator added that Alameda could also open positions and order transactions without insufficient asset balances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alameda could borrow without limit on FTX, said the CFTC. The filing noted that Alameda’s borrow limit, or lack of it, included customer deposits and user assets.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>On at least one occasion during the Relevant Period, Alameda had reached a previously-set borrowing limit for its FTX account. In response, Bankman-Fried directed FTX personnel to raise the borrowing limit to a level that would be unlikely to ever be exceeded. On information and belief, FTX personnel ultimately raised Alameda’s borrowing limit to be many tens of billions of dollars. Alameda’s borrowed funds could also be withdrawn from FTX. These features, in combination, allowed Alameda unlimited ability to borrow and withdraw digital assets directly from FTX Trading to put towards its off-platform activities.</p></blockquote>



<p>Despite using customer funds to backstop billions in Alameda’s losses, the CFTC alleges that SBF’s trading giant was unable to repay loans and meet margin calls by May/June 2022. Notably, Terra’s $40 billion implosion happened around the same time. </p>



<p>The filing <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-new-ftt-tokens/">spurred</a> discourse around claims that Bankman-Fried and FTX played a role in crashing Luna and Three Arrows Capital after Su Zhu and his 3AC co-founder Kyle Davies published a barrage of Twitter threads blaming SBF for their fortunes. </p>

<h2>Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether Are Commodities: CFTC</h2>



<p>Part of the CFTC’s complaint gave insight into the regulators&#8217; approach toward classifying some cryptocurrencies. “Certain digital assets are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT) and others are commodities”, said the CFTC. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="680" height="319" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC.png" alt="CFTC: Alameda Used FTX Customer Funds To Stave Off Insolvency In May/June 2022 12" class="wp-image-580143" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC.png 680w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC-300x141.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC-269x126.png 269w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" title="CFTC: Alameda Used FTX Customer Funds To Stave Off Insolvency In May/June 2022 26"></figure>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-chief-gary-gensler-cftc-cryptos/">reportedly</a> backs classifying Bitcoin as a commodity. However, the SEC under Gensler <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-pos-security-gary-gensler/">suggested</a> that Ethereum, and by extension ETH, should fall under U.S. Securities laws&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clear crypto regulations in the U.S. remain elusive despite the CFTC’s argument and the SEC’s rhetoric. Crypto participants have long blamed a lack of regulatory guidance for crypto as the underlying factor behind some failures in the digital asset industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the FTX Congressional <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/" rel="noreferrer noopener">hearings</a>, bipartisan lawmakers suggested a myriad of regulatory paths total bans on crypto, inclusive regulatory policies, and completely isolating blockchain technology from America’s traditional financial ecosystem. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao pointed to FTX&#8217;s collapse as a reason for increased scrutiny of the digital asset industry.</li><li>Zhao&#8217;s internal meme to Binance staff said the crypto exchange &#8220;will survive any crypto winter”.</li><li>Outflows from Binance crossed $6.1 billion in assets while inflows exceeded $6.5 billion in the same 24 hours, Nansen data showed.</li></ul>



<p>According to Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao, crypto winter is far from over and bumpy days lay ahead for the digital asset industry following the collapse of FTX, a now-bankrupt crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao who is known as CZ by crypto participants and mainstream media shared his thoughts in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. CZ told colleagues and staff to expect amplified scrutiny on crypto companies. Zhao also expects that industry leaders like Binance will have tough questions to answer as the FTX debacle unfolds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on December 13, a few before he was scheduled to testify before Congress. United State prosecutors affirmed that SBF was indeed arrested ahead of a formal indictment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">charged</a> with eight counts including fraud on customers and investors, money laundering, and campaign finance violations. Bankman-Fried was arraigned before a judge and denied bail. His lawyers argued for a $250,000 bail bond.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Binance Prepared For ‘Stress Test’ Says CZ</h2>



<p>CZ’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/binance-ceo-zhao-warns-bumpy-road-ahead-in-message-to-his-staff?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">memo</a> echoed previous rhetoric that Binance boasts liquidity to match withdrawal demands. The crypto exchange “will survive any crypto winter”, said Zhao to staff. Indeed, massive outflows from Binance highlighted mounting skepticism for centralized crypto exchanges and their reserves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nansen data showed withdrawals of over $6.1 billion in Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets from Binance in 24 hours. Data also showed $6.5 billion in inflows within the same period. CZ remained adamant that Binance customer assets are held 1:1.</p>

<p>Zhao used “FUD” and “stress test” to describe the spotlight on Binance following FTX’s crash, where top executives like SBF stand accused of stealing customer funds to finance debts and expenditures at Alameda.&nbsp;</p>
