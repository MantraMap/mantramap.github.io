<p class="s3">The market is changing fast, and analysts believe some cryptocurrencies that were hot a few years ago may never see phenomenal growth.</p>
<p class="s3">Analysts see little of a future in two cryptocurrencies: Cronos (CRO) and Loopring (LRC). Analysts believe that the increasing curbs on crypto advertising hurt Cronos (CRO), while saturation of Ethereum layer 2 solutions means Loopring (LRC) may have seen better days.</p>
<p class="s3">However, in changing market dynamics, there is always a winner. This time, analysts expect Sparklo (SPRK) to outperform the rest of the market by a huge margin. Some even believe this cryptocurrency, which is still in the presale stage, could be destined for the top 100.</p>
<p class="s7">Cronos (CRO) Future Bleak As Crypto Advertising Faces Regulations</p>
<p class="s3">In the past, Cronos (CRO) has relied heavily on advertising to drive adoption. Cronos (CRO) even sponsored the last FIFA world cup, a testament to how heavily invested it is in advertising.</p>
<p class="s3">However, after the collapse of FTX, which was also quite heavy on advertising, many companies are avoiding crypto-related sponsorships. This means Cronos(CRO)'s avenues for creating awareness are dwindling. </p>
<p class="s3">At the same time, declining crypto prices and usage in the bear market means Cronos (CRO) revenues through Crypto.com have decreased. This means even when advertising opportunities arise, Cronos (CRO) team may need more resources to sustain such marketing. </p>
<p class="s3">There is also the aspect of competition. Cronos (CRO) transactions are costly, and more people are starting to realize it. This means Cronos (CRO) has to contend with other crypto payment networks that may be miles ahead in terms of transaction costs and speeds. </p>
<p class="s3">Besides so many factors playing against Cronos (CRO), its market cap is so high compared to where it was when it first hit the market. This makes Cronos (CRO) a crypto asset with diminishing returns. </p>
<p class="s3">That's why most investors are looking elsewhere, especially toward cryptocurrencies whose prices are still on the ground floor, such as Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s7">Loopring (LRC) Lost In A Sea Of Many Other Ethereum Layer-2s</p>
<p class="s3">Loopring (LRC) may have good fundamentals as a DEX for trading Ethereum tokens. However, there is nothing unique about such a value proposition. It makes Loopring (LRC) one of many L2s that are in the market today.</p>
<p class="s3">To make things worse, some of Loopring (LRC) 's competitors are much better known. This means that even as the Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem grows, Loopring (LRC) will likely get a minor share of the growth.</p>
<p class="s3">It is, therefore, not surprising that savvy investors are moving away from Loopring (LRC) and into newer, more innovative cryptos like Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo Continues To Attract Investors Seeking Parabolic Gains</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) is a major beneficiary as some cryptocurrencies fall out of favor with investors. </p>
<p class="s3">Investors are excited that Sparklo is still in the presale stage, which means they are getting in on the ground floor. The price is right, too, as Sparklo (SPRK) is going for a presale price of $0.015.</p>
<p class="s3">Besides the excitement of getting in early, investors love the Sparklo (SPRK) value proposition. Sparklo (SPRK) makes precious metals more accessible to the average investor by fractionalizing them as NFTs. </p>
<p class="s3">Investors also love that the Sparklo (SPRK) team has kept everything above board. InterFiNetwork thoroughly audits Sparklo (SPRK). Sparklo (SPRK) also has a KYC audit for maximum transparency. </p>
