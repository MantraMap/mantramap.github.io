<ul><li>Gemini, Genesis, and the Digital Currency Group have agreed to start a 30-day mediation process.&nbsp;</li><li>The mediation process, which includes the Unsecured Creditors Committee, will see all parties work towards a final resolution.&nbsp;</li><li>The Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange has expressed its frustration with the slow pace of Genesis’ restructuring efforts.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform/">Gemini</a> has come one step closer to recovering the funds stuck at Barry Silbert’s struggling crypto firm Genesis. Gemini has announced that it is set to enter a mediation period with Genesis, the Digital Currency Group (DCG), Genesis’ Unsecured Creditors Committee, and an ad hoc Creditor Committee led by the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Expresses Frustration With Genesis’ Restructuring Pace</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1652779387970899969" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to give its customers an update regarding the situation with Genesis and associated debtors. According to the Twitter thread, the crypto exchange has reached an agreement with Genesis and the Digital Currency Group to start a 30-day mediation process in order to come up with a final resolution regarding the outstanding payment as soon as possible. The parties that will participate in the mediation process include the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) and the ad hoc Creditors Committee led by Gemini. </p>



<p>Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane is expected to issue an order directing the mediation as early as May 1, 2023. The mediation process will be focused on the economic contribution of DCG to Genesis’ bankruptcy estate in order to bring resolution to its bankruptcy plan and benefit all creditors, including the Earn users of Gemini. While the mediation provides for a 30-day period, all parties are expected to work expeditiously as soon as the mediation process begins, given the upcoming maturing of a $630 million loan owed to Genesis by its parent firm DCG.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If DCG is unable to pay and/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations. So while the mediation is scheduled for up to 30 days, the parties are expected to work expeditiously towards agreement in the immediate window.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Gemini has clarified that it is supportive of the mediation process and looks forward to working with all parties to reach a resolution as soon as possible. The crypto exchange also expressed its frustration on record before Judge Lane regarding the pace of progress among the parties involved in Genesis’ restructuring efforts and emphasized the need for urgency.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp has issued a consent order to Cross River Bank.&nbsp;</li><li>The order directed the crypto-friendly bank to take corrective action and address its unsafe banking practices.&nbsp;</li><li>The FDIC issued the order on March 8 but it was made public on Friday.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/silvergate-si-stock-down-11-with-u-s-fdic/">FDIC</a>) has reportedly issued a consent order to New Jersey-based Cross River Bank. The bank is widely regarded as a crypto-friendly institution that caters to several businesses operating in the crypto space including crypto exchange Coinbase and USD Coin issuer Circle. </p>



<h2><strong>Cross River Bank: Consent Order Will Have No Impact On Growth</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-28/cross-river-bank-receives-fdic-enforcement-order-over-lending" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the FDIC issued a cease and desist order to Cross River Bank over alleged “unsafe and unsound” banking practices related to fair-lending laws. The consent order was issued on March 8, 2023, but was made public on Friday. The FDIC alleged that the crypto-friendly bank failed to maintain internal controls, information systems, and prudent credit underwriting practices. A spokesperson for the bank clarified that the order was the result of a standard review and had nothing to do with its crypto-related business. </p>



<p>As per the order, Cross River Bank has agreed to address the concerns related to its practices and improve internal controls. However, the bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing. A spokesperson for the bank stated that the order will have no “meaningful impact” on its growth. Several enhancements laid out by the FDIC in the order have already been completed by the bank. The bank’s board has agreed to increase supervision and oversight of controls and ensure that corrective actions are taken.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Importantly, the order does not identify discriminatory practices or anything that would require Cross River to compensate consumers for harm. Further, it places no limitations on our extensive existing Fintech Partnerships or the credit products we presently offer in partnership with them.” </p><cite>Cross River Bank spokesperson.</cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a cease and desist order to Coinme in relation to UpToken.</li><li>The securities regulator also imposed a fine of almost $4 million on the crypto firm and associated parties.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinme and Up Global were booked by the regulator for the unregistered and misleading offering of their UpToken.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-bittrex-violation-federal-laws/">SEC</a>) has imposed a multi-million dollar fine on the Seattle-based crypto giant Coinme and Up Global Inc. The fine settled an ongoing case related to the initial coin offering (ICO) of the crypto firm’s Ethereum-based UpToken back in 2017. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinme Fined For Unregistered ICO</strong></h2>



<p>According to an SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2023/33-11179.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a>, the cease and desist order was imposed as per the U.S. Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. The case dates back to 2017 when Coinme and its Up Global unit conducted a misleading ICO of their UpToken and raised more than $3.6 million. The funds were used by the crypto firm to expand its Bitcoin ATM network. The proceeds of the ICO were reportedly also for several other corporate purposes. </p>



<p>The SEC found that the UpToken issued by Coinme were sold as investment contracts and therefore securities as per the controversial Howey Test. The regulator cited the additional benefits that were made available to UpToken investors to strengthen its case against the firm. The firm was also accused of selling securities without registration and limiting the supply of its token to artificially inflate its demand. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Neil Bergquist was also named in the complaint. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>An UpToken investor would have had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a future profit from the rise in value of UpToken based upon Respondents’ efforts.” </p><cite>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinme reportedly submitted an offer of settlement in anticipation of enforcement actions from the securities regulator. As part of the settlement, a $3.52 million penalty was imposed on Up Global along with a $250,000 fine on Coinme. Ceo Neil Bergquist has also been ordered to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, bringing the total settlement to almost $4 million.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Crypto miner Core Scientific has signed a new hosting contract amid its bankruptcy proceedings.&nbsp;</li><li>The struggling miner has agreed to host nearly 18,000 BTC mining rigs from three firms.</li><li>The new contracts will bring the mining firm’s total mining rigs to over 220,000.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The latest development in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/core-scientific-nydig-settle-38-m-debt/">Core Scientific</a>’s bankruptcy case saw the struggling crypto miner sign a series of new hosting contracts to host thousands of bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs. The Texas-based crypto mining firm has negotiated three new hosting contracts to host nearly 18,000 BTC mining rigs.</p>



<h2><strong>Core Scientific Stock Surges 7% Following News Contract Signings</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230428005272/en/Core-Scientific-Signs-Hosting-Contracts-with-Three-Public-Companies-During-Reorganization-%E2%80%93-Maintains-Industry-Position-as-One-of-North-America%E2%80%99s-Largest-Bitcoin-Miners" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by Core Scientific, the Bitcoin mining firm has signed new hosting contracts with three companies. It will host 6914 mining rigs for Greenidge Generation Holdings, 10,000 mining rigs for Ault Alliance, and 1021 mining rigs for LM Funding. The firm will host the mining units at its facilities in Georgia, Kentucky, and Texas. The new hosting contracts demonstrate its status quo as a leader in the Bitcoin mining industry despite being in the midst of Chapter 11 proceedings. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The signing of these agreements are illustrative of Core Scientific’s industry leading hosting and mining capabilities and the strong demand for our services within our world class mining facilities.” </p><cite>Russell Cann, Head of Mining at Core Scientific. </cite></blockquote>



<p>The combined computing power of 17,935 units amounts to 1.88 exahashes per second and requires approximately 55 megawatts of data center rack space. As of now, 900 LM Funding units and 3,000 Ault Alliance units are already in operation and are actively hashing. An additional 121 LM Funding rigs will become operational by the end of April. By May, 7,000 Ault Alliance units and 6,914 Greenidge rigs will go online and begin hashing.</p>



<p>The new hosting contracts have had a considerable impact on Core Scientific’s share price (CORZQ). Its stock surged by nearly 7% following the news, reaching as high as $0.41 earlier today. The bankrupt mining firm’s stock was trading at $0.38 at the time of writing. Earlier this month the firm’s bankruptcy estate appointed investment banker Adam Sullivan as the firm’s new president. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Alex Pertsev published on Twitter for the first time in over nine months after Dutch authorities arrested him for facilitating money laundering through crypto mixer Tornado Cash.</li><li>Pertsev was released on home arrest last week pending an investigative hearing on May 24.</li><li>“Sorry I was afk for a while, what did I miss?”, he tweeted after spending months in prison in the Netherlands.</li></ul>



<p>Blockchain developer Alex Pertsev <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_pertsev/status/1651961639388815363?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/alex_pertsev/status/1651961639388815363?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published</a> on Twitter for the first time in over nine months after Dutch authorities arrested him in August. </p>



<p>“Sorry I was afk for a while, what did I miss?”, Pertsev wrote today. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry I was afk for a while, what did I miss? 👀</p>&mdash; Alexey Pertsev (@alex_pertsev) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_pertsev/status/1651961639388815363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>Tornado Cash Developer Arrested</h2>



<p>The Dutch financial crime authority (FIOD) issued arrest orders on the suspicion that Pertsev laundered more than 500,000 ETH through sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash. At current prices, Dutch prosecutors claimed Pertsev laundered nearly a billion dollars in crypto, per details of his arrest in August 2020. </p>



<p>Pertsev remained in Dutch detention as a judge denied him bail on at least one occasion. Prosecutors argued that the Tornado Cash developer had access to caches of digital assets and posed a flight risk. The court was also told that Pertsev could destroy evidence if released. </p>



<h2>Pertsev Free On House Arrest Pending Trial</h2>



<p>Last week, a Dutch court ordered his <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dutch-court-tornado-cash-alexey-pertsev/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dutch-court-tornado-cash-alexey-pertsev/" rel="noreferrer noopener">release</a> until an investigative hearing scheduled for May 24. Pertsev will have to wear an ankle monitor and cannot leave the property. Dutch authorities also installed surveillance systems to keep an eye on Pertsev until the trial. </p>



<p>His lawyers said more effort will go into defense after a Dutch judge previously turned down motions for his early release. The arrest and delayed release was followed by criticism from the crypto community over whether open-source coding should attract criminal investigations.</p>



<h2>War On Crypto Mixers</h2>



<p>Global regulators have seemingly gone after crypto mixers that allow users to obfuscate the origin of their transactions. Apart from sanctions against Tornado Cash, law enforcement also seized  $46 million from crypto tumbler ChipMixer.</p>

<p>The statement issued by the company notes that external transfers will be subject to network fees.

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Binance is set to restart operations in Japan&#8217;s crypto market after acquiring licensed trading venue Sakura in November 2022.</li><li>The Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC) which currently supports 11 trading pairs will cut its services on May 31 and rebrand to &#8220;Binance Japan&#8221;.</li><li>Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s company will re-enter Japan five years after exiting the country due to regulatory pressure in 2018.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto&#8217;s largest centralized trading venue Binance is set to <a href="https://sebc.co.jp/23042801_notice/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sebc.co.jp/23042801_notice/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">resume</a> operations in Japan after acquiring a locally regulated Bitcoin exchange in November last year and exiting the country five years prior due to regulatory pressure. </p>



<p>News of the platform moving for a crypto license emerged earlier in September last year as previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-crypto-license-japan/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-crypto-license-japan/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</p>



<h2>Exit Sakura, Enter Binance!</h2>



<p>Binance will reclaim a foothold in Japan&#8217;s crypto scene through its acquisition of the licensed platform Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC). The deal happened in late 2022 as part of the company&#8217;s global expansion strategy. Per reports, Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s scooped up 100% equity in SEBC. </p>



<p>The purchase means that CZ&#8217;s company can now operate as a Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) regulated entity after June 2023, complying with the watchdog&#8217;s policies. First, SEBC will terminate its current services on May 31. </p>



<p>After that, Sakura will rebrand to Binance Japan. This will finalize the deal and cement the company&#8217;s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-returns-japan-sakura-exchange/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-returns-japan-sakura-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-entry</a> into the Japanese market. </p>



<p>SEBC CEO Hitomi Yamamoto expressed his delight regarding the deal and rebrand, saying that Binance’s strong compliance system would contribute to building a more compliant atmosphere for users in Japan and that the acquisition would assist users in gaining access to crypto services needed for mass adoption in the future. </p>



<p>SEBC offers brokerage and consultation services to its customers with support for 11 trading pairs. It&#8217;s unclear if the new platform will be allowed to list new tokens given Japan&#8217;s strict token listing rules. </p>



<p>Japan has a high regulatory bar for crypto exchanges. It requires the segregation of customer and exchange assets, with most exchange assets to be kept in cold wallets and customers&#8217; fiat to be kept by a Japanese trust company or bank trust. Listing tokens on exchanges in Japan requires vetting by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association.</p>



<h2>Binance Global Expansion</h2>



<p>Binance has been on a mission to widen its global reach. Recently, has been able to secure an active license in France, Italy, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-wins-vasp-license-from-spains-central-bank/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-wins-vasp-license-from-spains-central-bank/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spain</a>, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, New Zealand, Poland, Lithuania, and Cyprus. </p>



<p>Re-entry into Japan will mark the 12th nation where regulators have officially sanctioned operations for CZ&#8217;s company. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>South Africa-based Cornelius Johannes Steynberg was fined $3.4 billion for running an unregistered Bitcoin commodity pool operation, the CFTC announced in a Thursday statement.</li><li>Steynberg founded Mirror Trading International (MTI), a BTC pool operator that illegally accepted $1.7 billion from 23,000 U.S. citizens while operating out of SA.</li><li>The news marks the largest civil monetary penalty ever won in the history of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, America&#8217;s commodities watchdog.</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission was <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8696-23" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8696-23" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">awarded</a> $3.4 billion in penalties in a case against South African-based bitcoin operator Mirror Trading International (MTI) and its founder Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, a U.S. court ruled. </p>



<p>CFTC prosecutors first slammed MTI and founder Steynberg with fraud allegations in June 2022 amid multiple failures in the broader crypto industry. Before, Steynberg had been arrested in Brazil a year prior and detained since last 2021. The MTI founder is also a fugitive wanted by authorities in his home country South Africa.</p>



<p>The commodities regulator alleged that Steynberg used MTI to collect 29,421 BTC from 23,000 without registering with any watchdog in the U.S.  At the time, the sum was valued at a massive $1.7 billion. </p>



<p>According to the U.S. court ruling, Steynberg&#8217;s MTI is liable for retail forex fraud. The founder himself was found guilty of fraud and failing to align his company with commodity pool operator (CPO) rules. </p>

<h2>CFTC Crypto Crackdown</h2>



<p>The ruling marks the biggest civil monetary penalty ever won by the CFTC in its history. Also, the news comes amid a supposed joint operation among U.S. regulators geared towards cracking down on unregistered crypto businesses in the country. </p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly carried out a raid at the residence of former FTX executive Ryan Salame. Salame was a part of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-lost-50-million-joked/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>’s inner circle and served as one of his top advisors before the collapse of his crypto exchange in November last year. The raid has become the latest development in the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation into FTX’s collapse.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Purpose Of Raid At Former FTX Exec’s Home Unclear</h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/ftx-ryan-salame-sam-bankman-fried.html" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a>, FBI agents reached Salame’s house in Potomac, Maryland earlier today to carry out a search. People familiar with the matter revealed that Salame&#8217;s legal representative had handed over information related to his political campaign finance activity ahead of today&#8217;s raid. The purpose of the raid is unclear at this time. Salame, who served as Co-Chief Executive Officer of FTX Digital Markets, has not yet been charged or accused of any wrongdoing, unlike other former executives like Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang who were charged in connection with the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. </p>



<p>Ryan Salame came under scrutiny last year after his firm filed for bankruptcy. Regulators and lawmakers paid particular attention to the millions of dollars he spent on political contributions during his stint at the crypto exchange. Salame reportedly spent more than $24 million during last year’s midterm elections. The majority of these funds were contributed to Republican candidates, unlike Bankman-Fried who spent well over $50 million to back Democratic candidates and PACs. Prosecutors have claimed the funds for these political contributions were misappropriated from customers of the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase has formally responded to the Wells Notice issued by the SEC last month.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Brian Armstrong has urged the regulator to not choose litigation and find a path forward through dialogue.&nbsp;</li><li>Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal categorically rejected the allegations made by the SEC regarding breach of securities laws.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange is willing to defend itself vigorously in court if the SEC chooses to litigate.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase has formally responded to the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-stock-drops-11-wells-notice-sec/">Wells notice</a> issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of the American crypto giant, has urged the securities regulator to work together to find a path forward through dialogue instead of choosing to litigate. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal reiterated that the crypto exchange does not list securities. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Will Defend Itself Vigorously In Litigation</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase submitted its <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-responds-to-the-secs-wells-notice" rel="nofollow noopener">response</a> to the SEC in the form of a video and a 73-page <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/2pW56ln6rPJ7koLHlu2L8G/5041e0166c408698b621fde543539d76/2023-04-19_Coinbase_Wells_Submission.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a>. The Wells notice was issued by the regulator to allow the exchange to offer its explanation for the allegations of securities law violations. In the response, Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal categorically rejected the allegations made by the regulator. He also stressed on the fact that the exchange’s fundamental business hadn’t changed since 2021 when the SEC reviewed it before allowing the company to become publicly listed. </p>



<p>Grewal also questioned the basis on which the securities regulator asserted jurisdiction over the crypto exchange, given that SEC Chair Gary Gensler himself testified in 2021 that his agency did not have regulatory authority over crypto exchanges. The Chief Legal Officer highlighted that since Congress had introduced no new legislation between the testimony and the Wells notice, there was no basis for the SEC to claim jurisdiction and charge Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A Wells notice to the company at this stage is not constructive and its not in America’s interest. There are many aspects of the current rules which are not clear for operating a crypto business in the U.S.” </p><cite>Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. </cite></blockquote>



<p>Both executives made it clear that the company is prepared to defend itself vigorously in court if the SEC chooses to go the litigation path. CEO Brian Armstrong warned that litigation would put the agency’s own actions on trial. The executives agreed that the constructive solution would be to address all regulatory concerns through dialogue in order to find a path forward.&nbsp;</p>
