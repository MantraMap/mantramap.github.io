According to a recent report by Santiment, investors are actively depositing ETH to various crypto exchanges, and this activity has reached its highest level in the past eight months.  While this trend may suggest a growing interest in the cryptocurrency, it also indicates that the price of ETH may experience surging volatility in the near future. As more investors deposit their ETH into exchanges, this influx of supply may impact the demand and cause fluctuations in the market.  In other words, the surge in active ETH deposits may be a harbinger of potential price turbulence, which could impact investors&#8217; portfolios.

This metric suggests that the longer the meme season persists, the more ETH will be burned, which could positively impact ETH holders, regardless of their stance on meme coins. -Featured image from Macro Hive
