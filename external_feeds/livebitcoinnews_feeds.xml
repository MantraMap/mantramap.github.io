<li>Bitcoin cash price started a fresh decline below the $125 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below the $120 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $120 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $120 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining below the $125 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-29250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could extend losses if there is a close below $115.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $130 and $132 resistance levels. BCH formed a high near $136.18 and started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $126.00 and $125.00 support levels. The pair even declined below the $120 support. It tested the $112 level. A low is formed near $111.66 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $136.18 swing high to the $111.66 low.</p>
<p>Besides, it is trading below the $120 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-bulls-struggle-to-keep-bch-in-bullish-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance is near the $118.80 level. The next key resistance is near $120.</p>
<p>There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $120 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair. The main resistance is now forming near $124 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $136.18 swing high to the $111.66 low.</p>
<p>Any more gains above $120 and $124 could set the pace for a move toward the $132 level. If there is a move above the $132 resistance, the price could rise toward the $136 zone.</p>
<p>If not, the price might continue lower below $115. Immediate support on the downside is near the $114 zone. The next major support is near the $112 level, below which the bears might aim for $100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP – the native digital token of crypto firm Ripple – <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/22/xrp-cryptocurrency-jumps-as-investors-hope-ripple-will-win-sec-case.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">experienced a sharp price hike</a> in late March after several investors and fans felt they had reason to believe Ripple could potentially win its ongoing court case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2>Could Ripple Beat the SEC?</h2>
<p>The SEC has made a habit out of attacking virtually every single digital currency company over the last six or seven years. The agency is going after every firm that took part in token offerings or provided interest or other rewards through token investments. The idea is that these tokens are securities, and thus the firms in question did not follow present SEC regulations when issuing said currencies to traders.</p>
<p>One of the companies that the SEC has been targeting hard over the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-is-looking-to-file-legal-action-against-ripple/" data-wpel-link="internal">past few years is Ripple</a>. Many crypto investors pointed out a supplemental notice issued by Monica Long – the current president of Ripple – saying that she and her fellow executives are very hopeful that the SEC case will result in a win for the digital currency firm. She confirmed in the notice that the “facts and the law” were on the side of Ripple, and that she doesn’t believe the ruling judge will take the side of the SEC.</p>
<p>Following these comments, XRP – which at the time, was at around 45 cents – rose by a whopping 20 percent. Vijay Ayyar – vice president of international crypto exchange Luno – said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, crypto markets have rallied in the past week or so given the anticipation of a pause or slowdown in interest rates and the slowdown in inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a separate statement, Long commented on why she thinks Ripple has a strong chance of being victorious. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re seeing action through enforcement versus setting clear rules and regulation, which is what all of us in the industry desire. Europe is really emerging as a leader in setting really clear regulations and rules that allow crypto companies and also traditional finance to embrace crypto.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the more recent crypto firms to have been victimized by the SEC was trading platform Kraken, stationed in Northern California. The <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">company was forced</a> to part with a $30 million penalty fee and end all its staking services and activities.</p>
<h2>Gary Gensler on Kraken</h2>
<p>Regarding that scenario, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a handful of tokens that have registered. The intermediaries, the storefronts if you wish, the casinos that people are investing in and investing at need to properly comply and disentangle these bundled products. If this field has any chance of survival and success, it’s time-tested rules and laws to protect the investing public.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ripple should feel confident that the SEC is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/could-grayscale-actually-defeat-the-sec-in-court/" data-wpel-link="internal">also slated to lose</a> its case with Grayscale, a BTC trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An elderly man living in the East Lyme region of Connecticut <a href="https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/cryptocurrency-scam-east-lyme-senior-citizen-theft-17850657.php" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">has allegedly lost more</a> than $60,000 in crypto to scammers at the time of writing. Police are now investigating to understand what happened.</p>
<h2>East Lyme Resident Loses a Lot of Cash and Crypto</h2>
<p>Michael Finkelstein – chief of the East Lyme Police Department – says crypto scams have become constant issues in his state, and that his department heads are receiving calls almost on a regular basis from people who believe they have lost money or been victimized. He commented in a recent interview that the $60,000 sum in question has been the largest thus far. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The East Lyme Police Department urges residents to always keep themselves and their accounts safe, and use extreme caution when contacted and told to provide any funding to individuals. We are hopeful that continuing to shine a light on these constant scams will help keep our residents safe.</p></blockquote>
<p>A relative of the victim is alleged to have gotten in touch with East Lyme police to let them know about what was going on. Right now, the identity of the victim has not been revealed. He is only being referred to as a “senior citizen in the community” in documents pertaining to the matter. The relative said that the man had received a call from someone claiming that fraudulent charges had appeared on his bank statements.</p>
<p>From there, the man was transferred to a second person who claimed to be an attorney. The person then gave the victim instructions on how he could send a payment to settle the charges. He had to withdraw a certain amount of money without telling anyone, then travel to a nearby bitcoin ATM and convert the cash to crypto. The money could then be uploaded to a digital wallet and sent to the attorney (aka the scammer).</p>
<p>As much as $60,000 was converted into BTC. There is good news in that members of the investigating police force were able to recover about $40K, though there’s still another $20K to go. Finkelstein said cases like these tend to be difficult in that most crypto is not recoverable once it’s sent. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>In so many of these cases, life savings are stolen and not recoverable.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This Happens Way Too Much</h2>
<p>Crypto scams have become extremely prominent in recent years. Many of them take on the form of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a>, in which hackers target those looking for love online. Once they find people they feel they can victimize, they get to know them well enough that they can convince them to invest in phony crypto platforms.</p>
<p>Once they do, they begin to see returns, though problems arise when they try to make withdrawals, and they’re often unable to get their funds back unless they invest even more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s really behind the sudden rise of bitcoin? The world’s number one digital currency has had a very successful 2023 thus far, spiking by as much as $12,000 in the last three months, but while it’s easy to assume that the asset is on the rise strictly because of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-just-got-higher-and-higher-in-mid-march/" data-wpel-link="internal">banking failures</a> in America, some analysts believe the truth is <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2023-03-22/analysis-whats-behind-bitcoins-latest-surge" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more complicated</a> than that.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Really Moving Up This Year</h2>
<p>Not long ago, bitcoin reached a new <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">nine-month high of $28,000</a>. While this wasn’t where the currency stood in November of 2021 (during that time, bitcoin hit a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit), things are starting to look up for the currency, especially when one considers how bad 2022 really was.</p>
<p>During that year, the crypto space lost more than $2 trillion in valuation. This was due, in part, to major assets such as BTC losing as much as 70 percent of their overall values, and many investors wound up on the losing side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>So, the big question is, “What’s fueling these present gains?” Noelle Acheson, an economist that’s been tracking the crypto sector for the past seven years, says that indeed the banking failure of America is largely behind the rise, though there are smaller aspects within that realm that seem to be contributing as well.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, she said central bank hikes are more the reason for the sudden spikes along with the fact that credit costs are nearing their peak. This is causing a lot of people to turn their backs on centralized financial services and find alternative methods of investing and garnering capital, and bitcoin is becoming a major answer for several of them. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The macro narrative is the number one. Bitcoin is not just a risk asset; it is arguably the most sensitive to monetary liquidity out of all of the risk assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also said bitcoin is still greatly propelled by a belief that it will someday fulfill the prophecy of pushing credit cards, checks, and fiat currencies to the side and serve as the ultimate payment method.</p>
<p>Other analysts are rather dismissive of the idea that BTC is doing well because banks are not. Usman Ahmad – CEO of Zodia Markets – explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s rather narrow-minded to say that bitcoin is going to succeed because a bank failed, but confidence is almost a critical factor. Confidence in the banking system has been damaged.</p></blockquote>
<h2>There Are Many Investors Playing Important Roles</h2>
<p>Zhong Yang Chan – head of research at Coin Gecko – also threw his two cents into the mix, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent bull run looks to be mainly supported by individual investors, ranging from retail to whales, as we have seen evidence of institutions exiting during this rally.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Isle of Man, Apr. 27, 2023 </strong>&#8212; Today, FUN Token signed an undisclosed deal with DWF Labs that will support the vision of decentralizing the online casino space.</p>
<p>FUN Token is a leading gaming token with over 350,000 users. It is backed by FreeBitco.in, the biggest Bitcoin faucet in the world with over 51 million crypto-savvy users.</p>
<p>FUN Token is preparing to launch a revamped version of the XFUN Wallet – the flagship product of the FUN ecosystem. The XFUN Wallet is an innovative multi-asset non-custodial wallet that can store a wide range of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs.</p>
<p>The XFUN Wallet allows users to effortlessly exchange FUN Token for XFUN – the utility token of the ecosystem based on the Polygon blockchain. XFUN enables quicker, more cost-effective transactions while facilitating enhanced scalability.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the XFUN Wallet allows players to retain control of their funds. This technology eliminates intermediaries and enables users to play straight from the wallet. The XFUN Wallet is already integrated into several gaming platforms, including Dplay Casino, XFUN Casino, XFUN.bet, and XFUN Arcade.</p>
<p>FUN Token also employs advanced escrowing and token-burning practices to maintain the token’s deflationary character. The company is committed to utilizing 50% of its net gaming revenue to burn tokens quarterly.</p>
<p>FUN Token seeks to expand its ecosystem by bringing the technology to more casinos, exchanges, payment gateways, and platforms. They will soon release final upgrades to the XFUN API, a tool that allows third-party dApps to integrate seamlessly into the XFUN ecosystem.</p>
<h4>About FUN Token</h4>
<p>FUN Token’s objective is simple – harnessing the power of blockchain tech to create “trustless” gaming ecosystems that users can rely on and operators can implement seamlessly.</p>
<p>FUN Token is backed by the best in the business – FreeBitco.in is committed to fueling FUN Token’s efforts of making non-custodial gaming an industry standard.</p>

<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1.080 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $1.08 and $1.10 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $1.12 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-29250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to recover if there is a clear move above $1.080.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, EOS price saw a steady decline from the $1.25 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $1.20 and $1.15 levels to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The decline gained pace below the $1.10 level. It even spiked below $1.00. A low is formed near $0.9747 and the price is now consolidating losses. EOS is trading well below $1.10 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-upsides-could-be-limited-above-1-15-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $1.050 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2978 swing high to the $0.9747 low. The first major resistance is near the $1.08 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1.080 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $1.080 level could start a steady increase toward the $1.10 level. The next major resistance might be $1.135 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2978 swing high to the $0.9747 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.15 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near $1.00. The next key support is near the $0.975 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.975 support, the price could test the $0.920 support in the near term.</p>

<p><em>Litecoin price is struggling below $92 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-29250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. LTC price could continue to decline if it stays below the $92 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past 2-3 sessions, there were swing moves in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-revisits-key-support-but-struggles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-turns-red-below-0-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple</a>, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC started a fresh decline from the $104 zone.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $100 and $98 support levels. Besides, there was a break below a key rising channel with support near $96 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. The pair even broke the $92 support and tested the $84 zone.</p>
<p>A low is formed near $84.21 and the price is now rising. There was a move above the 50% % Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $94.01 swing high to the $84.21 low.</p>

<p>The next major resistance sits near the $92 level. The main resistance is near the $94 level. A clear move above the $94 level could pump the price toward the $98 level or even $100. The next major resistance could be $105.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $86.50 level. The next key support is near the $84.20 level. If there is a downside break below the $84.20 support, the price could accelerate lower toward the $80 level in the near term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is going after Justin Sun of Tron <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/22/sec-hits-jake-paul-lindsey-lohan-justin-sun-with-crypto-violations.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">fame and a wide array</a> of celebrities he hired to at one point, serve either as promoters or brand ambassadors for the company.</p>
<h2>The SEC Is Going After Tron</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, securities fraud charges have been filed against Tron, the famed crypto company. In addition, several well-known figures – including musician Lindsay Lohan and internet personality Jake Paul – have been caught up in the case. The agency alleges that Sun engaged in fraud by manipulating the activity of various tokens. He thus created the image that valid and real trading was occurring when, in fact, it was not.</p>
<p>The company is also under the SEC’s gaze for taking part in an unregistered token offering. SEC chair Gary Gensler commented in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>This case demonstrates again the high-risk investors face when crypto asset securities are offered and sold without proper disclosure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, the tokens that are alleged to have been part of Sun’s “infamous” scheme are TRX and BTT. Gensler continued his statement by commenting that Sun orchestrated a “promotional campaign in which he and his celebrity promoters hid the fact that the celebrities were paid for their tweet[s].&#8221;</p>
<p>This is something we have seen time and time again not just from the SEC, but from financial agencies around the world. One such case recently occurred with reality star Kim Kardashian, who failed to reveal that her promotion of a new <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/kim-kardashian-settles-with-the-sec-over-ethereum-max-promotion/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency called Ethereum Max</a> was not done out of her own goodwill. Rather, she had received compensation to promote the asset, something she was required to tell all her fans and followers.</p>
<p>Many of the celebrities in question have already agreed to settle with the SEC. Several will forfeit as much as $400,000 in disgorgement, interest, and penalty fees to alleviate the charges. However, some – such as Soulja Boy – are fighting back and refusing to give in. It’s unclear what their chances in court are.</p>
<p>The celebrities were under contract to promote both TRX and BTT on social media and in Tron-affiliated Discord and Telegram channels. Gurbir Grewal – SEC enforcement chief – commented that Tron was at the center of an “age-old playbook to mislead and harm investors.” He further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the same time, Sun paid celebrities with millions of social media followers to tout the unregistered offerings, while specifically directing that they [do] not disclose their compensation. This is the very conduct that the federal securities laws were designed to protect against regardless of the labels Sun and others used.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Kraken Is the Latest Victim</h2>
<p>The SEC has been at the heart of several crypto-related takedowns as of late, a recent one being Kraken.</p>
<p>The company was forced to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">part with $30 million</a> and cease all its staking services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of crypto hackers have drained all the coins <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/hackers-drain-bitcoin-atms-of-1-5-million-by-exploiting-0-day-bug/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">and funds from several bitcoin</a> ATMs throughout the world hosted by a company called General Bytes.</p>
<h2>General Bytes Loses a Lot of Money</h2>
<p>The hackers took advantage of what’s referred to as a zero-day vulnerability to prevent all transaction losses from being reversed. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/general-bytes/" data-wpel-link="internal">General Bytes</a> explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The night of 17-18 March was the most challenging time for us and some of our clients. The entire team has been working around the clock to collect all data regarding the security breach and is continuously working to resolve all cases to help clients back online and continue to operate their ATMs as soon as possible. We apologize for what happened and will review all our security procedures and are currently doing everything we can to keep our affected customers afloat.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a separate post, the company explained how it was that the hackers were able to gain control of the machines and flee with so much money:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. The attacker identified a security vulnerability in the master service interface the BATMs use to upload videos to the CAS. 2. The attacker scanned the IP address space managed by cloud host Digital Ocean to identify running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other BATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean. 3. Exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker uploaded the Java application directly to the application server used by the admin interface. The application server was, by default, configured to start applications in its deployment folder.</p></blockquote>
<p>General Bytes has since told its customers that from here on out, it will no longer be managing CASes on behalf of its users. In other words, terminal holders will be required to manage all future servers themselves. Right now, the company is in the middle of collecting data from customers so it can get an idea of what their individual losses were. The firm is also cooperating with federal officials on the matter and performing an internal investigation to better understand what occurred.</p>
<h2>Trying to See What Happened</h2>
<p>Managers of General Bytes said they were extremely disturbed and surprised by the incident given the company has undergone “multiple security audits” over the past two years, and vulnerabilities such as the one that the hackers exploited have never been noticed in the past. The enterprise is presently contacting third-party security firms to see about beefing up protection in the coming months.</p>
<p>The issue with most crypto-based ATMs is that the wallets stored within them are referred to as “hot wallets,” meaning they are directly connected to the internet. This makes them particularly vulnerable to cyberthieves who can manipulate code and APIs to gain access to said wallets and the funds contained within them.</p>
