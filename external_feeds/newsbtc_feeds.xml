					<description><![CDATA[Solana price has displayed a completely bearish price thesis on the one-day chart. In that same timeframe, the coin declined by close to 9%. The depreciation in value might continue as the technical outlook points in the same direction. With the recent Solana Protocol Raydium hack of over $2 million, the price of the coin has been affected further. Over the past week, the coin has shed nearly 10% of its value. As SOL fell from its long-standing support line of $13, the coin has been on a freefall. Demand for the altcoin has remained substantially low, with investor interest fading away. Investors have to be cautious as SOL continues to depict increased volatility over the past few weeks. For the bulls to return to the market, there are two important price levels that Solana has to breach. Trading volume in SOL declined, which is noted in the case of bearish price action. As volatility remains high, a further push from the sellers will push SOL below its immediate support line. The market capitalization of SOL depreciated, an indication that the coin is under bearish influence.

The Solana price broke off its consolidation when it fell below the $13 support line. For the bulls to be back, Solana has to turn the $13 price level into a support line again. Before doing that, the coin has to move past the $12.50 price mark. As the coin continues to register less demand, a further fall in value is on the chart. In that case, Solana will begin bidding at $11, then at $10.40. This will mean another 17% fall for the coin before it starts to note a price reversal. The amount of Solana traded in the last session declined, and that was a sign of bearishness on that chart. Technical Analysis Over the last few weeks, the altcoin was trying to capture buyers, but the price did not align with the bulls. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40-mark, close to the oversold and undervalued region. Usually, after this phenomenon, the coin attempts to reverse its value. In relation to buyers, the Solana price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, depicting slow demand for the altcoin. It meant that the bears were driving the price momentum in the market. According to the depiction of volatility, the technical indicators have sided with the idea of an explosive price action. The Bollinger Bands, which indicate price fluctuation and volatility, narrowed and were constricted, indicating that SOL was expecting a breakout. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence depicts price momentum and change. The indicator painted a red signal bar, which was tied to the sell signal for Solana price.

					<description><![CDATA[The Litecoin price has tanked further over the last 24 hours. On their respective charts, the prices of major altcoins reflect the price action of Bitcoin. As BTC slipped close to 3%, LTC also tanked nearly 8% on the daily chart. Recovery for Litecoin seems far-fetched from what the technical outlook suggests. A rise in Bitcoin&#8217;s price may help LTC for a while, but the altcoin&#8217;s demand must rise in order for the price to reverse. The short-term price thesis for LTC points towards continued lower price action. Since the coin has moved to a short-term low on its daily chart, the chance of a reversal cannot be fully negated either. For the past few weeks, the altcoin has been moving in a parallel channel, between $79 and $68 respectively. Investors had expected that LTC would break on the upside as BTC was attempting to register daily gains on its chart. Despite Litecoin moving above the $70 price mark, demand was not on the side of the bulls. This could mean that demand was lower at higher levels for Litecoin. On the other hand, market capitalization noted a slight uptick, which could also hint at the coin attempting to turn its price around.

The altcoin got to this price level after falling through the lower line of the parallel channel. Its current resistance mark would be at $70, breaching which the coin might face another setback at $74. As LTC continues to fall, the local support line for the altcoin was $66, falling through which LTC could halt at $56. This would cause the coin to lose another 15% of its value. The amount of Litecoin traded in the last session shot up, and that signified selling pressure intensifying on the chart. Technical Analysis As LTC broke below the lower band of the parallel channel, the buying strength could not sustain itself. The Relative Strength Index pierced through the half-line and stood near 40. This indicated that sellers were countering buyers at press time. In accordance with the same, the price of the altcoin was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. Moving below the 20-SMA meant that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The altcoin depicted that sellers were strong in the market. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence reads the price momentum and trend, painted red histograms. These red histograms were sell signals for the altcoin. The Aroon Indicator indicates a trend; as the blue line (Aroon down) crossed over the yellow line (Aroon down), it signals a downtrend for the Litecoin price.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana was scrutinized extensively after speculations appeared connecting it to the bankrupt FTX. The network&#8217;s perception of FTX was drastically altered by the occurrence, and the resulting fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) proved challenging to dispel. Almost 9% of the token&#8217;s value was wiped out today, perhaps because of the fallout from the exchange&#8217;s downfall,Â indicating a deepening bear market. In addition, the CryptoSlam data reveals that the NFT market in the ecosystem has been experiencing severe declines in trading volume and new buyers. DeFiLlama also reported that SOL&#8217;s TVL had dropped by another 10%. When compared to the all-time high in TVL in November of $1.02 billion, the current value of $265.43 million represents a staggering drop of 73.46%. Data from Messari, however, indicates that Solana is very much alive. Related Reading: Bitcoin Backpedals To $16,000 Level As Crypto Market Sheds $50 Billion Image: The Independent Getting Rid Of Security Bugs Messari&#8217;s latest coin report notes various activities, even if the ecosystem does not have a clearly articulated roadmap. For example, JumpCrypto is working on a C++ client for the token&#8217;s validator called Firedancer. Because of this, the impact of bugs on the Solana blockchain would be mitigated. However, such endeavors necessitate time to germinate and grow. At the moment, there are some security holes in Solana that should be fixed. The Solana DeFi protocol Raydium was compromised on December 16. This resulted in investors and traders losing approximately $2 million. This is expected toÂ diminish confidence in the token further. Contrary to these neutral and negative changes, Santiment data indicates that on-chain development activity is still quite robust.

In contrast, Solana&#8217;s native coin SOL stands in stark contrast to the ecosystem. As of the time of writing, the token has support at $11.83 and resistance at $14.98. The increased link between SOL and BTC could become problematic if Bitcoin&#8217;s market performance continues to deteriorate. As the US Federal Reserve prepares for a further hike in interest rates, macroeconomic considerations will also play a role. The future of Solana is looking bleak at the moment. But, hopefully, as the situation improves, FUD surrounding the ecosystem may diminish. However, if the existing status quo is not altered, SOL might fall to $10. The next few hours or days will be key for SOL&#8217;s price consolidation or capitulation to lower lows, therefore investors and traders should actively monitor the situation.]]></description>

When compared to the all-time high in TVL in November of $1.02 billion, the current value of $265.43 million represents a staggering drop of 73.46%.</p>
<p>Data from <a href="https://messari.io/report/solana-ecosystem-overview?referrer=asset:solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Messari,</a> however, indicates that Solana is very much alive.</p>

<h2>Getting Rid Of Security Bugs</h2>
<p>Messari&#8217;s latest coin <a href="https://messari.io/report/solana-ecosystem-overview?referrer=asset:solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a> notes various activities, even if the ecosystem does not have a clearly articulated roadmap. For example, <a href="https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JumpCrypto</a> is working on a C++ client for the token&#8217;s validator called Firedancer. Because of this, the impact of bugs on the Solana blockchain would be mitigated.</p>
<p>However, such endeavors necessitate time to germinate and grow. At the moment, there are some security holes in Solana that should be fixed.</p>
<p>The Solana DeFi protocol Raydium was compromised on December 16. This resulted in investors and traders losing approximately $2 million. This is expected toÂ diminish confidence in the token further.</p>
<p>Contrary to these neutral and negative changes, Santiment data indicates that on-chain development activity is still quite robust.</p>

<h2><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tm5OcOj5/" width="2047" height="979" /></h2>

<h2>Solana Token Needs More Kick</h2>
<p>It appears that the Solana Ecosystem is highly resilient due to the significant development activity and activities to enhance on-chain performance. In contrast, Solana&#8217;s native coin SOL stands in stark contrast to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, the token has support at $11.83 and resistance at $14.98. The increased link between SOL and BTC could become problematic if Bitcoin&#8217;s market performance continues to deteriorate.</p>
<p>As the US Federal Reserve prepares for a further hike in interest rates, macroeconomic considerations will also play a role.</p>
<p>The future of Solana is looking bleak at the moment. But, hopefully, as the situation improves, FUD surrounding the ecosystem may diminish. However, if the existing status quo is not altered, SOL might fall to $10.</p>
<p>The next few hours or days will be key for SOL&#8217;s price consolidation or capitulation to lower lows, therefore investors and traders should actively monitor the situation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[According to Santiment, the decentralized exchange Uniswap has not experienced any kind of recovery. Santiment recently tweeted that Uniswap is one of the outliers in the active addresses measure, indicating that the DEX&#8217;s native token UNI is underperforming relative to other cryptocurrencies. According to the data, the number of functioning IP addresses last increased when Uniswap introduced its NFT market aggregator following the acquisition of Genie, the pioneering NFT market aggregator. Address decline may indicate investors and traders have lost interest in the exchange. Chart: TradingView ðŸ“Š Several #altcoins are seeing big upticks in address activity and dormant wallets awakening to move their funds right now. Others are staying stuck in the mud, and are more likely to fall behind. Read our short take on $YFI, $REN, and $UNI. https://t.co/MI1HQaLUpy pic.twitter.com/sRSyiDvqVe â€” Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 15, 2022 Image: Forkast Negative Market Sentiment To summarize, Uniswapâ€™s network activity has been very unpleasant for investors on its native token. As of writing, UNI is down 2.4% with subsequent drops in the weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly timescales. This negative market sentiment can be seen on-chain. In the time after its release in November, the volume of NFT transactions processed by Uniswap&#8217;s marketplace aggregator has dropped significantly, as reported by Dune Analytics. Numbers show that there were only 39 recorded transactions today, down from 446 on November 30. That is a drop of 91.25%. This contradicts what Uniswap Labs COO Mary-Catherin &#8220;MC&#8221; Lader stated to Fortune in an interview. She stated that the NFTs&#8217; underlying technology is still in its infancy. Other proponents of the technology have utilized this reasoning. Whether or not the NFT business is in its infancy, data indicates that it is barely alive, with few customers and sellers, as seen by large declines in trade volume and sales.

The recent hike in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve adds to the strain. With the big cryptocurrencies also seeing value declines, UNI&#8217;s long-term prospects may worsen. In terms of pricing, the token appears to find support in the $5.2 range. What&#8217;s interesting is that UNI has a strong correlation with Bitcoin. This means that when Bitcoin appreciates, UNI will as well. The market will rebound as institutional interest in cryptocurrencies and digital assets in general grows. Short-term UNI bulls can benefit at the $6.5 price level. Nonetheless, investors and traders should continue to take prudence, as further rises in interest rates by the central bankÂ could result in market declines.]]></description>

<p>Numbers show that there were only 39 recorded transactions today, down from 446 on November 30. That is a drop of 91.25%.</p>
<p>This contradicts what Uniswap Labs COO Mary-Catherin &#8220;MC&#8221; Lader stated to Fortune in an <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/11/30/uniswap-nft-aggregator-acquiring-genie/?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=fortunemagazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview.</a> She stated that the NFTs&#8217; underlying technology is still in its infancy. Other proponents of the <a href="https://metfabtech.com/nft/nfts-arent-just-a-trend-theyre-still-in-their-infancy-beincrypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">technology</a> have utilized this reasoning.</p>
<p>Whether or not the NFT business is in its infancy, <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/nft-non-fungible-tokens/nft-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data</a> indicates that it is barely alive, with few customers and sellers, as seen by large declines in trade volume and sales.</p>

<h2>Incoming Headwinds</h2>
<p>In addition to the UNI NFT issue, the market has yet to recover from the FTX collapse. The recent hike in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve adds to the strain.</p>
<p>With the big cryptocurrencies also seeing value <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">declines</a>, UNI&#8217;s long-term prospects may worsen. In terms of pricing, the token appears to find support in the $5.2 range. What&#8217;s interesting is that UNI has a strong correlation with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This means that when Bitcoin appreciates, UNI will as well. The market will rebound as institutional interest in cryptocurrencies and digital assets in general grows. Short-term UNI bulls can benefit at the $6.5 price level.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, investors and traders should continue to take prudence, as further rises in interest rates by the central bankÂ could result in market declines.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The past few days have seen a decline in the price of crypto assets such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), with inflation and other macroeconomic factors in play, as other cryptocurrencies registered gains. Related Reading: Stablecoins Flow Into Spot Exchanges, Fuel For Christmas Bitcoin Rally? Macroeconomic factors have historically impacted crypto prices. Recently, the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) levels in the market were high, taking a toll on crypto and investor sentiment. Meanwhile, the Binance vs. Reuters tussle sparked a considerable amount of withdrawals from the exchange. However, anxiety is reducing, and normalcy has returned to the market. Bitcoin and other altcoins have recorded gains in the past 24 hours as the market looks to recover. But Shiba Inu has dipped in the last 24 hours, losing above 7% of its value to trade at $0.0000088. Whale Transfers Over 210 Billion SHIB Lookonchain, an on-chain analysis platform, reported that a whale transferred 207.2 billion SHIB tokens valued at $1.9 million to Binance. The transfer took place at 01:54 PM UTC. This whale also dumped close to 4 billion tokens in a 7-day timeframe pushing the sell-off figures to more than 210 billion. This transfer affected the price, making it lose 3% a few hours after the transfer. The ripple effect of this activity also caused the asset to fall below its support level by another 3%. The coin price decreased by 6% before the U.S. Federal Reserve revealed its rate hike decision. Whale In Control Of SHIB Price Momentum The controversial whale had moved 3.49 trillion SHIB for 2.37 ETH, valued at $2,233 via Uniswap in 2020. It spent 1.83 ETH on 2.27 trillion SHIB tokens and 1.22 trillion using the addresses 0x5952 and 0x92f2. The whale made its last purchase on February 9, 2021, and has only sold Shiba Inu since then for profit. After the token rallied in 2021, the whale took short positions for its holdings. Lookonchain places the total token sold by this whale since April 13, 2021, at 2.94 trillion SHIB. The whale will make close to $18.3 million if it sells at the current market price.

					<description><![CDATA[The Cardano price continued to depict a strong bearish influence in the market. The coin lost over 7% of its value over the last 24 hours. On a weekly time frame, ADA was down by 14%. The extended price pullback might continue, so investors should be wary of their next move. The ADA price was unsettled; the only way investors can make gains is to sell now and buy when the coin dips further, as it would recover lost gains by correcting itself. The technical outlook for the coin supported the bearish thesis and emphasized that ADA might nosedive below its local support line. The trading volume of Cardano also dipped, indicating that sellers have taken over the market. In case of a price correction, if ADA manages to move above the $0.30 price mark, then the bulls will make a comeback.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin long-term holders are dumping their coins as BTC plummets below the $17,000 level. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR Spikes Today As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, some BTC long-term holders seem to have taken profits in the past day. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio,&#8221; which tells us whether Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When this metric has a value greater than 1, it means the average holder has been moving their coins at some profit recently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market has been realizing some loss. Naturally, SOPR exactly equal to 1 implies that the investors are just breaking-even with their selling. Related Reading: Stablecoins Flow Into Spot Exchanges, Fuel For Christmas Bitcoin Rally? The &#8220;long-term holder&#8221; (LTH) group is a Bitcoin cohort that includes all investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago, without having moved or sold them from a single address. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR specifically for these LTHs during the last 15 days: Looks like the EMA16 value of the metric has shot up in the last few hours &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin LTH SOPR (EMA16) has observed a sharp spike above 1 during the past day. This means that these holders have harvested some profits today. Statistically, LTHs are the investors least likely to sell at any point, so any dumping from them can have noticeable consequences on the BTC market. Related Reading: End Of Litecoin Rally? LTC Plunges 7% In Last 24 Hours From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that when the indicator last saw such a large spike in its value, the price of the crypto had plunged down shortly after. Interestingly, the latest spike has only come after BTC has plunged down under $17k. Usually, such holders sell for profits during rallies, but here the dumping has come after the bullish momentum has already passed over. This could be a sign that with all the FUD going around in the market right now, these supposed diamond hands have also broken down and feel bearish about the prospects of Bitcoin at the moment. Such a trend is likely to be negative for the price, and might take the crypto even further lower. BTC Price The price of the coin seems to have slid down over the last few days &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView At the time of writing, Bitcoin&#8217;s price floats around $16.7k, down 2% in the last week.

<h2>Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR Spikes Today</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/639d668436ec775f4743924b-Price-crash-from-high-volatility-after-CPI-FOMC-then-spike-in-LTHSOPR" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">post</a>, some BTC long-term holders seem to have taken profits in the past day. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-capitulation-asopr-plunges-dec-2018-lows/">Spent Output Profit Ratio</a>,&#8221; which tells us whether Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now.</p>
<p>When this metric has a value greater than 1, it means the average holder has been moving their coins at some profit recently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market has been realizing some loss. Naturally, SOPR exactly equal to 1 implies that the investors are just breaking-even with their selling.</p>

<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-long-term-supply-regains-ath-conviction/">long-term holder</a>&#8221; (LTH) group is a Bitcoin cohort that includes all investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago, without having moved or sold them from a single address. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR specifically for these LTHs during the last 15 days:</p>

<p>As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin LTH SOPR (EMA16) has observed a sharp spike above 1 during the past day. This means that these holders have harvested some profits today. Statistically, LTHs are the investors least likely to sell at any point, so any dumping from them can have noticeable consequences on the BTC market.</p>

<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that when the indicator last saw such a large spike in its value, the price of the crypto had plunged down shortly after. Interestingly, the latest spike has only come after BTC has plunged down under $17k. Usually, such holders sell for profits during rallies, but here the dumping has come after the bullish momentum has already passed over.</p>
<p>This could be a sign that with all the <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-below-17000-mazars-binance-pause/">FUD</a> going around in the market right now, these supposed diamond hands have also broken down and feel bearish about the prospects of Bitcoin at the moment. Such a trend is likely to be negative for the price, and might take the crypto even further lower.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin&#8217;s price floats around $16.7k, down 2% in the last week. The above chart displays the trend in the value of the crypto over the last five days.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the past 24Â hours, Bitcoin has slid beneath the important support level of $17,000 as weekly bears have taken the driver&#8217;s seat.Â  The most popular cryptocurrency is presently selling at $16,723, a decrease of 2.5% over the past week. There has been significant selling pressure on the cryptocurrency market as a whole, resulting in a 6% correction and a $50 billion loss over the past 24 hours. As a result of the latest price decline, BTC has let go of all weekly gains and returned to the red zone. TradingView and Cointelegraph Markets Pro data followed BTC/USD as it reached multi-day lows on Bitstamp at $16,928. The pair reversed its entire advance to one-month highs in response to the most recent macroeconomic data and the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to raise interest rates. Similarly, the price of Ethereum has dropped more than 7% in the previous 24 hours, according to figures from CoinGecko. The second-largest cryptocurrency has decelerated during the past week, trading below $1,178. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the vast majority of the $117 million in leveraged positions that were wiped out throughout the entire cryptocurrency market.

Mazars Group, the auditor for Binance&#8217;s Proof-of-Reserves, severed ties with the exchange on Friday. In addition, the current crypto market decline mirrors Wall Street&#8217;s severe downturn.

					<description><![CDATA[Presently Japanese crypto firms pay a set 30% corporate tax rate on their holdings, regardless of whether or not they made a profit. Due to this stringent tax law over the past years, some local crypto firms reportedly chose to move their business elsewhere. Related Reading: Solana: This Minor Hiccup Didnâ€™t Discourage Investors From Acquiring SOL â€“ Until Today This development has impacted the country&#8217;s economic growth, and the LDP, having identified it as its primary task, wants to set things right. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan addresses issues with administrative reform and collaborates with the U.S. to enact defensive and foreign policies. The term Administrative Reform refers to multiple themes in the nation. An example of such themes is adopting measures like tax reform to stand the test of economic strain. Japan Set To Ease Stringent Tax Rules In line with its objectives to promote fast economic growth, the Japanese ruling party&#8217;s (LDP) tax committee held a meeting on December 15. The meeting was to deliberate on tax reforms. While at it, they approved an August-tabled proposal. The proposal seeks to remove taxes on crypto companiesâ€™ paper gains from issuance or custody tokens. The Japanese government seeks to ease tax requirements on domestic crypto firms to facilitate the growth of the tech and finance sectors. Submission of more lenient crypto tax laws to parliament will commence in January and will take effect in the next financial year beginning in April. LDP lawmaker and member of the Web3 policy office, Akihisa Shiozaki, spoke on the recent development in an interview with Bloomberg. Shiozaki noted that the move is a step forward in the economic reforms. He added that it would allow more companies to start token issuance businesses.

It also indicates that the current bearish trend in the crypto industry, including FTX&#8217;s crisis, did not affect its interest in blockchain technology. Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, hammered on the roles of NFTs, blockchain, and Metaverse in the county&#8217;s digital evolution in a statement in October. He cited practical examples using the digitization of national identity cards. In October, the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association announced plans to ease the strict screening process for listing tokens on exchanges. Kishida addressed this issue in June, asking the organization to loosen its stringent rules on the screening process. Some top leaders in the private sector also shared the same thoughts with the Prime Minister. On December 8, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMBC) announced an ongoing project to explore use cases of soulbound tokens (SBTs).

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the number of stablecoin transactions going into spot exchanges have risen recently, something that could help fuel a Christmas Bitcoin rally. Stablecoin Deposits To Spot Exchanges Have Shown Increasing Demand Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there has been an increasing demand on spot exchanges recently. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;stablecoin exchange depositing transactions,&#8221; which measures the total number of transfers involving these fiat-tied tokens that are heading towards exchanges. Investors usually use stablecoins whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with coins like Bitcoin. Once the holders feel the prices are right to re-enter into these volatile markets, they transfer their accumulated stables to exchanges for swapping them into their desired cryptocurrency. So, a large amount of these tokens entering into exchanges can act as buying pressure for other markets, and thus provide a bullish effect to the prices of Bitcoin and other assets. Unlike the normal inflow metric, which simply measures the total amount flowing into exchanges, this indicator paints an idea about the actual demand in the market since it counts individual transfers, which can&#8217;t be inflated by a few large investors as their transaction count will be much lesser than their inflow values.

<h2>Stablecoin Deposits To Spot Exchanges Have Shown Increasing Demand Recently</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/639c2bf24370fd07b6106528-Increasing-Spot-Exchange-Demand" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">post</a>, there has been an increasing demand on spot exchanges recently. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;stablecoin exchange depositing transactions,&#8221; which measures the total number of transfers involving these fiat-tied tokens that are heading towards exchanges.</p>
<p>Investors usually use <a href="https://newsbtc.com/stablecoin/whales-across-these-five-chains-are-heavy-on-stablecoins-should-you-be-too/">stablecoins</a> whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with coins like Bitcoin.

So, a large amount of these tokens entering into exchanges can act as buying pressure for other markets, and thus provide a bullish effect to the prices of Bitcoin and other assets.</p>
<p>Unlike the normal <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bullish-whale-exchange-inflows-down/">inflow</a> metric, which simply measures the total amount flowing into exchanges, this indicator paints an idea about the actual demand in the market since it counts individual transfers, which can&#8217;t be inflated by a few large investors as their transaction count will be much lesser than their inflow values.</p>

<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric, as well as the opposite one that keeps track of withdrawal transactions:</p>

<p>As the above graph shows, the stablecoin exchange depositing transactions metric has observed some growth recently, and at the same time, the withdrawing transactions have gone down instead. This means that there is demand to buy with stables right now, while there isn&#8217;t much interest in exiting from volatile markets using these fiat-tied tokens.</p>

<p>Such a situation has proved to be bullish for the price of Bitcoin in the last few months, as the previous instances of this trend in the chart display. &#8220;With the number of stablecoin deposits up-trending &amp; the number of stablecoin withdraws down-trending, the capitulation events could be reaching an end,&#8221; notes the quant.</p>
