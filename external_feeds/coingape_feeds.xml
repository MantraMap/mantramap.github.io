These charges come just a few short weeks after Eisenberg, aka Mango Avi, was arrested by the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> Department of Justice (DOJ) on charges that were particularly similar.</p>
<h2>CFTC Sues Mango Markets Exploiter</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66707334/1/unknown-case-title/" rel="nofollow">lawsuit</a> filed on Monday, Eisenberg engaged in &#8220;manipulation of a swap&#8221; for his part in abusing Mango Markets in October and allegedly used a deceitful method to influence the price of the MNGO token through fraudulent swaps. After a trader used numerous accounts to buy, sell, and hedge the price of the MNGO token, more than $100 million in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> was stolen from the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/">decentralized exchange.</a></p>
<p>According to the recent complaint, CFTC&#8217;s exact words were:</p>
<blockquote><p>A manipulative and deceptive scheme to artificially inflate the price of swaps offered by Mango Markets.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Eisenberg&#8217;s Trades Under Scanner</h2>
<p>Eisenberg had claimed that he and his team had orchestrated an extremely profitable trading strategy and later would give some of the money back to Mango. However,  his tweets indicated that he felt the activities were within the law and completely legal.  But, around two months later, he was detained by the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/u-s-department-of-justice/">Justice Department</a> on allegations of market manipulation.</p>
<p>Eisenberg specifically managed to increase the value of the native MNGO <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/">crypto token</a> relative to the stablecoin <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/usd-coin-usdc/">USDC</a> by purchasing the small-cap token in bulk. As a result, its price increased by 1,300% in October. Eisenberg and his crew were subsequently able to utilize the inflated MNGO as collateral for additional USDC loans.</p>
<p>In the wake of <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy</a>, the CFTC is coming under increasing amounts of scrutiny. The government organization and its respective commissioners were on board with FTX&#8217;s efforts to lobby Congress for a measure that would expand the body&#8217;s regulatory authority over the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">cryptocurrency market</a> prior to the exchange&#8217;s demise.</p>

In spite of the catastrophic market slump in 2022, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> has held up far better than most of the leading assets on the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>. Dogecoin has now begun to attract the interest of large crypto whales, which has resulted in a price increase of more than 10% over the course of the last twenty-four hours.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin&#8217;s Massive Whale Interest</h2>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WhaleStatsBSC/status/1612375026002530305" rel="nofollow">data</a> published by the crypto analytical portal WhaleStats, Dogecoin is one of the top 10 tokens that whales on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have accumulated in the past 24 hours. The platform further tweeted that <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/">XRP</a>, Filecoin (FIL), and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/luna-2-0/">Terra (Luna)</a> were also among the few cryptocurrencies that made it to the list.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></em></p>
<p>This has propelled the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin&#8217;s</a> trading volume to zoom past 300% in a day with the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/">market capitalization</a> also rising by 8% to $10.3 billion. Currently, DOGE ranks 9th and is the market leader for the memecoin sector.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Surge</h2>
<p>Even during the first and second weeks of December 2022, the most popular token purchased by BSC whales was still the community favorite Dogecoin. This <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/#:~:text=Whale%20accumulation%20is%20the%20term,or%20gathered%20by%20a%20wallet.">whale accumulation</a> trend continued throughout the entirety of the month. According to the data from the first week of December, the 100 hundred largest investors on BSC held a combined total of 97 million Dogecoins in their wallets. In a similar fashion, the BSC whales had a collection of more than 80 million DOGE tokens with a value of $7.3 million during the second week of December.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that during the week leading up to Christmas in 2022, the memecoin climbed to the position of being the most traded digital asset among the top 100 BNB holders. It&#8217;s speculated that Christmas greetings from <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/elon-musk/">Twitter CEO Elon Musk</a> were the cause of the unexpected increase in the trading volume, which resulted in a total of 347,240 tokens being traded at a price of $268,000.</p>
<p>As things stand, the Dogecoin (DOGE) price is currently being traded at $0.07751. This represents an increase of 9.6% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 7.8% during the last week as per CoinGape&#8217;s crypto market tracker.</p>

During this fall, the coin prices have reverted from the pattern converging trendline multiple times, indicating the traders are actively responding to this pattern and would do the same for its potential target. Here’s how this pattern may influence Gala’s future price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the falling wedge pattern trendline sets GALA price for a bullish rally to $0.09</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RSI slope, which reflects the strength of current price action, has surged into the overbought region, indicating the need for a short correction to stabilize the price trend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the GALA is $157.5 Million indicating a 447% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/D0tB5PL7.png" alt="GALA Tokens" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the formation of a falling wedge pattern, the price action continues to wobble between two converging trendlines. Therefore, the price spread gets narrow inside the pattern indicating the inability of the sellers to carry a deeper downfall. However, this losing bearish momentum would eventually breach the resistance trendline, offering a recovery opportunity for traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent new year recovery in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/gala-price-gala-games-the-rock-collab/">GALA price</a> rebounded from the $0.0155 mark and witnessed a perpendicular rally.  Furthermore, the price jump breached multiple resistances and soared 211% within a fortnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GALA price currently trades at the $0.048 mark, as the recent bull run has pierced the long-coming wedge pattern and, most recently, the $0.0456 horizontal resistance. Moreover, the massive jump in volume activity indicates that buyers are strongly committed to the price recovery.</span></p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-discord-groups-servers/">Top Crypto Discord Servers/Groups Worth Joining In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, such a sharp recovery is unhealthy for a sustained trend, and therefore, the coin price may witness a minor pullback or consolidation above the breached trendline before the resumption of the forward march. The interested trades can find entry opportunities during the potential pullback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, in an ideal bullish condition, the trendline breakout may lead a price rally to the top swing high of the pattern, which is $0.09 for GALA.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> The increasing gap between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and the signal reflect the strong buying momentum in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band:</strong> the rising price breached the upper band of this indicator, projecting the overextended growth in the short-term and also the need for possible correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">GALA Coin intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.045</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.057 and $0.07</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.048 and 0.039</span></li>

Customers withdrew a net amount of 360 million dollars on Friday and it certainly seems like the world&#8217;s largest digital asset exchange, Binance, is having trouble maintaining its holdings.</p>
<h2>Binance Amidst Chaos</h2>
<p>The underperformance of the exchange&#8217;s indigenous tokens, Binance Coin (BNB) and Binance USD (BUSD), is indicative of investors&#8217; skepticism. The value of BNB has dropped by 29% in only a little over two months.

<p>Nansen, an independent crypto data business, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2023/01/09/binance-is-bleeding-assets-12-billion-gone-in-less-than-60-days/?sh=136e3a4d15cf" rel="nofollow">reported</a> on December 13 that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">top crypto exchange Binance</a> had lost $3 billion in assets over the previous week, or 4% of the company&#8217;s total at the time. The exchange lost almost 15% of its assets after Zhao negated the withdrawals from the Nansen article on Twitter the same day. Even still, in only two months, roughly a quarter of Binance&#8217;s assets left the exchange.</p>

<p>Binance appears to be losing credibility and clout in less obvious ways as well. Even while the exchange&#8217;s total value has decreased by 24% since November, investors&#8217; holdings of popular tokens like <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/polygon-matic/">MATIC</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ape/">APE</a>, and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gala">GALA</a> have also been reduced by between 40% to  50%.</p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Doubtful PoR</h2>
<p>On January 4, CoinMarketCap displayed a balance of $9.58 billion BUSD, which was over $3.5 billion less than the $13.1 billion and $13.2 billion respectively that were announced by Nansen and Defillama. It reported the portfolio allocation to be BNB at 31.86%, BUSD at 19.15%, USDT at 16.73%, BTC at 9.87% and ETH at 7.16%. The remaining were attributed to the &#8220;Others&#8221; category.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134752" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/09231924/Screenshot-2023-01-09-231509.png" alt="" width="1741" height="794" /></p>
<p>Defillama data show that the reduction in BUSD holdings has been consistent, with notable drops (at least $1 billion) on November 25 and December 14—the latter day being the day following CZ&#8217;s solace-inducing tweet. The net loss in only one day during this second significant BUSD decrease was staggering, coming in at $3.46 billion. On January 4, USDT and USDC coins on the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> simultaneously doubled to a total $6.27 billion.</p>
<p>This disparity is indicative of trust issues with Binance, and given the exchange&#8217;s prominence in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>, it&#8217;s reasonable to worry that these suspicions could spread if they materialize. Yet, there hasn&#8217;t been much media attention about Binance or significant market turbulence, but if withdrawals keep rising at their current rate &#8212; it might end up having catastrophic effects on digital assets and on market participants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/05144325/zil-token.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="zil-token" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly eight months, the Zilliqa coin price was falling under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>. During the pattern formation, the prices resonated between two converging trendlines, carrying an established downtrend. Thus, the falling ZIL price reached a low of $0.0154 on December 30th, indicating a 93.4% loss from the all-time high of $0.2563. However, in theory, this pattern is known for offering a direction bull run, and here’s how you may trade it.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the wedge pattern’s resistance trendline set ZIL price for a 30% upswing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oversold RSI value hints the coin price may consolidate for coming trading sessions before it continues to rise ahead.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the Zilliqa coin is $449.8 Billion, indicating a 2348% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/AJql1IRh.png" alt="Zilliqa Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though this falling wedge pattern carries a steady downtrend, each successive price cycle within this pattern gets narrower than before, indicating the losing bearish momentum. Thus, with this core concept, the buyers gradually wrestle trend control from sellers and initiate a fresh recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent new year recovery in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/zilliqa-price-surge-by-50-sand-up-by-15-metaverse-tokens-boom/">Zilliqa price</a> bounced back from the  $0.0154 low and triggered a new bull cycle within the pattern. Furthermore, the nine consecutive green candles offered a 62.8% growth and pushed the coin to its current price of $0.0256 mark.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-7-crypto-marketing-firms-of-the-year/">Top Crypto Marketing Firms / Agencies 2023; Here’s Best Picks</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this price jump, the Zilliqa coin gave a massive breakout from the aforementioned pattern’s resistance trendline, indicating further growth potential for the coin holders. The high volume hike during this breakout accentuates the buyers’ strong commitment to the upcoming recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> manages to sustain above the breached trendline, the post-breakout rally may offer a near-term target of $0.0288, followed by $0.033.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily candle closing below the trendline will invalidate the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI</a>, which reflects the strength of the ongoing price, has soared to the overbought. Thus, the indicator value at a high value of 81% suggests the prices need pullback or consolidation before resuming the upward march.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the ongoing recovery in ZIL price breached 20-50-and-100-day EMA, offering some early signs of a trend reversal.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.0288 and $0.0334</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels are $0.0243 and $0.02</span></li>

Moreover, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> Binance temporarily <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-suspends-terra-classic-lunc-burn-lunc-price-falls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended its LUNC burn</a> mechanism until March and reduced the burn amount to 50% have also affected the LUNC burn rates.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Validators and Projects Aim To Increase Burn Rate</h2>
<p>Terra Classic validators and projects aim to burn billions of Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens in 2023. Until now, the community has burned over 37.30 LUNC tokens and staked almost 850 billion LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>Terra Casino, in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/TerraCasino_io/status/1612287670356701189" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on January 9, revealed that it has sent over 8 million LUNC tokens to the burn address. It has burned 50 million LUNC tokens in less than 2 months. The project commits to burn billions of LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>Moreover, validator LUNC DAO has burned over 4 million LUNC tokens in the last 24 hours. Two transactions with 2.235 million LUNc tokens each were sent to the burn address. LUNC DAO burned over 2 million Terra Classic tokens on January 2. This makes LUNC DAO the 5th largest burners of Terra Classic tokens.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the community votes on two important proposals. Proposal 11242 effectively stops reminting of LUNC from burns and sets the community pool reward policy to zero. Also, Proposal 11243 suggests increasing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/gas-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gas fees</a> by 5 times and funding the community pool from fees.</p>
<p>Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/edk208/status/1612177684578050050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warns</a> the community that the proposals could severely impact funding for the community pool as data shared in the proposal has a miscalculation. Thus, it shows extra fees being distributed. However, a fix could later witness much less going to the community pool.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Jumps 6%</h2>
<p>Amid the recovery in the broader crypto market, the LUNC price jumped over 6% in the last 24 hours. Also, the trading volume has increased by 180% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The 24-hour low and high are $0.000153 and $0.000166, respectively. The LUNC price is trading in a range after hitting a <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-price-skyrockets-10-heres-why-more-rally-is-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high of $0.000184</a> on December 27.</p>

However, macroeconomic scenario does not really reflect a bullish sentiment in the traditional markets as yet. The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a> at the far end of 2022 dealt a body blow to the crypto community. Meanwhile, there seems to be a change of attitude that is driving the altcoin rally currently.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Happening With BUSD?</h2>
<p>In the context of market recovery post the FTX related liquidity concerns, on chain data shows some interesting trend in Binance BUSD data. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63bbd474c694b7554b1985b2-Something-is-happening-with-BUSD" rel="nofollow">Crypto Quant</a> data, there is a drop in BUSD reserves since December 12, 2022. This decline marked the start of pumping of altcoin prices. It may be recalled that a majority of investors moved their assets to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> exchange when they feared FTX exposure would lead to closure of companies. However, the situation had apparently changed few weeks later, as evident with the decline in reserves.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;$BUSD reserves have risen significantly since the FTX. But it started to drop significantly from December 12. That&#8217;s when altcoin began to pump. Market liquidity remained unchanged and began to eat up $ BTC&#8217;s dominance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not particularly a good thing for the crypto market in the medium term. Compared to previous bull runs, the current rebound is not caused by a fresh influx of capital.</p>

<p>The Binance USD stablecoin lost significant market cap in the last one month. In fact, from around Deceber 14, the BUSD market size curve has been on a steady downward curve. From a high of around $24 billion immediately after FTX meltdown, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/stablecoin/">stablecoin</a> lost a market share by a whopping 40%.</p>

The flagship <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> which is currently changing hands for around $17,200 per BTC, has met with a moderate level of daily trading volume on major exchanges and an increase in volatility. This has been at historic lows up until now and further suggests that the relief rally might not have much-staying power.</p>
<h2>Time To Sell Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63bc070bfc4599123b27e1ac-Bitcoin-ASOPR-is-it-time-to-consider-taking-profits" rel="nofollow">information</a> acquired by CryptoQuant, a declining number of investors are taking a loss while selling their Bitcoin holdings. This comes after the ASOPR (Adjusted Output Profit Ratio) for Bitcoin has reached a value of 0.99. In a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/">bear market</a>, the value 1 for ASOPR, functions as a significant point of resistance.</p>
<p>The ASOPR measures the proportion of profitable outputs that were spent across a stipulated time period (greater than an hour in duration). The number of investors selling for a profit increases as the value rises above 1. When the value is less than 1, it means more investors are selling at a loss. The data further sheds light on the fact that it might be prudent to consider cashing in on BTC earnings as a result of this resistance.</p>

<p>However, according to another data point shared by renowned crypto analyst Sulivan, if the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price of Bitcoin (BTC)</a> reaches $20,000–$22,000, it would enter the S2F green zone (as shown below), which may cause another immediate sell-off. He also stated that such an increase might take place later on in this week if the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/">U.S. CPI statistics</a> turned out to be better than the general projections.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he expressed concern that the macroeconomic situation and the likelihood of prolonged recessions in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> and other nations could make 2023 a worse year for Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) Key Price Barrier</h2>
<p>CryptoGodJohn, a prominent crypto analyst and trader, believes that the level of $17,600 is crucial to the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> price. If the leading cryptocurrency breaches the $17,600 level, bulls will be able to pursue the $20,000 mark. However, failure to break above that level, according to the expert, might lead to the invalidation of his bullish thesis and a BTC price retracement below $15,500.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">$17,600 is most important level for me for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a></p>
<p>Flip $17,600 I wouldn’t be surprised to see a move towards $20k</p>
<p>Reject likely revisit $15.5</p>

<p>As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $17,242. This represents an increase of 1.73% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 3.26% during the week as per CoinGape&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</p>

Moreover, the sustained rally in a majority of meta tokens has breached their respective crucial resistance zone, which could offer long entry opportunities to interested traders. Today we’ll analyze some tokens of this category in their daily time frame chart.</span></p>
<h2><b>Apecoin</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/UGPmBohr.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two months, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/apecoin/">Apecoin price</a> showed the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. The two converging trendlines of the pattern had temporarily limited this meta coin growth, as the overall market was struggling with uncertainty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 5th, the APE price breached the pattern’s resistance trendline, which hints the release of trapped bullish momentum. The post-breakout rally has surged the prices 15% higher, where it currently trades at $4.68. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, with today&#8217;s price jump, the Apecoin price also breached a local resistance of $4.57. This upward breakout bolsters buyers for further price recovery to $5.14, followed by $6.</span></p>

<h2><b>MANA</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/lG1W3z3a.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent new year recovery in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/">Decentraland(MANA)</a> token has witnessed a directional rally in the past nine days. During the rally, the token price rebounded from the $2.9 mark and registered 38% growth. In the daily time frame chart, the prices display a U-shaped recovery, indicating gradual and steady growth of bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the MANA price shows a bullish breakout from the local resistance of $0.38 today, offering a higher footing for buyers to lead to further recovery. The post-breakout rally may bolster buyers for another 6% rise to hit the $4.28 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, the token holders should watch for this monthly resistance as it may stall bullish growth.</span></p>
<h2>Sandbox</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/vs5FFLJe.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to improving market sentiment, the Sandbox token price showed a V-shaped recovery from $0.38 support. Thus, over the past nine days, the coin price showed 36% growth and pushed it to its current price of $0.52.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the SAND price tries to break another horizontal barrier of $0.53. Thus a daily candle closing above $0.53 could surge the price another 15-12% before hitting the resistance trendline of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pattern is currently carrying the ongoing downtrend in Sandbox token, and its resistance trendline is an active spot for selling activities. Thus, traders looking for sustained recovery opportunities should wait for an overhead trendline breakout before entering the market.</span></p>

The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto-mining</a> firm achieved increased figures due to the agile acquisition of 3,570 Bitmain S19j Pro mining machines at discounted prices. Additionally, HIVE has received and installed 1,423 of its HIVE BuzzMiner Bitcoin miners powered by Intel Blockscale chip.</p>
<h2>HIVE Blockchain Increases Bitcoin Production in 2022</h2>
<p>In the latest production update on January 9, HIVE Blockchain <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.hiveblockchain.com/news/hive-blockchain-provides-december-2022-production-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> an 18% increase in Bitcoin production in 2022. The company mined crypto assets with a value of 4,752 BTC. Also, the company leverages the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a> to buy mining rigs at discounted prices.</p>
<p>HIVE Blockchain produced 213.8 BTCs in December. Moreover, it made $3.15 million of income from energy price hedging and grid balancing strategy.</p>
<p>While other crypto mining firms faced financial issues in 2022 due to crypto winter, HIVE Blockchain improved its global efficiency with the acquisition of 3,570 Bitmain S19j Pro machines. Further, HIVE has received and installed 1,423 of its HIVE BuzzMiner Bitcoin miners, powered by Intel Blockscale, out of the total production quantity of 5,800 HIVE BuzzMiners.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Notwithstanding the foregoing, as HIVE&#8217;s global fleet of ASIC and GPU miners expanded, HIVE&#8217;s output of crypto mined with green energy, outpaced the Bitcoin Network Difficulty increase.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With the installation of <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Intel&#8217;s new </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">mining chips, Hive Blockchain will increase Bitcoin mining efficiency and lower the average cost of Bitcoin production.</span></p>
<p>Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE, believes the company will be able to further increase profits and bitcoin production after receiving all 5,800 HIVE BuzzMiners by the end of January 2023. The company holds 2,348 Bitcoin in its treasury, valued at $38 million.</p>
<p>The HIVE share price is up 5% at $1.90 during the pre-market hours on Monday.</p>
<h2>Can Mining Industry Recover?</h2>
<p>The crypto market saw a massive recovery in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price breaks above $17K, while Ethereum price breaks above $1.3K in the last 24 hours. Other cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://coingape.com/cardano-ada-and-solana-sol-lead-altcoin-rally-with-20-gains-each/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solana and Cardano</a> also contributed to the rally. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaverse</a> tokens witnessed special upside momentum, with many tokens <a href="https://coingape.com/zilliqa-price-surge-by-50-sand-up-by-15-metaverse-tokens-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recording double-digit gains</a>.</p>
<p>The crypto mining industry can also recover if prices hold the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullish </a>momentum and Bitcoin prices continue a rally, marking the end of the bear market.</p>

This can be seen as a return of investments in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoins</a> after many traders preferred to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) following the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a> in November 2022. The meltdown led to a crypto crash that swept away the gains obtained over several months. However, in ETH&#8217;s case, technical parameters point to potential upside in terms of price in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>ETH Price Action For Profit Taking</h2>
<p>There was heavy flow of assets to low risk cryptocurrencies in the wake of the FTX scenario. In this context, many traders preferred to hold <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/stablecoin/">stablecoins</a> while many others invested in Bitcoin. After the downward price action related to the FTX related liquidity crisis died down, altcoins started seeing price rise. Meanwhile, ETH price also saw a weekly gain of 8.64%. In line with the overall crypto market rebound activity, the ETH price is on the rise. As of writing, ETH price stands at $1,320, up 4.61% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">CoinGape live price tracker</a>.</p>
<p>To add to this, technical indicators also indicate that there could be further price rise in the coming weeks. In the recent times, ETH&#8217;s exchange inflow has been on a huge rise, in what could be a sign of hitting the bottom. Also, the number of tokens transferred is very low currently, according to <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63bb5e936829de68183e0bfd-Ethereum-price-tops-and-bottoms-are-defined-by-coin-flow">Crypto Quant</a> data. This means there is no sign of price reaching its local top.</p>

<p>At the current price range, ETH appears to be going through the phase of capitulation. However, considering the strange movements seen in the current market cycle, it remains to be seen if ETH is yet to drop further.</p>

He announced a slew of new <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> features that will start being implemented from next week.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">These changes include an easy swipe right/left to move between recommended Vs. followed tweets, a bookmark button, and long-form tweets.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Taking to Twitter, the billionaire tech mogul revealed the changes that are going to be made in the &#8220;first part&#8221; of a &#8220;much larger UI overhaul.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Elon Musk listed the upcoming changes in Twitter&#8217;s user interface in a tweet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Easy swipe right/left to move between recommended vs followed tweets rolls out later this week.</p>
<p>First part of a much larger UI overhaul.</p>
<p>Bookmark button (de facto silent like) on Tweet details rolls out a week later.</p>
<p>Long form tweets early Feb.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1611932793130438656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p style="color: #252525">In November last year, Musk mentioned that the platform will soon allow users to write long-form text in tweets (which currently have a character limit of 280).</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Musk said that he plans to allow users to tweet 4,000 characters, which is more than 14 times the existing limit.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Some users are thrilled about the changes, claiming that it would enhance the user experience by eliminating the need for individuals to compose several tweets in threads. However, some users are not happy with the changes and predict that long-form tweets will harm Twitter.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">He also hinted at adding the &#8220;Bookmarks&#8221; feature in December 2022.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">According to the Elon&#8217;s tweet, the &#8216;easy right/left swipe&#8217; feature will be rolled out this week, followed by the &#8216;bookmark button&#8217; feature a week later, and &#8216;long form tweets&#8217; will be available from early February.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">Possible Crypto Integration</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">According to a report by the Financial Times, Twitter filed paperwork with US authorities to become a financial services business in November 2022. This move was seen as the stepping stone in realising Elon Musk&#8217;s vision of turning the social media company into a &#8216;Super App&#8217;. He also outlined his ideas for offering payment services in a Twitter space.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">While there&#8217;s no concrete information on whether Twitter is going to offer payment services or the platform is looking into crypto integration, the crypto community remains hopeful.</p>

In the major development, Huobi’s South Korean arm, Huobi Korea has reportedly decided to cut itself from its parent firm.</p>
<h2>Huobi Korea CEO to buy all stakes?</h2>
<p>As per reports, Huobi Korea is looking to run its own business. In this bid, the Korean is willing to acquire all of its shares which are presently owned by Huobi Global. The firm will also change the name of the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Leon Li, founder of Huobi Global holds more than 50% of shares in Huobi Korea. However, it is being reported that Cho Kook-bong, CEO of Huobi Korea is willing to buy out all shares.</p>
<p>This major development has landed amid <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-exchanges-rush-to-provide-proof-of-reserves-following-ftx-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huobi publishing a “proof of reserves”</a> which was backed with a reserve ratio of 101%. However, this was done shortly after the concerns were raised regarding the crypto firm’s solvency after the horrible collapse of the SBF’s FTX crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Earlier, Coingape reported that<a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-justin-sun-confirms-20-of-staff-layoff-at-huobi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Justin Sun Confirms 20% Of Staff Layoff</a> At Huobi. However, an internal notice at the firm stated that the exchange survived the crypto winter with an average of 20K new users over the past 3 months.</p>
<h2>Will Huobi Token will drop?</h2>
<p>Huobi token<a href="https://coingape.com/huobi-token-falls-after-reports-of-internal-conflicts-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (HT) price is down</a> by 25% over the past 30 days. However, HT price has jumped by around 3% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $ 4.80, at the press time.</p>
<p>Earlier, HT token price fell by around 10% over a day, while its 24 hour trading volume dropped by 23% when reports of internal strife went out on the internet.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;NFT derivatives&#8221; describes <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a></strong> collections that combine characteristics and design elements from well-known <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT projects</a></strong>. The names of NFT Derivatives are almost identical to the original non-fungible tokens from which they were derived, in addition to having a nearly identical visual appearance.</p>
<p>Numerous well-known NFT collections, including <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-are-cryptopunks-how-to-buy-cryptopunks-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoPunks</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/aggregatorapps/bored-ape-yacht-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a></strong>, have served as inspiration for some derivatives. Furthermore, not just one, but two projects simultaneously have an impact on some derivatives. An NFT Derivative collection called SODA, or Society of Derivative Apes, combines features from both Doodles and BAYC.</p>
<p>The majority of derivative projects use components from earlier iterations of current projects without seeking permission from the NFT project they are modeled after. You can assume a derivative NFT is informal unless the original project has officially announced a partnership.</p>

<h2>What makes NFT Derivatives so popular?</h2>
<p>The popularity of NFTs and the growth rate of their adoption are two of the main factors contributing to the rise in the popularity of NFT derivatives.</p>
<p>In terms of the motivations for launching NFT derivatives, some non-fungible token developers hope to attract attention and business by developing something akin to popular non-fungible token collections. The next factor, which is probably crucial from the perspective of collectors, is that not all of them have enough money to buy their preferred high-profile collections, which tends to steer them toward derivatives.</p>
<h3>What Motivates People to Develop NFT Derivatives?</h3>
<p>The global expansion of NFT adoption is responsible for the rise of NFT derivatives. The NFT community generally has mixed opinions about derivative projects. Some consider them to be unoriginal knockoffs of already-existing projects, while others see them as a tribute to the original collections they&#8217;re based on.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of reasons why a digital artist might choose to make a derivative project. Unofficial derivative projects, affiliated derivatives, and spin-off projects launched by a project&#8217;s founding team are also distinct from one another.</p>
<h3>Not all NFT Derivatives are about making money</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no denying that these projects&#8217; primary goal is to generate as many sales as they can. The organization or person behind the collection makes every effort to spread the word about it on social media, share encouraging road maps, and provide enticing perks.</p>
<p>But there is also another side. Certain projects go beyond financial gain and assist community members in evaluating their creative abilities. Jenkins the Valet and Noodles are two examples of derivative projects that have not only built strong value but also received backing from the real collection&#8217;s creators.</p>

<h2>NFT Derivatives projects that are popular</h2>
<p>Few of the top NFT Derivative projects whose success has astounded the market.</p>
<h3>Noodles</h3>
<p>The creators of the actual collection, Doodles, have given Noodles, an official Derivative project, a tonne of support. Noodles is intriguing because it came about as a joke between two NFT collectors.</p>
<h3>CryptoPhunks</h3>
<p>A Derivative NFT collection with the same visual appearance as CryptoPunks is referred to as CryptoPhunks. The project received poor reviews and was taken down from several <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT marketplaces</a></strong>. Despite this, CryptoPhunks enjoy incredible sales and are well-known all over the world.</p>
<h3>NotOkayBears</h3>
<p>Another derivative on the list that resembles Okay Bears is called NotOkayBears. NotOkayBears are based on Ethereum, as opposed to Okay Bears, which is based on <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/solana-sol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solana</a></strong>. Just a few hours after it was released, the collection quickly became a huge hit on LooksRare and OpenSea.</p>
<h3>Bored Apes Solana Club</h3>
<p>The collection, also known as BASC, is a copy of the Bored Ape Yacht Club project. The Derivative, which is based on the Solana <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a></strong>, has become successful despite opposition.</p>

<h3>Organizations that produce NFT Derivatives</h3>
<p>Some participants envision using NFT derivatives to enable non-fungible token trading for small retailers.</p>
<h3>NFTures</h3>
<p>Users are able to wager on the price of the non-fungible tokens in the future thanks to NFTures. Along with adding gaming elements, it uses the decentralized protocol sAMM to leverage trading on marketplaces.</p>
<h3>Bliv.club</h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs like Mohammed Sirajuddin, Vikas Singh, and Abhishek Kumar Gupta co-founded the NFT Derivative platform Bliv. Through small ticket sizes, Club makes it possible for the average person to participate in the NFT market.</p>
<h2>NFT Derivatives: Are they legal or not?</h2>
<p>NFT Derivatives&#8217; legitimacy has been a hot topic ever since they entered the market. It wouldn&#8217;t be incorrect to say that the original NFT collections and Derivatives have a companion-like relationship if we looked at them from a long-term perspective. While creators want their work to be seen by as many people as possible through derivatives, derivatives also want to be a part of the market and open doors for a strong presence. One thing to keep in mind is that it is considered an IP rights violation if a Derivative NFT is offered for sale alongside a Real non-fungible token without first receiving permission from the creators.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Derivative project is deemed legal if the team behind it received permission from the original non-fungible token creator to use the creative styles and elements found in the original non-fungible token work. Due to this conflict between legal and illegal, it is crucial to check that it has the real creator&#8217;s permission before purchasing it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>These are still in their infancy and are relatively new to the market. However, they have a very bright future. Making <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/top-5-nft-trading-strategies-for-investors-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT trading</a></strong> as popular and understandable as current <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto</a></strong> trading is crucial, especially in making it available to the general public. Yes, there is a lot of buzz and hype surrounding non-fungible tokens, but not among retail investors because so few people are familiar with the NFT trading game.</p>

<h2>Hong Kong Maintains Its Pro-Crypto Stance</h2>
<p>During the <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Hong Kong</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> Web3 Innovator Summit</span> on January 9, Hong Kong&#8217;s Financial Secretary Paul Chan reaffirms that the city will continue to transform into a global crypto hub, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/markets/status/1612316239568699394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Several leading tech firms and startups are considering opening their headquarters or an expansion to Hong Kong. Moreover, crypto exchanges have also shown interest in expanding to the region and helps develop the market.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Hong Kong administration has recently completed the legislative work to set up a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers.

<h2>Rising Interest From Retail and Institutional Investors</h2>
<p>Hong Kong plans to become a crypto hub amid the rising interest from retail and institutional investors. Moreover, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/singapore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singapore&#8217;s</a> recent shift to a strict crypto stance led to crypto companies shifting to countries with less stringent regulations.</p>
<p>While Hong Kong is known for its financial hub, the crypto industry continues to evaluate China&#8217;s influence on Hong Kong. China&#8217;s crypto crackdown on crypto mining and trading activity in 2021 caused a massive fall in the crypto market. Therefore, crypto participants move with caution as China can exert control over the financial hub.</p>

It is also the biggest gainer on Metaverse in the 24 hours.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/">market cap</a> for this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">crypto</a> has gone up to 419.512 million USD.

The price of each ZIL token is 0.0264 USD, an increase of 0.008564 USD in the last 24 hours. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134713" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/09164621/ZIL_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-1.jpeg" alt="Metaverse Tokens" width="1858" height="800" />Source: coinmarketcap</p>
<p>There have been 550 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/smart-contract/">smart contract</a> wallets formed in the last 2 days, which might be one of the reason for the hike.</p>
<h2>Other Metaverse Tokens</h2>

<h2>Is the market entering bullish momentum?</h2>
<p>A slowdown in wage growth and a decline in services sector activity in the United States, which point to the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">FED</a> raising interest rates less aggressively, are the main drivers of the cryptocurrency market boom.</p>
<p>Despite a significant recent week, the values of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> continued to trade solidly above the major support levels. After the FOMC Minutes were published, the price of cryptocurrencies also started to rise.</p>
<p>Numerous point prove that there is a slowdown in inflation. Investor sentiment has been buoyed by China&#8217;s reopening of its international borders and initiatives taken by other central banks to reduce inflation.</p>
