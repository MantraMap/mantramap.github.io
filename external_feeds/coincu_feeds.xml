<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Offchain Labs has released BOLD, permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains.</em></li>



<li><em>BOLD is a huge technical achievement that makes the Arbitrum chain more secure than ever.</em></li>



<li><em>There are a few more steps to complete before the BOLD is ready for production.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official <a href="https://offchain.medium.com/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>, the Arbitrum Offchain Labs development team announced the launch of a permissionless verification protocol Bounded Liquidity Delay (BOLD) to resolve Rollup disputes. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>BOLD enables the <a href="https://coincu.com/206210-arbitrum-goerli-testnet-launched-on-substancex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a> technology chain to ensure the security and vitality of the chain, minimizing delays in condition resolution and preventing dishonest parties from increasing the costs of honest parties. This verification method provides a fixed upper limit of 7 days for additional confirmation delays without being subject to delay attacks.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BOLD is a massive technical accomplishment, making Arbitrum chains more secure than ever.<br><br>But it&#39;s an equally bold statement about what we value at <a href="https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@OffchainLabs</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="ðŸ§µ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/n2Qz2QYnWm" target="_blank">https://t.co/n2Qz2QYnWm</a></p>&mdash; Steven Goldfeder (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f499.png" alt="ðŸ’™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />,<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e1.png" alt="ðŸ§¡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) (@sgoldfed) <a href="https://twitter.com/sgoldfed/status/1687199191204798464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>BOLD code and specs are now available on Github. There are a few more steps that need to be completed before the BOLD is ready to use:</p>



<ol>
<li>Share instructions for running Arbitrum Nitro development with the BOLD challenge in the coming weeks;</li>



<li>Publish official proof-of-concept code for BOLD written in the Isabelle programming language and Complete the academic paper;</li>



<li>A new test network environment will be made available to BOLD for community participation;</li>



<li>If there is positive feedback from the community, plan to prepare the AIP so that the DAO can decide whether to adopt this new protocol in Arbitrum One and Nova.</li>
</ol>



<p>As stated by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum Technology has always been built with security as a top concern. And that&#8217;s why they invest a lot of resources to build and improve the fraud proof system.</p>



<p>The protocol can help securely validate the Arbitrum chain without permission, taking them up the ladder of decentralization. This approach allows a single, honest validator to win Ethereum disputes against any opponent.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bankman-Fried faces detention request over CEO&#8217;s diary leak.</em></li>



<li><em>DOJ alleges attempts to influence witnesses through media actions.</em></li>



<li><em>New York Times objects to gag orders on FTX collapse reporting.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) continues to assert that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried should be &#8220;detained pending trial&#8221; due to his sharing of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison&#8217;s diary with the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>CoinDesk</em> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/04/sam-bankman-fried-likely-faces-jail-as-doj-pushes-for-incarceration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>In their latest filing, the DOJ emphasizes that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense does not deny the act, and they view it as an attempt to &#8220;corruptly influence witnesses.&#8221;</p>



<p>The ongoing legal battle between Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys and the prosecutors centers around the extent of his actions and their implications.</p>



<p>The DOJ <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.188.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contends</a> that Bankman-Fried went beyond a mere &#8220;fair comment&#8221; when sharing the diary, and they cite his use of a VPN to watch the Super Bowl and reaching out to FTX.US General Counsel Ryne Miller as additional evidence of his misconduct.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense has <a href="https://coincu.com/207851-bankman-fried-fights-against-jail-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> that the government is mischaracterizing his actions, stating that he sought to defend his reputation in the press and did not initially contact Miller.</p>



<p>However, the DOJ maintains its position, suggesting that <a href="https://coincu.com/206847-sam-bankman-fried-seeks-seal-caroline-ellisons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> may have orchestrated media attention around <a href="https://coincu.com/204571-former-alameda-co-ceo-admits-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ellison</a> ahead of her acting as a witness.</p>



<p>The filing also reveals that he had set up Signal groups to delete messages after a week, raising further concerns about potential evidence tampering.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.187.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">objected</a> to gag orders imposed on Bankman-Fried, arguing that such restrictions must adhere to legal standards and protect the public&#8217;s First Amendment right to be informed about FTX&#8217;s collapse and alleged mismanagement.</p>



<p>The case, overseen by Judge Lewis Kaplan in the Southern District of New York, remains a subject of ongoing discussion, with the possibility of further hearings to address the filings. </p>



<p>The legal battle highlights the complexities and potential consequences surrounding the sharing of sensitive information and its impact on the judicial process.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix give hacker ultimatum after DeFi platform attack.</em></li>



<li><em>The hacker offered a 10% reward for returning stolen funds before the August 6 deadline.</em></li>



<li><em>Legal action and public reward are promised if the hacker does not comply.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Curve Finance, together with Metronome and Alchemix, has taken an unconventional approach to dealing with the recent attack on their platform that sent shockwaves through the DeFi community.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="676" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263.png" alt="Curve, Metronome, And Alchemix Issue Ultimatum To Hacker With 10% Bounty" class="wp-image-208328" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263-300x198.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263-768x507.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263-750x495.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Curve, Metronome, And Alchemix Issue Ultimatum To Hacker With 10% Bounty 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>In an unprecedented move, they sent an on-chain ultimatum to the attacker responsible for the breach.</p>



<p>Through a <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1687180381714358272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter announcement</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/208104-curve-finance-stops-crv-rewards-pools-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve</a> offered the attacker a <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc45e47f6e7d3e74763032e2fb991fa9a003d8ed55c13c93c6a5368ff322d7742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deal</a> &#8211; they would reward the hacker with 10% of the lost assets if they agreed to return the remaining 90% of the hacked funds to the project. </p>



<p>The proposal came with a deadline, set for August 6 at 08:00 UTC, giving the hacker a limited window to respond and return the funds.</p>



<p>In the event that the hacker fails to comply with the ultimatum, Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6264cc2827b0598ec7d8c0f549238c2a96a795cfde8c5ac4dcf77021c75adf0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> it clear that they would take legal action to pursue the culprit and retrieve the stolen money. </p>



<p>Additionally, they pledged to publicly offer a reward to anyone who can provide information leading to the hacker&#8217;s arrest and conviction.</p>



<p>To assure the attacker, the trio promised no further legal actions or involvement of law enforcement if the funds were returned as per their offer. The goal is to recover the majority of the funds and hold the hacker accountable without resorting to traditional legal channels.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">â€œYou will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues, etc.,&#8221; says the message.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The attack on Curve Finance, which occurred within the past 24 hours, <a href="https://coincu.com/207193-curve-finances-liquidity-pools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted</a> a series of stablepool pools using the Vyper 0.2.15 programming language. The seriousness of the attack prompted this unconventional response from the affected projects.</p>

<p>This means that artwork minted on Base&#8217;s network can now be bought and sold on OpenSea, and the market leading NFT platform&#8217;s NFT-related toolkit will now be able to mint assets on Base&#8217;s extended network.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OpenSea now supports the <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@BuildOnBase</a> network! <a href="https://t.co/iptsyajmV1" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/iptsyajmV1</a></p>&mdash; OpenSea (@opensea) <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1687203377552453632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>OpenSea has been a mainstay of the NFT industry, historically accounting for the majority of organic NFT transaction volume. Although it was overtaken by rival Blur earlier this year and its encrypted trading offers, with its reputation, Opensea remains the top NFT platform of choice for traders.</p>



<p>The Layer 2 Network from Coinbase has announced that the launch of the common access mainnet will take place on August 9.</p>



<p>Base says its network will host more than 50 &#8220;top brands, platforms, markets, artists and creators&#8221; at launch, including Coca-Cola, Atari and OpenSea. The team will also celebrate the launch with the &#8220;Onchain Summer&#8221; campaign, which includes daily NFT rewards for users.</p>



<p>The memecoin transaction boom <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">propelled</a> Base to 3rd place in the most active Layer 2, processing almost 7.6 transactions per second (TPS). However, a series of drag disasters &#8211; including from the network&#8217;s top memecoin, BALD &#8211; have since caused activity to drop, with Base now ranked eighth with an average TPS of 2.2 over the past day.</p>



<p>LeetSwap, the network&#8217;s most popular DEX, also briefly halted trading after losing $625,000 in a single mine on Tuesday, causing volumes on the network to continue to decline.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US SEC inundated with 11 Ether futures ETF applications in less than a week.</em></li>



<li><em>ProShares and Bitwise among the major players submitting proposals for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.</em></li>



<li><em>Excitement grows as the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval looms, boosting crypto investment prospects.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces a surge in applications for Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-260.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-260-1024x614.png" alt="Surge Of Ether Futures ETF Floods US SEC With 3 New Applications " class="wp-image-208320" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-260-1024x614.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-260-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-260-768x460.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-260-750x450.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-260-1140x683.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-260.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Surge Of Ether Futures ETF Floods US SEC With 3 New Applications 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>Among the applicants, ProShares and Bitwise have <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1687213881934966784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> three ETF applications specifically related to Bitcoin and Ethereum. ProShares has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1174610/000168386323005834/f26041d1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> for the &#8220;Bitcoin &amp; Ether Strategy ETF&#8221; and the &#8220;Bitcoin &amp; Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF.&#8221; </p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://coincu.com/202636-sec-now-reviews-bitwise-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitwise</a> has put forward its own proposal for the &#8220;Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF.&#8221;</p>



<p>The &#8220;Bitcoin &amp; Ether Equal Weight ETF&#8221; is designed to track the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly bitcoin and ether futures contracts.</p>



<p>In addition to these filings, <a href="https://coincu.com/101707-proshares-bitcoin-etf-trades-for-35-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProShares</a> has lodged four separate applications for Ether-based ETFs, which include a dual Bitcoin and Ether futures strategy ETF, a short Ether Strategy ETF, and an Ether Strategy ETF.</p>



<p>The trend of Ether-related ETF applications commenced with Volatility Shares, which filed for the &#8220;Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF&#8221; on July 28. </p>



<p>Subsequently, several other prominent players like Bitwise Asset Management, Roundhill Financial, Van Eck, and <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale Investments</a> have also jumped on board and filed new Ether futures applications on August 1.</p>



<p>In a span of less than a week, a total of 11 filings for Ether-based ETFs have been submitted, signaling the growing interest in crypto investment products.</p>



<p>Currently, the U.S. only permits investment in Bitcoin futures ETFs, which are backed by bitcoin derivatives. </p>



<p>The flurry of recent filings indicates the increasing desire for a <a href="https://coincu.com/207975-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-surge-to-65/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> to be approved, sparking excitement within the crypto investment community.</p>



<p>As the SEC navigates through these applications, market participants eagerly await the potential approval of Ether-based ETFs, which could further fuel the adoption and accessibility of cryptocurrencies for investors.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase to file for lawsuit dismissal, confident of winning.</em></li>



<li><em>SEC sued Coinbase for unregistered securities trading.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange beats revenue expectations and aims for regulatory clarity.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase is set to <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1687197491098492928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take action</a> against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by filing an order seeking dismissal of the lawsuit on August 4.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1024x576.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1024x576.jpg" alt="coinbase header" class="wp-image-208307" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-750x422.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Plans To Seek Full Dismissal Of SEC Lawsuit From Court This Friday 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The company&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, conveyed confidence in their defense during the second-quarter earnings call held on August 3.</p>



<p>Grewal emphasized that <a href="https://coincu.com/207917-coinbase-promises-to-integrate-lightning-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> would argue against the allegations, asserting that they did not list securities on their platform. </p>



<p>Additionally, he highlighted that the SEC lacks regulatory authority over cryptocurrency exchanges and had not indicated any requirement for registration when Coinbase&#8217;s registration statement was deemed effective in April 2021.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s Chief Executive, <a href="https://coincu.com/186979-coinbase-ceo-made-million-security-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Armstrong</a>, also spoke out against the SEC&#8217;s approach, criticizing its regulation by enforcement tactic instead of participating in rulemaking.</p>



<p>Despite the ongoing legal battle, the exchange reported impressive second-quarter earnings on Thursday, exceeding analysts&#8217; expectations with a revenue of $708 million. However, the company did report a loss of $0.42 per share for the same period.</p>



<p>The legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC ensued in June when the regulator accused the exchange of trading at least 13 crypto assets without proper registration as securities. </p>



<p>Along with its rival <a href="https://coincu.com/208211-binance-reaches-150-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, Coinbase allegedly operated as an unregistered securities exchange, leading to the SEC&#8217;s legal action.</p>



<p>Looking forward, the exchange aims to collaborate with the SEC and lawmakers to establish clearer regulatory guidelines in the cryptocurrency space. The exchange hopes to emerge victorious in the court case and subsequently work towards a more transparent and compliant ecosystem.</p>



<p>As Coinbase prepares to submit its motion for dismissal, the court is expected to review the arguments put forth by the company in October. </p>



<p>This development comes amidst the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulations, which remains a critical area of concern for market participants and regulators alike.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Massive traders sold off Tether USDT late August 3 in key stablecoin pools on Curve and UniSwap.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Asset allocation in Curve 3pool was unbalanced as a series of traders sold off USDT in favor of USDC and DAI.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-258.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-258-1024x538.png" alt="USDT Depegs Again Due To Strong Selling To USDC &amp; DAI" class="wp-image-208305" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-258-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-258-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-258-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-258-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-258-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-258.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="USDT Depegs Again Due To Strong Selling To USDC &amp; DAI 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Massive traders sold off Tether in key stablecoin pools on Curve and UniSwap yesterday. Shortly after, USDT recoiled to $0.9976 and was <a href="https://coincu.com/198455-tusd-depeg-trueusd-reserves-audited-by-ftx-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depeg</a> below the $1 anchor for a long time.</p>



<p>Many people have exited/sold USDT to run to other stablecoins, causing the pools to fall into a severe imbalance. According to 3pool data, the USDT balance has now skyrocketed to 59.3% in Curve 3pool, which includes USDT, USDC, and DAI, while USDC and DAI account for only 20.3% and 20.8% of total assets in the pool.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-257-767x1024.png" alt="image 257" class="wp-image-208304" width="783" height="1046" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-257-767x1024.png 767w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-257-225x300.png 225w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-257-768x1026.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-257-750x1002.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-257.png 849w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" title="USDT Depegs Again Due To Strong Selling To USDC &amp; DAI 8"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Asset Allocation in <a href="https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/deposit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve 3pool</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Right after USDT went strong, Paolo Ardoino, Tether&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer, suggested that this may be a foul play. The community is also eyeing Hong Kong-based First Digital&#8217;s new stablecoin FDUSD, which Binance quickly backed recently.</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it interesting that USDt is being pressured down (slightly, within 10bps, just to push market makers to react), and USDc, the main competitor that you would expect to gain from the situation, is redeemed nevertheless heavily, while suddenly a competitor born 2 hours ago is getting it all? Exactly! It feels definitely organic and not manipulative at all. Some people never learn.&#8221; He wrote.</p>



<p>The Curve and Uniswap pools are popular places for traders to swap stablecoins quickly. Most of the time, the tokens are balanced in the pool. The imbalance shows that the market is in trouble as investors seek to dump an asset in bulk. Similar imbalances occurred when Terra crashed in May 2022 and the Silicon Valley banking crisis hit USDC Circle Issuers in March of this year.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Matter Labs responded to Polygon&#8217;s allegation of plagiarism of open-source code as &#8220;an untrue statement&#8221;.</em></li>



<li><em>Polygon alleges against a new product called Boojum because it contains some code copied from the Plonky2 library that is not clearly annotated with the original author.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to CoinDesk, Ethereum scaling solution Polygon said in a <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x70DF15b0208eFCeFaA541Da9A0ED6C4A884554Fc/gNi8coqXjd1ybFsQBAG7QARUkPHZECu7ihIRkpiVx2Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a> on Thursday that development firm zkSync <a href="https://coincu.com/167819-matter-labs-new-branding-for-zksync-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matter Labs</a> copied some of Polygon&#8217;s open-source code but did not provide attribution.</strong></h5>

<p>Earlier, Polygon stated in a blog post that Matter Labs recently released a proof-of-work system called Boojum, which contains some source code copied from performance-critical components of the software library Plonky2.</p>



<p>In particular, this code is not original copyright and is not explicitly attributed to the original author. It also alleges that copying the source code without attribution and making false claims about the original work violates the spirit of open source and harms the ecosystem. In its article, Polygon notes that Matter Labs marketed Boojum 10 times faster than Plonky2.</p>



<p>CEO Alex Gluchowski followed up with a detailed tweet expressing frustration with Polygon&#8217;s allegations. Matter Labs denied the allegations in a statement, saying the code was &#8220;clearly marked&#8221; above one of the related documents.</p>

<p>It is known that blockchain projects often release their code under an open-source software license, which means that external developers can read, copy, and even contribute to the code. However, community standards and most open-source licenses often require third-party developers to provide credit for using code sourced elsewhere.</p>



<p>The tension between Polygon and Matter Labs shows the fierce rivalry as both companies rush to deliver the first Zero-Zero Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) to provide cheaper and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Base Leetswap&#8217;s largest DEX has reopened trading for several tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can make sales but cannot buy tokens because of the risk of re-attack.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/208077-leetswap-recovers-314-eth-resume-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recovered </a>about 400 ETH from the risk liquidity pool, and this money will be redistributed to different pools for a restart.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official announcement from Leetswap, the largest DEX on the layer 2 Base platform, now DEX transactions have resumed, but users cannot buy tokens.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="826" height="390" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255.png" alt="Leetswap Trading Restarted But User Can&#039;t Buy Tokens" class="wp-image-208276" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255.png 826w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255-300x142.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255-768x363.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255-750x354.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" title="Leetswap Trading Restarted But User Can&#039;t Buy Tokens 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Specifically, transactions have now resumed on the DEX. Users can sell those tokens affected in their hack, as their remaining liquidity cannot be rescued by white hat hackers. A <a href="https://t.co/YWIrZag3eZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">URL</a> is attached to be able to withstand more loads if the leading site fails to load.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The purpose of trading resumption is to allow users to dispose of illiquid tokens. However, Do not buy any tokens because if you do, the liquidity of the DEX could again be exploited by hackers.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, on August 1st, the axlUSD/WETH pool in LeetSwap was hit by a price manipulation attack, and the loss amounted to around $620,000. Yesterday, about 400 ETH was recovered from the risk liquidity pool, and this money will be redistributed to different pools for restart.</p>



<p>The liquidity hack is the second-biggest LeetSwap mining after a project creator (believed to be Sam Bankman-Fried) withdrew $12.5 million from a Layer 2 Base meme coin, BALD. Launched in 2022, LeetSwap is the largest decentralized exchange on Coinbase&#8217;s Base network, which aims to provide higher transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC freezes assets of crypto mining firm over alleged fraud.</em></li>



<li><em>DEBT Box was accused of selling unregistered securities with false promises of cryptocurrency mining profits.</em></li>



<li><em>18 defendants were charged and accused of misappropriating funds for personal use.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken decisive action</a> against Digital Licensing Inc., a Utah-based crypto mining company, for its alleged involvement in fraudulent activities. The commission announced an emergency asset freeze and obtained a restraining order against the company, which operates under the name DEBT Box.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249.png" alt="SEC Cracks Down On Crypto Fraud: 18 Defendants Charged In DEBT Box Scandal" class="wp-image-208262" width="929" height="523" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="SEC Cracks Down On Crypto Fraud: 18 Defendants Charged In DEBT Box Scandal 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the charges, DEBT Box and its four principals, including Jason Anderson, Jacob Anderson, Schad Brannon, and Roydon Nelson, along with 13 other defendants, orchestrated a scheme that began in March 2021. They allegedly targeted hundreds of U.S. investors, raising a substantial sum of approximately $50 million by selling unregistered securities known as &#8220;node licenses.&#8221;</p>



<p>Investors were misled into believing that these licenses would facilitate cryptocurrency mining, promising potential increases in value over time. However, the truth was that the defendants were merely generating the cryptocurrency instantly using blockchain code, as revealed by the commission.</p>



<p>Tracy S. Combs, Director of the SEC&#8217;s Salt Lake Regional Office, expressed outrage at the defendant&#8217;s actions, accusing them of deceptive practices: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We allege that DEBT Box and its principals lied to investors about virtually every material aspect of their unregistered offering of securities, including by falsely stating that they were engaged in crypto asset mining,&#8221; Combs stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The complaint further claimed that the defendants misappropriated the raised funds for personal gains, including purchasing luxury vehicles and homes, extravagant vacations, and lavishing themselves and their acquaintances with cash.</p>

<p>DEBT Box had purportedly propagated its fraudulent scheme through numerous online videos, social media posts, and events, falsely assuring investors of massive gains from their crypto mining endeavors. The SEC, however, asserted that the so-called &#8220;node licenses&#8221; were nothing more than a deceptive front.</p>



<p>In total, the commission charged 18 defendants for their involvement in the sale of unregistered securities offerings. The emergency asset freeze and restraining order come as the regulatory authorities ramp up efforts to protect investors from potential crypto-related scams and fraudulent activities.</p>
