Data from Glassnode shows that the current Bitcoin price is where the cost basis of a large number of coins lies. Here’s what this means. 780,000 BTC Was Acquired Near The Current Spot Prices According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, 4.6% of the entire circulating Bitcoin supply has its acquisition price near the current spot prices of the asset. The relevant indicator here is the “entity-adjusted UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD),” which, in simple terms, tells us about how the cost basis of the investors is distributed right now. The cost basis here refers to the price at which they bought their coins, so this distribution shows us at which price how many coins were acquired by the holders. Note that this indicator has been adjusted for entities, meaning that all internal movements between the wallets owned by a single investor are removed from this data (an “entity” refers to a collection of addresses that Glassnode has identified to belong to the same holder). Naturally, this adjustment has been made because any movement between the addresses of the same entity would otherwise count as a sale. Thus, a fresh cost basis would be given to the investor (when in reality, it wouldn’t be so).

In total, 780,000 tokens were purchased at these prices, which amount to around 4.6% of the entire circulating supply of the cryptocurrency. Because of this reason, the current price range that Bitcoin is trading in might be crucial for where the asset could go from here.

Major cost basis centers have historically played a notable role in the market because they act as important psychological levels. During bearish trends, investors prefer to sell when the prices fall to their cost basis, as they want to avoid getting into a loss. Similarly, holders prefer to buy more at their cost basis during bullish trends, considering it a profitable buying opportunity. It remains to be seen how the market will respond to the current situation in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,000, down 5% in the last week. The value of the asset seems to have plunged down during the past day or so &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Thought Catalog on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com
