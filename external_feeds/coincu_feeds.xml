<p>Through an investigation, the team said that they discovered multiple fake websites claiming to be 3Commas were used to phish information by tricking users into connecting their exchange accounts to fraudulent web interfaces, noting that <strong>third-party browser extensions or malware may have been involved.</strong></p>

<li><em>DesLucrece stated that he, Tezos, and Manchester United are discussing a solution to the problem.</em></li>

<h5><strong>A well-known NFT artist known for his vibrant animated monsters has been compared to an official collection from the Manchester United Football Club that appears a little too much like his work.</strong></h5>

A colour scheme, similar eyes, and horns are shared by virtually identical figures in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<p><strong>CertiK</strong> has audited many key components of <strong>The Open Network</strong>, including the vesting schedule smart contract, <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Bridge</strong> application, and <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Baselayer</strong>. The company reduces the risk of Web3 services being compromised by security threats using a hands-on approach and automated audits run by artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>In order to give the network an additional layer of security assurance, the audit company also used formal verification. A defense-in-depth strategy is created by combining expert manual review with automated, AI-powered verification, which reduces and guards against the very real hazards that are present in the <strong>Web3</strong> environment.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>With the announcement of a timetable for the release of the first alpha for Illuvium: Zero, their land-owning, and management game, Illuvium keeps the alphas coming.</em></li>



<li><em>The alpha testing will likely be divided into two seasons. Currently, Season 0 is expected to run 6 to 8 weeks before being completely reset and wiping all data.</em></li>



<li><em>Season 1 of the game will follow Season 0, and it will last up until the open beta phase. At the conclusion of Season 1, another data reset is anticipated.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>On January 6, 2023, Illuvium: Zero, the mobile and desktop companion to the blockchain-based RPG game Illuvium, will enter Private Alpha. Versions for Android, Windows, and MAC will be available.</strong></h5>

<p>All land owners, past, present, and future will have access to the <strong>Illuvium: Zero Private Alpha.</strong></p>



<p>The alpha testing will likely be divided into two seasons. Currently, <strong>Season 0</strong> is expected to run <strong>6 to 8 weeks </strong>before being completely reset and wiping off all data (even blueprints).</p>



<p><strong>Season 0 </strong>is meant to give the development team a chance to fix bugs and balance problems while averting any potential problems that might occur if player data needs to be reset.</p>



<p><strong>Illuvium: Zero</strong> is a game about base building, resource extraction, and blueprint creation. Players can opt to produce <strong>Fuel</strong> (which powers players in the <strong>Illuvium</strong> <strong>Overworld</strong>), materials for growth and crafting, or blueprints for <strong>NFT Overworld</strong> and <strong>Arena skins.</strong></p>

<p>The game offers players a variety of tactical alternatives and judgment calls. Everything from building placement (some buildings fit together better than others), resource management, market work, and Illuvial research for blueprints are crucial decision points.</p>



<p><strong>Season 1</strong> of the game will follow <strong>Season 0</strong>, and it will last up until the open beta phase. At the conclusion of <strong>Season 1</strong>, another data reset is anticipated.</p>

<p>It will slowly but certainly work with intriguing projects in the near future to open up new return sources and investment opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>Mean</strong> <strong>Finance</strong> is the state-of-the-art DCA open protocol that enables users (or <strong>dApps</strong>) to <strong>DCA</strong> <strong>any ERC20 into any ERC20 </strong>with their preferred period frequency without sacrificing decentralization or giving up personal information to any centralized parties.</p>



<p><strong>DCA</strong> is a tool an investor can use to build savings and wealth over a long period while neutralizing the short-term volatility in the market.</p>

<p>The purchases occur regardless of the asset&#8217;s price and at regular intervals. In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of assets at the best prices.</p>



<p>The protocol is designed in such a way that users get protection against volatility while market makers are well-incentivized to execute the trades.</p>



<p>Users can get protection against market volatility, MEV-protected trades, and gas-less DCA. Market makers can leverage the whole protocol balance to execute the trade, earn a percentage of the fees, and arbitrage the Mean Finance pool.</p>

<p><strong>Gamma</strong> <strong>Strategies</strong> will also be releasing various structured <strong>LP</strong> <strong>solutions</strong> for risk-tolerant and risk-averse <strong>LPs</strong> in the interim, along with new strategies and descriptions on its web app.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gamma Strategies officially launches on <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@arbitrum</a> ! <a href="https://t.co/zOnVunNQSj" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/zOnVunNQSj</a></p>&mdash; Gamma (@GammaStrategies) <a href="https://twitter.com/GammaStrategies/status/1607863942176456705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 27, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The protocol caters to persons with various risk appetites and opinions on volatility by providing both <strong>wide and narrow dynamic range strategies</strong>. Narrower ranges are consequently more short volatility because the act of liquidity provision itself is a position that is short volatility.</p>



<p>Additionally, it provides pegged price techniques, which tighten the liquidity bands around the net asset value of liquid-staked derivatives, maximizing fee income with little temporary loss.</p>



<p>In the long run, bigger ranges will probably outperform narrower ranges, but in the short run, when volatility is low, narrow holdings can outperform wider positions by a significant margin. The LP&#8217;s strategy is determined by its risk appetite and opinion on volatility. Even a hybrid of the two stances is possible.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2212.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2212-1024x538.png" alt="Gamma Strategies Officially Launches On Arbitrum" class="wp-image-156344" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2212-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2212-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2212-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2212-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2212-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2212.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Gamma Strategies Officially Launches On Arbitrum 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, <strong>liquidity is made available around an asset&#8217;s net value</strong>. Because the protocol did not provide liquidity when the market price materially deviated from the net asset value, this technique avoided temporary loss. It can supply liquidity where the price is most likely to trade since we anticipate that the market price will eventually converge to the net asset value.</p>



<p><strong>Gamma</strong> <strong>Strategies</strong> also released high-volume pairs across multiple fee tiers and strategies. It anticipates launching additional pairs and collaborating with more protocols on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/142523-arbitrum-ecosystem-overview-p1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a> in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<p>Thena is the native liquidity layer of the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154719-bnb-chain-becomes-largest-layer1-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BNB Chain</a>, facilitating value creation by opening the gates for both established protocols searching for a long-term solution to lower costs to reward their liquidity and for new protocols wishing to tackle the cold start liquidity challenge.</p>



<p>The DEX is a shared resource held by protocols and users, who both help to make <strong>Thena</strong> the dominant <strong>automated market maker</strong> <strong>(AMM)</strong>. To beat the competition and establish your product as the market leader in a decentralized and open-source economy, you need a collaborative strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Thena</strong> takes on these challenges and offers an appealing solution by fixing the fundamental flaws of <strong>Solidly</strong>, an AMM and a liquidity layer initially created by <strong>Andre</strong> <strong>Cronje</strong> on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155691-fantom-will-focus-on-dapp-ecosystem-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantom</a>.</p>



<p>To recap, Solidly&#8217;s core innovation went beyond just rewarding liquidity to correlate protocol emissions with fees produced. By acquiring and locking <strong>THE</strong>, our native token, protocols, and other major stakeholders would be able to direct future emissions and collect fees (referred to as bribes in <strong>Solidly</strong>) from the pools they supported, so controlling the emissions.</p>



<p>The DEX had previously intended to introduce the mainnet on <strong>December 29</strong>. Due to a flaw discovered in its bug bounty program, the debut date has been postponed.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum Layer2 scaling solution Taiko announced the launch of its first public testnet, Snæfellsjökull.</em></li>



<li><em>Smart contracts can now be made available to users on the testnet by developers. A Layer 2 node may also be run by participants. Users cannot extend their nodes into provers at this time, and the testnet cannot produce validity proofs. Future testnet releases will address the issue.</em></li>



<li><em>Taiko is a ZK-Rollup that strives to be Ethereum- and EVM-equivalent, enabling it to support all current Ethereum smart contracts, DApps, developer tooling, and infrastructure.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Ethereum scaling solution Layer 2 Snaefellsjökull, the name of Taiko&#8217;s first public testnet, has been launched.</strong></h5>

<p>Smart contracts can now be made available to users on the testnet by developers. A Layer 2 node may also be run by participants.</p>



<p>Users cannot extend their nodes into provers at this time, and the testnet cannot produce validity proofs. Future testnet releases will address the issue.</p>



<p><strong>Validity</strong> <strong>proofs</strong> are not included in the testnet. This testnet release won&#8217;t create any <strong>ZKPs</strong>.</p>



<p>Additionally, pre-deployed <strong>dApps</strong> do not show up on the testnet. The only out-of-the-box supported user activities are bridging between <strong>L2</strong> and <strong>L1</strong> and sending <strong>ETH</strong> or <strong>ERC20</strong> to pals. Any developer can make their smart contract or <strong>dApp</strong> available to all users by deploying it.</p>



<p><strong>Taiko</strong> scales <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156275-ethereum-eth-has-increased-in-liquidity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> in a manner that emulates <strong>Ethereum</strong> as closely as possible &#8211; both technically and non-technically. More specifically, <a href="https://mirror.xyz/labs.taiko.eth/oRy3ZZ_4-6IEQcuLCMMlxvdH6E-T3_H7UwYVzGDsgf4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taiko</a> is an <strong>Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup</strong>, scaling Ethereum by <strong>supporting all EVM opcodes in a layer-2 architecture that is decentralized, permissionless, and secure.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gemini Earn Trust,</strong> a program that offers investors up to<strong> 8%</strong> interest on their holdings, is the subject of the event. However, last month, following the <strong>FTX</strong> issue and a severe liquidity situation faced by its principal partner <strong>Genesis</strong> <strong>Global</strong>, <strong>Gemini</strong> was forced to halt withdrawals from its <strong>Earn</strong> <strong>product</strong> quickly.</p>



<p>According to a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-28/gemini-winklevoss-twins-sued-for-fraud-over-interest-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em> story, disgruntled investors have launched a lawsuit against two founders, accusing the company of fraud and breaking securities regulations.</p>



<p>Gemini <strong>“refused to honor any further investor redemptions, effectively wiping out all investors who still had holdings in the program,” </strong>the investors said in the filing. The investors claimed that if the goods had been registered, they would have received disclosures that would have improved their ability to evaluate the risks.</p>

<p>Midway through November, or shortly after the initial rumors of FTX&#8217;s liquidity problems, the exchange began to have significant problems with <a href="https://news.coincu.com/143160-gemini-earn-has-paused-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini Earn</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Gemini</strong> <strong>Earn</strong> hasn&#8217;t been accessible to users since it stopped allowing withdrawals in <strong>November</strong> because the platform has millions of dollars stranded on Genesis. According to certain estimates, the exchange customers may be owed up to<strong> $900 million</strong> by cryptocurrency lender <strong>Genesis</strong> and its parent business, <strong>Digital Currency Group (DCG).</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cameron</strong> <strong>Winklevoss</strong> said on Twitter on <strong>December 20 </strong>that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/145103-gemini-works-with-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini</a> has developed a strategy for the creditor committee to address the liquidity problems at <strong>Genesis</strong> and <strong>DCG</strong> and retrieve the assets.</p>



<p>Numerous account holders have filed arbitration claims against the exchange and <strong>Genesis</strong> as a result of the customer agreement&#8217;s specific reference to arbitration as the only method for resolving problems. Customers claim that <strong>Earn</strong> products deceived them into thinking they were quite safe.</p>

<p>The claimants contend that although the agreement contains language noting that the goods pose risks, including complete loss of assets, it was underemphasized in the exchange marketing.</p>
