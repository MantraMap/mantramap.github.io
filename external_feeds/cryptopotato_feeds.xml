			            <description><![CDATA[Large ADA holders remain unfazed by underwhelming price performance.  ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano remained locked in a narrow trading range lately with no volatility in sight. Over the past month, ADA was down by approximately 20%, trading at $0.29 as of now. While this trend has caused increasing frustration among market observers, ADA whales and sharks continued to be resilient.</p>
<p>In fact, this cohort of holders has continued to fill their bags with ADA tokens despite the stagnant price action.</p>
<h2>ADA Whales Show Resilience</h2>
<p>According to Santiment&#8217;s latest analysis, Cardano&#8217;s trader sentiment hasn&#8217;t fared well owing to the 35% decline in the crypto-asset&#8217;s market cap.</p>
<p>However, ADA sharks and whales have remained undeterred. The count of addresses on Cardano with over 100k ADA has rebounded to its peak level since April 2022. In a recent update, the blockchain intelligence platform <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1690983240730054656" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">tweeted</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Trader sentiment toward Cardano continues to be low as its market cap is down 35% since topping 4 months ago. However, the sharks &amp; whales haven&#8217;t been as deterred as one may think. There are now 25,294 wallets with 100K+ $ADA, the most in 16 months.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bull Run Soon?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-ada-whales-accumulate-heavily-below-0-30-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">accumulation</a> trend typically depicts a bullish momentum in the offing. The similar sentiment was echoed by another prominent analyst, Ali, who drew <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1690986678519832577" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">parallels</a> to a similar period of stagnancy between 2018 and 2020. During that phase, ADA&#8217;s price appeared to have oscillated between $0.10 and $0.028 for a total of 665 days.</p>
<p>The accumulation ended with a bull run of over 2,985%.</p>
<p>In the current scenario, the analyst observed that ADA has been trapped in the $0.46 to $0.24 range for 329 days already. If history is to repeat itself, the crypto-asset could potentially break free around February 2024, as per Ali&#8217;s estimation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key takeaway? Patience often pays in the crypto market, and those willing to wait will be rewarded.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even as ADA failed to perform, the Cardano ecosystem, as a whole, was reported to have grown significantly. This is evident from a recent Messari <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-records-impressive-49-qoq-growth-in-dapp-transactions-10-rise-in-tvl-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">report</a> that revealed an increase of 8.5% in Cardano&#8217;s average transaction in Q2 as compared to the previous quarter, going from $0.117 to $0.126. Moreover, the average daily transactions also grew by nearly 2% QoQ from 67,500 to 68,800.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement has remained stagnant after being rejected from the critical resistance zone at $30,000. However, it is currently consolidating near a pivotal support area, which includes both the 100-day moving average and the lower boundary of a multi-month ascending channel.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By</strong> <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>The daily chart analysis shows that the price entered a slight corrective phase at the beginning of July, marked by diminished volatility and subdued price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, BTC is gradually approaching a substantial support range comprising the 100-day moving average, positioned at $28,544, and the lower threshold of the ascending channel, situated at around $28,500. This particular price range holds significant importance as robust support that could potentially prevent additional declines.</p>
<p>However, the current price action within this pivotal support area suggests the prevalence of market indecision, evident from the formation of small and directionless candles. Consequently, if the price receives support and witnesses strengthened buying pressure, market participants could anticipate a decisive reversal in price.</p>
<p>Conversely, in the absence of such support, the price might breach the mentioned support levels, subsequently triggering a cascade effect toward the noteworthy support zone at $25,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266304" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266304" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-266304 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_1408231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266304" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, it is observable that the price appears to be constrained within a static range, oscillating between the resistance at $30,000 and the minor support at $28,000. At present, Bitcoin is consolidating close to the critical 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, displaying efforts to avoid a downward breach.</p>
<p>Considering the likelihood of the price undergoing a temporary corrective phase, it is reasonable to regard the price range marked by the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels as the most probable target for this movement. Therefore, a positive response within this defined range could potentially pave the way for a fresh upward trend, propelling the price toward the significant resistance level at $30,000.</p>
<p>However, in the event that the price breaks below the range outlined by the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels, it may provoke an impulsive plunge toward the support region around the $25K mark.</p>

<h2><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/tradingrage?lang=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index</strong></h3>
<p>Although Bitcoin&#8217;s price has remained relatively stable, there are significant developments taking place behind the scenes. The Bitcoin Coinbase premium index measures the percentage difference between Coinbase Pro price (USD pair) and Binance price(USDT pair). Positive premium values indicate stronger buying pressure by US investors in Coinbase, while negative values suggest selling pressure by Americans.</p>
<p>US investors include financial institutions and wealthy individuals interested in the crypto market. Therefore, analyzing their behavior can provide valuable insight.</p>
<p>As the chart depicts, this metric has been showing negative values over the past few weeks, pointing to the fact that American investors are selling their BTC. If this pattern continues and the market fails to break above $30K, the price might reverse to the downside in the short term due to excess supply.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York revoked Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) bail on Friday, August 11, the former CEO and disgraced founder of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has spent three nights at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn (MDC Brooklyn).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for SBF, MDC Brooklyn is considered one of the worst prisons in New York City and is infamous for its horrible conditions and inmate maltreatment. Judge Kaplan acknowledged that the detention center “is not on anybody’s list of five-star facilities.”</p>
<h2>SBF Detained at MDC Brooklyn</h2>
<p>Federal prosecutors <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/doj-wants-sbf-detained-and-his-bail-revoked-following-witness-tampering-efforts/" data-wpel-link="internal">sought</a> to reverse SBF’s $250 million bail in July after he attempted to tamper with witnesses. At the time of the request, the FTX founder was under <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-a-250m-bail-can-stay-at-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">house arrest</a> at his parent’s $4 million home in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice pushed to revoke the bail because SBF’s activities, including using a virtual private network to conceal his internet activities, violated his bail conditions. The 31-year-old former CEO also reached out to FTX’s general counsel, suggesting that they become resourceful to each other.</p>
<p>To crown it all, he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/caroline-ellison-felt-unsuited-to-run-alameda-amid-sbf-relationship-drama/" data-wpel-link="internal">leaked</a> the private writings of Caroline Ellison, his ex-girlfriend and former CEO of FTX sister trading firm Alameda Research, to a New York Times reporter. As per the Justice Department’s accusations, SBF attempted to cast Ellison in a negative light to make her look like a jilted lover, thereby discrediting her as a witness in his upcoming trial.</p>

<h2>One of the Worst Prisons in NYC</h2>
<p>Following the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-sent-to-jail-for-witness-tampering-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">hearing </a>Friday, SBF was moved to MDC Brooklyn, a U.S. federal administrative detention facility housing both male and female prisoners of all security levels. Originally built to accommodate 1,000 inmates, the center houses more than 1,600 prisoners.</p>
<p>Lawyers have complained about overflowing toilets, plastic in inmates’ meals, and contaminated water, amongst other horrific living conditions at the MDC. On one occasion during winter in 2019, inmates suffered days without heat, electricity, and hot meals due to a power outage. Prisoners who <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/16/metropolitan-detention-center-mdc-brooklyn-jail/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">protested</a> the conditions were pepper sprayed, thrown in solitary confinement, and had their toilets shut down.</p>
<p>The MDC has held high-profile individuals like American singer cum convicted sex offender R. Kelly, child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, and American rapper Fetty Wap.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SBF’s lawyers disclosed their intent to appeal Judge Kaplan’s decision.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Zug, Switzerland, August 14th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://www.synesis.one/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Synesis One,</a> the world’s first AI data crowdsourcing platform on the Solana Blockchain, announced today the launch of its new Train2Earn App ‘Workspace by Synesis’ on iOS, Android, Saga, and web browsers. The App allows anyone, anywhere in the world to train AI and earn rewards.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Workspace App is a significant leap forward in our mission to provide high quality data to companies developing AI applications,” said Paul Lee M.D., Cofounder and CEO of Synesis One. “We designed the Synesis One platform to connect companies that need quality AI training data with digital workers who can generate the data quickly, and at competitive prices.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The need for high-quality data to train and refine AI models is growing at an exponential rate, as nearly every industry from financial services to health care is starting to integrate AI into their business processes. Without data, AI models are basically useless: they can&#8217;t make connections or find patterns or make predictions. That’s why humans are still needed to train AI systems.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re a bit like Wikipedia,” says Paul. “Synesis One workers are contributing and refining data every day. But unlike Wikipedia, our contributors are paid for their contributions. That&#8217;s why we call our business model Train2earn. They train AI and earn rewards.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The applications for Synesis One are limitless. “Train2Earn is the first enterprise-quality on-chain software where business logic is conducted entirely on blockchain,” said Synesis One Head of Product and CTO David Saccon. “This means the provenance of our crowdsourced data is fully traceable and auditable. We believe we are providing a critical component for a new type of open data supply chain to power AI applications.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="ql-align-justify">In addition to crypto payments, the Train2Earn platform also uses the blockchain to enable a public voting process in which contributors reach consensus about the quality of the submitted data. The result is a web3 application that is secure, decentralized, and interoperable.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Worldcoin is equal parts wonder and terror.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to push the boundaries of human ingenuity, revolutionizing industries and augmenting our capabilities. Yet, as we marvel at its advancements, the ethical concerns surrounding AI grow more pressing.</p>
<p>Social media is slowly becoming a breeding ground for AI-powered deep fakes and counterfeits that pose significant risks, as they can convincingly manipulate audio, video, and other forms of content, leading to misinformation, identity theft, erosion of trust, and triggering widespread social and economic disruption.</p>
<p>This is where Worldcoin comes in with its audacious proposal to utilize orbs for ocular scanning in exchange for a digital ID. Tools for Humanity (TFH) is the company behind Worldcoin, which is co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman along with Alex Blania and Max Novendstern. The project seeks to build a decentralized proof-of-personhood solution.</p>
<p>However, it has ignited a fiery debate at the crossroads of convenience and privacy. The Orwellian undertones have led critics to fear that the unblinking gaze of the orbs could lead to a dystopian surveillance state.</p>

<h2>Why Worldcoin?</h2>
<p>The digital landscape of 2023 can frequently resemble an unending gauntlet of concealed hazards. Fraudsters employ a wide array of tactics to lure individuals into clicking on deceptive links to siphon their funds. Meanwhile, social media platforms are teeming with unchecked bot activity, further complicating the online experience.</p>
<p>To tackle this, Worldcoin was unveiled in 2021 with the objective of discovering a definitive method for discerning between human users and artificial intelligence (AI). Such a scenario where all online individuals can unequivocally establish their human identity is expected to substantially reduce scams and imposters.</p>
<p>At heart, Worldcoin’s proof-of-personhood stems from the idea that as AI generates a myriad of content alongside a surge in spam, the imperative to establish the authenticity of an individual as a unique real person, as opposed to a bot or another individual, becomes significantly important.</p>
<h2>How Does Worldcoin Work?</h2>
<p>Worldcoin hopes to provide a reliable way to authenticate humans online called World ID with a threefold objective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishment of a distinctive global digital identity &#8211; World ID</li>
<li>Introduction of a global currency in the form of &#8211; the Worldcoin token (WLD),</li>
<li>Development of &#8211; World App &#8211; to facilitate payments with WLD alongside other crypto-assets and fiat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals are required to scan their eyes using a spherical device known as the Orb. This process ensures the authenticity of each participant as a human and guarantees a single registration per person. The significance of this distinct identifier becomes increasingly pronounced in light of the advancing AI landscape, where distinguishing between human and machine holds paramount importance.</p>
<p>Similar to fingerprints, irises possess unique characteristics for each individual. The Orb utilizes the iris structure of the individual&#8217;s eyes to generate a specialized code, functioning as their exclusive identifier. This code is subsequently stored within the decentralized Worldcoin blockchain, safeguarding it against replication attempts by others. Importantly, the scanning procedure anonymizes the data, rendering it impossible to trace back to the individual after the identifier has been established.</p>
<p>Worldcoin is currently working on expanding its practice of &#8220;orbing&#8221; individuals by establishing centers in over 35 countries and continuing to grow its footprint.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266282" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover.jpg" alt="" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Tokenomics</h2>
<p>Worldcoin’s native ERC-20 token, WLD, was officially launched on July 24, 2023, after three years of development.</p>
<p>The initial supply of WLD tokens will be capped at 10 billion for a duration of 15 years. Following this period, the network&#8217;s governance will determine to introduce an inflation rate of up to 1.5% and devise allocation methods for the tokens newly brought into circulation.</p>
<p>75% of the initial token allocation of the 10 billion tokens will be funneled to users, the ecosystem fund, and network operations. Meanwhile, 10% will go to the founding team, 13.5% will be directed to investors, and 1.7% will be used for reserves.</p>
<h2>Buying Worldcoin (WLD) Tokens</h2>
<p>WLD has been listed across various major centralized exchanges (CEXs), like Binance, Huobi, Bybit, and OKX, among others, enabling users to purchase the token or even trade for other crypto or stake it.</p>
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap are also available for users to acquire the WLD token.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manipulation Risks:</strong> Despite Worldcoin&#8217;s endeavors to hinder unauthorized access to World IDs beyond one&#8217;s own, there remain loopholes through which individuals can exploit vulnerabilities to obtain multiple World IDs.</li>
<li><strong>Data Privacy Concerns:</strong> World ID enables users to verify their “humanness” online while maintaining their privacy through zero-knowledge proofs and does not store entire sensitive biometric data. Despite this, concerns exist that sensitive data may be exposed in some way, especially in the event of a data breach.</li>
<li><strong>Centralization:</strong> While decentralization represents Worldcoin&#8217;s ultimate goal, its achievement hinges on the successful execution of implementation in the upcoming forthcoming stages. Also, not all components of the protocol, including the Orb&#8217;s firmware, are open source. To top that, operations such as data centers that store the hashes of iris scans and the Orb’s production and distribution are centralized too.</li>
<li><strong>Security Risks Associated With Orb:</strong> Achieving absolute security in hardware systems is virtually impossible. Hence, the security of the Orb presents a significant potential hazard, exposing it to vulnerabilities like fraud, theft, etc.</li>
<li><strong>WLD Volatility:</strong> Similar to other cryptocurrencies, the price of the WLD token may undergo substantial fluctuations as well. Hence, it is important for investors to exercise caution and engage in comprehensive research prior to considering an investment in the token.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Regulatory Pushback</h2>
<p>While Worldcoin itself aims to counter bots and fake virtual identities facilitated by AI, the project has had its fair share of critics since it revolves around the use of biometric data.</p>
<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s aspirations of establishing a global protocol currently appear fraught with challenges. This can be attributed to the mounting regulatory challenges and compliance intricacies as the project maneuvers through varied local legal frameworks across the globe.</p>
<p>The project is facing multiple investigations and regulatory troubles for its operations, with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/kenya-authorities-suspend-worldcoin-activities-over-data-privacy-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Kenya</a> being the first country to suspend its operations over the methodology employed for data collection. Subsequently, its Nairobi-based warehouse was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/kenyan-police-raided-worldcoin-warehouse-in-nairobi-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">raided</a> by the authorities.</p>
<p>Argentina’s Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/another-country-begins-investigating-sam-altmans-worldcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">initiated</a> an investigation on Worldcoin to determine whether it complies with security and privacy rules.</p>
<p>In addition to Germany&#8217;s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority &#8211; BaFin &#8211; monitoring the project, Bavaria&#8217;s data watchdog has also launched a privacy and security assessment. France and the United Kingdom have also raised concerns about the legality of Worldcoin&#8217;s collection of biometric data.</p>
<p>Worldcoin has not yet launched its WLD token in the United States.</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Worldcoin’s launch has been one of the key highlights of the year. Privacy advocates view the project to be a Black Mirror-esque reality weighing down the financial market. The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/worldcoins-iris-scanning-approach-deemed-evil-security-expert-predicts-high-probability-of-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reluctance</a> to purchase the WLD token by many experts in the crypto sector is evident.</p>
<p>Today, the conversation revolves around the potential unprecedented level of oversight and control that Worldcoin creators might get their hands on. Hence, only time will reveal whether the ambitious venture is a cautionary tale or technology to strive for.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP ($XRP) has continued to face selling pressure in the past few days, with the token’s value dropping to $0.627.</p>
<p>The token&#8217;s recent struggles have been linked to lingering regulatory uncertainty following the SEC&#8217;s decision to appeal Ripple Labs&#8217; recent court victory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, excitement continues to build around the XRP20 ($XRP20) presale, which has now raised over $2.7 million as it trends toward its hard cap.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266265" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="344" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2>$XRP Struggles for Momentum as Technicals Turn Bearish</h2>
<p>XRP&#8217;s value has declined by 6% since Friday, with the token closing in the red for four straight days.</p>
<p>After a minor pump last Tuesday, the price has returned to a downward trend as the SEC&#8217;s appeal weighed on investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Price failed to break the critical $0.650 level, which was rejected with a long wick on Wednesday.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266264" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="284" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This has caused $XRP to create a minor support zone around $0.625, where the price has consolidated in the past 48 hours.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, $XRP is now tapping the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), often used as a proxy for a token&#8217;s medium-term trend.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily time frame stands at 43, signaling the token’s bearish momentum.</p>
<p>However, trading volumes remain robust, with <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap data</a> showing that over $881 million in $XRP traded hands in the past day – a 76% increase from the previous day.</p>
<h2>Lingering Lawsuit Uncertainty Dampens Investors’ Spirits</h2>
<p>The main driver of XRP’s recent struggles is the lingering regulatory uncertainty after the SEC announced plans to appeal the court’s ruling in Ripple’s favor.</p>
<p>The threat of a prolonged legal battle has dampened investor enthusiasm, leading some to exit their positions rather than face ongoing price volatility.</p>
<p>Until the lawsuit&#8217;s outcome is decisively resolved, either through a settlement or a rejection of the SEC&#8217;s appeal, the uncertainty around $XRP will likely persist.</p>
<p>This will make it difficult for $XRP to recapture the bullish momentum showcased in mid-July.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266263" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="319" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19-300x159.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, many crypto influencers and analysts continue to be optimistic about $XRP’s prospects.</p>
<p>Edo Farina, a crypto analyst with over 73,000 Twitter followers, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/edward_farina/status/1690766446890975232?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweeted about $XRP’s historical resistance in the face of uncertainty</a> – speculating that the token will also be able to navigate the current headwinds easily.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether this optimistic outlook comes to fruition, but Farina’s tweets highlight that some still see a bright future for $XRP.</p>
<h2>Investors Flock to Limited-Time XRP20 Presale As Project Hits $2.7 Million Milestone</h2>
<p>As XRP grapples with familiar regulatory woes, the new <a href="https://bs_b791c467.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=xrp-price-struggles-amid-investor-uncertainty-but-xrp20-presale-hits-2-7-million-milestone" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20 token</a> continues to gain traction by positioning itself as a “second chance” for crypto investors.</p>
<p>The XRP20 presale has now raised an impressive $2.7 million as it heads closer to its $3.68 million hard cap.</p>
<p>By leveraging investors’ nostalgia for XRP’s early days, the project has resonated with investors – priming it for a highly-anticipated DEX launch in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>XRP20 incorporates several valuable features, like staking rewards and a deflationary token burn, which help boost the token&#8217;s inherent value.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266262" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="277" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13-300x138.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the low presale price of $0.000092, 30 times cheaper than XRP’s all-time low, has also contributed to the growing buzz around the project.</p>
<p>This enthusiasm has spread to <a href="https://t.me/XRP20_coin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20’s Telegram channel</a>, which has seen remarkable growth in the past few days.</p>
<p>Early adopters have also highlighted <a href="https://xrp20coin.com/assets/documents/audit.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20’s clean smart contract audit</a>, conducted by 0xGuard, as another factor that underscores the project&#8217;s legitimacy.</p>
<p>With the presale nearly 75% complete, the countdown is on for $XRP20&#8217;s open market debut.</p>
<p>Thus, as XRP stumbles, investors are flocking to XRP20 – suggesting an exciting few weeks lie ahead for early adopters.</p>

<h2>2. Sellers Absent</h2>
<p>This is a buyers&#8217; market, and PEPE&#8217;s price did not hesitate to show it. In the past week, sellers were absent as the volume profile closed in the green for six consecutive days, and today is also about to do the same.</p>

<h2>3. Breakout on RSI</h2>
<p>The daily RSI has made a higher high. This is very good news for PEPE holders as it indicates that the price wants to go much higher. It&#8217;s important to pay close attention to how today&#8217;s candle closes and if the RSI will continue to show a higher high.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for PEPE is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for PEPE Price</h2>
<p>The trend remains firmly on the bullish side for this cryptocurrency, and buyers don&#8217;t seem satisfied. Therefore, it&#8217;s possible for the price to initiate a test of $0.00000149 next if this momentum continues.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple's XRP might be in for some action this week. Here are two important things to watch.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP might be in for increased volatility throughout the coming days as there are some interesting upcoming developments that may fuel market participation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the price has been on a somewhat sluggish path throughout the past couple of weeks, demonstrating a clear lack of major volatility and an overall downward movement. Is this bound to change soon?</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s Expected Stance on SEC Appeal Request</h2>
<p>As <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-lead-lawyer-slams-secs-appeal-request-reveals-important-date/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> earlier last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed an interlocutory brief showing its intention to appeal the ruling of Judge Analisa Torres.</p>
<p>Recall that back in July, Judge Torres was the one who ruled partially in favor of Ripple, claiming that secondary sales of XRP failed to constitute an investment contract.</p>
<p>The SEC had previously expressed its intention to appeal, which was formalized last week. The Chief Legal Officer of Ripple Labs &#8211; Stuart Alderoty &#8211; responded to the development, slamming their attempts.</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC does not have the “right” to appeal just yet which is why they are asking permission to file an “interlocutory” appeal. Ripple will file its response with the Court next week. Stay tuned.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the market is currently anticipating Ripple&#8217;s response to the filing, which may as well fuel some additional participation and result in increased volatility.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ripple_lawyer_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265524" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ripple_lawyer_cover.jpg" alt="ripple_lawyer_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ripple_lawyer_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ripple_lawyer_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ripple_lawyer_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ripple_lawyer_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ripple_lawyer_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>XRP Price Approaching Critical Support</h2>
<p>From a technical perspective, the XRP price is also approaching a very important support zone. The level in question lies around $0.55.</p>
<p>It holds the potential to stop further downward movement and even initiate an upward rally that might target the critical $0.8 threshold. This is because the zone also includes the pivotal 100-day moving average.</p>
<p>In addition, XRP formed a very rare technical price pattern known as a golden cross on the 3-day chart. It happens when a lower timeframe moving average crosses above a longer timeframe moving average.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s widely considered to be a bullish pattern and a very rare one, to that. It has only taken place twice before in XRP price&#8217;s entire history.</p>

The involvement of experienced Advisory Board members ensures that BTCX Token will solidify its innovative presence in the market.</p>
<p>BTCX Token&#8217;s unique approach in the form of the combustion model represents a systematic means of controlling supply.

This simplification and democratization of staking marks a significant milestone, setting it apart from more traditional and volatile avenues. By rewarding stakers, BTCX Token aligns user interests with network growth, creating a mutually beneficial environment. This alignment of incentives fosters community participation and engagement, a crucial factor for enduring success in the rapidly changing crypto world.</p>
<p>The Tokenomics of BTCX Token are intricately woven into the fabric of its design, ensuring long-term viability and a deep commitment to growth. With a total supply of 21,000,000 BTCX Token, the structure includes 5,250,000 BTCX Token for presale, 8,610,000 BTCX Token for burning, 5,040,000 BTCX Token as a reward for staking, and 2,100,000 BTCX Token for liquidity. The presale of BTCX Token Token allowed investors to buy at attractive prices, reflecting the community&#8217;s confidence in this groundbreaking project. By staying attuned to market needs and trends, BTCX Token demonstrates adaptability, a vital factor in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s ideology is firmly rooted in inspiration and innovation, and it&#8217;s poised to pave the way for the next Bitcoin era, offering solutions, opportunities, and a vision for the future.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has been stuck in a state of indecision between buyers and sellers, resulting in small candle formations and steady consolidation over the past few months.</p>
<p>However, ETH faces a crucial price region that could potentially determine its short-term trajectory.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has been struggling with the 100-day moving average for an extended period of time. The price action has remained subdued and characterized by small candle formations lacking a distinct directional bias.</p>
<p>A significant support zone has emerged, encompassing the 100-day and 200-day moving averages at $1850 and $1792, respectively. If the price finds support within this range, it could trigger a strong upward movement, aiming to breach the $2K resistance level.</p>
<p>Conversely, if selling pressure escalates and the price drops below the moving averages, it could potentially initiate a cascade effect, driving Ethereum&#8217;s value toward the noteworthy support zone at $1.7K. In the broader context, the cryptocurrency appears to be moving within a range, fluctuating between the price levels of $2K and $1.7K. A decisive breakout from this pivotal price range is likely to define Ethereum&#8217;s overarching long-term trend.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266195" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-266195 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_1408231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETH-Daily-1-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266195" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Zooming in on the 4-hour timeframe, ETH appears to be confined within a narrower range, with substantial resistance at $2K and a minor support area around $1.8K.</p>
<p>The current price action indicates an attempt to breach the lower threshold of this range. However, the static support at $1.8K has played a significant role in preventing further downward movement. Notably, when the price approached this level, it triggered the formation of bullish candles and a minor rebound.</p>
<p>If this specific price zone continues to provide support, it could facilitate a significant upward surge, with the potential to retest the substantial resistance at $2K. Conversely, if selling pressure intensifies and breaks through this support, ETH might experience a decline toward the major support level at $1.7K.</p>
<p>In either scenario, ETH&#8217;s long-term outlook will remain uncertain until a decisive breakout occurs beyond the initial range defined by the $2K and $1.7K price boundaries.</p>

<h1>On-chain Analysis</h1>

<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price action has been relatively silent in recent months, with consolidation occurring around the $2,000 mark. However, noteworthy developments have been unfolding behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The provided chart illustrates the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index, featuring the inclusion of a 30-day moving average. This particular measure is calculated by analyzing the price difference between ETH on Coinbase and Binance, the two most prominent global exchanges. The significance of this metric lies in its capacity to indicate whether U.S. investors are collectively engaged in purchasing or selling compared to others. Positive readings suggest a surge in buying interest originating from the United States.</p>
<p>As depicted in the chart, there has been a substantial shift in sentiment within the U.S. market, as evidenced by the noticeable downward trend in the premium index. This alteration in sentiment holds significance due to the fact that numerous U.S. investors are wealthy individuals or institutional entities.</p>
<p>This behavior might cast a pessimistic light on ETH&#8217;s prospects, implying that these investors might not be inclined to accumulate ETH within this price range, possibly signifying a bearish sentiment prevailing in the market.</p>
