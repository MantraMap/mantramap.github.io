<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>IBM is expecting to pause hiring for &#8220;back-office&#8221; roles that could be potentially automated by AI.</em></li>



<li><em>IBM CEO Arvind Krishna expects 30% of &#8220;back-office&#8221; positions to be replaced by AI over the next five years.</em></li>



<li><em>AI-based automation has already helped IBM save well over $1 billion in business expenses and maintenance costs.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This move is part of the company&#8217;s effort to adopt AI technology to improve its operations, reduce business expenses, and increase efficiency.</p>



<p>IBM CEO Arvind Krishna explained in a May 1 interview with Bloomberg that many &#8220;back-office&#8221; positions such as those in the human resources and accounting departments will likely be the first to be automated by AI. According to Krishna, AI has the potential to replace around 30% of these positions over a five-year period. This means that around 7,800 jobs could be handed over to AI, out of the 26,000 non-customer-facing staff that IBM has.</p>



<p>Despite this, Krishna thinks that human resource roles that evaluate workforce composition, measure productivity, and other tasks that benefit from human judgement likely won&#8217;t be replaced over the next decade. Many industry pundits remain at crossroads on whether AI actually has the potential to leave humans without work on a mass scale.</p>



<p>A recent study found that 62% of Americans think that implementing artificial intelligence in the workplace will have a &#8220;major impact&#8221; on workers within the next 20 years, leaving many employees feeling &#8220;wary&#8221; and &#8220;worried&#8221; about what their future holds. However, more tech-savvy employees feel slightly more secure about their future, believing that AI will only serve as a tool to increase efficiency, rather than wipe out their jobs.</p>



<p>In fact, some blockchain developers such as Salman Arshad and Syed Ghazanfer believe that the combination of human input and AI technology offers much more versatility than a complete transition to AI automation. They view ChatGPT and AI tools as a &#8220;blessing&#8221; rather than enemies, and that they are not here to end the career of a developer.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Dominik Schiener, the founder of the IOTA Foundation, believes that AI will take away employment opportunities from humans, but at the same time, AI and robotic process will create new jobs. He predicts that we&#8217;ll see more and more humans being forced to pivot to new roles that may look nothing like anything they&#8217;ve ever done.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Poloniex will pay $7.6 million in fines for numerous sanctions breaches.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange permitted consumers in sanctioned nations to trade and transfer more than $15.3 million in digital currencies in approximately 66,000 transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>The relevant offenses occurred between January 2014 and November 2019 and included activities in four countries.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Monday that it had reached a settlement with Poloniex LLC, a U.S. entity previously affiliated with the encryption exchange Poloniex, for violations of sanctions.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The exchange agreed to pay a $7.59 million settlement. OFAC said the platform had nearly 66,000 violations of the sanctions program.</p>



<p>Poloniex was founded in January 2014, however, it did not implement a sanctions compliance program until May 2015. According to a Treasury document, the compliance program was also not retroactive, enabling consumers from sanctioned nations who were already on the site to continue using it.</p>



<p>Between January 2014 and November 2019, the exchange allowed clients in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria to conduct transactions totaling up to $15 million.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Although Poloniex made efforts to identify and restrict accounts with a nexus to Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Crimea and Syria pursuant to its compliance program, certain customers apparently located in these jurisdictions continued to use Poloniex’s platform to engage in online digital asset-related transactions,&#8221; OFAC said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Poloniex had enough KYC (know-your-customer) information and IP address data to know that the sanctions breaches occurred, according to the Treasury and OFAC. Despite the fact that it began monitoring IP addresses and collecting KYC information data in 2015, the exchange did not begin banning forbidden IP addresses until 2017.</p>

<p>Poloniex implemented limits by late 2017, which began to dramatically decrease infractions, according to OFAC. Circle purchased the exchange in February 2018 before selling it in 2019, according to the regulator, and the short takeover resulted in new regulations on the exchange.</p>



<p>Poloniex previously reached an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August 2021. It was found to be operating an unregulated digital currency exchange by the authority, and a $10.4 million settlement was struck.</p>



<p>Prior to the SEC settlement, Canada&#8217;s Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) started action against the corporation in May 2021. Despite these issues, Poloniex is still a popular exchange with a moderately high volume. In recent months, the site has also incorporated additional trading capabilities.</p>

<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to broaden market participation by processing trial applications for digital exchanges. While the Central Bank of Nigeria restricts cryptocurrency trading, the SEC is considering allowing tokenized coin offerings on licensed digital exchanges backed by assets such as equity, debt, and property. This move is expected to attract digitally-savvy individuals in the nation of over 200 million, including 43% of the population below the age of 14, to local assets like equities that have been shunned for years.</p>



<p>Paxful reports that Nigeria has the highest volume of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions outside the US. Other countries are also experimenting with similar tokens. For example, DBS Bank Ltd., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and Marketnode Pte are leading &#8220;Project Guardian&#8221; in Singapore, which aims to explore the potential uses of asset tokenization. It involves creating a permissioned liquidity pool with tokenized bonds and deposits.</p>



<p>The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to register fintech firms as digital sub-brokers, crowdfunding intermediaries, robo-advisors, fund managers, and tokenized coin issuers. Digital exchanges, however, will not be registered until standards are agreed upon with the central bank, which has banned cryptocurrency transactions. </p>



<p>Digital exchanges in the country will undergo a year of regulatory incubation, during which they will offer only skeletal services that will be monitored by the SEC. The SEC will study their operations and determine by the tenth month whether to register the firm, extend the incubation period, or ask the firm to stop operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a cooperative market maker of TUSD, the main purpose of TRON DAO Venture&#8217;s deposit of TUSD is to promote market making among TUSD&#8217;s leading exchanges, thereby improving liquidity and trading volume, rather than participating in any exchange promotions,&#8221; <a href="https://news.coincu.com/181358-justin-suns-withdrawal-sparks-crypto/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/181358-justin-suns-withdrawal-sparks-crypto/">Justin Sun</a> tweeted in response to Changpeng Zhao. Our market maker has reached a total trading volume of 40 million US dollars in the last several hours, contributing to the stability of the TUSD price. </p>



<p>According to him, certain team members did not fully comprehend the intended use of these money and, as a result, used some of them mistakenly to participate in exchange activities. When they realized their error, they immediately contacted the exchange team and arranged for a full refund. He also expressed regret for the oversight.</p>

<p>Today, Justin Sun sent 405 million TUSD to Binance in ten transactions, according to reports. Changpeng Zhao indicated that Justin Sun has been told not to use his TUSD in SUI new currency mining or he will take action against him.</p>



<p>Changpeng Zhao (CZ) issued a warning. CZ stated that if Sun uses TUSD to join Sui LaunchPool, he would face consequences. CZ further stressed that the Binance LaunchPool is intended for retail consumers, not just a few whales.</p>



<p>This event emphasizes the significance of transparency and effective money management in the cryptocurrency business. It is critical that all individuals involved understand the intended use of the funding and act properly and ethically. It is worth noting that TRON DAO Venture acts as a TUSD partner market maker, facilitating market-making between prominent TUSD exchanges rather than participating in exchange advertising.</p>

<p>BIT Mining has recently launched a new generation of mining machines, the LD4, designed explicitly for the Dogecoin and Litecoin blockchains. Boasting peak hashrate and energy efficiency, the LD4&#8217;s peak output can reach 5GH/s, making it the superior choice for Litecoin and Dogecoin mining. </p>



<p>The LD4 is the third ASIC mining machine developed by BIT Mining since its acquisition of mining hardware manufacturer Bee Computing in 2022. It has reliable design features such as excellent heat dissipation and a computing chip that can frequently work at lower temperatures, extending its lifecycle.</p>



<p>The LD4 boasts improved security features over the previous generation, with hardware and high-level security software protection against known vulnerabilities. Its single airflow channel design also enables the deployment of more machines in limited spaces, simplifying assembly and maintenance processes and lowering operational costs.</p>



<p>BIT Mining&#8217;s dedication to advancing the industry through state-of-the-art technology and increased efficiency positions the company as a technical leader. LD4&#8217;s advantages, such as its single airflow channel mining machine design and aluminum PCBs, make it a significant improvement from LD3 in terms of durability, portability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness.</p>



<p>BIT Mining is a cryptocurrency mining company driving the industry forward with innovative technology and increased efficiency. They specialize in cryptocurrency mining, mining pool, data center operation, and mining machinery manufacturing. </p>



<p>They own BTC.com, the world&#8217;s top blockchain browser, and operate a comprehensive mining pool that provides multi-currency mining services, including BTC, ETC, and LTC. BIT Mining also owns a 7nm cryptocurrency mining machine manufacturer, Bee Computing, which enables the company to be self-sufficient through vertical integration with its supply chain.</p>

The weekend auction, which received offers from JPMorgan Chase and PNC as well as interest from other institutions, was a &#8220;highly competitive bidding process,&#8221; according to the FDIC.</p>



<p>According to the regulator, the transaction will cost the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund an estimated $13 billion. In comparison, the SVB process cost the fund approximately $20 billion. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation announced Monday that it had taken custody of First Republic and designated the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver. JPMorgan&#8217;s bid for the bank&#8217;s assets was accepted by the FDIC.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;This acquisition benefits our company modestly overall, it is accretive to shareholders, it helps further advance our wealth strategy, and it is complementary to our existing franchise.&#8221;</p>



<p>Following the takeover, the Treasury Department sought to reassure Americans about the country&#8217;s financial system on Monday morning. According to a Treasury spokeswoman, the banking system remains strong and resilient, and Americans should be confidence in the safety of their savings and the banking system&#8217;s ability to fulfill its critical duty of providing credit to businesses and families.</p>

<li><em>According to Changpeng Zhao, the banking industry is becoming increasingly inefficient, and the collapse of banks has nothing to do with the development of encryption technologies.</em></li>



<li><em>He said that the most challenging issue is securing the support of banks, particularly if banks are extremely eager to cooperate and engage with encrypted companies. He thinks this will be the case if banks are particularly interested in working with encrypted enterprises.</em></li>

<p>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1lPKqBdRkbLGb?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1lPKqBdRkbLGb?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMA</a>, Binance CEO <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184404-changpeng-zhao-282-billion-wealth-assessed/">Changpeng Zhao</a> stated that the banking business is becoming increasingly inefficient, and that the failure of banks has nothing to do with the growth of encryption. Cryptocurrency is simply a method for people to invest. People do not jump into crypto after failing their banks since they want various forms of assets. </p>



<p>&#8220;The better the banking system, the better cryptocurrency.&#8221; He added that the developers should concentrate on making encryption easier to use. He believes that the largest issue in the face of regulation in various regions is the assistance of banks, if banks are especially eager to work and interact with encrypted firms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this method, the market may achieve true and convenient liquidity integration between the traditional financial system and the encrypted financial system, which benefits both sides. He stated that he believes bank support and education, particularly financial education, are extremely important and that we devote a significant amount of time and energy to them. Hong Kong is embracing cryptocurrency, which is a welcome move. As China&#8217;s &#8220;encryption testing ground,&#8221; I believe Hong Kong is prudent.</p>



<p>In addition, Changpeng Zhao has indicated that he does not participate in the process of listing projects on Binance and that he is not familiar with the majority of the projects that are listed there. The number of registered users on Binance is the primary factor considered by the independent committee that evaluates applications for listing on the exchange.</p>

This token nearly surpassed the top 100 largest coins on the market in the early afternoon of May 1, 2023, with a current market value of 451.5 million USD.</p>



<p>As a result, the green frog became the market&#8217;s third largest memecoin, trailing only two dogs, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Furthermore, the community anticipates that the &#8220;green frog&#8221; token will progress toward its goal of becoming a &#8220;billion dollar memecoin&#8221; comparable to DOGE and SHIB.</p>



<p>With market capitalizations of $400 million and $322.5 million, respectively, the growth of PEPE pushed BABYDOGE and FLOKI to fourth and fifth place. The PEPE community is celebrating the project&#8217;s top 100 milestone, which has resulted in the $PEPE keyword trending on Twitter recently.</p>

<p>Of course, with such rapid expansion, there is no shortage of &#8220;life-changing&#8221; examples made possible by PEPE. The unifying feature of these wallets is that, because to &#8220;early entry,&#8221; purchasing PEPE at a low cost makes it simple to open accounts. Despite being heavily promoted on all fronts by the community, investors must remain vigilant in order to assess risks and limit fomo at this time.</p>



<p>It is obvious that this meme coin has generated enormous profits, but the capitalization is currently too massive, making it difficult to increase several times. Furthermore, there are many large wallets (whale) holding a large amount of PEPE, so a profit-taking dump is not ruled out.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it is understandable for investors to be looking for other memecoins similar to PEPE or AIDOGE. To avoid &#8220;losing money,&#8221; however, it is vital to be vigilant of sophisticated fraudulent methods.</p>

<p>In recent news, Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, has made a significant transfer of 59 million TUSD to Binance. Sun stated that this transfer was intended solely to provide liquidity, but Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) responded with a warning. CZ said that if Sun uses TUSD to join Sui LaunchPool, action will be taken against him. CZ also emphasized that Binance LaunchPool is meant for retail users, not just for a few whales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will &quot;take action against it&quot;. SMH.<br><br>Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales.<br><br>On the bright side, blockchains are transparent&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/8Xs1oXjfVd" target="_blank">https://t.co/8Xs1oXjfVd</a></p>&mdash; CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1652949031524376579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This situation highlights the importance of transparency and proper use of funds in the cryptocurrency industry. It is essential for all parties involved to have a clear understanding of the intended purpose of the funds and to act responsibly and ethically. It is worth noting that TRON DAO Venture serves as a partner market maker for TUSD and aims to facilitate market-making between leading TUSD exchanges rather than participating in exchange promotions.</p>



<p>Later, Justin Sun revealed that some of his team members inadvertently used some funds to participate in exchange campaigns. Upon realizing their error, they promptly refunded the funds. This serves as a reminder that proper communication and management of funds are crucial, especially in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Regrettably, some of our team members were not fully aware of the intended purpose for these funds and inadvertently used a portion of them to participate in exchange campaigns.

</div></figure>



<p>On the bright side, this situation highlights the transparency of blockchains. The public nature of blockchain technology makes tracking and verifying transactions easier, ensuring that all actions are transparent and accountable.</p>



<p>As for the future relationship between TRON and Binance, it remains to be seen. Nevertheless, this event has brought attention to the need for clear communication and ethical use of funds in the cryptocurrency industry. This situation emphasizes the importance of responsible and transparent behavior to maintain the wider community&#8217;s trust.</p>
