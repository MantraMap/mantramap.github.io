This was when Cuban tried to approach the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> about finding the guidelines on how to register a crypto token. With this, he had boiled down to the real reason why crypto firms find it really difficult to register with the agency, as things stand in terms of the rules. This could also make an interesting case for discussions with lawmakers on crypto, as we head to the election year.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Cuban&#8217;s experience showed that most of the companies in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> would &#8220;love&#8221; to register with the SEC if the agency made it simpler to do so. Another important concern is the relatively high costs and delays when it comes to the registration timeline.</p>
<h2>When Mark Cuban Tried To Register A Token</h2>
<p>According to Marc Cuban, SEC Chair Gary Gensler does not understand three things about crypto and small businesses and start ups: difficulty with approval delay, legal fees and complex rules. He added that he would bet almost all of the companies would love to register with the SEC if these issues are fixed. There are &#8220;zero easy to follow guidelines&#8221; for small crypto start ups to follow, he <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1670131669096095744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I had someone who I work with call the SEC and ask them about how to register a token. Where could we find guidelines. They .. effectively told us that we should probably get a securities lawyer to help.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The investor stressed on the need for legal help for startups with small capital, when it comes to registration and compliance. All the SEC needs to do is make it easy and relatively inexpensive for firms to register, he concluded.</p>

It is generally perceived that his selective bias towards some mainstream companies that is harming the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>. Bigwigs like Wall Street bank JP Morgan and asset manager Blackrock are already in the game, but it is unclear as to how long it would take for US regulators to lay a clear path for crypto regulation. Also, the US presidential election 2024 could be a stumbling block amid efforts in that direction in Washington DC.</p>

<p>Very recently, the crypto market ecosystem in the United States faced a major blow in the form of back to back lawsuits against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. The SEC charged two of the world&#8217;s top crypto exchanges of violating securities laws.</p>
<h2>Raoul Pal On Crypto In US</h2>
<p>Earlier, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-to-be-reality-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Blackrock, the world’s largest assets manager, was filing for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) application with the SEC. This came after the company&#8217;s 2022 launch of a spot Bitcoin private trust. In this context, investment strategist Raoul Pal feels not all is in the red when it comes to SEC Chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s actions on crypto. Pal echoed XRP Lawyer John Deaton&#8217;s views that Gensler was in the crypto enforcement mode to make some way for incumbents to gain some market share before full scale regulation kicks in.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gensler is giving Blackrock the BTC ETF the nod and also got that Prometheum circus going to “prove” that he isn’t stopping crypto entirely. It’s all politics and in the end he throws a bone to Wall St so he can suggest they are “more trusted”.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The macro guru believes Gensler&#8217;s actions are &#8220;all politics&#8221; to throw &#8220;a bone to the Wall Street.&#8221; He also the mentioned the SEC&#8217;s recent &#8216;approval&#8217; of crypto firm Prometheum.</p>

<p>So, back to proper news. The million dollar class action lawsuit filed against Elon Musk for insider trading of cryptocurrency Dogecoin took a new turn today.  Elon Musk&#8217;s lawyer Alex Spiro revealed that Mr. Musk does not own any Dogecoin wallets that were part of price manipulation.</p>
<p>Earlier, a class action lawsuit was filed against the billionaire for allegedly manipulating price of Dogecoin and cashing out $95 Million in pump dump.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Wallets In Lawsuit Does Not Belong To Elon Musk?</h2>
<p>Elon Musk has publicly promoted Dogecoin on multiple occasions mostly to his large number of twitter followers. It was always believed that the billionaire is actually a Dogecoin holder. The ongoing proceedings in the lawsuit filed against Elon Musk particularly mention dogecoin wallets that benefitted from Elon Musk&#8217;s tweets between April 3rd, 2023 to April 9th, 2023.</p>
<blockquote><p>On April 3rd, 2023 <a href="https://coingape.com/why-elon-musk-changed-twitters-logo-to-dogecoin-doge/">Elon Musk changed twitter famous bird logo to Dogecoin</a> symbol representing a Shiba Inu Dog. This was followed by a massive rise of 25% in Dogecoin price in a single day.</p></blockquote>
<p>As reported by <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/15/elon-musk-denies-owning-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-wallets/" rel="nofollow">NY Post</a>, his lawyer today in the court blasted at plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer for assuming that the wallet in trial belong to billionaire Elon Musk. He argued that sole basis for the lawsuit is that these wallets belong to Elon and which is in fact wrong.</p>
<h2><strong>Does Elon Musk Own Dogecoin? </strong></h2>
<p>As falsely reported by many popular publishers, Elon Musk does not own any Dogecoin, but actually he has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/20/elon-musk-discloses-that-tesla-owns-dogecoin-but-how-much-does-it-have/" rel="nofollow">publicly admitted of owning cryptocurrencies</a> including Dogecoin. He may have other wallets which were never a part of pump dump. So, this FUD that Elon Musk is not owning any Dogecoin may be actually untrue.</p>
<p>In a tweet from, October 2021, Elon Musk shared that he own Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Out of curiosity, I acquired some ascii hash strings called “Bitcoin, Ethereum &amp; Doge”. That’s it. </p>
<p>As I’ve said before, don’t bet the farm on crypto! True value is building products &amp; providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452334458066149377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>We will keep you updated as and when we find actual Dogecoin wallets associated with Tesla CEO.</p>

<h2><b>XRP Price Daily Chart:</b></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower price rejection candles at the support trendline reflect increased demand pressure for the XRP price. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout above $0.487 resistance could kickstart a new recovery cycle </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $07.5 Million, indicating a 40% loss.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/SqDAAkJK.png" alt="XRP Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the XRP price trades at the $0.47 mark and wobbles in a narrow range created between the ascending trendline and the recently breached $0.487 support. The coin price has been wobbling in this range for the past three days and showcased uncertainty among traders with several short-bodied candles.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the market sentiment shows no improvement in the coming days, the XRP price is likely to prolong its consolation for a few more days. Thus, the aforementioned range can be marketed as a no-trading zone for newcomers.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering a bullish outlook, the breakout above the $0.487 resistance with daily candle closing will give additional confirmation for price reversal. Thus, a potential recovery initiated from the bottom trend could assist buyers to rechallenge the $0.55 mark, indicating a growth opportunity of 14%</span></p>
<h2><b>Will XRP Price Lose the $0.45 Mark?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For market buyers, the ascending trendline stands as a crucial support that sustains their bullish outlook. However, with the current negative sentiment, the possibility of trendline breakdown is not completely off the chart. Considering a pessimistic situation, a breakdown below the lower trendline will accelerate the selling pressure and can plunge the XRP price below $0.42</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Fibonacci Retracement level: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing correction in XRP price stayed above the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">FIB level</a> indicating the overall market trend is bullish.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upswing slope of the lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger band indicator</a> can offer significant support.</span></li>

The crypto exchange giant has been under scrutiny by the SEC for some time, ushering in a tense and uncertain period for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the regulatory cloud dissipating, CZ can now breathe a sigh of relief and focus on the future of Binance. In a </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1670076255633375236" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the crypto veteran stated that the mutually acceptable resolution will allow Binance move forward even though he highlighted that the SEC’s request for emergency relief was not necessary.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Although we maintain that the SEC&#39;s request for emergency relief was entirely unwarranted, we are pleased that the disagreement over this request was resolved on mutually acceptable terms.  </p>

<h2><b>Agreement Between Binance and US SEC</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a significant development, the US District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Amy Berman Jackson has approved the “Proposed Stipulation and Consent Order” agreed upon by Binance, Binance.US, and US SEC on Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-binance-us-reaches-deal-with-the-us-sec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consent order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed by Judge Jackson, Binance must “repatriate” all fiat currency and crypto assets related to Binance.US on or before the date the court issued the order.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the agreement </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-court-approves-binance-and-us-sec-agreement/?utm_source=cgtelegram"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stipulates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that only Binance.US employees will have access to customer funds on the US-based crypto exchange. This restriction aims to ensure that Binance.US maintains control over customer funds and can independently manage and safeguard them.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the agreement limits access for Binance Global officials, preventing them from accessing the private keys of all wallets, including both cold and hot wallets. </span></p>
<h2><b>Binance Looks Towards a Positive Direction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the difficulties and regulatory obstacles that Binance has encountered recently, CZ highlights that the firm is committed to continuing operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While expressing satisfaction over the resolved issue with the SEC, Binance CEO emphasized that users’ funds have been and will continue to be safe and secure on all Binance-affiliated services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the ordeal, Binance has consistently prioritized the safety and security of user funds. Binance has implemented robust security measures to safeguard user funds on all affiliated platforms. Recently, there have been indications from Binance that its BNB Chain is </span><a href="https://coingape.com/binances-bnb-chain-to-announce-layer-2-blockchain-solution/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the development and release of a Layer-2 blockchain solution.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Dogecoin Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dogecoin price witnessed a demand pressure near the $0.056 mark</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the $0.063 resistance could trigger a relief rally in the DOGE price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $187.9 Million, indicating a 0.97% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/q/QEZahzMA.png" alt="Dogecoin Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over a week, the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has remained flattish, trading in a narrow range below $0.632. This sideways action could be the disorder created due to the overall downtrend, the surge in buying pressure developed by discounted prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the DOGE price trades at $0.062 with an intraday loss of 0.03%. The neutral candle reflects the uncertainty continuing among traders, indicating this sideways action could extend longer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a retest to the lower trendline of the channel pattern usually triggers a significant upswing back to the upper trendline. This potential reversal will offer long entry opportunity to traders with a potential target of $0.95</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Dogecoin Price Poke $0.95?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the current consolidation phase, the Dogecoin price respects two technical levels which are $0.063 and the lower trendline of the channel pattern. Under the influence of the chart pattern, the coin price is likely to revert higher to reclaim lost ground. However, interested traders must wait for the breakout of $0.063 immediate resistance to obtain an entry opportunity. The potential recovery could face selling pressure at $0.075, followed by $0.083 and $0.095.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bands of </span><a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bollinger band</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicators challenged on the downside reflect selling pressure in the market is still active. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Average Directional Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high value of ADX indicates instability in the current downturn and a higher possibility for a prolonged consolation to recovery.</span></li>

<h2><b>Defined Support for DOGE and XRP</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The partnership effectively implies the professional basketball club is now indirectly supporting the acceptance of top digital currencies including dog-themed memecoin, Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP in a rare move to bridge the gap between crypto and the sporting world.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fans and members of the public who want to get the club’s jerseys and accessories can do so through BitPay which lends support for these digital currencies. Besides Dogecoin and XRP, other digital currencies hosted on BitPay are also featured with Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) also featuring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BitPay as one of the mainstream crypto payment platforms in the Web3.0 world is playing an important role in bridging the gap between mainstream firms and the digital currency ecosystem. As </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-spanish-airlines-partners-with-bitpay-to-accept-crypto-payments/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by CoinGape last year, BitPay helped Spanish Airlines to accept cryptocurrencies for tickets from customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The payment service provider has helped boost the interest of more firms through related partnerships in the past few years, and its efforts has helped transform memecoins like Dogecoin from a mere fun token to one with deep utility.</span></p>
<h2><b>Intersection of Sports and Crypto</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the London Lions basketball club partnership with BitPay is renowned, it cannot be tagged the first of such deals between a sports club and the crypto world. Dallas Mavericks, the NBA team owned by billionaire investor and crypto advocate Mark Cuban became the first basketball club to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/mark-cubans-dallas-mavericks-becomes-first-nba-team-to-accept-dogecoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400">accept DOGE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as payment for its merchandise as far back as 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">London Lions joining the list is evident that the perception about the nascent asset class as a key technological resource to boost blockchain adoption is not waning. While the deal between crypto and the sports industry saw a setback with the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-bankruptcy-lawyers-locate-2-2-billion-worth-of-crypto-assets-in-ftx-linked-wallets/"><span style="font-weight: 400">fall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of industry giants like FTX Derivatives Exchange, the renewed trend has proven to be promising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Effectively, the London Lions move to support Dogecoin and XRP amongst others can set a new trend for other firms to follow.</span></p>

From the peak of $2138, the prices plunged to a low of $1627, registering a loss of 23.5%. However, this retracement backed by decreasing volume indicates the lack of commitment from sellers and a higher possibility of a bullish reversal. With a sufficient sign of demand pressure, the ETH price is likely to resume prior to recovery offering an excellent dip opportunity for traders. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Ethereum Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ascending support trendline governs the current long-term bullish trend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accumulation at crucial support trendline indicates upcoming recovery in ETH price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.8 Billion, indicating a 37.5% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/HPG4p2zX.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-tradingview</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the ETH price shows a long-tail hammer candle at the ascending trendline. This rejection candle shows active accumulation from buyers and a higher possibility of a bullish reversal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the whole correction phase stayed above the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> indicating this pullback health considering the overall uptrend. Previously, when the prices retested this dynamic support, the coin holders witnessed significant recovery, especially in the months of January and March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the anticipated bullish reversal could kickstart a new recovery cycle and may push the price above $2138.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested traders can enter at this dip with a close stop loss below the hammer wick at $1625. However, the safer traders can enter at the breakout of immediate resistance of $1775.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Can $ETH Price Revisit the $2000?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retest to the dynamic support trendline could replenish the bullish momentum in the ETH price and end the ongoing correction. The investors buying at this support can expect sustained growth above $2138 but will face in-between resistance at the $1775 and $2000 marks. On a contrary note, a breakdown below the support trendline will invalidate the bullish thesis and can plunge prices back to the $1400 mark.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish crossover between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) reflect the aggressive influence of sellers and therefore a need for a $1775 breakout to confirm a bullish reversal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The ETH price above 200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> projects long-term growth for ETH remains bullish.</span></li>

<p>XRP lawyer <strong>John Deaton</strong> calls the response by Coinbase &#8220;persuasive and compelling&#8221; as the US SEC continues to evade questions on crypto regulatory clarity.</p>

<p>Paul Grewal <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1669880095908184070" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> crypto exchange Coinbase can&#8217;t wait until the next week’s deadline to address the US SEC&#8217;s indecisive response to an earlier court order.</p>
<p>Grewal argues it is unusual for the government to disregard a direct inquiry in federal court. The court should rule now as the US SEC has decided not to grant Coinbase&#8217;s rulemaking petition. The US SEC avoiding the rulemaking petition is actively harming the industry amid the government agency&#8217;s escalating enforcement actions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, the SEC’s refusal to say how long it will take to act on Coinbase’s petition confirms the possibility of further delays. The court should order the SEC to report its action within 60 days. If the SEC has not acted by then, the court should rule quickly on the enforcement order.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase claims the petition was originally filed in the summer 2022 and the US SEC is knowingly evading answering to questions related to regulatory frameworks in the US and how the agency regulates the crypto market. The lack of clarity on crypto regulation in the US is impacting the crypto industry and investors.</p>
<p>SEC Chair <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gary-gensler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler</a> continues to believe that most crypto assets are securities. In addition, there&#8217;s still no clarity over whether SEC or CFTC has jurisdiction to regulate crypto.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US House Financial Services Committee has released a <a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-releases-stablecoin-bill-bring-clarity-giving-fed-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draft stablecoin bill</a> and aims to bring clarity over crypto regulation in the US in the coming weeks.

The news has fueled mixed reactions in the industry with experts sharing both positive and negative sentiments about the move.</span></p>
<h2><b>BlackRock Filing May Benefit Grayscale</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amid the broad based regulatory uncertainty in the digital currency ecosystem in the United States, many are projecting that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF product, if approved, will set a major precedent for the industry, a record that top market analyst Adam Cochran </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669731165161267201?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400">believes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> will be more beneficial to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the Blackrock ETF does get approved, the real winner here is going to be <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GBTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$GBTC</a></p>
<p>Because Blackrock will show the path to conversion, and GBTC&#39;s 40%+ discount will resolve on top of industry growth.</p>
<p>Imagine Barry is praying to every deity in every religion right now. <a href="https://t.co/IHfjiFbOuv">pic.twitter.com/IHfjiFbOuv</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669731165161267201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rationale is very obvious as Grayscale has made an attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust product to a full fledged spot Bitcoin ETF product, a proposal the SEC blatantly rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While in reality, the BlackRock filing is technically a Trust which will function like a Bitcoin ETF, its approval will set the tone for Grayscale to double down on its case as it dragged the markets regulator to court following the refusal of the GBTC conversion to Bitcoin ETF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stretching the context of the benefits, Adam noted that the approval for BlackRock’s filing “will show the path to conversion, and GBTC&#8217;s 40%+ discount will resolve on top of industry growth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While highlighting Grayscale as one of the prospective beneficiaries, the major hurdle experts have been debating is whether or not the US SEC will approve the application or not. Adam is convinced that BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-chair-supports-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-schedules-sec-oversight-hearings/"><span style="font-weight: 400">deep ties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> within the Democratic Party and as such, he may have the upper hand to get the market regulator to approve the product.</span></p>
<h2><b>Banking on BlackRock’s Records</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BlackRock is arguably one of America’s largest financial institutions which boasts of about $10 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM). As </span><a href="https://coingape.com/will-blackrock-win-the-first-bitcoin-etf-approval-here-are-the-odds/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> earlier by CoinGape, the company has about a 99% success rate when its previous applications for Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are brought into focus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By banking on his success rates over the years and the influence of the company and its CEO, the industry is anxious that the first spot Bitcoin ETF may be on its way.</span></p>

<h2>Terra Founder Do Kwon Speaks Truth on Passports in Court</h2>
<p>During a hearing at the Basic Court, Do Kwon and Han Chang-joon <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230616160000109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they didn&#8217;t know the passports under the economic citizenship program were fake as they traveled around the world with these Costa Rican and Belgian passports. Interpol report claimed these are fake documents.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I filled out all the documents and received a Costa Rican passport through an agency in Singapore recommended by a friend.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Do Kwon pointed out that he would never go to countries with fake passport. Along with Costa Rican and Belgian passports, they also applied for a <strong>Granada</strong> passport, which was rejected. Terra founder said if he is allowed to open his email he can answer this question correctly. He also asked the court to spare Han Chang-joon as he hasn&#8217;t been associated with passport forgery.</p>
<p>However, Montengrin prosecutor <strong>Haris Sabotic</strong> asked to hold Do Kwon and Han Chang-joon guilty as allegations of the indictment were proven during the proceedings. Judge <strong>Ivana Becic</strong> will announce the ruling on June 19.</p>
<p>On June 15, <a href="https://coingape.com/do-kwon-bail-approved-by-montenegro-high-court-extradition-to-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montenegro High Court approved</a> Do Kwon and Han Chang-joon&#8217;s bail request.

<h2>Do Kwon Denies Financing Political Campaign in Montenegro</h2>
<p>Terra founder Do Kwon denied participating in any illegal financing of the political campaign of the Europe Now Movement political party. He testified before the Special State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (SDT) and the defense attorneys that he doesn&#8217;t have any financial transactions or meetings with former finance minister Milojko Spajic.</p>
<p>Outgoing Montenegro’s Prime Minister <strong>Dritan Abazovic</strong> claimed he received a <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-founder-do-kwon-allegedly-have-political-ties-montenegro-prime-minister/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter from Do Kwon</a> regarding his ties with Spajic, president of the Europe Now political party. The former Finance Minister confirmed that his friends and the company he worked for invested in the Terra project in 2018. However, they lost all during the Terra-LUNA crisis, “which is why we had the special satisfaction of reporting him to authorities.” Milojko Spajic also has connections with Ethereum co-founder <strong>Vitalik Buterin.</strong></p>

Bitcoin generated more than a 3% bearish candle this week and reached long-term support in the $25,100 area. Analysts reported here have taken key indicators such as the SOPR, Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis, and price regions to allow investors to navigate Bitcoin&#8217;s price trends effectively.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Trends</h2>
<p>Market Intelligence platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/june-mid-month-report-alts-are-showing-their-faults-7321?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=twitter_june_mid_month_report_insight_b_061623/&amp;fpr=twitter" rel="nofollow">Santiment shared its latest insight</a> highlighting the rise in BTC whale transactions and the contrasting responses to Blackrock and SEC lawsuits. Additionally, concerns regarding being altcoin heavy have been prominent, with multiple FUD-causing stories emerging.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152112" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/17180524/satiment-2.jpg" alt="" width="2581" height="1650" /></p>
<p>At the same time, Glassnode&#8217;s analysis reveals that while <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s SOPR resides in a profit-driven regim</strong>e, recent undercuts pose a test to the prevailing trend. Market participants, on average, are transacting at a loss, indicating potential weakness if the profit-driven regime isn&#8217;t reclaimed. They tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The current undercuts suggests market participants are on aggregate, transacting at a loss. Failure to reclaim the profit driven regime could suggest further market weakness, whilst reclamation of the trend would infer market strength.</p></blockquote>

<p>Notably, the <strong>Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis at $26.4K</strong> has anchored recent price volatility, serving as a crucial level in determining the direction and momentum of the local trend.</p>

<h3>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis:</h3>
<p>Another popular analyst CrediBULL Crypto <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1669909683748872197?s=20" rel="nofollow">suggests</a> that <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent performance is positive</strong>, as it tags the first red region and demonstrates strength. However, a small pullback in the upper green region may occur, and failure to hold this level could bring the lower green region into play. The depth of this correction will provide insights into the potential strength of the ongoing impulsive move on lower timeframes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152114" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/17180533/credibull.jpg" alt="" width="2854" height="1494" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s current price stands at $26,515.22, reflecting a 0.31% increase in the past hour, a 4.14% increase over the past 24 hours, and a 3.11% increase over the past week.</p>

The release of crucial memos opened up different aspects for Ripple against the commission. However, Defendant and Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse addressed the release of Hinman Docs in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1669805367688331267" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">video</a>.</p>

<h2>Ripple CEO Mocks SEC Over Clear Rules</h2>
<p>Ripple CEO stated that the release of Hinman documents is the truly first time the SEC was forced to be transparent regarding their lack of internal coherence. This move acknowledged that the commission may not have the jurisdiction to fill the regulatory gap around the crypto industry.</p>
<p>He added that the US SEC has been asking for transparency from the digital asset linked businesses. However, the commission fought hard to protect these momes and ditch transparency. This has led the SEC Chair Gary Gensler to refuse to comment on several specific projects.</p>
<p>Ripple CEO mentioned that the commission is now indirectly and incorrectly labeling tokens as securities in recent lawsuits. The US SEC chair is promoting that there are clear rules meanwhile the agency is trying to front run Congress. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</a></strong></p>
<h2> SEC Using The Same Tactics In Every Lawsuit</h2>
<p>The commission recently filed back to back lawsuits against the two biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. It alleged that Binance, its US affiliate, and its executives were operating illegally. While Coinbase was offering unregistered securities to its users.</p>
<p>Garlinghouse added that they have witnessed a pattern in the recent US SEC filed cases against the crypto exchanges similar to what the commission did to them. He claimed that the agency is killing crypto innovations in the country.</p>
<p>He stated that the current chair is an unelected bureaucrat who is weaponizing the lack of regulatory clarity to exert its jurisdiction over the entire crypto space.</p>

<h2><b>Bitcoin Price Daily Chart:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price rising for three consecutive days has reached the current trading price of $26726</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the weekly 20 and 50 EMA flashes a buy signal for interested traders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $8.93 billion, indicating a 38% loss. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/a7pyXPuJ.png" alt="Bitcoin price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />(Source: Tradingview)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly time frame chart shows the two monthly corrections in Bitcoin price are associated with weak volume activity. The downward price action backed by low volume reflects the lack of conviction from sellers which in contrast indicates the buyers are likely to retake trend control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the correction phase is still above 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement levels</a> indicating the pullback is healthy in terms of overall bullish trend. As of now, a falling <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">wedge pattern</a> governs the ongoing downfall, and therefore a breakout above its resistance trendline will signal the resumption of prior recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Bitcoin price traded at $26700, if the buyers gave a daily candle closing above the trendline, the potential buyers can look for an entry opportunity, with the expected rally to the $31555 mark.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will Bitcoin Price Rise to the $31000 mark?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing correction, the weekly chart shows alternative red and green candles reflecting no completion dominance from sellers. Thus, if the market sentiment shows improvement in the second half of June, the price could breach the overhead trendline. The post-breakout rally could push the price to $28500, followed by $29800 and $31155.</span></p>

Now their CEO recently announced the plans to resume withdrawals in phases. While Decenter <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.decenter.kr/NewsView/29QW2HCXOK/GZ03">shared</a> the announcement aimed to appease investors, specific details regarding the repayment period, method, and extent of the damage were not disclosed.</p>
<h2>Delio Resumes Withdrawals</h2>
<p>During the investor briefing, Delio CEO Jeong Sang-ho informed attendees that the company would gradually resume withdrawal services. However, the CEO emphasized that the situation remained fluid, as it depended on the circumstances surrounding Haru Investment and B&amp;S, two entities closely associated with Delio&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>Jeong acknowledged that Haru Invest was undergoing bankruptcy procedures, leading to uncertainties in guaranteeing the initially promoted rate of return for deposit products. Despite the challenges, the CEO assured investors that plans were in place to recover the losses incurred.</p>
<p>To compensate for the losses, CEO Jeong expressed Delio&#8217;s commitment to securing as much capital as possible, including considering a paid-in capital increase from a third party. While this statement aimed to instill confidence among investors, the CEO did not disclose specific details regarding the timing of repayment.</p>
<blockquote><p>While I cannot disclose specific timing at this moment, rest assured that we are working diligently to address these issues and communicate further updates through an investor representative meeting.&#8221; &#8211; Delio CEO Jeong Sang-ho</p></blockquote>
<h3>Background Of Case</h3>
<p>The predicament Delio finds itself in stems from entrusting some of its customers&#8217; funds to Haru Invest, which, in turn, had entrusted its own funds to B&amp;S. When Haru Invest faced issues with B&amp;S and halted withdrawals, the repercussions quickly spread to Delio.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Delio temporarily suspended its own withdrawal services and transitioned to a telecommuting system. However, CEO Jeong expressed his will to normalize the company, saying, “From next week, we will switch to a normal working system.”</p>
<p>According to Delio website, they have a total of $9.5B in Assets. Whale Chart shared their assets on <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WhaleChart/status/1668969431173562369?s=20">Twitter</a> upon suspension:</p>

<h2>Coinbase Not Holding Back Against US SEC</h2>
<p>Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer announced that they filed a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1669880095908184070" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reply</a> to US SEC’s response in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit filings. He stated that the exchange couldn’t wait for the next deadline as they find it unusual for the government to flout a direct query from a federal court.</p>
<p>The commission in its reply to Coinbase’s rulemaking petition mentioned that it hasn’t decided what action to take on. However, It asked for another 120 days to file a reply to it. The US SEC has been alleged of filing enforcement actions against the crypto linked business in the absence of clear regulations around it.</p>
<p>Coinbase Legal Chief stated that the court should grant mandamus to them now as the US SEC has decided not to permit the crypto exchange&#8217;s petitions. He added that the refusal presented by the commission in the last court submission confirms that a delay ahead is futile. <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Coinbase News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<h2>SEC Needs To Reply In 60 Days</h2>
<p>The crypto exchange asked the court to order the US SEC to file a response in at least 60 days. However, this submission should not be an anticipated staff recommendation so that the court can decide the mandamus petition directly.</p>

The exchange announched addition of $FLOKI to its Metaverse and Gaming categories, price action followed in last 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Floki Now In Binance Metaverse</h2>
<p>Official Twitter account of memecoin Floki took to Twitter and shared:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="r-18u37iz">#Binance</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/RealFlokiInu/status/1669762218517209094?s=20" rel="nofollow">added </a></span><span class="r-18u37iz">$FLOKI</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> to the </span><span class="r-18u37iz">#Metaverse</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> and </span><span class="r-18u37iz">#Gaming</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> categories on its exchange! </span></p></blockquote>
<p>Binance by including $FLOKI to its Metaverse and Gaming categories allowed millions of users to trade Floki alongside other prominent metaverse and gaming cryptocurrencies such as $SAND, $MANA, $AXS, $IMX, $GALA, and $ENJ. Added are screenshots from Binance categories:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-152065 alignleft" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/17121348/floki-bnb-meta.jpg" alt="" width="2452" height="936" /> <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-152066 alignleft" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/17121353/floki-bnb-gaming.jpg" alt="" width="2410" height="1274" /></p>
<p>The decision by Binance to include Floki in its Metaverse and Gaming categories is a significant validation for the meme coin. Binance is renowned for its rigorous listing process and careful selection of cryptocurrencies, ensuring the inclusion of reputable and promising projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/pepecoin-delisted-from-binance-flexible-loans-pepe-price-drops-15-in-past-week/">CoinGape reported yesterday how Binance delisted PEPE</a> from its Flexible Loans as it was no longer a reliable asset, adding to whale dumping of PEPE tokens.</p>
<h3>Floki Adoption And Price Action</h3>
<p>Floki, the fourth-largest meme coin by market capitalization, has been gaining momentum in recent times. It got <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/FlokiTurkiye/status/1669730301298327558">listed</a> on Bitci, one of Turkey&#8217;s top crypto exchanges with over 5 million registered users. Also in a s<a href="https://coingape.com/floki-inu-announces-strategic-partnership-with-binance-pay/">trategic partnership unveiled two weeks ago</a>, the Floki team aims to drive adoption through an extensive marketing campaign that leverages Binance Pay to incentivize users.</p>
<p>Binance exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-news-support-for-floki-inu-meme-season-incoming/">announced Floki listing</a> on April 24 this year and it went live the next day to its millions of users.</p>
<p>Floki continues to demonstrate positive momentum in the market, showcasing gains over the past 24 hours and the past week. With a 3.09% increase within one hour, it gained 5.28% gain over 24 hours upon announcement. It has also surged over 10% as we write over the course of the past week, indicating a positive trend in the coin&#8217;s performance.</p>

<p>As part of the proposed agreement, only Binance.US employees could access customer funds on the US-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a>. Binance Global officials will be restricted from having access to private keys of all wallets including cold and hot wallets, any other hardware wallets, as well as Binance.US&#8217;s internal systems and controls.</p>
<h2>Binance and US SEC Agree to Proposed Deal</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.70.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">notice</a> of proposed stipulation and consent order submitted to the US District Court for the District of Columbia on June 16, the plaintiff US SEC and defendants Binance Holdings and Binance.US have reached an agreement.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, no Binance Holdings officials will have access to Binance.US&#8217;s wallets including hardware wallets and systems such as Amazon Web Services tools. Moreover, Binance.US will share a detailed financial statement including business expenses and estimated costs with the US SEC in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The move comes after <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-us-federal-judge-rejects-secs-request-to-freeze-binance-us-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judge Amy Berman Jackson asked</a> the US SEC and Binance.US to reach an agreement than to have her approve a restraining order to freeze assets of Binance&#8217;s US-based arm. The <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-us-seeks-to-revoke-us-secs-request-to-freeze-its-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exchange said</a> asset freeze will potentially end its business in the US and the restraining order is &#8220;unnecessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made the first move in accordance with the court order on June 13, reducing its concerns related to Binance&#8217;s control over its U.S.-based subsidiary. The proposed stipulation and consent order was agreed upon by both parties, pending approval from the federal judge.</p>
<p>The crypto market recovers, with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices soaring 5% each to $26700 and $1755, respectively. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/blackrock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> iShares spot Bitcoin ETF-fueled positive sentiments among traders, bringing broader recovery in the crypto market.</p>

ZachXBT took to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1669783717236342785?s=20" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> to defend free speech in the face of such legal challenges.</p>
<h2>ZachXBT Sued For Defamation</h2>
<p>ZachXBT received the lawsuit (attached below for reference) from MachiBigBrother, accusing him of defamation. However, Zach firmly believes the lawsuit is baseless and merely an attempt to stifle free speech. This situation exemplifies the power dynamics at play, with Machi&#8217;s significant wealth being used to intimidate and silence a detective who lacks similar financial resources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152042" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/17110036/zachxbt-lawsuit.jpg" alt="" width="1556" height="1080" /></p>
<p>The article that led to the lawsuit, titled &#8220;<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://medium.com/@investigationsbyzachxbt/22-000-eth-embezzled-and-over-ten-projects-failed-the-story-of-machi-big-brother-jeff-huang-a1ad073fcfa8" rel="nofollow">22,000 ETH Embezzled and Over Ten Projects Failed: The Story of Machi Big Brother (Jeff Huang)</a>,&#8221; delved into alleged financial improprieties and the failure of multiple projects associated with MachiBigBrother.</p>

<p>Zach adds to his Twitter thread:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is sickening to see it come to this but I knew one day this would happen as the price of telling the truth is sometimes people dislike what you say. I have always kept my research as objective as possible and let the data and historical record speak for themselves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Plea For Free Speech</h3>
<p>Recognizing the financial burden that comes with defending against a defamation lawsuit, ZachXBT has created a donation address to seek assistance with the associated legal costs. The potential expenses could easily exceed $1 million USD, and any contributions would help ensure that free speech is not silenced.</p>
<p>The donation address, provided as ETH: 0x6eA158145907a1fAc74016087611913A96d96624, welcomes donations in various EVM chains, with stablecoins being preferred.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Justin Sun did a donation of 10k </span><span class="r-18u37iz">TUSD </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">to Zach and wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Despite not being a legal expert myself, I highly value Zach&#8217;s substantial contributions to blockchain security and his crucial role in guiding our users to safeguard their funds.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>ZachXBT&#8217;s plea for support echoes the sentiment <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CollinRugg/status/1669744861732552710?s=20" rel="nofollow">expressed by Elon Musk, </a> who recently voiced his support for free speech at the Viva Technology event in Paris, France. It is through collective efforts and standing up for what is right that we can protect the truth and fight against the suppression of free speech.</p>
