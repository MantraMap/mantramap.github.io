<ul><li>Poloniex has agreed to pay $7.6 million as part of a settlement agreement with the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.&nbsp;</li><li>The multi-million dollar fee will settle charges related to the alleged violation of multiple sanctions programs.</li><li>The crypto exchange was accused of 66,000 violations of multiple sanctions programs between 2014 and 2019.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto exchange Poloniex is set to shell out a significant chunk of cash after reaching a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Treasury. The California-based exchange has agreed to pay a whopping $7.59 million to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in order to settle allegations related to violation of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/huobi-kucoin-russian-banks-evade-sacntion/">sanctions</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Poloniex Accused Of Over 65,000 Violations In 5 Years</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20230501_33" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the Department of Treasury’s OFAC, Poloniex has agreed to remit $7,591,630 to settle its potential civil liability for apparent violations of sanctions enforced by the agency against Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. The agency alleged that between January 2014 and November 2019, Poloniex allowed customers from sanctioned jurisdictions to initiate transactions on its trading platform. These included trades, deposits, and withdrawals with a combined value exceeding $15 million. The agency highlighted the lapse by the exchange in enforcing appropriate KYC norms. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This enforcement action, similar to other recent cases involving online digital asset companies, emphasizes the importance for new companies and those involved in emerging technologies to incorporate sanctions compliance into their business functions at the outset, especially when the companies seek to offer financial services to a global customer base.</p><cite>Office of Foreign Assets Control</cite></blockquote>



<p>OFAC acknowledged that while the alleged violations were not voluntarily self-disclosed they were non-egregious. OFAC agency stated that under its Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, the penalty imposed on the crypto exchange would be over $99 million and that the final settlement amount was indicative of the agency’s consideration of the general factors under the enforcement guidelines. The agency also took into consideration the fact that Poloniex was a small startup at the time of the alleged violations.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Justin Sun transferred 56 million TUSD to Binance earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The transaction was flagged by the crypto community who accused Sun of farming today’s SUI airdrop.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao warned Sun against using the whale transfer to farm SUI by staking the TUSD.&nbsp;</li><li>The Tron founder has issued an apology to Zhao for the misunderstanding over the whale transaction.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Tron founder Justin Sun has issued an apology to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-us-ends-1-billion-voyager-deal/">Binance</a> CEO Changpeng Zhao after getting called out for attempting to participate in the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/introducing-sui-sui-on-binance-launchpool-farm-sui-by-staking-bnb-and-tusd-f76980d5d5e54d80b1348fd446e8f5d3" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance Launchpool</a> for SUI, the native token of the layer 1 blockchain Sui using a whale transaction.</p>



<h2><strong>Justin Sun Claims Whale Transaction Was To Stabilize TUSD</strong></h2>



<p>The controversy started earlier today after Justin Sun transferred 56 million TUSD to Binance. Whale watchers on Twitter flagged the transfer as a whale transaction, leading to considerable speculation among the crypto community. Crypto Twitter concluded that Sun was attempting to farm SUI’s airdrop by staking millions of TUSD, brewing further controversy. </p>



<p>Sun defended his actions by claiming that the transfer was part of Tron DAO Venture’s efforts as TUSD’s cooperative market maker to stabilize the price of the stablecoin. He clarified that the purpose was not to participate in Binance’s activities including the launchpool for SUI. </p>



<p>The Tron founder acknowledged that some of his colleagues had used part of the funds to participate in the launchpool and farm SUI tokens because they “did not understand the purpose of the funds.” This was followed by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1652949031524376579" rel="nofollow noopener">issuing</a> a public warning to Justin Sun regarding his participation in the airdrop. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will &#8220;take action against it&#8221;. SMH. Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales.” </p><cite>Changpeng Zhao, Founder and CEO of Binance</cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We sincerely apologize for this oversight <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@cz_binance</a>!</p>&mdash; H.E. Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1652955224032829440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Justin Sun responded and stated that the TUSD deposit was meant for facilitating market-making between leading TUSD exchanges and not participating in the airdrop. However, he again acknowledged that some members of his team “inadvertently” used some of the funds to farm the SUI airdrop. “We sincerely apologize for this oversight,” Sun <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1652955224032829440" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>

<p>CoinMarketCap, the crypto data aggregator site owned by the world’s largest crypto exchange, is venturing into the entertainment space with the launch of its very own reality TV show called Killer Whales. The show is inspired by Shark Tank, the popular investing show featuring billionaire investor Mark Cuban and former <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/?s=kevin">FTX</a> spokesperson Kevin O’Leary.</p>



<h2><strong>Altcoin Daily Will Co-Produce Killer Whales With CoinMarketCap</strong></h2>



<p>Dubbed the Shark Tank of crypto, Killer Whales will feature a panel of judges or “whales”, who will hear pitches from crypto entrepreneurs and decide if they wish to invest in them and provide mentorship. A recent update posted by Hello Labs on CoinMarketCap&#8217;s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/644cf3db4bebb711c962723e" rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a> revealed that crypto influencer duo Aaron Arnold and Austin Arnold, better known as Altcoin Daily, will produce and star in the reality show. Other judges include Cordell Broadus, AKA Champ Medici.</p>



<p>Sander Gortjes, the CEO of Hello Labs, recently took to Twitter to announce that the hunt for Web3 projects to feature in Killer Whales will begin on May 2, 2023. Starting tomorrow, crypto projects and entrepreneurs will be able to apply to enter and stand a chance to win the show. Killer Whale will begin filming in June 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“2022 was not a great year for crypto’s reputation, dragged through the mud and branded as the wild west by the mainstream media. Killer Whales takes strides to rebuild trust and shine a light on the founders that are innovating.” </p><cite>Paul Caslin, Founder, HELLO Labs</cite></blockquote>



<p>To coincide with Killer Whale’s release, CoinMarketCap, and Hello Labs will also launch an exclusive Show Producer NFT collection. Holders of these NFTs will be able to influence key show decisions and be a part of the production. Hello Labs’ <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hello-labs/" rel="nofollow noopener">HELLO</a> token as much as 16% over the past 24 hours thanks to the hype around the upcoming crypto reality show. At the time of writing, HELLO was trading at $0.060, with a market capitalization of $32.2 million. </p>

<ul><li>Gemini, Genesis, and the Digital Currency Group have agreed to start a 30-day mediation process.&nbsp;</li><li>The mediation process, which includes the Unsecured Creditors Committee, will see all parties work towards a final resolution.&nbsp;</li><li>The Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange has expressed its frustration with the slow pace of Genesis’ restructuring efforts.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform/">Gemini</a> has come one step closer to recovering the funds stuck at Barry Silbert’s struggling crypto firm Genesis. Gemini has announced that it is set to enter a mediation period with Genesis, the Digital Currency Group (DCG), Genesis’ Unsecured Creditors Committee, and an ad hoc Creditor Committee led by the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Expresses Frustration With Genesis’ Restructuring Pace</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1652779387970899969" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to give its customers an update regarding the situation with Genesis and associated debtors. According to the Twitter thread, the crypto exchange has reached an agreement with Genesis and the Digital Currency Group to start a 30-day mediation process in order to come up with a final resolution regarding the outstanding payment as soon as possible. The parties that will participate in the mediation process include the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) and the ad hoc Creditors Committee led by Gemini. </p>



<p>Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane is expected to issue an order directing the mediation as early as May 1, 2023. The mediation process will be focused on the economic contribution of DCG to Genesis’ bankruptcy estate in order to bring resolution to its bankruptcy plan and benefit all creditors, including the Earn users of Gemini. While the mediation provides for a 30-day period, all parties are expected to work expeditiously as soon as the mediation process begins, given the upcoming maturing of a $630 million loan owed to Genesis by its parent firm DCG.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If DCG is unable to pay and/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations. So while the mediation is scheduled for up to 30 days, the parties are expected to work expeditiously towards agreement in the immediate window.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Gemini has clarified that it is supportive of the mediation process and looks forward to working with all parties to reach a resolution as soon as possible. The crypto exchange also expressed its frustration on record before Judge Lane regarding the pace of progress among the parties involved in Genesis’ restructuring efforts and emphasized the need for urgency.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp has issued a consent order to Cross River Bank.&nbsp;</li><li>The order directed the crypto-friendly bank to take corrective action and address its unsafe banking practices.&nbsp;</li><li>The FDIC issued the order on March 8 but it was made public on Friday.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/silvergate-si-stock-down-11-with-u-s-fdic/">FDIC</a>) has reportedly issued a consent order to New Jersey-based Cross River Bank. The bank is widely regarded as a crypto-friendly institution that caters to several businesses operating in the crypto space including crypto exchange Coinbase and USD Coin issuer Circle. </p>



<h2><strong>Cross River Bank: Consent Order Will Have No Impact On Growth</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-28/cross-river-bank-receives-fdic-enforcement-order-over-lending" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the FDIC issued a cease and desist order to Cross River Bank over alleged “unsafe and unsound” banking practices related to fair-lending laws. The consent order was issued on March 8, 2023, but was made public on Friday. The FDIC alleged that the crypto-friendly bank failed to maintain internal controls, information systems, and prudent credit underwriting practices. A spokesperson for the bank clarified that the order was the result of a standard review and had nothing to do with its crypto-related business. </p>



<p>As per the order, Cross River Bank has agreed to address the concerns related to its practices and improve internal controls. However, the bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing. A spokesperson for the bank stated that the order will have no “meaningful impact” on its growth. Several enhancements laid out by the FDIC in the order have already been completed by the bank. The bank’s board has agreed to increase supervision and oversight of controls and ensure that corrective actions are taken.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Importantly, the order does not identify discriminatory practices or anything that would require Cross River to compensate consumers for harm. Further, it places no limitations on our extensive existing Fintech Partnerships or the credit products we presently offer in partnership with them.” </p><cite>Cross River Bank spokesperson.</cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a cease and desist order to Coinme in relation to UpToken.</li><li>The securities regulator also imposed a fine of almost $4 million on the crypto firm and associated parties.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinme and Up Global were booked by the regulator for the unregistered and misleading offering of their UpToken.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-bittrex-violation-federal-laws/">SEC</a>) has imposed a multi-million dollar fine on the Seattle-based crypto giant Coinme and Up Global Inc. The fine settled an ongoing case related to the initial coin offering (ICO) of the crypto firm’s Ethereum-based UpToken back in 2017. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinme Fined For Unregistered ICO</strong></h2>



<p>According to an SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2023/33-11179.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a>, the cease and desist order was imposed as per the U.S. Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. The case dates back to 2017 when Coinme and its Up Global unit conducted a misleading ICO of their UpToken and raised more than $3.6 million. The funds were used by the crypto firm to expand its Bitcoin ATM network. The proceeds of the ICO were reportedly also for several other corporate purposes. </p>



<p>The SEC found that the UpToken issued by Coinme were sold as investment contracts and therefore securities as per the controversial Howey Test. The regulator cited the additional benefits that were made available to UpToken investors to strengthen its case against the firm. The firm was also accused of selling securities without registration and limiting the supply of its token to artificially inflate its demand. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Neil Bergquist was also named in the complaint. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>An UpToken investor would have had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a future profit from the rise in value of UpToken based upon Respondents’ efforts.” </p><cite>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinme reportedly submitted an offer of settlement in anticipation of enforcement actions from the securities regulator. As part of the settlement, a $3.52 million penalty was imposed on Up Global along with a $250,000 fine on Coinme. Ceo Neil Bergquist has also been ordered to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, bringing the total settlement to almost $4 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest development in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/core-scientific-nydig-settle-38-m-debt/">Core Scientific</a>’s bankruptcy case saw the struggling crypto miner sign a series of new hosting contracts to host thousands of bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs. The Texas-based crypto mining firm has negotiated three new hosting contracts to host nearly 18,000 BTC mining rigs.</p>



<h2><strong>Core Scientific Stock Surges 7% Following News Contract Signings</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230428005272/en/Core-Scientific-Signs-Hosting-Contracts-with-Three-Public-Companies-During-Reorganization-%E2%80%93-Maintains-Industry-Position-as-One-of-North-America%E2%80%99s-Largest-Bitcoin-Miners" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by Core Scientific, the Bitcoin mining firm has signed new hosting contracts with three companies. It will host 6914 mining rigs for Greenidge Generation Holdings, 10,000 mining rigs for Ault Alliance, and 1021 mining rigs for LM Funding. The firm will host the mining units at its facilities in Georgia, Kentucky, and Texas. The new hosting contracts demonstrate its status quo as a leader in the Bitcoin mining industry despite being in the midst of Chapter 11 proceedings. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The signing of these agreements are illustrative of Core Scientific’s industry leading hosting and mining capabilities and the strong demand for our services within our world class mining facilities.” </p><cite>Russell Cann, Head of Mining at Core Scientific. </cite></blockquote>



<p>The combined computing power of 17,935 units amounts to 1.88 exahashes per second and requires approximately 55 megawatts of data center rack space. As of now, 900 LM Funding units and 3,000 Ault Alliance units are already in operation and are actively hashing. An additional 121 LM Funding rigs will become operational by the end of April. By May, 7,000 Ault Alliance units and 6,914 Greenidge rigs will go online and begin hashing.</p>



<p>The new hosting contracts have had a considerable impact on Core Scientific’s share price (CORZQ). Its stock surged by nearly 7% following the news, reaching as high as $0.41 earlier today. The bankrupt mining firm’s stock was trading at $0.38 at the time of writing. Earlier this month the firm’s bankruptcy estate appointed investment banker Adam Sullivan as the firm’s new president. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Alex Pertsev published on Twitter for the first time in over nine months after Dutch authorities arrested him for facilitating money laundering through crypto mixer Tornado Cash.</li><li>Pertsev was released on home arrest last week pending an investigative hearing on May 24.</li><li>“Sorry I was afk for a while, what did I miss?”, he tweeted after spending months in prison in the Netherlands.</li></ul>



<p>Blockchain developer Alex Pertsev <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_pertsev/status/1651961639388815363?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/alex_pertsev/status/1651961639388815363?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published</a> on Twitter for the first time in over nine months after Dutch authorities arrested him in August. </p>



<p>“Sorry I was afk for a while, what did I miss?”, Pertsev wrote today. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry I was afk for a while, what did I miss? 👀</p>&mdash; Alexey Pertsev (@alex_pertsev) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_pertsev/status/1651961639388815363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>Tornado Cash Developer Arrested</h2>



<p>The Dutch financial crime authority (FIOD) issued arrest orders on the suspicion that Pertsev laundered more than 500,000 ETH through sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash. At current prices, Dutch prosecutors claimed Pertsev laundered nearly a billion dollars in crypto, per details of his arrest in August 2020. </p>



<p>Pertsev remained in Dutch detention as a judge denied him bail on at least one occasion. Prosecutors argued that the Tornado Cash developer had access to caches of digital assets and posed a flight risk. The court was also told that Pertsev could destroy evidence if released. </p>



<h2>Pertsev Free On House Arrest Pending Trial</h2>



<p>Last week, a Dutch court ordered his <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dutch-court-tornado-cash-alexey-pertsev/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dutch-court-tornado-cash-alexey-pertsev/" rel="noreferrer noopener">release</a> until an investigative hearing scheduled for May 24. Pertsev will have to wear an ankle monitor and cannot leave the property. Dutch authorities also installed surveillance systems to keep an eye on Pertsev until the trial. </p>



<p>His lawyers said more effort will go into defense after a Dutch judge previously turned down motions for his early release. The arrest and delayed release was followed by criticism from the crypto community over whether open-source coding should attract criminal investigations.</p>



<h2>War On Crypto Mixers</h2>



<p>Global regulators have seemingly gone after crypto mixers that allow users to obfuscate the origin of their transactions. Apart from sanctions against Tornado Cash, law enforcement also seized  $46 million from crypto tumbler ChipMixer.</p>

<p>Paypal, Venmo’s parent company, said on Friday at Consensus 2023, that cryptocurrency users will be able to make digital coin transfers to third-party wallets very soon. The four accepted cryptocurrencies on Venmo are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.</p>

<p>The statement issued by the company notes that external transfers will be subject to network fees.

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Binance is set to restart operations in Japan&#8217;s crypto market after acquiring licensed trading venue Sakura in November 2022.</li><li>The Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC) which currently supports 11 trading pairs will cut its services on May 31 and rebrand to &#8220;Binance Japan&#8221;.</li><li>Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s company will re-enter Japan five years after exiting the country due to regulatory pressure in 2018.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto&#8217;s largest centralized trading venue Binance is set to <a href="https://sebc.co.jp/23042801_notice/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sebc.co.jp/23042801_notice/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">resume</a> operations in Japan after acquiring a locally regulated Bitcoin exchange in November last year and exiting the country five years prior due to regulatory pressure. </p>



<p>News of the platform moving for a crypto license emerged earlier in September last year as previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-crypto-license-japan/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-crypto-license-japan/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</p>



<h2>Exit Sakura, Enter Binance!</h2>



<p>Binance will reclaim a foothold in Japan&#8217;s crypto scene through its acquisition of the licensed platform Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC). The deal happened in late 2022 as part of the company&#8217;s global expansion strategy. Per reports, Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s scooped up 100% equity in SEBC. </p>



<p>The purchase means that CZ&#8217;s company can now operate as a Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) regulated entity after June 2023, complying with the watchdog&#8217;s policies. First, SEBC will terminate its current services on May 31. </p>



<p>After that, Sakura will rebrand to Binance Japan. This will finalize the deal and cement the company&#8217;s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-returns-japan-sakura-exchange/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-returns-japan-sakura-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-entry</a> into the Japanese market. </p>



<p>SEBC CEO Hitomi Yamamoto expressed his delight regarding the deal and rebrand, saying that Binance’s strong compliance system would contribute to building a more compliant atmosphere for users in Japan and that the acquisition would assist users in gaining access to crypto services needed for mass adoption in the future. </p>



<p>SEBC offers brokerage and consultation services to its customers with support for 11 trading pairs. It&#8217;s unclear if the new platform will be allowed to list new tokens given Japan&#8217;s strict token listing rules. </p>



<p>Japan has a high regulatory bar for crypto exchanges. It requires the segregation of customer and exchange assets, with most exchange assets to be kept in cold wallets and customers&#8217; fiat to be kept by a Japanese trust company or bank trust. Listing tokens on exchanges in Japan requires vetting by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association.</p>



<h2>Binance Global Expansion</h2>



<p>Binance has been on a mission to widen its global reach. Recently, has been able to secure an active license in France, Italy, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-wins-vasp-license-from-spains-central-bank/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-wins-vasp-license-from-spains-central-bank/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spain</a>, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, New Zealand, Poland, Lithuania, and Cyprus. </p>



<p>Re-entry into Japan will mark the 12th nation where regulators have officially sanctioned operations for CZ&#8217;s company. </p>
