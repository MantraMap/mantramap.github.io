										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum – the world’s largest cryptocurrencies by market cap – <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/06/32966846/the-great-accumulation-of-bitcoin-etf-filings-signal-a-new-era-for-crypto-investment-say-e">rose to new levels in late</a> June following several weeks of traveling through the doldrums, and the moves appear to stem from some new bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications from two of the largest financial companies around: Wisdom Tree and BlackRock.</p>
<h2>BlackRock Does Big Things for BTC</h2>
<p>Both bitcoin and Ethereum weren’t doing so hot throughout the month of June prior to this news. The assets were slipping a bit more each week, largely due to headlines that both <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a> were being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It got to the point where bitcoin, briefly, fell into the $24K range, while Ethereum itself wasn’t doing much better. Then, suddenly, the tables really turned.</p>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss – one half of the Winklevoss Twins, which run the popular Gemini crypto exchange in New York – was quick to comment on the situations surrounding the two ETFs from both BlackRock and WisdomTree. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast. If bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this will likely be the most obvious and best trade of this decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michael Saylor – the former CEO of software giant and major BTC institution MicroStrategy – was also there to throw his two cents into the mix, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The window to front-run institutional demand for bitcoin is closing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the sentiments that are stemming from the news around the ETFs is that BlackRock, at least, has a chance of getting its application supported and approved by the SEC given how close it’s been with the federal financial agency. The company has had more than 500 applications approved by the SEC. To this day, it only has one rejection on its record.</p>
<p>What’s also interesting about the BlackRock application is that Coinbase – a company now getting sued by the SEC – is listed as the custody partner of the company. What this could potentially do regarding the lawsuit the agency has against the exchange remains a mystery, but it should at least throw a monkey wrench (albeit a small one) into the mix.</p>
<h2>A Huge Step Forward?</h2>
<p>The news of the price surges surrounding bitcoin and Ethereum is a huge and welcome change from what we’ve been seeing in recent days, and especially from where both assets were last year. During 2022, arguably the worst period on record for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, the digital asset fell from about $68,000, it’s new all-time high (which it achieved in November of 2021), to around $16,600, thus constituting a near 70 percent fall from grace.</p>
<p>Ethereum and several leading altcoins were quick to follow in BTC’s footsteps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin wallet provider Casa has unveiled Ethereum vaults, which are designed to give Ethereum fans and holders <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-startup-casa-expands-beyond-160044845.html">more secure options for</a> keeping control of their money.</p>
<h2>Casa Says &#8220;Yes&#8221; to Housing Ethereum</h2>
<p>There’s a common theme in the digital currency world. The theme is, “Not your keys, not your coins.” The statement refers to custody practices and third parties in which custody responsibilities are trusted to figures or companies that are not the actual owners of the tokens in question. For this reason, it doesn’t matter how many units of crypto you put in your wallet. If custody is taken over by someone (or something) else, you’re not in control, and your coins could disappear whenever the company is in trouble.</p>
<p>Initially, Casa was only created for bitcoin holders. If you had bitcoin in your stash, Casa would house it for you, but now, the company is opening its doors to Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market cap and the number one competitor to bitcoin.</p>
<p>The firm is also building itself out as a self-custody outlet. In other words, while the crypto one holds can be done through a wallet provided by the firm, final ownership truly lies with whoever garnered the coins in the first place, and Casa allegedly prides itself on the fact that all its customers fully control their coins and aren’t required to forfeit their custody abilities. CEO Nick Neuman explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Self-custody places the control and responsibility back into the hands of the users, eliminating the risk that people’s assets will be frozen, misused, or stolen when things go wrong at an exchange. We believe that reducing reliance on third parties by taking self-custody and holding your private keys is the future of money management.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since self-custody is an entirely new route for Casa customers, the company has created new education modules to help them understand how the protocols work and what they can do to boost the safety of their coins. Neuman said one of the quickest and easiest windows to self-custody is through the company’s new app. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our app gives Casa members a clear view of their key health and guides them through replacing a key if it is lost or stolen. It’s no more complicated than interfacing with any regular banking app, and we’re here to offer support and guidance at every step.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Making the Network Faster</h2>
<p>Ethereum is arguably becoming as big as bitcoin. The asset has already gone through two major upgrades over the last 11 months (the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/merge/">Merge</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/shapella/">Shapella</a>) that have shifted the asset over to a proof of stake module over proof of work, which it had followed since its inception.</p>
<p>Proof of stake has permitted Ethereum to move faster and lessen its gas fees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A China-owned crypto mining <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/chinese-owned-cryptocurrency-mining-facility-planned-in-vilonia-opposed-by-townsfolk-local-government-officials/ar-AA1cOROK">facility could be built</a> in the rural town of Vilonia, Arkansas, and the residents aren’t too happy about that.</p>
<h2>Will Vilonia Be a New Crypto Mining Hub?</h2>
<p>What’s odd is that the mining facility is controlled and owned by China, a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/">country that not long</a> ago decided crypto mining should be illegal due to the alleged harm it does to the atmosphere. The country announced that due to new “green” rules implemented by Beijing, all crypto mining was outlawed on Chinese lands, and miners were either going to have to close or find new places to run their businesses.</p>
<p>This shows a clear lack of regard for the U.S. Basically, China thinks mining is bad for its own air, but ours can get poisoned and destroyed? That’s basically what the nation is saying… Mining is okay so long as it doesn’t occur within its own borders.</p>
<p>Gladys Anderson is currently living in a city called Bono in Arkansas. She says there’s been a crypto mining facility near her home for a while now, and it’s caused plenty of problems for her and her family. In an interview, she stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s caused a lot of headaches&#8230;I&#8217;ve been to the doctor over headaches. My son is currently in the backyard having a meltdown… They&#8217;re not going to tell you the truth. They&#8217;re not going to do what they say they&#8217;re going to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vilonia councilman Mike Matos stated that the high level of energy use is a big concern for him. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was discussed in a planning meeting that they were going to be using the equivalent of 30 schools worth of power, and one of the questions posed was, &#8216;What happens if another investor wants to come to our city and our power grid needs to be upgraded because of the massive amount of energy this thing is using?’</p></blockquote>
<p>Vilonia mayor Preston Scroggins also isn’t a big fan of what’s happening. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think foreign ownership of farmland and stuff is&#8230;at least the federal government and I understand the state government did something good. They passed a bill banning that. I wish we could do more here in our country.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Paving Space for the Business</h2>
<p>The mine hasn’t been fully approved yet, but it could potentially go through thanks to what’s known as Act 851 in Vilonia, which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data centers create jobs, pay taxes, and provide general economic value to local communities and this state… [The] local government shall not enact or adopt an ordinance, policy, or action that limits the sound decibels generated from home digital asset mining other than the limits set for sound pollution generally, [or] impose a different requirement for a digital asset mining business than is applicable to any requirement for a data center.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">getting a lot of heat</a> from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and related agencies. Not long ago, Jareck Jakubcek – the head of law enforcement at Binance APAC – <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/not-pretending-cryptocurrency-is-immune-to-criminal-activities-binance-head-of-law-enforcement-on-crypto-regulations/ar-AA1cJsbD">sat down for an</a> interview to explain the regulatory issues surrounding crypto and to explain that digital assets aren’t immune to criminal activity.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Going on with Binance?</h2>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>At Binance, we welcome opportunities to actively engage with regulators, and we support clearer rules of the game, clearer regulations. We believe that there [must] be a set of defined rules by which cryptocurrencies [must] behave. So, having a regulatory framework is a step in the positive direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jakubcek, who conducts his work in India, says his country has set up clear steps to ensure the birth of regulation that’s clear and efficient. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do support criminal investigations in India and other jurisdictions. So far, we have had a very positive experience supporting the Enforcement Directorate in India, its investigations, as well as working with other law enforcement agencies in the country. An example of such a practical cooperation would be our support [for] the E-Nuggets investigation. During this investigation, we have provided extensive support to the ED that too often, under very short deadlines, allowed identification of the suspects and ultimately led to a substantial seizure of funds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, Binance is facing several criminal charges from the SEC, which claims the exchange ignored securities laws and that it commingled investor funds with company funds. Gary Gensler – the head of the SEC – was also quick to dismiss any arguments that regulation is not clear in the U.S., and he said this is no excuse for companies like Binance to take chances or break present laws. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I find the talking point that there’s a lack of clarity in the securities laws unpersuasive. Some crypto companies might message that the laws are unclear rather than admitting that their platforms don’t have sufficient investor protection. Crypto intermediaries aren’t exactly lining up to register with the SEC and comply with the laws enacted by Congress.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Keep Your Head Up!</h2>
<p>Jakubcek continued by saying that bad actors litter the crypto arena, and investors always need to stay careful. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not pretending that cryptocurrency is immune to criminal activities. Unfortunately, there are many criminal actors who are using the popular narrative of cryptocurrencies, and they are creating scams and different Ponzi schemes to attract naive investors. My advice is do your own research. Look at which platforms are most popular. Look at whether these platforms are used by millions of people, if these platforms were tested through time, or if these platforms can guarantee that they have billions in assets so that you will decrease your counterparty risk.</p></blockquote>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum developers are working to take <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/distributed-validator-technology-marks-last-key-milestone-in-ethereums-current-era-1032389563">their digital baby</a> to the next level. They’re now establishing something called “distributed validator technology” or DVT.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Continues Its Trek Forward</h2>
<p>Right now, there are more than 600,000 Ethereum validators in the world. The problem is they are too independent of each other, so what one might see as a successful pushing of transactions forward, another might see as a failure. Also, these validators are still prone to several financial penalties known as “slashing.” This can occur whenever validators go offline for extended periods.</p>
<p>The idea is to ensure validators become decentralized and work in a fully decentralized environment. To do this, developers are making it so that private keys – usually only associated with separate or individual validators – can be split amongst all validators. They can be used to sign in by multiple people, thus allowing validators’ data to be shared across clusters of node operators.</p>
<p>Steven Quinn – the head of research at the staking service provider P2P – explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>From a technical perspective, what [this] means is you can geographically distribute the machines.</p></blockquote>
<p>To aid in the deployment of these distributed validators, Ethereum is employing the assistance of two open-source networks. The first is Obol; the second is SSV. The goal is to have two minds regularly agreeing with each other, so success somewhere cannot be seen as failure in another region.</p>
<p>Obol documents read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Should &lt;33 percent of the participating nodes in a DV cluster go offline, the remaining active nodes can still come to consensus on what to sign and can produce valid signatures for their staking duties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding DVT, Messari research analyst Stephanie Dunbar explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I’m most excited about is the idea of increasing resiliency on Ethereum and in the future, potentially on other blockchains as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ethereum has come quite a long way over just the last few months. While it was hyped long before it officially occurred, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/merge/">Merge update</a> – which took place in September of last year – was one of the final building blocks in establishing the world’s second largest digital currency by market cap as a proof of stake rather than a proof of work module.</p>
<p>The idea was to ensure Ethereum could continue running and garnering more developer attention by enforcing quicker transaction times and thinner gas fees. From there came the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/shapella/">Shapella upgrade</a>, which occurred just a few months ago in April of 2023.</p>
<h2>Withstanding All That&#8217;s Thrown at It</h2>
<p>Walter Smith of the technology firm Galaxy mentioned that the importance of DVT revolves around making the ETH blockchain more “resilient,” and that the network should be able to withstand whatever “external or internal disturbances” it faces. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>This can be from geopolitics, regulation, markets, or even less intuitive disruptions like fires or earthquakes.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Kwon – the nefarious founder of the now failed stable coin company Terraform Labs – will spend the <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/kwon-south-korean-cryptocurrency-boss-093016848.html?ref=upstract.com">next four months</a> behind bars in Montenegro after he was detained at one of the nation’s airports with forged documents and phony passports.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon Heads to Prison</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/disgraced-crypto-executive-do-kwon-pleads-not-guilty-following-arrest/">passports allegedly held</a> by Kwon at the time of his detainment included ones from Costa Rica and Belgium. He attempted to board a flight that was on its way to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Montenegro’s capital city of Podgorica. He was found guilty and sentenced to four months in jail. His former chief financial officer Han Chang-joon was found guilty of the same thing and will serve the same amount of time behind bars.</p>
<p>Terraform Labs created an algorithmic stable currency known as Terra USD. The problem with an algorithmic stable coin is that it’s not backed by any physical collateral the way a standard stable coin (i.e., Tether, USD Coin, etc.) is. There is no fiat currency, gold, or other proven financial product supporting it. Rather, it’s simply up because the people investing in it believe it should be up. It’s backed by “spirit” or investor confidence if you will.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous situation because if that investor confidence ever goes down (which it clearly did), the currency in question runs the risk of vanishing overnight, and that’s exactly what happened with Terra USD, though the circumstances surrounding the token’s demise appear more complicated in their own ways.</p>
<p>The Terra USD asset ultimately collapsed over the course of about 24 to 48 hours. Within that time, more than $40 billion in wealth vanished. As it later turned out, Kwon and his fellow executives began taking their Terra reserves and placing them into bitcoin just weeks before the crash occurred, suggesting that Kwon and those behind the currency were engaged in a rug pull of sorts or some other form of malicious activity designed to hurt investors while they walked away without a scratch.</p>
<p>This raised serious suspicions <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-executive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro/">with law enforcement</a> officials in South Korea, where Terraform Labs was based. An arrest warrant for Kwon was issued after it was determined he was responsible for a multi-billion-dollar fraud scheme, though it was explained in news headlines that he eventually became a fugitive that sought to avoid capture and time in prison. Kwon was quick to deny this on social media, claiming he was coding in his living room and that he was willing to cooperate with law enforcement in any way he could.</p>
<h2>Trying to Appeal</h2>
<p>Following his detainment and prison sentence, a defense lawyer for Kwon named Goran Rodic explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once we receive the verdict in writing, we will consult with our client about [a] possible appeal.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada has just finished having <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/first-ever-canadian-bitcoin-conference-wraps-up-in-toronto-1032397885">its first ever</a> bitcoin conference. Taking place at the Chelsea Hotel in mid-June in downtown Toronto, the event was a huge success and is one of the first of its kind in the Great White North.</p>
<h2>Canada and Bitcoin&#8230; Growing Stronger Together?</h2>
<p>Canada has had a relatively mixed history with bitcoin and crypto. Between <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/quadriga-cx/">Quadriga CX</a> – which is being labeled as some as the <em>first</em> <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> given the amount of money that’s been lost – and the harsh regulations it’s enforced that have caused some crypto <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-will-proactively-withdraw-canada-2023-05-12/">exchanges and related companies</a> to leave, it’s not always considered the best region for crypto innovation, so it’s always positive to see things like this occur.</p>
<p>The Canada event was organized by Daniel and Manuela Carlin, with over a dozen volunteers also giving their time. More than 300 people attended, and tickets were available for between $136 and $377. Daniel expressed great enthusiasm for the industry, and he thinks it’ll go quite far. In an interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin adoption has been steadily growing over the last number of years, and that will continue. I think it will accelerate. One day, we’ll wake up and it’ll just be a big green candle to the moon.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the event, Francis Pouliot – the CEO of Bull Bitcoin – unveiled a new mobile app for his enterprise that would allow customers to purchase BTC directly from the Canadian exchange. He released a tweet about the product that read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Still a bunch of work to do before I&#8217;m happy with a release, but testing is still appreciated!</p></blockquote>
<p>Another startup to make an appearance at the event was called Panties for Bitcoin. It has nothing to do with technology. Rather, creators design underwear with bitcoin logos and images on it. The founder is a man named Pablo, who hails from Argentina and later immigrated to Canada to work as an industrial engineer, though he has 50 years’ experience in fashion and is now getting his son Michael involved in the company. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before bitcoin, I was a panty manufacturer. Now, I&#8217;m a bitcoin nerd who manufactures panties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michael also threw his two cents into the mix, claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, we have one style of bra and three styles of panties. The next step will be to get a boxer around the time of pacific bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Getting Rid of the Pond Scum</h2>
<p>Stephan Livera of D-Central was also at the conference. He offered a discussion about self-custody in bitcoin. He was also quick to say that the industry has become saturated with what he called “sh*t coin casinos.” He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you sit by the bank of the river long enough, you can watch the bodies of your enemies float by. So, I think we’ll see that with some of these sh*t coin casinos.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Wharton – a former campaign manager to Boris Johnson that’s now leading an education quango – is being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/18/tory-peer-james-wharton-working-for-crypto-lobbying-firm-northpoint-strategy">questioned over his alleged</a> ties to a crypto lobbying firm.</p>
<h2>James Wharton Criticized for Ties to Crypto</h2>
<p>Wharton presently leads an organization known as the Office for Students (OFS). However, he’s also launched a new public affairs company designed to help clients “navigate the complexities” of Westminster. He also provides legal counseling on regulated sectors.</p>
<p>That company – known as North Point Strategy – is managing a group called the UK Crypto Asset Business Council (UKCBC). It emerged a few years back and began working in the lobbying sector while trying to build connections within the UK Parliament. The main goal of the UKCBC is to establish the United Kingdom as a leading crypto hub.</p>
<p>Among the tactics it’s undertaken to create this future have been writing to both civil servants and ministers and meeting with Treasury officials. Wharton was appointed to the organization about two years ago in 2021, but his attachment to the group is now being criticized by the UK Labor Party, which says Wharton is placing his own interests above those involved in education (people he’s purportedly trying to help through the quango mentioned above).</p>
<p>Matt Western – the shadow minister for higher education with the Labor Party – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the latest in a long line of examples of the chair of the Office for Students putting his political interests above the interests of students. Students rightly expect swift action from the independent regulator on matters that affect them the most. It is less than clear how Lord Wharton’s additional commitment helps further those interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the past several months, crypto has taken a new lead on regulators’ priorities lists in the UK. Not long ago, it was believed that crypto trading should fall under the same <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-united-kingdom-wants-gambling-laws-to-apply-to-crypto-trading/">rules and guidelines</a> that apply to gambling. In other words, buying bitcoin, in lawmakers’ eyes, was a lot like sitting down and betting one’s money at a blackjack table, a metaphor that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/finance-professor-disagrees-with-united-kingdom-sentiment-towards-crypto/">has been criticized</a> by many.</p>
<p>The main idea behind the gambling comparison, however, stems from regulators’ blatant feelings that crypto assets like bitcoin have no intrinsic value and are very risky endeavors.</p>
<h2>The UK Is Leading the Way to Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>After the UKCBC’s work with the Treasury came to public attention, a Treasury spokesperson emerged and issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Government officials have consulted with well over 50 crypto organizations, including one meeting with UKCBC, to ensure our new crypto asset regulatory regime achieves robust, transparent, and fair standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the disastrous <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">fall of FTX</a> last November, the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-united-kingdom-announces-plans-for-new-crypto-regulations/">became one of the first</a> regions in the world to get serious about crypto regulation and impose strict new laws designed to regulate trading and keep investors protected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Ben Zhang – a former banker at JPMorgan and the co-founder of Node Real – believes blockchain and crypto are <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/06/32905479/ex-jp-morgan-banker-says-cryptocurrency-is-a-long-term-investment-opportunity">long-term investments</a>, and he thinks entrepreneurs and startups alike need to get involved now before things really explode.</p>
<h2>Ben Zhang on How Crypto Should Be Viewed</h2>
<p>Over the last year or so, the crypto market has been subjected to haphazard conditions that have really caused prices to sink. Bitcoin, for example, was trading 70 percent less at the end of last year from where it was at the end of 2021. The crypto industry’s overall valuation dropped by more than $2 trillion during a 12-month period, and things really took ugly (and unexpected) turns.</p>
<p>However, while it’s easy to blame <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/inflation/">inflation</a> and all these other economic factors, Zhang is confident the industry fell the way it did due to a lack of innovation. In an interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So far, I think business innovation for some specific areas is very good, but there are a lot of areas which lack innovation. I think crypto or web3 or blockchain is still in the very early stages. It&#8217;s the perfect time to start your journey as a startup, entrepreneur, or developer in crypto. You can learn some of blockchain&#8217;s fundamental technology and some of MetaMask’s wallet management.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said that the crypto space needs to be looked at as a long-term investment opportunity. One of the big issues, in his opinion, is that everyone wants to rush in, make a little money, and then sell their stashes as soon as they see some gains. This is the wrong idea, Zhang commented. People need to be in it for the long run. Otherwise, the arena is not going to succeed. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We should put more money in the crypto market and look for long-term investment. Crypto and blockchain are still getting a lot of attention. Now we have so many different regulatory frameworks, and it helps improve the downturn movement of crypto. I don&#8217;t think too many regulations cause a downturn. The downturn is caused by many factors including the macro economy&#8217;s instability worldwide, but there are so many regulatory frameworks, and [they’re] very difficult to follow.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Growth of Web3</h2>
<p>Discussing the implantation of web3, Zhang said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Web3 marks the next significant advancement in the evolution of the internet. Building upon the foundations of web1 and web2, which introduced user interaction[s] and social media, web3 represents a transformative leap forward. Powered by blockchain technology, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies, web3 is set to revolutionize the online landscape. Web3 environments are revolutionizing the gaming industry by enabling the creation of video games that utilize blockchain technology. Through these games, players can leverage the power of non-fungible tokens and token rewards within the game to earn profits.</p></blockquote>
