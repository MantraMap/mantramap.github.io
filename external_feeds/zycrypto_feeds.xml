<p>The past week has brought forth a series of regulatory uncertainties and price drops for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Over the past seven days, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost slightly over 4% following an intense battle initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against the world’s two largest crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>Amidst this tumultuous period, on Sunday, May 11, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported significant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-falls-below-26000-amid-regulatory-concerns-debt-ceiling-predictions-whats-next-for-btc/">Bitcoin</a> outflows from miners to exchanges providing further evidence to support the ongoing sell-off. As per the firm, Bitcoin miners sent many coins to exchanges in the past week, with the largest inflow reaching $70.8 million. However, although this represents the third-largest inflow on record, it falls short of the peak inflow of $101 million witnessed during the primary bull market in 2021, the firm said.</p>



<p>However, despite these negative aspects, other on-chain metrics offered a more optimistic outlook for Bitcoin. JA Marrtuum, an analyst at Cryptoquant, highlighted the continuous decline in exchange reserves, indicating a decreasing supply of Bitcoin available for trading. Notably, this trend contributes to the narrative of increasing scarcity, which historically has been a catalyst for price appreciation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/J7FDLopabQT86x60CPz5UeM1ezMMsxxqlyRakpwxzdVsmsHzvOPE9vbp-lB2SLtEQGaLdAeSJXLOcZ1fKZf1W-luqle9hSvD8CpTaNE2dn6xstHMMpzUP9lLX6EtkHD2HtR1IY38TwnSi1zcuAwx8w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>He also noted that the percentage of Bitcoin held by long-term holders remains steady compared to previous cycles. According to him, this suggests that despite short-term market volatility, a significant portion of Bitcoin holders remains confident in the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p><em>When we analyze Bitcoin from an on-chain perspective, it appears to be in excellent shape. In fact, it looks better than ever before,”</em> said Marrtuum adding, <em>“If you still have doubts, remember the old saying in the stock market: &#8220;When in doubt, zoom out.&#8221; When we take a broader view of the situation, it looks fantastic.”</em></p>



<p>From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is currently hovering around a critical support level. Analyst &#8220;Captain Faibrik&#8221; highlighted a falling wedge pattern, emphasizing the importance of defending the crucial trendline support. According to the pundit, Bitcoin bulls need to regain the $27,000 resistance level for bullish momentum to start. However, if the major trendline support is not maintained, there is a possibility of a bearish rally of approximately 15% in the coming days, he warned.</p>



<p>Another analyst, &#8220;Cryptocator,&#8221; focused on the short-term outlook for Bitcoin, emphasizing key levels to watch. He says channel resistance at $27,200 and support at $25,400 are crucial price levels. Failure to hold the support could lead to a further drop to $24,800 or $24,700. However, he said a break above $26,300 might signal a potential recovery.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $25,886, up 0.21% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has unveiled the hackers&#8217; identities behind the infamous Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange hack of 2011.</p>



<p>In a Friday statement, the DOJ announced that Russian nationals Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner had been charged with conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins stolen from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/big-btc-crash-ahead-mt-gox-creditors-to-be-paid-in-bitcoin-after-making-over-2000-gains/">Mt. Gox</a>. Additionally, Bilyuchenko was charged with operating the illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e from 2011 to 2017 in collaboration with Alexander Vinnik. The Mt. Gox hack was a significant event in the cryptocurrency industry, leading to the exchange&#8217;s insolvency.</p>



<p>The DOJ&#8217;s indictment alleges that Bilyuchenko and Verner, along with their co-conspirators, gained unauthorized access to Mt. Gox&#8217;s server in September 2011 and fraudulently transferred the stolen bitcoins from the exchange wallets to addresses controlled by themselves and their co-conspirators over about three years. Moreover, the two were also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, with Bilyuchenko facing an additional charge of operating an unlicensed money services business.</p>



<p>Additionally, the DOJ alleged that Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators operated a digital currency exchange that enabled criminals worldwide, including hackers, ransomware actors, narcotics rings, and corrupt public officials, to launder billions of dollars. The DOJ then expressed its commitment to identifying cybercriminals regardless of their location, emphasizing that Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators will face justice for the harm caused to communities.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner thought they could outsmart the law by using sophisticated hacks to steal and launder massive amounts of cryptocurrency, but the charges unsealed demonstrate our ability to tenaciously pursue these alleged criminals until they are brought to justice.” </em>Said Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York.</p>



<p>In a separate indictment unsealed in the Northern District of California (NDCA), Bilyuchenko was accused of working with Alexander Vinnik and others to operate the BTC-e exchange from 2011 until its closure in July 2017. Notably, BTC-e was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally and served as a means for cybercriminals to transfer, launder, and store the proceeds of their illegal activities.</p>



<p>Mt. Gox ceased operations in 2014 after the extent of the theft was revealed, impacting the credibility and trust in the cryptocurrency industry. That said, creditors of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox are set to receive compensation following the approval of a rehabilitation plan.</p>



<p>The plan, accepted by a significant majority of voting rehabilitation creditors, aims to reimburse victims, with eligible ones receiving approximately 90% of their assets. On Wednesday, June 7, the rehabilitation plan became “final and binding”, officially opening the window for compensation. However, although there has been no soft date set for the distribution, the plan is expected to be finalized before year-end, according to a previous communique.</p>

<p>Gary Gensler may have refused to say if ether and other cryptocurrencies are securities in the recent past — but the now-chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) certainly appeared confident about their security status back in 2018.</p>



<p>A video is making rounds on Twitter showing Gensler speaking at a conference organized by <em>Bloomberg </em>for institutional investors. Gensler was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the time, with the 2018 event preceding his nomination as chairman of the SEC by roughly two years.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1668328519334780928">video</a>, Gensler, a civilian at the time and speaking only in his capacity as a professor, says “Three-quarters of this [crypto] market is probably not securities.” He used Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash as specific examples, even stating, “Why did I name those four? They’re not securities.”</p>



<p>To catch you up, a security is a tradable financial asset with monetary value, such as stocks or bonds, that satisfies the infamous Howey Test. According to U.S. law, an asset meets the legal definition of a security if it is an investment of funds in a common enterprise from which there is an expectation of profit based on the efforts of others.</p>



<p>The clip of Gensler’s talk at the <em>Bloomberg </em>conference is one of many that have recently surfaced on Twitter. Still, in 2018, while giving a lecture at MIT, the now SEC boss affirmed that ether was not a security in the eyes of the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>



<p>It’s a statement that totally contradicts most recent comments as chairman of the SEC in which he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-indirectly-declares-ether-is-a-security/">says </a>besides bitcoin, which is a commodity, all other tokens in the crypto market are securities. Gensler has also launched a war against crypto exchanges — like Bittrex, Kraken, Binance, and Coinbase — claiming that they allow the trading of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Some Republican lawmakers in the U.S. have criticized Gensler for his latest enforcement actions that are obviously stifling innovation in the world’s biggest economy and forcing a slew of tech companies to relocate overseas. Congressmen Rep. Davidson and Rep. Emmer have even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-lawmakers-officially-introduce-legislation-to-oust-sec-chair-gary-gensler/">introduced a new bill</a> to remove Gensler from office.</p>

<p>XRP, the native cryptocurrency for the Ripple network, has witnessed an impressive surge following the public release of the highly anticipated Hinman documents.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, the popular cryptocurrency soared over 7% to tap $0.5650 at noon.&nbsp;This price movement was met with enthusiasm from investors, as the reveal is a significant development in the ongoing legal dispute between the cryptocurrency firm and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>In a tweet, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-says-hinman-docs-are-well-worth-the-wait-ahead-of-unsealing-today/">expressed his optimism</a> about the potential influence of these documents on the lawsuit, saying he believes “they were well worth the wait.”</p>



<p>The infamous Hinman documents consist of internal communication within the SEC related to a speech delivered in 2018 by William Hinman, the former Director of the Corporation Finance division. In the speech, Hinman stated that Ether was not a security. Ripple has always insisted that these documents will be crucial, shedding light on the SEC&#8217;s perspective on cryptocurrencies, particularly Ether and XRP.</p>



<p>Expressing his gratification, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601229688324097">noted</a> that the public could finally get a glimpse at what occurred behind the scenes. According to the lawyer, the documents reveal that Hinman disregarded multiple warnings regarding the speech&#8217;s fabricated analysis, which lacked a legal foundation and failed to consider the Howey factors.</p>



<p>Stuart argued that these factors, created by Hinman to determine when a token becomes &#8220;sufficiently decentralized&#8221;, were seen as introducing confusion and regulatory gaps within the market. He noted that despite the agency exhibiting inconsistent positions on the speech&#8217;s significance in litigation, it remains accessible on the SEC&#8217;s website. This is despite the SEC insisting that the documents were Hinman’s opinion.</p>



<p>Stuart concluded by calling for the immediate removal of the speech from the SEC&#8217;s website, investigating potential influences on Hinman, and reassessing the speech&#8217;s validity in discussions around the classification of tokens.&nbsp;He emphasized the need for unelected officials to faithfully apply existing laws rather than attempting to create new ones, as Hinman seemingly did.</p>



<p>It is important to note that as the legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC approaches its conclusion, the contents of Hinman’s documents can tilt the scales in favour of Ripple.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, apart from the public release of the Hinman documents, the crypto market has also been reacting to two other <a href="https://zycrypto.com/australia-based-lawyer-bill-morgan-tells-us-exactly-why-june-13-will-be-a-monumental-day-for-crypto/">notable events</a>. Today, the US Court of Appeals for the third circuit ordered the SEC to clarify a rulemaking petition by Coinbase.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-vs-sec-stakes-just-got-higher-following-binance-coinbase-lawsuits-as-xrp-win-proves-pivotal/">Binance US</a> is also expected to challenge the SEC&#8217;s request to freeze its assets. The exchange filed a motion in court on Monday, June 12, stating that complying with the SEC&#8217;s request would put it out of business if granted.</p>

<ul>
<li>The SEC has asked a US court for an order to temporarily freeze assets linked to Binance.US as it prosecutes its case against the company. </li>



<li>The Commission also seeks an expedited discovery period and substituted service instead of the traditional physical service.</li>



<li>The crypto community and industry executives have stood in solidarity with Binance, heavily criticizing the SEC. </li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market is under intense regulatory fire from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with Binance and Coinbase at the fore. Experts say this might only be the surface.</p>



<p>Barely a day after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance, the Commission is now looking to seize its assets to protect users. According to the filing made at the DC District Court, the SEC has asked the judge to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US through two companies. </p>



<p>The two impacted companies, BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services, act as the holding and operational firms for Binance US. The motion also requests that funds held by the two companies be returned to their customers, whether in fiat or digital assets.</p>



<p>If the motion is granted, funds overseas will be repatriated to the United States, and the companies, along with CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), would show cause against a pending preliminary injunction. In addition, the motion mandates Binance US to preserve all records without destroying, mutating, or altering anything.</p>



<p>The Commission wants the whole process expedited “<em>to ensure the safety of customer assets and prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment” </em>and will institute substituted service instead of the traditional physical method. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-community-roots-for-binance"><strong>Community roots for Binance</strong></h2>



<p>Binance has received much support from the digital asset community and industry executives following its regulatory battle with the SEC. The company, in its response, stated that it would “<em>vigorously” </em>defend its reputation, debunking all allegations. </p>



<p>The move to seize Binance.US assets has faced initial criticisms around digital assets spaces on social media. Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary expressed that the move will starve Binance of oxygen, adding that the entire sector may need to find another haven. </p>



<p>In reaction to Gary Gensler’s comments on the similarities between Binance US and FTX, crypto enthusiasts have fired back, asking Gensler why FTX was not sued and Binance being unfairly targeted. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that the recent attack of Binance was a ploy to “<em>distract users from how it handled FTX.”</em></p>

<p>It might finally be time to witness the last chapter of the SEC’s lawsuit against distributed ledger tech company Ripple.</p>



<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has hinted that the highly contested Hinman materials could tip the longstanding procedural fight with the Commission in his company’s favour. Garlinghouse implied there are critical insights to be deduced from the incoming reveal of the so-called Hinman documents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beginning-of-the-end"><strong>Beginning Of The End</strong></h2>



<p>Last month, a federal judge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">ruled </a>that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should release documents tied to former official William Hinman&#8217;s landmark 2018 ether speech to Ripple today, June 13. While Judge Torres will allow the SEC to redact the names and personal details of people mentioned in the emails and internal communications, she indicated that the SEC could not shield the so-called &#8220;Hinman Speech Documents,&#8221; explaining they were relevant to the judicial process.</p>



<p>While responding to a question put forth by cryptocurrency YouTuber Jungle Inc, Garlinghouse <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1668361426187218945">expressed</a> that while he could not disclose too much, he and Ripple&#8217;s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty see the speech docs as worth the 18-month fight to get them made public.</p>



<p>America’s securities watchdog has hounded Ripple in court for years, having accused the company in December 2020 of selling XRP as an unregistered security.</p>



<p>Ripple requested the documents in discovery, and the request was granted on Oct. 21, 2022. While the documents could be used as a part of Ripple’s defense by providing key context on the SEC’s stance regarding crypto security classification, the agency had tried to keep them hidden on multiple occasions, contending that they are irrelevant to the court’s summary judgment decision.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lawsuit Conclusion Draws Closer</strong></h2>



<p>Access to these now-controversial materials would mean Ripple counsel can finally understand how Hinman came to the conclusion that ether was not a security, which could impact XRP’s own categorization as a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most Ripple fans believe the imminent unsealing is super bullish for XRP as they price Ripple’s groundbreaking victory in the lawsuit. Should Ripple score an outright win against the SEC, it would mean the agency would have to acknowledge that XRP is in fact not a security.</p>



<p>While Ripple execs, including its CEO Garlinghouse, have long been forecasting a looming conclusion to the rollercoaster court battle, Deaton recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-sec-has-a-3-chance-of-winning-says-lawyer-predicts-xrp-victory-surge-to-10-price/">postulated </a>that Judge Torres would most likely come to a final decision before September 30 this year due to the “six-month list” that district judges are required to file to Congress.</p>



<p>XRP grew 7.41% over the past 24 hours to reach $0.5577 at press time. </p>

<p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler could be facing unemployment after Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) introduced a bill to remove the SEC boss from power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tyrannical-chairman"><strong>“Tyrannical Chairman”</strong></h2>



<p>In a June 12 <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1668305460368121857">tweet</a>, crypto-friendly congressman Warren Davidson announced that he had filed the “SEC Stabilization Act” in the House of Representatives.</p>



<p>“U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m introducing legislation to fix the ongoing abuse of power and ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come,” Davidson said in the Twitter statement. “It&#8217;s time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as Chair of the SEC,” he concluded.</p>



<p>Rep. Davidson, the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-congressman-mulls-pushing-legislation-to-remove-secs-gary-gensler/">initially announced</a> his intention to have Gensler fired from his role in April. At the time, he said he would be introducing legislation to “correct a long series of abuses” by firing the Chairman of the SEC and replacing the role with “an Executive Director that reports to the Board (where authority resides)”.</p>



<p>House Majority Whip and Minnesota Republican Tom Emmer, who co-authored the bill, <a href="https://emmer.house.gov/press-releases?id=F9BD4F5B-0C81-4DE5-8F65-E78B064CB060">posited </a>that “the SEC Stabilization Act will make common-sense changes to ensure that the SEC’s priorities are with the investors they are charged to protect and not the whims of its reckless Chair.&#8221;</p>



<p>While they will need bi-partisan support to pass the Senate, if the bill were to succeed, Gensler would no longer be able to serve in a leadership capacity at the top American financial watchdog. It would also overhaul the agency to redeploy power from the chairman to other commissioners and a single political party would not be able to hold more than three commissioner seats at a given time. According to Fox News, the bill would also add a sixth commissioner to the agency and create an executive director position. The SEC’s board of commissioners currently has five members.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC, Gensler Under Fire</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC and its chair Gary Gensler have drawn criticism from the cryptosphere — recently and in years prior — for not having clear-cut nor innovative regulations and for insinuating in different interviews that they truly want to destroy the crypto industry. Gensler has made it clear that he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-indirectly-declares-ether-is-a-security/">believes </a>all crypto assets — apart from bitcoin — should be classified as securities, and therefore, most cryptocurrency-focused companies and trading should fall under the SEC’s purview and comply with regulatory frameworks that are already being used for other securities.</p>



<p>Back in February, Rep.Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1625215670731390976">slammed </a>the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement technique when it fined Kraken $30 million and forced the exchange to close its staking program in the U.S permanently.</p>



<p>The SEC said last week it was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">suing </a>Binance, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the operating company for Binance.US on allegations of breaking federal securities laws. A day later, it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">levied similar charges</a> against rival exchange Coinbase (COIN).</p>



<p>While the SEC hits the crypto industry with a wave of enforcement actions, the European Union has been working hard to usher in a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-as-eus-mica-regulation-gets-another-green-light/">new set of rules for the nascent sector</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital asset lawyers say the judgment in the SEC and Ripple case could have substantial implications for the sector going forward.</li>



<li>Despite initial anger following the lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, crypto executives now see it as a platform to get clear regulations.</li>



<li>The digital asset community follows the cases keenly, backing both exchanges and criticising Gensler and the SEC.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The case between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v Ripple (XRP), filed in Dec 2020, is now more thrilling in its late stages as a potentially favourable ruling could spark off countless wins for the industry.</p>



<p>Web3 lawyers have expressed a close relationship between the Ripple case and the recent Binance-Coinbase lawsuit by the SEC. A ruling by the trial judge on whether XRP constitutes securities in the secondary market could set the tone for further decisions.</p>



<p>James Murphy, a crypto lawyer in a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/metalawman/status/1666864200147251201?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">tweets</a>, noted that a win for Ripple could “<em>undermine the entire basis for the SEC’s case” </em>against both exchanges it sued for allegedly offering trading services on unregistered securities. However, he stated that while it is only a convincing and persuasive precedent, it is not legally binding.</p>



<p>This means that the courts in Coinbase and Binance cases “<em>not be bound to rule the same way” </em>because only the Supreme Court of Appeal can determine binding precedents. Murphy, however, believes that the court will follow the Ripple matter closely as they serve in the same court in lower Manhattan.</p>



<p>Similarly, Bill Morgan, a partner at Morgan Mac Lawyers, explained that the judgment would be a game changer for the industry and the SEC, depending on where the pendulum swings.</p>



<p>“<em>If they lose badly in the Ripple case, they go forwards with Coinbase and Binance with a substantial judgment against them. Obviously, Coinbase and Binance will use that to their advantage that the sales of XRP are not an investment contract,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-others-allege-a-political-undertone"><strong>Others allege a political undertone</strong></h2>



<p>Since Gary Gensler and the SEC launched its renewed offensive on the digital asset market, crypto users and industry players have accused the Commission of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripples-lawyer-on-why-secs-gensler-must-recuse-himself-from-voting-on-enforcement-cases/">bias</a> toward certain assets and markets. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton feels the case between XRP and both exchanges are related, leading to the Commission’s decision to file the cases at this time.</p>



<p>“<em>I believe the SEC wanted to get those cases filed before that decision just in case it is a bad result for the SEC, possibly causing it to lose some political and legal momentum,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deaton further asserted that the Commission would tone down its aggression on cryptocurrency firms when big financial institutions acquire more shares in digital assets.</p>



<p>“<em>Once JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, or other traditional players get a bigger slice of the crypto market, then the SEC will become more reasonable,” </em>he added.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nigeria has passed a new 10% tax code on digital assets amid mixed signals from its regulatory agencies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Over the weekend, the nation issued a directive declaring the operation of Binance in the country as “illegal” for its failure to register with local regulators.</li>



<li>Finance experts feel the ban on Binance Nigeria is in line with its tax policy which places a huge focus on registration and compliance.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The country’s 2023 budget is riddled with an 11 trillion naira budget deficit and 6 trillion naira debt service cost, so it is looking for new avenues to fund its budget, observers say.</p>



<p>Nigeria has placed a 10% tax on digital asset profits in the latest Nations Finance Act 2022 amendment. The tax will include profits earned on trade, staking, or other cryptocurrency investments. According to the Capital Gains Tax Act, the word digital assets were infused into asset classes for purposes of taxation. </p>



<p>“<em>Subject to any exceptions provided by this Act, all forms of property shall be assets for the purposes of this Act, whether situated in Nigeria or not, including options, debts, digital assets, and incorporeal property generally,” </em>the Act reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The announcement of the new policy came with lots of backlash from the Finance markets, with many wondering how the government intends to tax a sector that it has described as “<em>illegal.” </em>Over the weekend, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the operations of Binance Nigeria Limited, the local branch of Binance in the country, are illegal and not in line with the laws. </p>



<p>The Commission also urged investors to be wary of the company and warned the exchange to desist from soliciting investment from the country.</p>



<p>“<em>Binance Nigeria Limited is hereby directed to immediately stop soliciting Nigerian investors in any form whatsoever,&#8221; the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in a statement dated June 9. It said the company was not registered or regulated, making it illegal.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-silver-lining-amid-chaos"><strong>A silver lining amid chaos</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the looks of things, observers have tipped a turnaround in the country’s dealings with digital assets. The Central Bank of Nigeria <a href="https://zycrypto.com/china-2-0-nigeria-intensifies-major-cryptocurrency-crackdown-after-cbdc-launch/">banned</a> cryptocurrency trading in 2021 with harsh words against the sector while floating its “<em>failing” e-naira, </em>creating panic for users. </p>



<p>That period looks over as the new President, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in his manifesto, recognized digital assets and created a path for them in the nation’s economy. Experts suggest that digital assets have received legitimacy with this new tax code because the government cannot tax what is illegal while infusing it as an asset class. </p>



<p>According to many, the ban on Binance, though harsh, is in line with the 10% tax policy forcing all exchanges to register with authorities for a regulated market. Nigeria has a pro-crypto population, and with plunging revenues, the government is looking for other revenue streams. </p>



<p>In 2022, Nigeria ranked 11th according to the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index amid tough regulatory policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a June 11, 2023 post, the private American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (also known as a16z) announced that it is expanding to the UK and would open a crypto office in London later this year. The office will oversee the growth of the crypto ecosystem in the UK and Europe.</p>



<p>“That’s why I am thrilled world-leading investor Andreessen Horowitz has decided to open their first international office in the UK – which is a testament to our world-class universities and talent and our strong competitive business environment”, said UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</p>



<p>Andreessen Horowitz said the UK has highly sophisticated, world-class regulators, making it well-positioned to lead in web3. Andreessen Horowitz said it had also invested in several UK-based crypto companies like Arweave, Aztec, and Improbable.</p>



<p>According to Andreessen Horowitz, UK policymakers and regulators are taking an inclusive approach to blockchain and digital asset regulation that includes working constructively with the industry to identify the unique attributes of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>The UK policymakers and regulators&#8217; approach also includes laying the foundation for future applications of blockchain technology and ensuring adequate consumer protection in any crypto regulation.</p>



<p>Andreessen Horowitz said that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation due to its deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and strong entrepreneurial culture.</p>



<p>Some U.S.-based companies are expanding overseas amidst requests from crypto companies for more regulatory clarity. There is also concern amongst crypto enthusiasts that the U.S. could lose the crypto leadership role to Europe, where parliament has already passed the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.</p>



<p>In May 2023, Coinbase opened the Coinbase International Exchange in Bermuda. The expansion will enable institutional users based in eligible jurisdictions outside the U.S. to trade perpetual futures.</p>



<p>In a May 2023 blog, Team Gemini announced that it had set up its European Headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Gemini also announced that it would begin applying for a crypto license to serve customers based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to make Gemini a global company.</p>



<p>Again in May 2023, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">Ripple announced a $250 million acquisition of Metaco</a>, a Swiss-based provider of digital asset custody and tokenization technology, increasing its presence overseas.</p>



<p>There is also concern amongst crypto enthusiasts that the U.S. could lose the crypto leadership role to Europe, where parliament has already passed the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Andreessen Horowitz emphasized that it remains committed to working with U.S. policymakers and regulators for more crypto regulatory clarity.</p>

<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has unveiled a &#8220;Stand with Crypto&#8221; commemorative non-fungible token (NFT) in a show of solidarity with the crypto community following the latest onslaught by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on crypto.</p>



<p>Described as a unifying emblem for those who believe in the future of crypto on its official website, this symbolic artwork aims to rally support and advocate for sensible policies surrounding cryptocurrency. The NFT features a striking blue shield, representing the collective determination to protect and promote the potential of digital currencies.</p>



<p>In addition to displaying support for the cause, the NFT will allow holders to actively engage with the community&#8217;s efforts and take various actions to advance the advocacy for crypto further. Over 135,531 NFTs were already minted at press time on the Zora NFT marketplace.</p>



<p>This unveiling follows closely on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing a lawsuit against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase</a> on Tuesday, just a day after a similar suit was filed against Binance.</p>



<p>In particular, the SEC argued that Coinbase&#8217;s platform operated three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets-those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies, yet<em> “Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets.”</em></p>



<p>Armstrong responded to the lawsuit by expressing his pride in representing the industry in court and seeking clarity on crypto rules. In a tweet, Armstrong criticized the SEC&#8217;s enforcement-based approach, stating that it was harming America and the industry, highlighting that the SEC had previously reviewed Coinbase&#8217;s business and allowed it to become a public company in 2021. </p>



<p>Armstrong further noted that introducing new legislation by the US Congress and the global move towards establishing clear rules demonstrated the need for regulatory clarity. He affirmed Coinbase&#8217;s confidence in their adherence to the facts and the law expressing his belief that America would ultimately find the right path forward.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Coinbase is publicly pushing back against the SEC. Earlier this year, the exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1630592674020335617">launched</a> a grassroots campaign dubbed “Crypto 435” aimed at advocating for pro-crypto-policy in all 435 Congressional Districts across the U.S. Through the initiative, the exchange noted that it <em>“will empower the Crypto435 community with information about how to contact specific politicians in their local districts, what those politician&#8217;s records on crypto are, tips for making your voices heard in D.C., and more.”</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the legal battle between the SEC and Coinbase takes a new twist, it remains to be seen whether the crypto community can stay resilient and determined to safeguard the future of cryptocurrencies in this challenging time.</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">Ripple</a> has entered a partnership with Canada&#8217;s largest university by enrollment, the University of Toronto. The partnership is a part of Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), a program that supports a diverse portfolio of blockchain research, technical development, and innovation at universities around the world.</p>



<p>The university plans to start work on an independent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/colombian-government-launches-national-land-registry-on-xrp-ledger-for-over-50-million-people/">XRP Ledger</a> Validator. UBRI has been driving significant blockchain and crypto technology research in Canada, which is an addition to the number of benefiting tertiary institutions in the country.</p>



<p>The program will allow university students to acquire and improve skills that will make them relevant in the fast-growing crypto industry.</p>



<p>In the last five years, Ripple has invested over $2 million in UBRI for top universities and colleges in Canada to foster knowledge acquisition in crypto and blockchain technology in the country. This is just a part of a total of $47 million the company has disbursed to universities worldwide, and the budget is increasing to $80 million for 2023.</p>



<p>Despite the ongoing case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple is working towards developing the crypto industry. This is a giant stride towards ensuring its impact is felt.</p>



<p>It is hardly surprising that the partnership is with Canada’s top university since the US has been hard on crypto and has intensified efforts this year by cracking down on crypto companies. UBRI has been chiefly active outside of the U.S. because of this, as other countries remain more crypto-friendly.</p>



<p><em>“As more crypto projects and companies look to build outside of the U.S., creating evergreen educational opportunities and growing a pipeline of talent is critical to our industry’s long-term success.” </em>Ripple’s Senior Vice President  of Strategic Initiatives Eric van Miltenburg, stated.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has many applications beyond crypto. With this program, Ripple is helping to raise the next generation of crypto and blockchain leaders who will help drive the industry’s growth in the future.</p>

<p>Holders of Cardano’s ADA, Polygon’s MATIC, and Solana’s SOL had a reason to smile on Monday as prices made a partial comeback— parring some losses incurred last week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged they were crypto securities in high-profile lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sol-ada-matic-stage-partial-comeback"><strong>SOL, ADA, MATIC Stage Partial Comeback</strong></h2>



<p>Although the SEC went after the world’s two biggest exchanges earlier last week, it also chose to namecheck a couple of cryptocurrencies that it describes as unregistered securities, triggering a fall across most altcoins.</p>



<p>Three of them — Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) toppled by around 29% each during the past seven-day span following the regulatory bombshells, according to CoinGecko data.</p>



<p>Yet, at press time, ADA rose 6.73%, SOL surged 1.1%, and MATIC was up 5.55% on the day as the wider crypto market remained mostly unchanged. The jury is still out on whether bulls will sustain the recovery in these tokens or whether higher prices will bring out the bears in big numbers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Securities Characterization Rebuffed</strong></h2>



<p>ADA was the first to have its regulatory status defended by its development company. ZyCrypto <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-devs-vigorously-dispute-secs-classification-of-ada-as-a-security-as-robinhood-mulls-delisting-coin/">reported</a> on June 8 that Input-Output Global disputed the SEC’s classification of its ADA token as an unregistered security, adding that the regulator’s allegations will not affect the firm’s operations “in any way”.</p>



<p>&#8220;The facts might be inconvenient to the SEC but are facts,&#8221; Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson further <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1668003846273085441">posited </a>today, pointing out that the initial financing and marketing for ADA was done in Japan and that no ADA tokens were sold in the U.S. Additionally, he said ADA debuted in 2017 as an airdrop two years after the vouchers sale, which was priced in Japanese Yen and Bitcoin.</p>



<p>On Saturday, the Switzerland-based Solana Foundation <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1667578529612017666">tweeted </a>its disagreement with the SEC’s framing of SOL as a security. Similar to IOG, the Solana Foundation emphasized its commitment to collaborating with regulators in the statement, noting “regulatory clarity” is an issue that affects everyone in the crypto sector that’s “building” in the United States.</p>



<p>Hours after the non-profit dedicated to stewarding SOL rebuffed the SEC’s securities claim, Polygon Labs <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1667643925232852996">took to Twitter</a> to address for the first time the SEC’s classification of its native token MATIC as a security without directly addressing the regulator. The company attempted to distance MATIC from U.S. markets by saying the token was developed and deployed outside the US. Polygon Labs then said MATIC was &#8220;available to a wide group of persons” while drawing attention to the “global community that supports the network” to this day. Commenting on MATIC’s utility, Polygon Labs said the coin was helpful in securing the Polygon network from Day 1.</p>



<p>Since the SEC’s enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase, some major retail trading avenues, such as Robinhood, have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/robinhood-ceases-support-for-cardano-solana-and-polygon-after-sec-calls-them-securities/">cut support for ADA, SOL, and MATIC </a>in response to the regulatory filings.</p>



<p>Other companies could soon follow suit, but in the meantime, each respective development foundation tied to the trio of coins is pushing to clear its token’s name.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the cryptocurrency initiatives that has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/3-catalysts-renewing-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-price-as-meme-coins-see-sudden-resurgence/">captivated investors&#8217; interest</a> and enthusiasm the most. The introduction of Rocket Pond, the creation of the SHIB Metaverse, and the impending mainnet release of Shibarium are just a few of the significant changes that the Shiba Inu community is anxiously anticipating as the project gathers pace and speed.</p>



<p>The launch of Rocket Pond, one of the 11 SHIB Metaverse hubs, was one of the most eagerly awaited updates. According to Marcie Jastrow, a Shiba Metaverse advisor, the Rocket Pond will be presented very soon. SHIB owners and fans are extremely excited about this news and can&#8217;t wait for the launch of this new metaverse hub.</p>



<p>The Shiba Inu project has focused on the SHIB Metaverse, and the team has been working hard to assemble it. Jastrow recently alluded to the upcoming release of a video presentation of one of the metaverse centers. With this release, the community can anticipate seeing a glimpse of the immersive universe that Shiba Inu is creating.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-outlook-hangs-on-as-shib-network-activity-surges-ahead-of-shibarium-launch/">Shibarium</a>, another ground-breaking invention, is also seeing rapid development. Puppynet, the Shibarium beta version recently released, shows continual upgrades and advancements. The developer team is working behind the scenes and improving the platform to offer the Shiba Inu community autonomous services and infrastructure.</p>



<p>These improvements mark significant turning points for the Shiba Inu project as it continues to gain popularity and draw an expanding user base. SHIB has lost two zeros since April, highlighting its remarkable price performance and market interest. This has sparked investor rumours and conversations about the likelihood that SHIB would soon achieve the coveted price of $0.001.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu lovers have expressed their enthusiasm and eagerness on various social media sites as they eagerly await these developments. There is palpable excitement for the next updates since SHIB holders think these achievements could significantly increase the value of their treasured coin.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the Shiba Inu initiative has strongly emphasised accessibility and inclusivity. According to reports, Rocket Pond and other metaverse hubs won&#8217;t be bought out by private investors. Once the metaverse is operational, it will instead be accessible to the general public and offer options for participation and community interaction.</p>



<p>The Shiba Inu community is on the verge of anticipation as the launch dates for Rocket Pond, the SHIB Metaverse, and the Shibarium mainnet approach. The planned updates are significant advancements for the project and can influence how the SHIB ecosystem develops in the future. Shiba Inu is already firmly entrenched as one of the most compelling projects in the cryptocurrency market, thanks to the enthusiasm and confidence that each milestone brings.</p>
