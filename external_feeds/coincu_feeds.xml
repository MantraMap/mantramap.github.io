<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>On Tuesday, Coinbase filed an enforcement action with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</em></li>



<li><em>If the SEC chooses to deny Coinbase&#8217;s request, it could still be required by the &#8220;Mandamus&#8221; to decide on digital asset regulation.</em></li>



<li><em>The crypto exchange argued that the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions demonstrate that it has not considered the lawsuit and ignored requests from the industry for many years.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/4Y8RdHCBOhXBvqYH51pw5P/564dd375bfeaaf866180888ef9a96432/2023.05.22_-_Dkt._27_-_Coinbase_Mandamus_Reply.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed </a>an enforcement action with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday and acted to petition Mandamus in response to the SEC&#8217;s disregard.</strong></h5>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/189137-coinbase-deletion-7-trading-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> has filed an answer in support of a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) petition in its latest move to seek a rule from the SEC for digital assets. Coinbase&#8217;s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, called the mandamus &#8220;a fitting remedy for extraordinary truths.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Late last night Coinbase replied in the Third Circuit to the SEC’s arguments against our petition for a writ of mandamus. Mandamus is the tailor-made remedy for the extraordinary facts presented here. We continue to appreciate the Court&#39;s consideration. <a href="https://t.co/OD02kX3524" target="_blank">https://t.co/OD02kX3524</a></p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1661025095173947393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Coinbase filings on May 22 stated that the agency decided to deny the exchange&#8217;s July lawsuit but has not made that decision public.</p>



<p>Last month, Coinbase filed a lawsuit against the SEC, asking the SEC to respond to a lawsuit it filed in July 2022 to create specific rules for digital assets. Earlier this month, a US court ordered the SEC to respond to a cryptocurrency rule petition filed by Coinbase within ten days.</p>



<p>At the heart of the dispute is the longstanding debate over which digital assets should be considered secure and, therefore, subject to the SEC&#8217;s trading rules. The regulator told the court earlier this month that the exchange&#8217;s most recent legal action was &#8220;baseless&#8221; and that they still have more time to consider the original claim.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1190-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1190-1024x576.png" alt="Coinbase Continues Digital Asset Regulatory Requirements In New Efforts With SEC

<p>In the latest filing, Coinbase reiterated its argument that the SEC decided to deny its request for the new rules and pointed to public comments from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.</p>



<p>The largest US cryptocurrency exchange also argued that the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions showed that it did not consider the lawsuit and accused the regulator of ignoring other cases from the crypto industry for many years.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The SEC does not dispute that since 2017 it has received five digital-asset-related rulemaking petitions and has acted on none.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is reported that the court order requires government officials to &#8220;correctly carry out official duties or remedy abuses of power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Syntropy Announces New Web3 Products at Aptos Hack Amsterdam. The protocol is changing the public internet into a safe and user-centric internet by including a unifying layer with built-in encryption and optimal speed that automatically allows anything linked to it.</p>



<p>The fund&#8217;s only purpose is to develop a game-changing Web3 product. It hopes to change that by working with important industry leaders to accomplish a common goal: to make Web3 mainstream for both developers and users.</p>



<p>The program targeted media monitoring for the goal of transparency and accountability in its previous $5 million funding round.</p>



<p>Syntropy aims to make significant development in the next year due to the support of its investors and the cash raised for the project. In line with this, it will develop a new website. It will also include a strategy describing the company&#8217;s future growth goals and objectives.</p>



<p>Syntropy is an open initiative that provides next-generation Internet connection technologies. It is intended to address concerns that currently exist in the Internet architecture, such as security, privacy, governance, performance, dependability, and inefficient resource consumption.</p>



<p>Additionally, Syntropy strives to address many of the inefficiencies and impracticalities that exist in today&#8217;s internet. As a result, it bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3, allowing for the smooth flow of data and applications while also promoting new business models and technological developments.</p>



<p>Moreover, Syntropy enables users to create encrypted connections without the need for complicated configurations or virtual private networks (VPNs). This simplifies the development, scalability, and monitoring of applications. Moreover, the network lowers latency to give the greatest possible performance for easily securing and distributing applications. It employs the consensus process known as Nomination Proof-of-Stake (NPoS). Validators may be nominated to participate in consensus using this approach.</p>

<p>Users may now create new zkSBT using Manta Network&#8217;s NFT Private Offerings (NPO) platform as long as they complete one of two Linea NFT campaigns.</p>

<p>Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, was the first to propose Souldbound Tokens. They work similarly to NFTs, except that they cannot be exchanged and are linked to the identification of a person or organization. These might be used for medical records or certifications as well.</p>



<p>These zkSBTs will provide users with a decentralized, trustless, and private mechanism to authenticate their true identities while preventing any information or data leakage regarding their on-chain behavior.</p>



<p>The revolutionary tokens will employ Linea&#8217;s zkPioneer, as well as a unique Manta invention called Proof Key, to allow any Web2 or Web3 application to validate a user&#8217;s information without connecting to a wallet.</p>



<p>Manta Network is a layer 1 blockchain built on Polkadot&#8217;s Substrate framework. Manta Network&#8217;s vision is to create a privacy smart contract platform, to achieve that, the project uses zk-SNARK to provide anonymity, high throughput, and cross-chain interoperability.</p>



<p>Currently, Manta Network is the only anonymous DeFi product that is compatible with all asset classes, including stablecoins, and provides security using cryptography instead of hardware.</p>



<p>Compared to public blockchains that also adopt Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology like Findora, Manta Network can support multiple cross-chain assets in Polkadot&#8217;s ecosystem. At the same time, Manta Network also reduces repetitive work in the evolution of Polkadot&#8217;s consensus layer ecology.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to an OFAC statement, a swath of Binance crypto-holding wallets was sanctioned for possible connections to the North Korean government.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange&#8217;s wallets received more than $2 million in cryptocurrency.</em></li>



<li><em>The money was subsequently transferred to North Korean companies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance wallets with links to North Korea have been sanctioned, according to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> from the US Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Meanwhile, on Tuesday, US agents raided a slew of wallets for possible ties to the North Korean regime.</strong></h5>

<p>OFAC said that the banned wallets, which included Bitcoin, Ether, Tether&#8217;s USDT, and Circle&#8217;s USDC, belonged to a 58-year-old North Korean citizen called Sang Man Kim. Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, housed the wallets.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not to claim Binance actively controlled the wallets; they seem to be automatically-generated wallet addresses maintained by the exchange and available to any user. According to blockchain statistics, there have been no transactions to or from these addresses in the last year.</p>



<p>Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist and Financial Intelligence, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The United States and our partners remain committed to combatting the DPRK’s illicit revenue generation activities and continued efforts to steal money from financial institutions, virtual currency exchanges, companies, and private individuals around the world.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the OFAC, the Binance wallets received more than $2 million in cryptocurrency. After that, the monies were transferred to North Korean companies, resulting in the sanctions.</p>



<p>The sanctions were coordinated with the Republic of Korea, which named two of the sanctioned parties jointly. South Korea had sanctioned three of the organizations in February.</p>

<p>Pyongyang University of Automation is one of the sanctioned institutions in charge of teaching personnel who go on to serve the DPRK&#8217;s principal intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. </p>



<p>The Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control has also designated two more RGB-controlled operation centers to lead offensive cyber activities. The facilities were linked to the Lazarus Group, a hacking outfit sanctioned by OFAC and renowned for stealing $620 million in virtual currency from a blockchain project in 2022.</p>



<p>North Korea&#8217;s use of illicit cyber activities to escape international sanctions, including cryptocurrency heists, has become a rising threat for US national security.</p>

<p>According to three unidentified individuals quoted in a <em>Reuters</em> article on Tuesday, Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has been accused of mingling customer cash with its own business earnings in breach of US financial rules. This breach is said to have happened in 2020 and 2021.</p>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/crypto-binance-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, one of the sources said that the combined funds were billions of dollars. According to the insider, the commingling occurred practically daily in Binance&#8217;s accounts at Silvergate Bank, a crypto-focused bank that shut down operations after a collapse in March.</p>



<p>&#8220;Commingling,&#8221; or the mixing of client and corporate assets, has become a kind of a feared buzz term in the cryptosphere since reports after the demise of exchange giant FTX in November last year raised suspicions that the practice was widespread.</p>



<p>According to the investigation, money from customers was sent to the Silvergate account of Key Vision Development, a Seychelles-based firm controlled by Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance. The exchange apparently advised Silvergate that the main objective of the Key Vision account was to accept USD payments from non-US consumers.</p>



<p>It was also claimed that a second Silvergate-based account connected to the Binance CEO&#8217;s Cayman corporation was used to convert funds into the dollar-linked coin Binance USD. But, according to the <em>Reuters</em> story, there was no proof that the exchange&#8217;s customer fund was lost or stolen.</p>



<p>Binance itself has been accused of money mixing after a January Bloomberg story showed that the exchange had retained collateral for some crypto assets it issued in the same wallet as monies belonging to consumers.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Binance&#8217;s Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann attacked the <em>Reuters</em> article, calling it &#8220;weak&#8221; and full of &#8220;conspiracy theories.&#8221; He said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The whole base of their story this morning, is that when users purchased BUSD (Paxos) from Binance, they were taken to a transaction page that had the term ‘deposit’ on it. Users were making a purchase of a stablecoin that was redeemable by Paxos, which was explicitly stated on the page.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hillmann later <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1660987014626287617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> that the conversation had addressed the matter &#8220;on multiple occasions.&#8221;</p>



<p>The current flurry of claims against the exchange for violating US banking regulations comes just months after the exchange was sued by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korea’s Ministry of Justice issued an opinion to the Ministry of Justice of Montenegro saying that Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon should not be released on bail.</em></li>



<li><em>Prosecutors in Montenegro have filed an appeal against Terra co-founder Do Kwon and chief financial officer Han Chang-<em>Joon&#8217;s</em></em> <em>bail conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Montenegro is not the only nation threatening Kwon.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=2668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local news</a>, The South Korean Ministry of Justice advised the Montenegrin Ministry of Justice that &#8220;the bail of Kwon Do-hyung (Do Kwon), CEO of Terraform Labs (TFL), is incorrect.&#8221;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176.png"><img decoding="async" width="976" height="549" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176.png" alt="Do Kwon&#039;s Freedom Is Receiving Intense Criticism" class="wp-image-189338" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176.png 976w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" title="Do Kwon&#039;s Freedom Is Receiving Intense Criticism 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>On May 23, a Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office official stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;I know that the Ministry of Justice expressed and conveyed the opinion that &#8216;CEO Kwon&#8217;s bail is inappropriate&#8217; to the Montenegro Ministry of Justice.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prosecutors in Montenegro have filed an appeal against the bail conditions imposed on Terraform Labs co-founder <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188332-do-kwon-withdraw-2-15-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do Kwon</a> and chief financial officer Han Chang-Joon.</p>



<p>Kwon urged the Montenegro court on May 11 to release him on bail of 400,000 euros ($436,000) under the condition of home arrest, and the next court agreed.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Montenegrin prosecutors filed an appeal, noting the low bail amount in comparison to Kwon&#8217;s wealth. It is unknown if bail was posted or an appeal was filed.</p>



<p>Kwon was detained in Podgorica on March 23 on allegations of possessing a falsified passport. Last month, Montenegrin prosecutors charged Kwon and Han with forgery for allegedly using phony passports from Belgium and Costa Rica. Forging papers is punished by up to five years in jail.</p>



<p>According to a prosecution official:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are working hard to request the extradition of Kwon, and we are closely watching related matters.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Montenegro is not the only nation threatening Kwon, Han, and other Terraform Labs executives with the death penalty (the company behind Terra). Courts in South Korea, Singapore, and the United States are also looking at them. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States charged Kwon and others with intentionally dealing unregistered securities.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in the country&#8217;s capital, Podgorica, also <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/pDQy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a formal appeal against the court&#8217;s decision to release Kwon and Han on bail on May 12.</p>

<p>The increasing demand for stablecoins in emerging regions with frail financial systems, such as Latin America and Turkey, is driving the growth of the stablecoin market. Stablecoins are commonly used as a means of sending remittances and storing value. They anchor their price to an external asset, usually a government-issued fiat currency, and enable cheaper and faster transactions using blockchain technology. Despite their growing adoption in developing countries, U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins still represent roughly 99% of the combined supply.</p>



<p>Num Finance offers collateralized loans in local currency stablecoins to businesses in emerging markets. Currently, the protocol issues Argentine peso and Peruvian sol stablecoins. With the additional funding, Num Finance will be able to expand its services to more countries and offer more financial services to businesses in emerging markets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FBI warns of fake jobs abroad that enslave victims for crypto scams.​</em></li>



<li><em>Victims are lured with lucrative benefits, salaries, and accommodation, but once they arrive in the country, they are forced to commit crypto scams online.</em></li>



<li><em>They are threatened with violence and have their passports confiscated. They are also told they must pay off mounting debt such as travel fees, room and board. These scams often target Asia-based victims.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently issued a <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230522#fn1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230522#fn1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public</a> service announcement (PSA) warning citizens of the increasingly prevalent issue of fake job ads &#8211; crypto scammer</strong> <strong>that trick people into traveling to Southeast Asia. </strong></h5>

<p>Once there, they are held against their will and forced to participate in international crypto scams that target unsuspecting victims.</p>



<p>The FBI explained that the fake job ads could be anything from tech support, call center customer service, and beauty salon technicians. These ads offer tantalizing benefits, including high salaries and free accommodation, which are used to lure in potential victims.</p>



<p>Once the victims arrive in the country, their passports are confiscated, and they are threatened with violence unless they commit crypto scams online. In addition, the victims are told that they must pay off mounting debt, including travel fees, room and board, and other expenses. In some cases, their debt gets worse when they are sold to other criminal groups.</p>



<p>These types of scams mostly target Asia-based victims. Unfortunately, reports of crypto scam rings using enslaved individuals to run fake crypto ICOs and scams regularly surface. For example, in November, Protos reported that thousands were enslaved in Cambodia by Chinese crime rings to run fake crypto ICOs and scams. This issue is a growing concern and should be taken seriously by law enforcement agencies and the public alike.</p>

<p>This surge in demand for LTC futures is the highest observed since the beginning of 2022, according to data from <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/LTC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coin Glass</a>. Open interest refers to the total value of unsettled trading contracts and can be used to measure trends in interest for a particular asset.</p>



<p>The jump in open interest for LTC futures may be influenced by several factors, including the upcoming halving event for Litecoin, which is often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.</p>



<p>Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has taken to Twitter to comment on the milestone achieved by the major cryptocurrency Litecoin, while the LTC halving event is just a few months away.</p>



<p>Martinez said that the biggest surge in the number of active LTC wallets over the past two years had been detected. The number of interacting LTC addresses reached 832,000 both as senders and receivers.</p>



<p>Aside from that, this year, the Litecoin network has demonstrated large growth. The number of transactions on it has increased by nearly 400%, the amount of the LTC supply held by retail users is around 50%, 60% of LTC holders are in high profit, and 3,900,000 wallets have been holding LTC for longer than a year. The coin&#8217;s <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/litecoin-hashrate.html#3y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hash rate</a> has been up 25%, too.</p>



<p>During the halving event <a href="https://www.litecoinhalving.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set</a> for Aug 2, the rate of new coin issuance on the network will be halved, and the reduction in new coins could drive up the perceived value of Litecoin due to increased scarcity.</p>



<p>Litecoin has seen modest gains this month, rising almost 7% so far this month from $85.25 to $91.4, according to data from TradingView.</p>

<p>This was the result of the Litecoin network adopting the LTC-20 standard, which allows issuing of tokenized assets on Litecoin, similar to Ethereum&#8217;s ERC-20. Now, developers can create DeFi, dApps, NFTs, and other cryptocurrency-based assets on the LTC network.</p>



<p>The halving will occur on block 2,520,000, and miner rewards will drop from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 per new block, meaning that twice as few LTC will be minted with each block. This is expected to help the price of Litecoin rise, similar to the effect of halving Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-recover-a-message-from-pascal-gauthier-chairman-ceo-at-ledger" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-recover-a-message-from-pascal-gauthier-chairman-ceo-at-ledger" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announcement</a> was met with backlash from the crypto community, with concerns over the security of user&#8217;s private keys. In response to these concerns, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier wrote a blog post stating that Ledger would work to increase transparency and accelerate its open source roadmap to address these concerns. He acknowledged that Ledger&#8217;s unintentional communication mistake took everyone by surprise and affected customer&#8217;s ability to understand Ledger Recover&#8217;s role for the growing crypto community and for Ledger&#8217;s future offering.</p>



<p>The service works by splitting a user&#8217;s seed phase into 3 pieces, which would then be shared with Ledger and an unnamed entity to be combined in the event of a user losing access to their keys. However, the company had struggled to explain how it would safeguard users&#8217; private keys, especially against the risk of hypothetical government subpoenas.</p>

<p>Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet had previously said that the perceived security tradeoff of the new product was acceptable. Gauthier tried to ease fears about possible subpoenas earlier this week when he said that it was not something that typically affects the average user. However, the concerns still persisted.</p>



<p>Gauthier said that the vast majority of Ledger&#8217;s codebase was already open source, and the acceleration would include as much of the Ledger operating system as possible, including core components of the operating system. He also announced that they would open source the Ledger Recover protocol, enabling the community to have as much choice as possible over self-custody. This, he said, would provide more transparency going forward and would not change the security of the device.</p>



<p>Moreover, users who want increased security can enable a passphrase feature that is not included in the Ledger Recover and can be &#8220;a fully trustless feature,&#8221; he added. While there were still concerns over the security of users&#8217; private keys, Ledger&#8217;s efforts to address these concerns through increased transparency and open sourcing their codebase provides a promising outlook for the future of Ledger Recover and its role in the growing crypto community.</p>
