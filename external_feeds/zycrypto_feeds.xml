<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has called out the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) for its regulatory overreach over crypto, arguing that it is hurting retail investors and small enterprises.</p>



<p>In a bold and outspoken tweet on Sunday, Garlinghouse addressed the SEC’s handling of cryptocurrency regulations, calling for legislative clarity to protect retail investors and small enterprises from the repercussions of the SEC&#8217;s enforcement approach in the crypto space. Notably, Garlinghouse&#8217;s tweet raised crucial concerns about the SEC&#8217;s actions and their impact on the crypto community.</p>



<p>“<em>An important topic has come up about protecting retail. The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction. Where’s that gotten us? Consumers left holding the bag in bankruptcy court while the SEC holds press conferences.&#8221; </em>He wrote.</p>



<p>He further highlighted the consequences faced by retail investors due to the SEC&#8217;s regulatory overreach in the cryptocurrency sector, emphasizing the need for legislative intervention to avoid confusion, resulting in retail investors being left vulnerable to the inherent risks of the crypto market.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;It’s absurd to blame a Judge for faithfully applying the law. We all know legislation – not more regulation by enforcement – is the only way forward to provide clear rules and protect retail,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>According to him, this call for legislative clarity reflects the growing sentiment among industry leaders that regulatory frameworks must be established to protect investors and promote innovation without stifling growth. Garlinghouse also expressed appreciation for members of Congress who have been advocating for more comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse&#8217;s comments come approximately a week after the court delivered a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">landmark decision</a> in favor of Ripple, ruling that XRP is not a security. This ruling brought clarity to XRP&#8217;s status and underscored the need for a more robust and predictable regulatory framework to govern the crypto market.</p>



<p>Over the years, the SEC&#8217;s handling of cryptocurrency enforcement has drawn considerable criticism, primarily centred around its potential negative effects on innovation and investment within the industry. While President Biden’s administration has been slow to take decisive action on this matter, several lawmakers have proposed pro-cryptocurrency regulations. However, none of these proposals has been successfully passed yet. Concurrently, a growing chorus of voices has been calling for the removal of SEC chair Gary Gensler.</p>



<p>That said, even though the recent court ruling in favour of Ripple&#8217;s XRP may have provided some relief for the crypto sector, the overall regulatory landscape remains uncertain. Notably, the SEC has recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-prepares-to-challenge-ripple-court-victory-heres-what-this-could-mean-for-xrp/">hinted</a> at appealing the court’s judgement which it argues goes against “fundamental securities laws principles” such as the Howey test.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) whales have recorded an uptick in trading activity in recent weeks, with short-term holders (STH) surprisingly at the fore. </p>



<p>In its latest newsletter, “The Week On-Chain”, digital asset analytics firm Glassnode explained that since the price of BTC soared above $30,000 in June, there has been a slight shift among different levels of investors in Bitcoin.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whales-transaction-count-of-1m-signal-declining-market-sentiment-here-are-its-implications-for-btc/">Bitcoin whales</a> exchange inflows hit a one-year high in July at 41%, following positive activity on the broader market. Observers have long noted that the actions of whales show an asset&#8217;s market health, leading to bulls understanding their ‘netflow to exchanges.’</p>



<p>“<em>Whale-to-exchange net flows have tended to oscillate between ±5k BTC/day over the last five years. However, throughout June and July this year, whale inflows have sustained an elevated inflow bias of between 4.0k to 6.5k BTC/day,” </em>Glassnode wrote.</p>



<p>Closely following whales, miners are also driving Bitcoin activities in exchanges as all-time high hash rates and mining difficulty looms. According to a report from Bitfinex, mining pools are deploying multiple strategies to sell large volumes of Bitcoin on exchanges.</p>



<p>Mining pool, Poolin accounts for most of the inflow as the report shows that overall, miners are hedging positions with derivatives exchanges tapping a 70,000 BTC 30-day volume this month.</p>



<p>“<em>Miners are clearly bullish on Bitcoin as they commit more resources to mining, hence triggering the mining difficulty, but they are hedging their position, hence the despatch of more Bitcoin to exchanges,” </em>the report stated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-short-term-holders-light-the-way">Short-term holders light the way </h2>



<p>The notion that BTC whales hold for extended periods may have slowed following a speculative investor trend in recent weeks. Short-term holders tend to keep assets for a maximum of 155 days, a trend that is now more common in exchanges.</p>



<p>Short-term holder dominance has spiked to 82% miles above the long-term holders&#8217; range, which fluctuates between 55-65% in the last five years.</p>



<p>Short-term trading activity among whales boomed with the infamous implosion of FTX, leading to whales looking to tap into the volatile price movements in the market.</p>



<p>“<em>From this, we can establish a case that much of the recent trading activity is driven by Whales active within the 2023 market (and thus classified as STHs). If we look at the degree of Profit/Loss realized by Short-Term Holder volume flowing into exchanges, it becomes evident that these newer investors are trading local market conditions,” </em>Glassnode added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BTC trades at $29,238 at press time, with outflows recorded in Bitcoin-related products after five weeks of consecutive inflows.</p>

<p>According to market watchers, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-good-bad-and-the-complicated-from-the-sec-vs-ripple-verdict-as-bulls-envision-10-xrp-price/">XRP Price</a> could hit $10 this year. This is not based on underlying fundamentals but rather on technical chart analysis. According to past trends, the price could reach $1.70 early this quarter, $6 in August, and over $10 in September if the monthly percentage sees the same trajectory as in the past.</p>



<p>However, it should be noted that technical analysis uses chart patterns based on historical data to predict the future. Not surprisingly, this method has its flaws and regularly receives criticism. Analysts admit that it is incomprehensible to ascertain if that price will be attained by Q3 2023.</p>



<p>While this price prediction seems a massive move from the current 70 Cents, it would still be far from another target some have. Based on a popular Simpsons meme, wild online speculations around XRP have reached $589 per coin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="646" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-1024x646.png" alt="" class="wp-image-83101" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-1024x646.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-1536x970.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-2048x1293.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">XRPUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>While nothing is impossible, expecting such colossal price movements in such short periods seems highly speculative. On the other side, many have been disappointed with XRP’s performance after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">Judge Torres ruled partially in favour of Ripple</a>.</p>



<p>On July 13, Judge Analisa Torres granted that XRP sold on exchanges did not constitute a security. The Judge said, however, that sales to institutions represent the sale of securities which in Ripple’s case means those sales were illegal.</p>



<p>Judge Torres has now passed on the case to Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, who has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/judge-suggests-its-time-for-sec-to-settle-with-ripple-following-historic-xrp-win/">suggested that both parties come to a settlement</a> before a trial commencing on the remaining issues.  Given this, the market may have priced in fines and future uncertainties, which may well be why the price has not seen new highs.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, XRP still has many positive developments, and the long-term growth outlook for the XRP-Ledger (XRPL) remains solid. From the announcement of the Canadian Imperial Bank to use XRP for cross-border settlement and payment to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-set-for-price-explosion-amid-ripples-expectations-for-250-trillion-cross-border-payments/">Ripple’s projections for $250 trillion in cross-border payments</a> by 2027, the outlook overall is good.</p>

<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed serious concern about Worldcoin, the highly anticipated and controversial project co-founded by OpenAI&#8217;s Sam Altman, which <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-targets-2-billion-users-with-worldwide-launch/">launched its WLD token on Monday</a>.</p>



<p>In a blog post, Buterin raised questions about its centralization, privacy, and security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-risks-and-issues-with-worldcoin"><strong>The Risks And Issues With Worldcoin</strong></h2>



<p>The newly launched Wordcoin project is among the crypto sector’s most polarizing. Its goal is to help people prove their identity online with credentials verified in person by iris-scanning orbs. This step provides “proof-of-personhood” that is cryptographically secured and used as a World ID. According to the company, the tailor-made device that uses the scan to create a unique identifier doesn’t actually process or store any related data locally.</p>



<p>In an extensive July 25 <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html">blog post</a>, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin outlined this system’s potential problems.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What do I think about biometric proof of personhood?<a href="https://t.co/yozo1buW24">https://t.co/yozo1buW24</a></p>&mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1683404462314999814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>For starters, Buterin identified four key issues with its biometric proof-of-personhood: privacy, accessibility, centralization within the Worldcoin Foundation, and security. Although he thinks some can be solved with technological improvements, “others seem to be fundamental limitations.”</p>



<p>Worldcoin Orbs will be distributed around the world to allow users to create their respective digital IDs. Buterin contended that there is no way to prove that the orb was “constructed correctly and does not have backdoors.” He theorized that “the Worldcoin Foundation still has the ability to insert a backdoor into the system, letting it create arbitrarily many fake human identities.”</p>



<p>His perspective was echoed by Bitcoin proponent Anita Posch, who <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1683404618070466560">indicated </a>that the centralized nature of the Worldcoin project and the sheer amount of data it handles could be a potential point of failure.</p>



<p>Buterin also argued that World IDs won’t be readily accessible to all interested participants as acquiring an “Orb” device can be challenging. In addition, he noted that the registry of iris may provide more details than planned. Case in point, if someone else scans your iris, they can verify it against the Worldcoin database to see if you have a World ID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Buterin recognized there is no perfect solution for these concerns. He sees the potential for a blend of various approaches to the issue. Community accountability, audits, and checks are paramount to this process, Buterin elaborated. However:</p>



<p>“Not having any proof-of-personhood at all has its risks too: a world with no proof-of-personhood seems more likely to be a world dominated by centralized identity solutions, money, small closed communities, or some combination of all three.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WLD Token Performance</strong></h2>



<p>WLD, issued on Ethereum and the popular layer-2 scaling solution Optimism soared double digits on Monday as <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-list-worldcoin-wld-9bc08522433c44b1b0b9978d65c4f5e5">Binance</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bybit_Official/status/1683477134147215364">Bybit</a>, OKX, <a href="https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobal/status/1683373651532591105">Huobi</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/gate_io/status/1683379305210949632">Gate </a>digital asset exchanges were all quick to reveal that they had kicked off trading for the Worldcoin token. </p>



<p>WLD is currently changing hands at $2.12 and is up by over 50% from its launch price, according to CoinGecko. The Worldcoin project has enrolled more than 2 million people around the world as of publication time.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/litecoin">Litecoin</a> halving on August 3rd approaching, anticipation among the crypto community grows, but does the price of LTC follow? After an all-time high of $347 in September of 2021, the Litecoin price is around $92 at the time of writing. LTC has been trading between $87 and $95 in the past week, with several up-and-down swings.</p>



<p>A Litecoin block halving event occurs every four years and involves reducing the block reward miners receive for validating transactions. Some market observers look to the Litecoin halving to gauge markets ahead of the Bitcoin halving.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-block-rewards-decrease-over-time"><strong>Block Rewards Decrease Over Time</strong></h2>



<p>Litecoin, dubbed the silver of crypto, is a fork of the gold of crypto, Bitcoin. The decision to implement block-halving events in Litecoin was driven by the desire to create a cryptocurrency with a fixed and limited supply, similar to the scarcity of precious metals like gold. Unlike conventional fiat currencies, which governments or central banks can print, Litecoin&#8217;s supply is capped at 84 million LTC.</p>



<p>The block reward will be cut from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC after the halving event, which will continue periodically until approximately the year 2142.</p>



<p>By reducing the block reward every four years through halving events, the rate at which new Litecoins are generated decreases, leading to a controlled and predictable inflation rate. This scarcity and controlled supply mechanisms aim to maintain and potentially increase Litecoin&#8217;s value over time as demand grows while the supply remains limited, making it more akin to a digital version of gold.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community Excitement Increases</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-and-litecoin-hit-new-daily-transaction-volume-thanks-to-ordinals-bulls-keen-on-massive-run-in-q2-2023/">market has a buzz and expectation</a> as the Litecoin block halving event draws near. As evidenced by crypto trader Ali, who stated in July that “Litecoin whales have bought over 590,000 $LTC in the last 48 hours, worth around $59 million!”</p>



<p>The halving, which lowers the block reward and restricts the supply of Litecoin, has traditionally raised interest in the cryptocurrency and driven up the price.</p>



<p>The number of wallet addresses holding sizeable quantities of LTC has also significantly increased in the months preceding the halving, reflecting an optimistic attitude among traders who think the scarcity would boost the altcoin&#8217;s price above and beyond $95. This accumulation of LTC tokens suggests a positive outlook for Litecoin&#8217;s future performance as the halving event draws near.</p>



<p>However, as the saying goes, &#8220;history never repeats itself, though it often rhymes,&#8221; therefore, only time will tell what effect the halving has if any.</p>

<p>Cardano is on the verge of a major breakthrough with the upcoming launch of Mithril, an innovative solution designed to revolutionize the network&#8217;s efficiency and security.</p>



<p>This revelation was recently shared by Input Output Global (IOG), the developer arm of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analysts-are-predicting-a-300-explosive-rally-for-cardano-amid-impressive-fundamentals-for-ada/">Cardano</a>, highlighting the exciting prospects of the upgrade. Last week, the Mithril team completed the deployment of the mainnet infrastructure for the beta launch. Additionally, they worked on implementing a stress test tool to benchmark the aggregator&#8217;s performance.</p>



<p>The journey towards the mainnet release of Mithril commenced in August 2022 when IOHK presented a comprehensive roadmap outlining the potential benefits and applications of the upgrade. Mithril&#8217;s primary advantage lies in its ability to expedite the process of starting a full Cardano node. By seamlessly combining the benefits of running a full node with the ease of a lightweight client that taps into trusted third-party sources, Mithril brings a considerable boost to the network, making it faster, more efficient and safer.</p>



<p>Moreover, the potential unleashed by Mithril for the Cardano ecosystem will be immense in the sense that developers of decentralized applications (DApps) will be empowered to deploy light clients and mobile applications, streamline sidechain operations, and utilize stake-based voting applications and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">governance solutions</a>. Through secure and lightweight tally verification, decentralized decision-making will be made more accessible, leading to outcomes that can be verified for transparency.</p>



<p>Notably, Cardano is currently in its Basho stage aimed at optimizing the network’s performance and scalability. By incorporating Mithril into the network, Cardano is on track to cater to high-demand DApps and enterprise-grade solutions, ensuring seamless operations and meeting the growing demands of its thriving ecosystem.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Cardano continues to sharpen its focus on scalability by continuously improving its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-releases-first-mainnet-compatible-version-of-hydra-node-ada-looks-to-ride-the-wave-to-major-gains/">Hydra layer-2</a> scaling solution, exploring the potential of sidechains, and implementing Vasil for enhanced diffusion pipelining. All these efforts combined are set to elevate Cardano&#8217;s position in the blockchain space even as the blockchain edges closer to the so-called “age of Voltaire”, which will usher in full self-governance, unlocking the network&#8217;s untapped potential and establishing a fully self-sustaining system.</p>



<p>That said, as Mithril advances through its testnet phase and prepares for a gradual mainnet rollout in the upcoming months, the true potential of its benefits will gradually emerge. And although IOHK is yet to provide a soft date for the mainnet launch, the solution, which is being rolled out in three Phases, is set to become “ fully decentralized and self-sustaining” sometime in early 2024.</p>

<p>According to renowned crypto lawyer John Deaton, an appeal of the recent Ripple court decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would not adversely affect XRP holders.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">decision </a>that Ripple’s XRP sales to investors did not violate securities laws has given hope to the rest of the crypto industry. It has also given hope to the slew of other crypto firms facing SEC charges for allegedly selling securities.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-prepares-to-challenge-ripple-court-victory-heres-what-this-could-mean-for-xrp/">suggested </a>in court documents on Friday that it could soon pursue an appeal of the judgment, prompting speculation that such a move would be a significant blow to holders of the XRP token.</p>



<p>However, attorney John E Deaton, representing over 75,000 XRP holders, pushed back against the claim in a recent Tweet. “An appeal is not even close to a setback,” Deaton opined.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An appeal is not even close to be a setback. First, it will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit, if it’s appealed. The Torres Decision is the law until then &#8211; at least in the 2nd Circuit. Second, even if the 2nd Circuit said Torres was wrong… <a href="https://t.co/GzW31D9edQ">https://t.co/GzW31D9edQ</a></p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1682863291947974659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The CryptoLaw founder explained that it would take a significant amount of time for the appeal to work its way through the court system, adding that Judge Analisa Torres’ decision would remain in effect for at least two years until the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals issued its own ruling.</p>



<p>Deaton further elaborated on the impact of a potential appeal outcome. He is confident that Judge Torres’ decision, particularly regarding other Howey Test legal factors such as the &#8220;common enterprise” and “investment of money”, would be upheld. In other words, Deaton believes the chances of the Second Circuit overturning this part of the verdict are rather slim.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC Created A “Mess”</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse, who <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1681795192746115072">described </a>the Torres ruling as &#8220;an unequivocal win for Ripple and for crypto in the U.S.,&#8221; separately <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1682869087511416832">lambasted </a>the SEC&#8217;s endeavours to be the primary regulator of crypto assets.</p>



<p>&#8220;The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction,&#8221; he <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1682869087511416832">tweeted</a>. &#8220;We all know legislation—not more regulation by enforcement — is the only way forward to provide clear rules and protect retail.</p>



<p>Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty followed up, stating that: “A securities agency only has jurisdiction over securities — no security, no role for the SEC.” He added that the SEC claiming jurisdiction over crypto is “simply a political power play” that “hurts everyone.”</p>



<p>If or when an appeal comes in, the Ripple case is anyone&#8217;s guess. That being said, Deaton is saying not to allow <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-to-win-an-appeal-against-ripple-former-sec-official-cautions-xrp-celebrations/">doomsayers </a>“underestimate how significant this win is for XRP and XRP Holders and Ripple.”</p>

<p>Worldcoin, the visionary crypto project spearheaded by OpenAI&#8217;s Sam Altman, has officially launched, propelling the dream of accelerating the global adoption of decentralized financial products one step closer to reality.</p>



<p>Announcing the development earlier on Monday, the San Francisco startup noted in a blog that the WorldCoin project could significantly enhance economic opportunities, safeguard privacy, enable global democratic processes, and potentially lead to AI-funded Universal Basic Income (UBI).</p>



<p><em>“In the age of AI, the need for proof of personhood is no longer a topic of serious debate; instead, the critical question is whether or not the proof of personhood solutions we have can be privacy-first, decentralized and maximally inclusive,” </em>said Worldcoin co-founder and Tools for Humanity CEO Alex Blania. <em>“Through its unique technology, Worldcoin aims to provide anyone in the world, regardless of background, geography or income, access to the growing digital and global economy in a privacy-preserving and decentralized way.”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, as per the Whitepaper, central to WorldCoin is the “Proof of personhood” concept that refers to establishing an individual is both human and unique. This will be achieved through the privacy-centric digital identity called World ID, along with the native cryptocurrency currency WLD, which can be acquired through simple verification of being a genuine human being. Worldcoin will be accessible through The World App, the first protocol-compatible wallet, which facilitates obtaining World ID and WLD through biometric verification using The Orb, a device that scans users&#8217; irises while ensuring <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-scams-will-only-get-worse-with-ai-cardanos-charles-hoskinson-warns/">complete privacy</a>.</p>



<p>As per the blog, the launch includes the release of the World ID and plans to scale Orb operations to 35+ cities across 20+ countries worldwide. However, Blania tweeted that Orbs were already available in over ten major cities globally, including Hong Kong, Tokyo, Nairobi, New York and San Francisco, encouraging users to sign up as the project expands its reach.</p>



<p>Altman applauded the team for its remarkable efforts in bringing the project to its current stage, emphasizing the significance of ambitious endeavours in driving progress.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I am super impressed by the work of the team to get to this point&#8211;the project has a level of complexity and ambition I haven’t seen very often. Like any really ambitious project, maybe it works out and maybe it doesn’t, but trying stuff like this is how progress happens,</em>&#8221; tweeted Sam.</p>



<p>With about two million users signing up for the beta, Altman further expressed confidence in WorldCoin&#8217;s journey towards two billion users, marking a significant technological and societal transformation.</p>



<p>That said, while the project&#8217;s success remains uncertain, its ambitious scope and potential impact on the future position WorldCoin as one of the most audacious endeavours in the crypto space. Meanwhile, debates surrounding its potential societal influence continue stimulating discussions within the crypto community and beyond, even as the sector emerges from a brutal crypto winter where giant blockchains like Terra and firms like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sam-bankman-fried-blames-crypto-winter-for-ftx-collapse-in-attempt-to-dodge-most-fraud-charges/">FTX collapsed</a>.</p>

<p>Electric car maker Tesla has removed the source code that once permitted BTC payments. However, the Elon Musk-owned company is retaining the OG meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) as a payment option.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doge-accepted-payment-option-for-tesla-merch"><strong>DOGE Accepted Payment Option For Tesla Merch</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto journalist Colin Wu drew attention to the rumors circulating on Crypto Twitter that claim both Bitcoin and Dogecoin are present on Tesla’s payment page source code. Upon further digging, Wu <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1681988930537943041">found </a>that BTC and DOGE have been present in the EV maker’s source code since January of this year.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong-based reporter observed that Tesla did not remove the source code when it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-pokes-massive-hole-in-the-bitcoin-market-after-halting-bitcoin-payments-at-tesla/">terminated </a>the option to pay in BTC in May 2021. Tesla <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin/">started accepting Bitcoin </a>as a payment method for its electric cars in late March 2021 after buying<a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-takes-crypto-enthusiasm-to-a-whole-new-level-as-tesla-invests-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin/"> $1.5 billion</a> worth of the asset. The pilot proved short-lived following concerns about Bitcoin’s high energy usage and was soon dropped.</p>



<p>Wu examined Tesla’s payments page and discovered that the company had finally decided to retain Dogecoin — originally designed in 2013 as a joke and poke fun at Bitcoin — but ditched the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization.</p>



<p>“At present, Tesla has deleted ‘Bitcoin’ in the source code of its payment page, but still retains ‘Dogecoin,” Wu stated.</p>



<p>Neither Tesla nor Elon Musk has issued an official announcement concerning this move. Nevertheless, it doesn’t come as a surprise as Musk is a self-proclaimed Dogecoin fan. Besides Tesla, Musk has also previously indicated that his other multi-billion-dollar enterprise, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-drops-major-signal-about-spacexs-starlink-accepting-dogecoin-payments-after-tesla/">Starlink</a>, would also start allowing DOGE payments for subscriptions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tesla Still A Bitcoin Holder</strong></h2>



<p>Despite scrapping Bitcoin payments, Tesla is not all done with the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Its BTC stash remains intact for the fourth straight quarter, as <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musks-tesla-still-hodling-184-million-in-bitcoin/">reported</a>. Tesla still holds approximately $184 million in Bitcoin. The company has not added or sold any BTC since the second quarter of 2022, when it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-above-22k-even-as-elon-musks-tesla-dumps-75-of-its-btc-holdings/">dumped over 30,000 bitcoins</a>, which accounted for 75% of its total holdings, for a whopping $936 million.</p>



<p>BTC is down 1.4% for the week and is currently trading hands at $29,874, according to CoinGecko. But the top cryptocurrency has rocketed by more than 80% since the start of the year, as a result of several factors. Recent bullish events include the U.S. Federal Reserve hitting the pause button on the latest interest rate hike and Blackrock&#8217;s landmark <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">application </a>to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US.</p>

<p>Following a partial defeat in its three-year-long case against Ripple over the firm’s sale of its native token XRP, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has revealed that it is now “considering the various available avenues for further review” of the court ruling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-prepares-to-challenge-ripple-decision"><strong>SEC Prepares To Challenge Ripple Decision</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple Lab’s battle with the SEC is far from over.</p>



<p>The judge overseeing SEC vs Ripple gave a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">summary judgment ruling</a> that the blockchain company’s crypto, XRP, is not a security, nor are sales of the token on secondary markets like crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>While the crypto industry at large celebrated the victory for Ripple, framing it as an outcome that showed cracks in the SEC&#8217;s armour, the financial markets regulator contends that the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-good-bad-and-the-complicated-from-the-sec-vs-ripple-verdict-as-bulls-envision-10-xrp-price/">verdict </a>goes against “fundamental securities laws principles” such as the Howey test, which decides what falls under the class of an investment contract.</p>



<p>These latest comments by the SEC about Ripple’s suit were made in a separate case against jailed Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, where the former crypto star is accused of allegedly “orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud.”</p>



<p>Do Kwon’s lawyers cited the XRP ruling as a precedent in a recent motion to dismiss the case against the disgraced Terra creator. In response to this motion on July 21, the SEC pinpointed a number of issues it has against US District Judge Analisa Torres&#8217;s decision on XRP.</p>



<p>“Respectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongly decided, and this Court should not follow them. SEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What A Potential SEC Appeal Could Mean For Ripple</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC plainly called the ruling in the Ripple case a “wrongful decision”, suggesting the commission might pursue an appeal and attempt to stuff the “XRP is not a security” judgment back in the bottle.</p>



<p>The SEC’s latest remarks come on the heels of chairman Gary Gensler <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleChart/status/1681003204924809217">saying </a>he was “disappointed” in the judge’s ruling and that the agency is “looking at it and assessing” that option.</p>



<p>The possibility of an appeal in <em>SEC </em>v.<em> Ripple</em> is a coin toss for now, nonetheless. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse is also of the opinion that it may “take years” before the SEC launches an appeal. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXh6bxKBkZ8&amp;ab_channel=BloombergTelevision">added </a>that an appeal by the watchdog would only fortify Judge Torres’ decision that XRP is not a security.</p>

<p>After months of consolidation and uncertainty, there is light at the end of the tunnel for Bitcoin (BTC) based on the upward momentum being witnessed. </p>



<p>As a result, optimism is engulfing the BTC market as bullish calls continue making airwaves. For instance, market analyst Michael van de Poppe took to Twitter and noted that new highs would be realized if the leading cryptocurrency continued trading above the $30,500 zone.</p>



<p>According to the analyst, new highs will be realized if Bitcoin breaks the resistance level at $31K. BTC was trading at $29,900 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>The uptrend propelled confidence in the market, as the Bitcoin: Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator showcased.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7m4xA2UoIhzo6W1Q0RHMEGzAatrRgcv_IbRxKNfwk2QpP3_qx8xyESnpeOkRQk_3kK0_8mTxPhDBuNDC7UMM-8GPXl62q1uzlC4xvP86W1cx8rlQ7zhiNZf5V9IDcrh4V179wvbjU8SbJrSOUdMkLPQ" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Glassnode</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ali, a crypto trader, acknowledged, “Market sentiment surrounding BTC has rebounded from a brief moment of “fear” and is now back to optimism.”</p>



<p>Whenever fear penetrates the market, an asset trades below its intrinsic value because investors usually shift their holdings to safe havens like gold. Therefore, the renewed optimism in the Bitcoin market is a welcome call because it’s a bullish sign.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-experiences-a-falling-wedge-breakout"><strong>Bitcoin Experiences a Falling Wedge Breakout</strong></h2>



<p>After trying to break out from a falling wedge pattern formed on the weekly chart in vain, Bitcoin recently realized this objective, as acknowledged by crypto analysts under the pseudonym Rekt Capital.</p>



<p>The usefulness of the falling wedge pattern is that it illustrates bullish momentum in the future as the trend direction changes. It is usually formed when the price continuously bounces between converging or downward-sloping trendlines.</p>



<p>Therefore, Bitcoin seems on the right footing as bullish signs continue to pop up.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, John E Deaton, a lawyer representing XRP holders, recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-could-soar-10x-to-hit-300000-reckons-xrp-holders-lawyer-heres-how/">pointed ou</a>t that Bitcoin could experience a tenfold increase and hit the $300,000 mark. This was based on a question he posed to his more than 276K followers on Twitter. </p>

<p>In recent weeks, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that several tokens, including Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL), are being sold on cryptocurrency exchanges which aren&#8217;t authorized to do so. However, the organizations that support these cryptocurrencies have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/far-from-securities-solana-polygon-and-cardano-issue-solid-statements-against-sec-claims/">rejected the SEC&#8217;s claims</a>. These tokens were cited as examples of securities being issued and traded on Binance and Coinbase without adhering to the requirements in the SEC&#8217;s actions against these companies.</p>



<p>In a turn of events, the well-known trading site Robinhood stopped supporting ADA, MATIC, and SOL from June 27th, 2023, at 6:59 PM ET, according to a statement. On June 26th, 2023, at 6:59 PM ET, transfer support for these coins ended. The notice makes it clear that none of the other coins on Robinhood are impacted, and the platform&#8217;s security remains intact for consumers&#8217; remaining crypto assets.</p>



<p>After the deadline, any ADA, MATIC, or SOL that customers still held in their Robinhood Crypto accounts were sold at market price, with the revenues being added to the users&#8217; Robinhood buying power. At the same time, the trading platform let go of around 150 of its employees or around 7% of the workforce, which comes as customer satisfaction and user activity plummeted.</p>



<p>To no surprise, immediately after Robinhood&#8217;s announcement, the altcoin market was in sharp decline. There is good news here, too, though. Most customers would have been aware of the move and moved their coins to other exchanges. However, trouble does not stop here as defunct crypto platform Celsius announced it would sell all altcoins, including ADA, SOL, and MATIC, on July 1.</p>



<p>This decision enables Celsius to concentrate on the two most well-known and valuable cryptocurrencies, streamlining operations and possibly lowering costs related to handling a wide variety of altcoins. In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin and Ethereum are more frequently used and liquid, making it simpler to acquire and sell them when necessary.</p>



<p>A Celsius consumer lawyer, David Adler, has opposed the company&#8217;s restructuring strategy. He contends that the proposed scheme breaks state and federal consumer lending laws. Adler complains directly about how Celsius handles Retail Borrow Claims, claiming that Celsius requires loan repayments without intending to uphold its end of the bargain by returning collateral to borrowers. According to Adler, this is against consumer lending regulations.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether the conversion occurs all at once or gradually over time, there is a chance that selling pressure on the affected altcoins may rise. It&#8217;s also possible that the market has already foreseen the potential effects and has already factored in the upcoming selling pressure into the prices of ADA, SOL, and MATIC.</p>



<p>The deadlines set by Robinhood and Celsius may signal a turning point in the altcoin market, in which a trend reversal happens after the announcement. Ultimately, it&#8217;s still unclear how the market will respond to these developments.</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-makes-a-comeback-as-holders-bet-on-huge-upsurge-amid-ripples-groundbreaking-win-in-sec-lawsuit/">partial victory </a>in its fight with the SEC last week, Ripple is setting its sights on obtaining a regulatory greenlight in the UK.</p>



<p>Ripple has already sent applications for registration as a crypto asset firm with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-eyes-uk-expansion"><strong>Ripple Eyes UK Expansion</strong></h2>



<p>American fintech firm Ripple continues its global expansion, initiating the process to secure approval in the UK after the legal win in the XRP lawsuit.</p>



<p>Sendi Young, Ripple’s European Managing Director, <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/ripple-sendi-young-aims-for-uk-fca-nod-after-us-court-win/">told </a><em>DL News</em> that the company had “very recently” applied for crypto asset firm registration with the U.K.&#8217;s FCA.</p>



<p>The company’s move to strengthen its foothold in the UK and European markets was motivated by the “huge win” in its battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A federal judge of the vaunted United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had reviewed the SEC’s drawn-out suit against Ripple and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">determined </a>last week that institutional sales of the XRP token violated federal securities laws, but sales on exchanges and programmatic sales did not.</p>



<p>Young emphasized that Ripple’s approach and growth objectives remain unchanged despite this recent courtroom triumph. The firm has plans to invest heavily in the UK, promoting exponential growth.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency companies have been choosing to enter the EU owing to its huge advances in regulating the space. The bloc&#8217;s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law, which creates a licensing regime that will let firms operate in all of its 27 jurisdictions was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/industry-leaders-upbeat-as-eu-parliament-passes-much-anticipated-mica-regulation/">passed </a>in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most recently, the U.K. has made significant steps to distinguish crypto assets from gambling, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/40999/documents/199652/default/">clarifying </a>that it views the industry through the lens of financial services, not gambling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP To Revisit $10 Soon?</strong></h2>



<p>Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP posted an incredible gain of over 70% on the same day as the landmark ruling.</p>



<p>According to well-known crypto strategist CredibleCrypto, there is no reason to be bearish on the fourth-largest cryptocurrency as long as its price remains above the $0.50 region.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As simple as it gets. There is ZERO reason to be bearish on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$XRP</a> as long as it&#39;s above .50 imo. <br><br>An argument can be made for a lower timeframe dip towards green, but how someone can be bearish on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$XRP</a> HTF here is beyond me.<br><br>If you want more, check the vid in my pinned tweet. <a href="https://t.co/mSHGCfHhBU">pic.twitter.com/mSHGCfHhBU</a></p>&mdash; CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1681876264196653056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>XRP is up 0.1% in the past day, currently changing hands at $0.79, per CoinGecko. The coin enjoyed another price bump this week after a judge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/judge-suggests-its-time-for-sec-to-settle-with-ripple-following-historic-xrp-win/">directed </a>the SEC and Ripple to agree on dates for a possible settlement conference.</p>



<p>Given the bullish regulatory developments, technical advancement, and the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-unseats-bitcoin-as-the-most-traded-crypto-asset-demonstrating-high-confidence/">popularity of the token among retail traders</a>, it is likely XRP could climb to the elusive $10 mark in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Scams and crimes related to cryptocurrencies have seen a significant drop of 65% in the first half of 2023, according to the recently released Crypto Crime Report by Chainalysis. The study highlights a decline in overall illicit revenue in various categories, including scams and darknet markets. In a recent interview with CNBC Crypto World, Jacqueline Burns Koven, the head of cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis, breaks down the data and provides insights into the reasons behind this decline.</p>



<p>Scams, which topped the list of crypto-based crimes, have decreased despite the increase in crypto prices. This may seem counterintuitive, as one would expect higher scam revenue with the growing interest in the crypto space. However, Burns Koven explains that investment scams might become more attractive in the future. She also points out that impersonation scams, particularly those involving authority figures and influencers, have not been significantly affected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-romance-scams-an-ongoing-concern"><strong>Romance Scams – An Ongoing Concern</strong></h2>



<p>The report highlights romance scams as an ongoing concern, as they continue to receive substantial scam payments irrespective of cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Burns Koven emphasizes the need to monitor and address this specific type of scam.</p>



<p>She said, <em>“Romance scams are agnostic to price fluctuations in cryptocurrency and on a per-victim basis are receiving more total scam payments than other types of scams.”</em></p>



<p>Asked about the decline in scams, Burns Koven attributes it to the disappearance of two major scams from the previous year, possibly due to law enforcement activities and pressure.</p>



<p>Noting that while this trend was positive, she said: <em>“This is a fragile trend and we are on the lookout for what the next big scam might be so that we can highlight it to investigators from the private and public sector and try to prevent their customers from sending funds to these scams.”</em></p>



<p>While overall crypto crime has decreased, ransomware attacks have witnessed a surge. The report reveals that ransomware attackers have extorted over $449 million in the first half of 2023, potentially making this year their second most profitable year. Burns Koven points out that this increase can be attributed, at least in part, to the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Russian-based operators have shifted their focus from potential military activities to ransomware attacks.</p>



<p>Another newly uncovered ransomware attack is Clop ransomware, according to Burns Koven, this has exploited a zero-day vulnerability to target numerous victims. Ransom demands have reached eight figures, indicating the growing financial impact of these attacks. The report predicts that if the current pace continues, ransomware attackers could take more than $898 million from victims in 2023, trailing only the figures from 2021.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention Remains Key</strong></h2>



<p>To prevent ransomware attacks, Burns Koven suggests a combination of factors, including law enforcement actions, sanctions, insurance policies that promote stringent security measures, and the availability of decryptors.</p>



<p>She added: <em>“So we&#8217;ve seen private sector companies, as well as law enforcement, come out with decrypters that they&#8217;ve been able to supply to victims so that they wouldn&#8217;t need to actually pay the ransom to get their data back.”</em></p>



<p>Apart from the rise in ransomware attacks, the report highlights the surprising decline in scam revenue, which fell by $3 billion compared to the previous year despite increasing cryptocurrency prices. Burns Koven acknowledges the positive development but stresses the need for continued efforts in education, public advocacy, and victim reporting to identify, track, and mitigate these issues.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Burns Koven advises vigilance since threat actors and scammers constantly adapt to new circumstances. Ransomware attackers, in particular, have been refining their techniques to overcome improved defenses by victims. With rising cryptocurrency prices, scammers will likely devise new tactics to target different victims within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The findings of the Crypto Crime Report for the first half of 2023 signify a positive trend but do not guarantee a sustained decline. Continued efforts from law enforcement, public advocacy, victim reporting, and education will be necessary to mitigate the evolving threat landscape in the crypto space.</p>
