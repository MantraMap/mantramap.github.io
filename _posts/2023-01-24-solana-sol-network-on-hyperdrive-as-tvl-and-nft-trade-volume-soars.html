Solana (SOL) is on hyperdrive as the network quickly gains momentum in terms of liquidity which are seen at more than 300% as of press time. Following a sweeping price decline, Solana has turned the tide with metrics with flying colors. Here&#8217;s a quick glance at SOL performance of late: SOL metrics and trustworthiness score looking positive Solana‚Äôs TVL seen to jump higher Solana rolls out Saga Pass Cards There is sizeable growth seen both in terms of NFT with the rollout of the Saga Pass Cards and market cap. Solana was seen to nosedive the past couple of weeks, but it‚Äôs now back on the top 10 cryptocurrencies list that is stacked at the green lane.

Evidently, following the FTX crash, short-term traders and the bulls were fixated on SOL which unlocked roughly 100 million coins from different contacts which could have punched a hole in the market, driving the price of SOL to null or $0. But, that didn‚Äôt happen as SOL holders chose to hold out their coins waiting for better days and not panic and sell their SOL holdings. True enough, the market gained traction and recovered with most assets moving north, including SOL which made the investors extremely happy with the gains. SOL total market cap at $8.9 billion on the daily chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com With this hypergrowth happening with Solana, the investors decided to accumulate longs which triggered SOL‚Äôs open interest to accelerate higher. As a matter of fact, around $460 million worth of orders is currently open at crypto derivative exchanges. Could this be bad news for SOL? Now, the open interest really isn‚Äôt the culprit here as it can‚Äôt really pull SOL price down but it‚Äôs the increased number of longs that could trigger a squeeze brought about by SOL holders rapidly selling their holdings to counterpunch future risks. On the brighter side, nothing is set in stone and SOL holders and investors need not panic right now as SOL has not gained much momentum yet to trigger millions in the liquidation of assets.
