					<description><![CDATA[Lido (LDO), the leading liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol, recently made waves in the crypto community by enabling staked ETH (stETH) withdrawals. Expectations were high as many anticipated a surge in stakers unstaking their ETH. However, contrary to these predictions, Lido has witnessed a remarkable increase in ETH deposits, reaching a record-breaking level. This surge has also been reflected in the protocol&#8217;s native token which has recorded a rally of more than 20% in the past week. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Surges 16% In Single Day, Maintains Dominance In Liquid Staking Market ETH Deposits Soar to New All-Time High Despite the introduction of stETH withdrawals, Lido experienced a surge in ETH deposits, defying expectations of widespread unstaking. On Friday, the platform witnessed a significant milestone as the total number of ETH deposited hit an all-time high. According to data provided by Lido, an astounding 6,373,289 ETH is currently staked with Lido, equivalent to more than $11.5 billion. Interestingly, while ETH deposits on Lido continue to soar, stETH withdrawals have remained stagnant around the 450,000 ETH mark, as reported by data from Nansen. It is worth noting that these withdrawal requests have yet to be processed, contributing to the overall stability of stETH withdrawals. This trend raises questions about the anticipated unstaking frenzy, prompting a closer examination of the factors influencing stakers&#8217; decisions. As the most significant liquid staking derivatives protocol, Lido holds an impressive 75% market share, surpassing its competitors in the Liquid staking (LSD) space. Notably, according to data from Nansen, Coinbase and Rocket Pool trail behind, occupying the second and third positions. Furthermore, while it may sound like positive news that ETH deposit is surging while withdrawal flattens, it is worth noting there are several reasons behind this so as not to get carried away. On the one side, the stabilized withdrawal can be attributed to the pending processing of withdrawal requests. On the other side, it can be attributed to stakers&#8217; long-term commitment to the protocol and the attractiveness of Lido&#8217;s offerings amidst the volatile crypto landscape. Lido Surges 20% In The Past Week Along with its surge in market share, Lido native token LDO&#8217;s price has experienced an upward trend in the past week up by more than 20%. Lido has surged from a low of $1.81 seen last Friday to trading as high as $2.48 on Wednesday. Related Reading: Lido DAO (LDO) Surges Nearly 20% In The Past 7 Days, Here’s Why LDO market capitalization has also recorded huge gains in the past 7 days. LDO&#8217;s market cap has surged 20.7% from a cap low of $1.5 billion to a high of over $2 billion on Wednesday. Meanwhile, LDO&#8217;s daily trading volume has only continued to range between $60 million and $100 million throughout the week. Interestingly, the asset has plunged over the past 24 hours down by 4.4%. LDO currently trades slightly above $2 with a price of $2.18 at the time of writing with a 24-hour trading volume of $62.1 million.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has now dipped below the $27,000 level as on-chain data shows the miners have possibly been selling the asset recently. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Taken A Sharp Plummet Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, miners have taken out about 1,750 BTC from their wallets during the past day. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;miner outflow,&#8221; which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that miners are transferring out of their wallets currently. The counterpart metric of the outflow is called the &#8220;inflow,&#8221; and it naturally tracks the total number of coins going into the addresses of these blockchain validators. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner outflow, as well as the inflow, over the last few weeks: Looks like the value of the outflow has been pretty high in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant Whenever the miner inflow has a high value, it means that this cohort is depositing a large amount of Bitcoin into their wallets. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be a sign that the miners are accumulating right now. Naturally, this can have bullish implications for the price. When the outflow is high, on the other hand, it suggests that a large amount of the asset is exiting from the supply of the miners. Generally, the main reason why these holders transfer their coins out of their wallets is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can be bearish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value. In the above graph, it&#8217;s visible that the miner inflow has been at relatively low values during the past day, implying that these investors aren&#8217;t depositing any significant amounts to their wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Stays Low, Here’s What This Means The miner outflow, however, has registered a pretty high spike in the same period. In total, around 1,750 BTC ($47 million) has exited the supply of the miners with this surge in the indicator. Since there haven&#8217;t been any inflows to counteract these outflows, a net amount of the asset has now left the miners&#8217; wallets. This would mean that if the outflows were made for selling purposes, a net bearish effect should appear on the price. An indicator that helps better identify whether these transfers were for selling or not is the &#8220;miner to exchange flow,&#8221; which tracks only the miner outflows heading towards centralized exchanges. Usually, this cohort uses the exchanges when they want to take part in distribution. As shown in the above chart, however, the metric has remained low recently, meaning that these outflows haven&#8217;t directly entered into the wallets of these platforms. Though, the quant has discovered that the destination wallet of the 1,750 miner outflow made another transfer, which was indeed towards an exchange. &#8220;There is a high probability that 1,750 BTC ultimately went to Binance,&#8221; explains the analyst.

Following them, however, the asset has observed a plunge and is now below this mark, suggesting that this latest selling pressure from the miners may have been behind the decline.

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently caught the attention of investors as its chart reflects a significant surge in capital inflows and buying pressure. These developments have left many speculators wondering if this positive momentum will be sufficient to initiate a much-anticipated price rebound.  With increased interest and activity surrounding Shiba Inu, all eyes are now focused on whether this surge in support will ultimately lead to a revitalization of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s fortunes. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Shiba Inu Price Consolidation And Increased Capital Inflows Shiba Inu, over the past few days, has witnessed relatively low volatility on higher timeframe price charts. From May 8 onwards, its price has oscillated within a range of $0.00000832 and $0.00000914, indicating a period of consolidation. At the time of writing, CoinGecko reflects Shiba Inu&#8217;s price at a mere $0.00000871. In the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency experienced a slight slump of 1.4%. The meme coin was up a very modest 0.3% over the course of the last seven days. Source: Coingecko Despite the recent price consolidation, the daily chart&#8217;s CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) and RSI (Relative Strength Index) have shown notable upward movements in the past few days. The CMF suggests increased capital inflows, while the RSI indicates rising buying pressure. SHIB Potential Rally Based On Fib Retracement, Market Conditions To analyze the potential price movement of Shiba Inu, traders have utilized the Fibonacci retracement tool by placing it between the swing high of the first quarter (Q1) and the lows observed in December. This tool helps identify crucial levels based on the Fibonacci sequence. If the current trend in SHIB continues and the overall macro environment conditions continue to improve, there is a possibility of a rally. This rally could lead SHIB to reach the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at approximately $0.00000967. Fibonacci retracement levels are commonly used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance levels based on the historical price movement. The 23.6% level often represents an initial area of interest where a significant rebound or reversal could occur. SHIB market cap nearly unchanged at $5.22 billion.

Positive developments and easing conditions could contribute to an upward movement in SHIB&#8217;s price. As traders and investors monitor these factors and the Fibonacci retracement levels, they will closely observe whether SHIB can indeed rally to the 23.6% Fib level, and if so, what implications it may have for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future trajectory. -Featured image from Nairametrics]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) has been embarking on a relentless quest for a price surge in recent weeks. As the market witnessed a flurry of activity, an unexpected twist unfolded when an anonymous whale made a significant decision—to sell a portion of their coveted meme coins.  In a move that raised eyebrows, one of these hefty Dogecoin holdings found its way to crypto exchange Binance, setting the stage for intrigue and speculation.  This interesting development came at a time when Dogecoin was fiercely determined to regain its footing and recoup some of the losses it had endured in recent weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Dogecoin Whales Make Waves: Massive DOGE Transfers Raise Eyebrows In a series of transactions, the Dogecoin community has been abuzz with news of substantial transfers involving the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Crypto platform @DogeWhaleAlert, known for tracking large DOGE transfers on Twitter, has recently reported multiple colossal movements of DOGE across wallets, with a cumulative total exceeding 100 million DOGE. 🐕🪙🐋🚨 14,835,380 $DOGE ($1,103,737 USD) was transferred from multiple wallets to a #Binance wallet. Fee: 1.00 ($0.07 USD) Tx: https://t.co/4lBCExiwYT#DogecoinWhaleAlert #WhaleAlert #Dogecoin #CryptoNews — Ðogecoin Whale Alert (@DogeWhaleAlert) May 17, 2023 Among the notable transactions, one of the largest transfers involved a staggering 14,835,380 DOGE, making its way to Binance. On the other end of the spectrum, the smallest transaction consisted of a still impressive 10,000,000 DOGE. Over a span of 24 hours, a total of five major transfers of the meme coin DOGE took place, as substantial chunks of cryptocurrency ranging from 10 million to 30 million DOGE were swiftly shifted between wallets.  The flurry of activity has piqued the interest of the Dogecoin community and the wider crypto sphere, as they eagerly analyze the implications of these substantial movements. DOGE Whale Behavior Sends Ripples Through The Market: Impact On Price The recent surge of large-scale DOGE transfers by anonymous whales has not gone unnoticed, and their behavior has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market. Unsurprisingly, the market has reacted to the recent whale transfers, resulting in notable price volatility for Dogecoin. The price of DOGE, as reported by CoinGecko, experienced a slight 0.7% slump in the past 24 hours. This downturn is likely attributed, at least in part, to the influx of substantial DOGE holdings hitting exchanges and potentially creating selling pressure. DOGE market cap currently at $10 billion.

This upward momentum, coupled with increased adoption and renewed interest in DOGE, may indicate that the impact of the whale transfers on the overall price has been mitigated by bullish market sentiment. Until then, observers will continue to dissect the actions of these anonymous whales, searching for insights and anticipating the next twist in the ever-evolving tale of Dogecoin. -Featured image from Cryptoglobe]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) shrimp investors, affectionately dubbed the &#8220;underdogs&#8221; of the cryptocurrency world, are making waves in the market as they steadily accumulate the digital asset at an unprecedented rate.  These smaller investors, often overlooked in favor of institutional giants, have recently reached a significant milestone, with the total supply of Bitcoin held by them surging to an all-time high of 1.31 million coins.  This surge not only highlights the growing influence of retail investors in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies but also underscores their determination to ride the Bitcoin wave alongside their more affluent counterparts. Related Reading: Conflux Network Partners With China Telecom For Blockchain, SIM Project – Details The Rise Of Bitcoin Shrimp Investors According to data analytics firm Glassnode, these shrimp investors have surged to an all-time high (ATH) of 1.31 million coins. The continuous rise in their holdings highlights their growing influence and raises intriguing questions about the evolving dynamics within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The #Bitcoin supply held by Shrimp Entities (&#60;1 BTC) continues to relentlessly rise, expanding to an ATH of 1.31M coins. The cohort is currently experiencing a significant expansion of +26K coins per month, with only 202 (3.9%) trading days recording a larger monthly growth. pic.twitter.com/Fa2QCHxZPO — glassnode (@glassnode) May 18, 2023 The data further reveals that shrimp investors are adding an average of approximately 26,000 Bitcoins to their cumulative holdings each month. This significant expansion is worth noting, considering that only 3.9% of trading days, equivalent to 202 days, have witnessed a larger monthly growth rate.  These statistics underline the sustained interest in Bitcoin among retail investors, who remain undeterred by its well-known price volatility. The Shrimp Investor Effect On BTC Price Dynamics Bitcoin&#8217;s price, as reported by CoinGecko, currently stands at $26,914, reflecting a slight 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours, while the cryptocurrency was up 1.4% over the last seven days. Source: Coingecko The surge in shrimp investors, indicated by their increasing accumulation of Bitcoin, can have multiple impacts on the current price of BTC. The sustained interest and continuous buying pressure from shrimp investors can contribute to upward price momentum. As more retail investors enter the market and acquire Bitcoin, the increased demand can drive the price higher.  This influx of buyers, particularly if they are accumulating the cryptocurrency at an unprecedented rate, as mentioned earlier, can create a bullish sentiment that attracts further investors and potentially leads to price appreciation.

A notable development in this space is the recent partnership announcement by Horizon, the creators of Sequence, aimed at redefining Web3 infrastructure. This collaboration has had a significant impact, particularly on Polygon&#8217;s governance token MATIC, which experienced a notable increase of nearly 3% within the past 24 hours. This bolstering of the infrastructure signifies a positive step forward for the Web3 ecosystem. Source: Coingecko This development came a day after Polygon’s blog post detailing the release of the v0.9 Testnet for Polygon’s Supernets. Once the final release of Supernets is launched, this partnership will surely affect the dominance of Polygon in the Web3 space.  Web3: Scalability, Seamlessness For Developers On Polygon The seamless integration of Sequence’s smart wallet and infrastructure stack on Polygon Supernets will pull business enterprises into the ecosystem. Polygon Supernets are custom-built blockchains for specific apps. The most important of these customizations is a custom blockspace, ensuring that the user experience isn’t affected by bumps in activity on-chain.  Sequence’s all-in-one development stack is the main attraction for both developers and investors. It is a complete package, covering tokens and NFTs to SDKs, the stack will fuel on-chain development as the release of Polygon Supernets nears.  To further push growth, both Polygon and Sequence will offer credits to incentivize developers to build on the platform. In doing so, the strategic alliance will have a strong effect on how quickly the Web3 infrastructure will improve.  .@AntimetalCloud launched its AI-powered cloud cost optimization platform, with an incredible $4.3M seed funding round led by @hiFramework☁️ 👉🏾We&#8217;re thrilled to have invested in Antimetal’s vision, driving innovation &#38; empowering the tech ecosystem More: https://t.co/beRTvlkVRE pic.twitter.com/TxJdJN76qv — Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) May 17, 2023 This isn’t the only move by Polygon to improve Web3 infrastructure. Recently, Polygon invested in Antimetal, a cloud-based platform, in a seed funding round led by Framework Ventures.

However, the current market structure is bearish, supporting the bears in the short to medium term. Thus, MATIC bulls should defend $0.8339 as much as possible.  With on and off-chain developments backing the token, MATIC might see a return to $1 in the coming days or weeks. Despite this, investors should be cautious in the short to medium term. Ethereum’s recent upward swing caused the altcoin market to follow as well.  If these price swings continue to move upward, MATIC’s rise to $1 is secured. With the market showing signs of strength, investors and traders should be able to enjoy gains in the long term.  -Featured image from DailyCoin]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price is struggling below the $1,840 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could decline heavily if there is a clear move below the $1,780 support. Ethereum is currently facing many hurdles near the $1,840 resistance zone. The price is trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,825 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,825 and $1,840 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Faces Uphill Task Ethereum’s price remained in a bearish zone below the $1,840 zone. ETH started a fresh decline below the $1,800 level and showed a few bearish signs, similar to Bitcoin. The price even declined below the $1,780 level. A low is formed near $1,772 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $1,800 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,834 swing high to the   $1,772 low. Ether is now trading above $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,825 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Immediate resistance is near the $1,820 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,834 swing high to the $1,772 low. The next resistance sits near $1,825 and the trend line, above which Ethereum could rise toward $1,820.

If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,825 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,785 level. The next major support is near the $1,770 zone. If there is a clear move below the $1,770 support, the price could decline sharply. In the stated case, the price might drop toward the $1,720 support zone.

					<description><![CDATA[The MATIC price recently broke above a key resistance level, indicating a positive development. However, its price appreciation over the past week has been modest, with only a 2% increase. MATIC has remained close to a critical support line on its daily chart despite the breakout. The technical outlook suggests that recovery might take some time as the bears dominate the price. Both demand and accumulation have decreased in the daily timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Stays Low, Here’s What This Means While MATIC currently sits above an important resistance, the absence of buyer support could lead to a significant loss in value before any recovery occurs on the daily chart. If the bears exert further pressure, MATIC will likely resume sideways trading, fluctuating between $0.81 and $0.84. The uncertainty in the Bitcoin price movement, as it fluctuates from $27,000 and retraces from that level, has impacted altcoins, weakening their respective price action. The MATIC market capitalization has fallen, indicating a higher level of selling activity than buying activity. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.86. It successfully surpassed the $0.84 resistance level in the short term, but buyer sentiment remained weak. The coin&#8217;s next significant resistance is $0.87, and breaching this level could initiate a recovery trend. However, if sellers persist, the altcoin could drop toward $0.81 and potentially below $0.80. The key for the bulls to regain control of the price lies in MATIC, staying above $0.86 in the upcoming trading sessions. The trading volume of MATIC in the last session was low, indicating a lack of buying strength. Technical Analysis MATIC faced challenges in generating strong buying support throughout April and May, resulting in reduced demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated a decline, with the indicator remaining below 40, highlighting the dominant presence of sellers in the market. Furthermore, the price dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers were driving the price momentum. However, if MATIC surpasses the $0.87 level, it will trade above the 20-SMA line. In contrast, the altcoin exhibited buy signals on the daily chart, albeit with a diminishing size and strength. The presence of green histograms on the Awesome Oscillator indicated buy signals for the altcoin, reflecting price momentum and potential reversals.

Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and the likelihood of price fluctuations, remained narrow and wide. However, the bands had a slight convergence, suggesting that the price may not undergo significant volatility or fluctuation in the immediate trading sessions.

					<description><![CDATA[An intriguing development has caught the crypto community&#8217;s attention as a Bitcoin whale deposited a substantial amount of BTC on the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange, Binance. This significant move has sparked speculation about potential selling pressure and the subsequent impact on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Notably, the massive deposit was recorded when Bitcoin showed signs of a rebound following its recent losses in the past week. Whale Moves BTC To Binance According to renowned on-chain analyst Lookonchain, a notable Bitcoin whale made a deposit of 1,750 BTC which is worth over $48 Million, on the Binance exchange a few hours ago. This occurrence has raised concerns among market observers, as large transactions can indicate imminent selling pressure.

On April 21, the same individual deposited a staggering 5,791 BTC (equivalent to $163 million), leading to a subsequent 3% drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s price within five hours. Notably, Lookonchain says this whale has a history of buying large amounts of Bitcoin. The analyst reports that the whale initially acquired 10,000 BTC, valued at $171 million, on December 1, 2022, when Bitcoin was priced at $17,101. And as of now, the whale has a current Bitcoin holding balance of 2,459 BTC and an approximate profit of $107 million. Bitcoin Reaction: Analyzing the Possibilities It is worth noting that the Bitcoin market reaction to this whale can be quite unpredictable as the large investor alone might have a different reason to move the coins besides selling them. However, given the historical evidence of price movements following whale deposits on exchanges, Bitcoin will likely experience a spike in volatility soon.

Glassnode Co-Founder Weighs In Particularly, If the past is any indication, there is a possibility of a short-term dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s price if the whale sells its BTC deposit. The sudden influx of 1,750 BTC into the exchange may trigger a cascade of sell-offs from other market participants, leading to a temporary downturn. Regardless, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has experienced a quick spike in the past 24 hours, up by 1%. Bitcoin has shown possible signs of rebound along with the rest of the crypto market. BTC has surged from low trading below $27,000 yesterday to trading for $27,406 at the time of writing. Before the bullish signs, BTC has since been in a downward trend in the past weeks, down by more than 10% in the past month. Interestingly, BTC trading volume remains below $10 billion despite the whale movement. Featured image from, Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>
