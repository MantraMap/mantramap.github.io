<p>In a series of tweets, Buterin highlighted his concerns about the competitive nature of the blockchain ecosystem and the encroachment of centralized systems at the expense of individual freedom.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The one comment I&#39;ll make is that I feel bad that <a href="https://twitter.com/solana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@solana</a> and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don&#39;t deserve it, and if ethereum ends up &quot;winning&quot; through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that&#39;s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term…</p>&mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1674644137847451649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 30, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Buterin began by expressing his sadness over the attacks on projects such as Solana, stating, &#8220;I feel sad that Solana and other projects were attacked in this way and they should not be attacked like so.&#8221; These remarks demonstrate Buterin&#8217;s empathy towards projects facing adversity and his belief in fostering a cooperative and supportive environment within the crypto community.</p>



<p>However, Buterin also voiced his concerns about Ethereum&#8217;s position in the market. He claimed that Ethereum appeared to be &#8220;winning&#8221; by allowing other blockchains to integrate and facilitate swapping capabilities. He expressed reservations about this approach, considering it less honorable and potentially unsustainable in the long run. According to Buterin, the real competition lies not among different chains, but rather in the rapid expansion of centralized systems that are being imposed on individuals at their own expense.</p>

<p>In his final tweet on the matter, Buterin expressed his hopes for fair outcomes for all projects involved in the current situation.

<p>Buterin&#8217;s tweets garnered significant attention within the crypto community, with many users appreciating his candid perspective on the industry&#8217;s dynamics and the need for a balanced approach to competition and cooperation. His remarks also served as a reminder of the challenges faced by emerging projects and the importance of supporting one another in the face of adversity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC will respond to Coinbase&#8217;s defense on July 13 after a recent court ruling.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange argues that the SEC lacks authority over the assets traded on its platform, as they are not securities.</em></li>



<li><em>The pre-trial meeting has been moved to July 13, and Coinbase maintains that many of the coins mentioned in the lawsuit are outside the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a recent court ruling, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will respond to Coinbase&#8217;s first legal defense on July 13.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-1024x768.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-1024x768.png" alt="Coinbase Defies The SEC In Landmark Lawsuit Showdown" class="wp-image-199155" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Defies The SEC In Landmark Lawsuit Showdown 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>This timing is surprising since Coinbase used a &#8220;creative&#8221; defense strategy by delivering its initial answer 40 days before the August 7 deadline. The SEC was supposed to respond to the exchange&#8217;s argument by July 3, but owing to the July 4 holiday weekend, they asked for a three-day extension, which the court granted.</p>



<p>Coinbase said in a letter filed just before midnight on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court that the SEC lacks the power to pursue civil claims against it because the assets traded on its platform are not &#8220;investment contracts&#8221; and hence not securities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Coinbase has answered the SEC’s complaint with numerous defenses, including that this action violates due process and constitutes an abuse of discretion. But there is a more fundamental problem with the SEC’s case— one that the Chair recognized two years ago and that entitles Coinbase to judgment on the pleadings now: The subject matter falls outside the SEC’s authority,” the exchange’s counsel said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.23.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter</a> to the court.</p>

<p>In addition, the pre-trial meeting has been renamed a pre-motion conference and has been shifted from August 24 to July 13 at 14:00 UTC. Coinbase has maintained in its response to the SEC&#8217;s complaint that many of the coins referenced in the lawsuit are outside of the Commission&#8217;s purview.</p>

<p>On June 6, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging that it gained billions of dollars as a middleman, including by trading at least 13 crypto assets, or tokens, such as Solana, Cardano, and Polygon, that should have been registered as securities. Coinbase was also sued for its &#8220;staking&#8221; scheme, in which it pools crypto assets to maintain activity on the blockchain network in return for &#8220;rewards&#8221; it gives to consumers after taking fees.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Crypto markets brace for turbulence as BTC and ETH options worth $4.9B and $2.3B expire soon, adding to market uncertainty and volatility.</em></li>



<li><em>Put Call Ratios and max pain points indicate a higher proportion of put options and potential influence on prices towards $26.5k for BTC and $1.7k for ETH.</em></li>

<p>A total of 159,000 BTC options, valued at approximately $4.9 billion, and 1.25 million ETH options, worth around $2.3 billion, are on the verge of expiration, bringing uncertainty and volatility to the already dynamic crypto landscape.</p>

<p>Among the factors contributing to the market&#8217;s unease are the Put Call Ratios and max pain points associated with these options. The BTC options have a Put Call Ratio of 0.56, indicating a slightly higher proportion of put options compared to call options. Meanwhile, the max pain point for BTC stands at $26,500, suggesting that market participants may seek to drive the price closer to that level at expiration to cause the most financial pain to option holders.</p>

<p>ETH options carry a Put Call Ratio of 0.57, hinting at a similar scenario to that of BTC. The max pain point for ETH is set at $1,700, potentially attracting market forces that aim to influence the price in that direction, further exacerbating the volatility.</p>



<p>Compounding the situation is the fact that over 40% of these options are expected to expire for delivery rather than being settled in cash. This means that the underlying assets (BTC and ETH) will need to be delivered to the option holders upon expiration, leading to a significant release of margin. The sudden influx of these assets into the market could trigger a downward pressure on prices, creating a bearish sentiment among investors.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>Zero trust is a modern security strategy based on the never trust, always verify principle. Instead of assuming everything behind the application, database, or AI model is safe, the Zero Trust framework takes a breach (has happened already or will happen soon) and verifies each request as though it originates from an open network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zero Trust Principles</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Verify Explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.</li>



<li>Use Least-Privilege Access: Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive polices, and data protection to help secure data and productivity.</li>



<li>Assume Breach: Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to gain visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Secure smart contract</strong></h3>



<p>By leveraging Mind Network&#8217;s Zero Trust architecture, smart contracts are protected from unauthorized access and the possibility of manipulation. This ensures the integrity and reliability of the contract execution. In partnership with Chainlink, Mind Network proposes a solution to secure Oracle services to transfer sensitive data off-chain to smart contracts.</p>

<p>It is reported that the Virtual Asset User Protection Act (Virtual Asset Use Act) aims to regulate unfair trading of virtual assets such as Bitcoin and protect users. It is the country&#8217;s first domestic law on virtual assets.</p>



<p>At a plenary session this afternoon, the National Assembly approved the Virtual Asset Use Act with 265 votes in favor, 0 votes against, and 3 abstentions out of 268 votes cast.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268.png" alt="BREAKING: South Korea Passed Important Crypto Act To Protect Users" class="wp-image-199137" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="BREAKING: South Korea Passed Important Crypto Act To Protect Users 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The first section of the law defines virtual assets. Virtual assets are described as &#8220;digital tokens with economic worth that may be sold or transferred.&#8221; Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) was excluded from the definition of virtual assets.</p>



<p>The law then specifies regulations for virtual asset operators to follow in order to secure user assets. It is required to produce and maintain asset transaction records, as well as subscribe to insurance/deduction or reserve accumulation in preparation for calamities such as hacking and computer failure.</p>



<p>Moreover, unfair trade was described as the use of concealed key information, market price manipulation, and counterfeit business methods. In the event of a violation, there is not only a criminal penalty but also civil culpability and the potential of initiating a class action lawsuit.</p>

<p>The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service resolved to resolve the problem of delegation of power to probe unfair virtual asset trades by a presidential decree rather than a legislative provision. The Bank of Korea has the authority to seek information on virtual asset operators. While virtual assets are not currencies, the claim that they will be required to implement monetary and financial stability measures has gained traction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korean authorities are investigating WeMade and its WEMIX token market maker following allegations of fraud and breach of trust.</em></li>



<li><em>The investigation includes a search and seizure operation at WeMade&#8217;s headquarters and market makers involved in WEMIX activities.</em></li>



<li><em>The company has faced issues such as unauthorized fund liquidation and fraudulent disclosure, resulting in delisting from major South Korean crypto exchanges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>South Korean authorities, according to <em><a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=3223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Asset</a></em>, have initiated a full obligatory investigation into the country&#8217;s listed gaming company WeMade and its WEMIX token market maker, including a search.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="749" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-1024x749.png" alt="BREAKING: WeMade Accused Of Fraud In The Latest Investigation Of The Korean Prosecutors" class="wp-image-199117" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-1024x749.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-300x219.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-768x562.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-750x549.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: WeMade Accused Of Fraud In The Latest Investigation Of The Korean Prosecutors 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>The search and seizure were carried out in response to a complaint filed with prosecutors on May 12 by WEMIX investors, who accused the firm of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust.</p>



<p>This is the first time the prosecution has undertaken a search and seizure in connection with WeMade&#8217;s mandatory inquiry. On May 24, the prosecution performed a search and seizure in connection with Rep. Kim Nam-guk&#8217;s WEMIX scandal, however it was not a WeMade probe.</p>



<p>The Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office Financial Investigation Division 1 has been conducting a large-scale search and seizure of WeMade headquarters in Sampyeong-dong, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, and market makers known to have been involved in WEMIX expedient market-making activities since the morning of June 30.</p>



<p>According to sources, WeMade has sparked several issues since 2021. Specifically, between November 2020 and January 2022, WeMade liquidated WEMIX 225.5 billion won without telling WEMIX users and transferred the cash to a firm, generating a great uproar. This was dubbed a &#8220;blink sale&#8221; by experts, and the occurrence emphasized the critical need for regulations governing the disclosure of virtual assets.</p>

<p>Moreover, towards the end of 2022, WEMIX&#8217;s circulation was suspected of fraudulent disclosure, and a legal arrangement with the country&#8217;s exchanges was reached. Some major South Korean crypto exchanges finally delisted WEMIX.</p>



<p>The prosecution is believed to have searched and seized not just WeMade but also WEMIX market makers. According to reports, CEO Henry Chang&#8217;s charges of breach of trust are also being investigated.</p>

<p>In December 2022, Korean tabloids revealed that CEO Henry Chang documented the circumstances around his usage of Signiel, a high-end residential facility, as a private house with corporate funds totaling 12 billion won ($9.1 million).</p>



<p>Immediately after the news, WEMIX dropped nearly 12% of its value.</p>

<p>The aim of the program is to backstop banks and other depository firms during the crisis. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has released data showing that the Fed&#8217;s Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has reached a record level of $103.08 billion in loans for the week ending June 28. This is the highest level of distressed asset redemptions since the program was introduced three months ago. Despite the Fed&#8217;s attempts to reassure investors that the banking crisis is over, the milestone figure shows that the Fed is still bailing out banks.</p>

<p>Market analyst Joe Consorti has also commented on the latest figures, suggesting that the &#8220;BTFP&#8217;s shadow liquidity is propping up risk-taking behavior across markets.&#8221; As a result of this, investors may be encouraged to take larger risks, as evidenced by the increases in stock markets such as the S&amp;P 500. Consorti believes that the BTFP will have to create a new facility to buy distressed commercial real estate loans and even commercial mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<p>U.S. banking regulators have been asking lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers that are facing stress as commercial real estate lending remains under pressure. In addition, the BTFP peak has come in the same week that the Federal Reserve announced its banking stress test results, passing the top 23 lenders in the country. It is unclear what further action the Fed will take regarding the ongoing banking crisis, but the record level of loans for the week ending June 28 is a clear indication that the program is still in high demand among embattled banks.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>RBNZ intensifies supervision of stablecoins and crypto assets.</em></li>



<li><em>A regulatory approach is not needed now, but vigilance is required, according to the bank.</em></li>



<li><em>The bank monitors global regulations and studies CBDC implementation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ</strong>) <strong><a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2023/06/rbnz-ramps-up-monitoring-of-stablecoins-and-cryptoassets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Friday that it is intensifying its supervision of stablecoins and crypto assets owing to uncertainty about how the industry will evolve and the potential dangers they may pose to the financial system.</strong></h5>

<p>The decision was made after the central bank received public feedback to better understand the possible ramifications of new forms of private money on both the financial system and monetary sovereignty. Ian Woolford, RBNZ&#8217;s money and cash director, said that the bank agreed with the majority of submitters that a regulated approach was not required at this time but that heightened vigilance was necessary.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We agree with the balance of submitters that a regulatory approach isn’t needed right now, but increased vigilance is,” said Woolford.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Woolford&#8217;s announcement was accompanied by a summary of 50 stakeholder contributions to a previous RBNZ study on crypto and decentralized finance.</p>

<p>Respondents included BlockchainNZ, the country&#8217;s crypto advocacy group, Ripple, and institutions such as Westpac and the Bank of New Zealand.</p>



<p>Woolford said that the comments demonstrated that crypto had major dangers and prospects, as well as &#8220;uncertainties&#8221; concerning the sector&#8217;s future, necessitating more scrutiny:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We agree that caution is needed, which also reinforces the need for enhanced data and monitoring to build understanding.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The RBNZ seems to be waiting to watch how other countries regulate cryptocurrency before making its own measures.</p>



<p>The RBNZ&#8217;s statement on Friday follows its announcement in December that it was developing a monitoring framework to monitor and appraise developments in new forms of &#8220;private money,&#8221; including cryptoassets. As part of its Future of Money initiative, the bank is doing a comprehensive research. This involves an ongoing study on the eventual establishment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum has been experiencing a series of price fluctuations lately. After the digital currency reached a high of $1,912, it started a downside correction below the $1,865 support. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>Although the price even spiked below the $1,820 level, the downsides were limited, unlike Bitcoin, which has been experiencing a slump. A low was formed near $1,817 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="472" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-1024x472.png" alt="image 2259" class="wp-image-199091" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-1024x472.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-300x138.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-768x354.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-1536x707.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-750x345.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-1140x525.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259.png 1835w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Holds Strong at $1,800: Experts Predict Further Gains 28"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>There has been a break above the $1,840 resistance zone. Furthermore, a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,838 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD was broken. Ethereum is now testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,912 swing high to the $1,817 low. Additionally, it is currently trading near $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.</p>



<p>The immediate resistance is near the $1,875 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,912 swing high to the $1,817 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level. Moreover, the first breakout level is near the $1,920 level. If there is a close above the $1,920 zone, a fresh rally could start. Subsequently, the next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the price could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains could send Ethereum toward the $2,120 resistance.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="603" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258-1024x603.png" alt="image 2258" class="wp-image-199090" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258-1024x603.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258-300x177.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258-768x452.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258-1536x904.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258-2048x1205.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258-750x441.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2258-1140x671.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Holds Strong at $1,800: Experts Predict Further Gains 29"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,875 resistance or $1,880, it could start another decline. In the event of a decline, the initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $1,840 level, while the first major support is near $1,820. If there is a move below $1,820, the price could drop toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,740 support.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The upcoming halving event for Litecoin has resulted in increased attention and network activity, with the hashrate reaching a new all-time high of 831.16 TH/s.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite recent price increases and outperforming other altcoins, LTC is currently facing resistance near the $100 price zone, with the Fibonacci 78.6% retracement level posing a potential challenge.</em></li>



<li><em>It is important to conduct thorough research and consider various indicators.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) is seen as one of the most promising coins at the moment as its major halving event this year draws near. Given its incredible performance, what could be its next price zone?</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="679" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1024x679.jpeg" alt="Litecoin Is Coming Back Strong Before Halving, $100 Is Approaching" class="wp-image-199079" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1024x679.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-768x509.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1536x1019.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-750x497.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1140x756.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1.jpeg 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Litecoin Is Coming Back Strong Before Halving, $100 Is Approaching 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the halving event approaches, the Litecoin network receives more attention. This has resulted in an increase in the network&#8217;s hashrate as additional miners join the network. The majority of June saw substantial surges in hashrate due to the increase in mining difficulty.</p>



<p>On June 23, 2023, the Litecoin hashrate hit 831.16 terahashes per second (TH/s), according to <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinWarz</a> statistics. This is a new all-time high for the network, which previously had data slightly higher than 756.26 TH/ S.</p>

<p>The increase in mining difficulty makes it more difficult to locate a block, thus miners must bring more computers online to boost their chances, resulting in a surge in hashrate. When additional miners are brought online, the Litecoin hashrate has reached its peak.</p>



<p>The good news is that Litecoin on-chain statistics show that a sizable fraction of LTC holders keeps their currency. This verified that a portion of newly bought LTC coins did not move throughout the same time period.</p>



<p>The price of Litecoin, which is now trading at $95 per coin, has increased by about 15% in the previous 24 hours, with several other cryptocurrencies following suit. Although most cryptocurrencies have been trending sideways in recent days, LTC has surpassed other altcoins today. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has stayed reasonably stable in the $30,000-$31,000 price area in recent days.</p>
