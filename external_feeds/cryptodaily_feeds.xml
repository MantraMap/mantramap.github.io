			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Staking your cryptocurrency is an ideal way of earning a passive income while also supporting the network&rsquo;s operation. Though the idea is sound, it comes with certain disadvantages for the user who is staking - meaning, his share of cryptocurrencies would remain locked in a wallet for a period of time and would remain inaccessible, thus limiting the ability to use or trade them.</p>
<p class="s4">But innovation never sleeps and thus sprung the idea of liquid staking.</p>
<p class="s4">With it, two key players emerged, captivating the attention of investors and enthusiasts like LIDO and Cosmos. These innovative platforms offer a revolutionary concept known as liquid staking, which combines the benefits of staking with the flexibility of decentralized finance (DeFi). We will also discuss an upcoming player who&rsquo;s big into DeFi, a meme token called Big Eyes Coin.</p>
<p class="s8">What Is Liquid Staking?</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking provides a solution to this liquidity problem. With liquid staking, you can stake your cryptocurrency and still maintain its flexibility. Instead of locking up your funds, they are tokenized into "staking derivatives" that represent your staked assets.</p>
<p class="s4">Thus, liquid staking offers the best of both worlds: the ability to earn staking rewards and maintain liquidity, allowing you to use your assets in various ways within the crypto ecosystem. It provides more flexibility and accessibility compared to traditional staking, where your funds are locked up for a specific duration.</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking holds huge future potential, and investing in tokens that are at the forefront of this unique mechanism will reap huge rewards.</p>
<p class="s10">LIDO - Unleashing The Power Of Liquid Staking</p>
<p class="s4">Imagine you have some cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, or Kusama, and you want to earn rewards by staking them.</p>
<p class="s4">Here's where LIDO comes in. LIDO is one of the best platforms that help you stake your cryptocurrencies through liquid staking. With LIDO, you can stake your assets and receive something called st-tokens. These st-tokens represent your staked assets and are linked to them in a one-to-one ratio. So, if you stake 1 Ethereum, you'll receive 1 st-token.</p>
<p class="s4">The cool thing about LIDO's liquid staking is that it allows you to enjoy the benefits of staking, like earning rewards, while still having the flexibility to trade or use your st-tokens in the DeFi world. So, win-win for both the network and staker.</p>
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s10">What Is Liquid Staking On The Cosmos Hub Through Stride?</p>
<p class="s4">Stride, the leading liquid staking protocol within the Cosmos ecosystem, offers liquid staking for several Cosmos chains, including the Cosmos Hub. Stride allows users to stake their tokens and receive staking derivatives that can be freely traded or redeemed with Stride for the original tokens.</p>
<p class="s4">By adopting Stride's non-custodial liquid staking protocol, users maintain full control over their assets, providing greater flexibility compared to traditional staking methods. With over 80% market share in the Cosmos ecosystem, Stride contributes to the decentralization and security of the network while enhancing the liquidity and accessibility of staked assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Big Eyes Coin - A Promising Investment Opportunity</p>
<p class="s4">Big Eyes Coin has emerged as an exciting crypto project, capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts. With its upcoming launch on Uniswap, Big Eyes Coin aims to establish itself as a unique player in the market. The project boasts a range of top features, including a casino platform where users can trade their crypto for BIG tokens and participate in play-to-earn (P2E) games. With over $37 million raised during its presale and a projected increase in value, Big Eyes Coin presents an enticing investment opportunity.</p>
<p class="s4">For a limited period, you have the exclusive chance to acquire $BIG tokens at their remarkable stage 3 price. Buy BIG tokens now for $0.00017 per token.</p>
<p class="s4">We hope now you can answer like a pro when someone asks - What is liquid staking?</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking has emerged as a game-changing concept, offering users the benefits of staking combined with the flexibility of the DeFi ecosystem. LIDO and Stride within the Cosmos ecosystem are two of the best liquid staking platforms that exemplify the power and potential of this new technology, providing users with enhanced liquidity, accessibility, and control over their staked assets.</p>
<p class="s4">Furthermore, Big Eyes Coin presents an exciting investment opportunity, with its unique features and promising future. By investing in these coins, individuals can diversify their portfolios and potentially reap substantial returns.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) gained marginal ground early in the Asian session as the pair remained in a relatively tight range with selling pressure around the 26955.26 level, right around the 38.2% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 25810 to 27678.73.&nbsp; Upside progress recently weakened around the 27516.58 level, representing a test of another downside retracement level linked to recent selling pressure around the 29850 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technical trading activity remains strong with recent buying activity around the 26361.52 area, a test of a previous downside price objective linked to selling pressure around the 28334.75 area. &nbsp;Following recent selling pressure, related downside price objectives include the 26308, 26093, 25885, and 25604 levels.&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 27145, 27108, 26765, 26729, 26380, 26309, and 26203 levels during the recent depreciation, downside price objectives related to recent selling pressure around the 30500, 30050, 29850, 28334, and 27647 levels.&nbsp; Related downside price objectives include the 25474, 25442, 25124, 24705, 24440, 23208, and 22769 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One key thing to understand about crypto is that it is a highly dynamic industry that is constantly evolving in both its operational and user experience capabilities. The current crypto market is rife with excellent newcomers bringing new and improved ideas to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these have improved old concepts or systems and others are bringing completely new, revolutionary ideas that challenge all the previous norms of what cryptocurrency is about. One key thing to understand about crypto is that it is a highly dynamic industry that is constantly evolving in both its operational and user experience capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of these, in particular, is Big Eyes Coin, which launched its presale in August 2022 and has since seen an incredible environment of growth. It has surprised investors and users with its stunning selection of rewards and profitable opportunities. Within the first 2 months, the platform made its first $8 million, this was the first display of strength by Big Eyes Coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Sets Big Eyes Coin Apart?</p>
<p>Right from the start, Big Eyes Coin was seen as one of the most successful coins in presale history due to it being audited and approved by Solidity Finance, making $2 million, and being listed as number 1 on CoinSniper all within the first month. No other meme coin was able to gain this amount of success in such a short period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exponential growth can be attributed to the coin's incredible bonus scheme. Starting at only 20% within a month of the presale launch, it successfully attracted all kinds of hungry investors. As it stands, Big Eyes Coin is offering one of the largest rewards in the presale market - a 300% bonus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coins has a lucrative structure that is different from other meme coins. Their loot boxes have the most to offer without the need for a large investment. Users can simply invest a minimum of $10 to win up to a million dollars in prizes. This communicates the incredible risk and reward ratio of the site and explains why it has grown so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is it a force to be reckoned with in the bonus arena, but it also gives its users a great selection of NFTs that they can use to maximize their profits when the platform launches. Hosted on the Opensea marketplace, they can collect, mint, and then trade these on or after the launch on June 3rd, when the demand for it is at an all-time high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Does Big Eyes Coin Hold In The Future?</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s release into the larger market will make history. Not only is it one of the best-performing presales in recent history, but its value and community are unmatched by that of both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the next 6 months, Big Eyes Coin is expected to face incredible growth. Based on its performance during the presale and its community of investors, the coin is highly likely to perform significantly better than both its meme coin rivals, with many speculating that it may even take the top spots in the meme coin category, being part of the top 10. This can be seen in the speed at which it has already built up its presale pool to over $35 million, which would not have been possible without the support of strong investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin will launch at $0.0006 and steadily grow from here. The ultimate goal is to reach a value of $1, and based on its performance and investment potential so far, this can easily be achieved within the first year of its launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the presale for Big Eyes Draws to a close in the following weeks, investors can make use of this limited time by purchasing their share of $BIG to make the most out of their investment when it does hit its $1 mark. Big Eyes Coin is expected to lead a new era in the meme coin arena, don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity to be part of a revolution.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>NFTs belonging to the bankrupt crypto firm Three Arrow Capital sold for close to $2.5 million at a Sotheby&rsquo;s auction. </p>
<p>According to auction house Sotheby&rsquo;s, seven non-fungible tokens (NFTs) belonging to bankrupt cryptocurrency firm Three Arrows Capital (3AC) fetched nearly $2.5 million at auction. The auction was part of 3AC&rsquo;s liquidation, Teneo, one of the court-appointed liquidators, said in February.</p>
<p>The liquidator said it would sell the firm&rsquo;s prized NFTs to help recoup the over $3.6 billion owed to 3AC&rsquo;s creditors.</p>
<p>The NFT, which fetched the highest price at over $1 million, was &ldquo;Fidenza #725,&rdquo; an image with graphic curves and dashed in a muted palette of yellow, cream, black, and pink, news outlet Reuters reported. The firm purchased the NFT for 135 ether (ETH) in 2021, worth around $341,786 at the time.</p>
<p>3AC is said to have had an extensive collection of sought-after NFTs, including items from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Cryptopunks.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency news site The Block reported 3AC&rsquo;s assets worth an estimated $1 billion, and its NFT collection valued at about $22 million.</p>
3AC Founders Embark on a New Venture
<p>Amid the company&rsquo;s liquidation, Three Arrows Capital co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies announced the launch of a new cryptocurrency exchange &ndash; OPNX.</p>
<p>Zhu and Davies pitched the idea in January, with CoinFlex co-founder Mark Lamb joining the duo.</p>
<p>Three Arrows Capital is widely regarded as one of the crypto firms most severely affected by the 2022 crypto winter. Davies and Zhu admitted that the crisis and collapse of the Terra ecosystem, along with Bitcoin&rsquo;s price drop below $20,000, eventually led to the firm's demise.</p>

<p>The crypto bull rally that started at the beginning of this year was very much led by a strong artificial intelligence (AI) narrative. ChatGPT was out in the public arena and much polemic debate raged over its use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the interest in AI continued to gather momentum, the focus turned to the cryptocurrency sector and its obvious capability to integrate AI and use its own particular technology innovations to find novel use cases.</p>
<p>According to Coingecko, the AI crypto category currently has a market cap of around $2.6 billion. Back in early January this would have been a lot less and value investors saw the potential in buying up several of the crypto AI tokens.</p>
Massive AI token surge
<p>One of the biggest recipients of this buying spree was SingularityNET ($AGIX). $AGIX went from a value of $0.0450 on January 1, to $0.622 on February 8, a whopping gain of 1400%.</p>
<p>Fetch.AI ($FET) was another AI token that rose in tandem with $AGIX. $FET put on 586% for the same time period, but if it was taken into account that its bottom was in late November 2022, its actual gain could be measured at 1068%.</p>
<p>However, both of these tokens, plus most of the other AI tokens descended from their dizzy heights in early February, first descending precipitously, and then grinding down over the last 3 months to arrive at what could now be an AI token bottom.</p>
Technical indicator bottoms
<p>When looking at technical analysis, the higher time frames give the much truer picture of price action. In this respect, the weekly Stochastic RSIs (a momentum indicator) have bottomed for some of the AI tokens, implying that they are now extremely oversold, and with some of these a crossover has now taken place.</p>
<p>$AGIX was the first AI token to lift off, and started its rapid breakout on late Thursday afternoon. It surged 30% in a period of only 24 hours, hitting $0.32. Since then $AGIX has come back to touch the trendline it broke out of - a trendline that has been steadily following downwards since March 18.</p>
<p>A cross up has taken place on the weekly RSI and it now remains for the oscillator to cross the 20 line to really signal the start of the strongest momentum that can send AGIX back to its double top at $0.66.</p>
<p>Many of the other crypto/AI-related tokens are likely to follow suit and it will be very interesting to note which of them might take the lead from SingularityNET.</p>

<p>The head of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has urged G7 nations to set an example in implementing global anti-money laundering standards. Kumar added it is prudent to put an &ldquo;end to the lawless crypto space&rdquo; as little progress has been made in introducing the organization&rsquo;s new crypto rules.</p>
<p>The FAFT head urged the Group of 7 to implement recommendations on fighting against money laundering and terrorism ahead of the annual G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, this weekend.</p>

CBDCs and &ldquo;Travel Rule&rdquo; Up for Discussion at Hiroshima
<p>The summit is slated to discuss policy for crypto and digital assets and standards for the global implementation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The summit will also address accelerating the implementation of the FAFT&rsquo;s controversial &ldquo;Travel Rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Travel Rule&rdquo; requires financial institutions which process crypto transfers greater than $3,000 to disclose the sender&rsquo;s details, including their name, address, and account information.</p>
<p>Kumar said most countries have advanced in introducing regulation, with most introducing FATF standards, but &ldquo;relatively poor&rdquo; progress had been made in implementing the updated requirements relating to crypto assets. The President noted his concerns in an article entitled &ldquo;An End to the Lawless Crypto Space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said:</p>

<p>G7 countries should lead by example and regulate the crypto sector so that no virtual safe havens exist for illicit financial transactions.</p>

<p>The FATF applied its AML and counter-terrorist financial rules to the crypto space in 2019, but most nations remain non or only partially compliant with them.</p>
<p>Kumar further emphasized the increased risk of crypto assets as they grow. He specifically referenced the use of cryptocurrencies to pay for ransomware attacks and evade sanctions and its use in raising funds for terrorist groups.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the risks have increased, crypto assets continue to operate in a virtually lawless global environment,&rdquo; the FAFT President said.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Developers of a decentralized exchange based on Arbitrum called Swaprum have drained $3 million worth of ETH from the protocol in what looks to be an apparent rug pull or exit scam.&nbsp;</p>
Swaprum Team Pulls Off $3M Heist&nbsp;
<p>Cryptocurrencies are built on the principles of trust and transparency. However, the specter of hacks and rug pulls has often cast a long and dark shadow on the industry. Recent events have provided a grim reminder of the constant threat from hacks and scams, as users of Swaprum have unfortunately discovered. Swaprum is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Arbitrum Network. It has now emerged that the developers at Swaprum have pulled off a rug pull on its users, draining $3 million worth of ETH from the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decentralized exchange offered users low swapping fees, exceptionally high farming rewards, and the potential to earn up to 100% annual percentage yield (APY).&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Rug Pull&nbsp;
<p>The rug pull was discovered by blockchain security firm PeckShield, which flagged it on Friday. PeckShield revealed that approximately 1628 ETH, worth around $3 million, was drained from Swaprum&rsquo;s liquidity pools. According to on-chain data, the exit was orchestrated late on Thursday. First, the Swaprum team removed liquidity for the SAPR token on the decentralized exchange, selling the assets in exchange for more ETH. The SAPR token is the native token of the Swaprum decentralized exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently, the team moved the funds from Arbitrum to Ethereum before moving them to the cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash. A more detailed analysis carried out by Beosin revealed that the developer of Swaprum&rsquo;s smart contract had added a backdoor functionality to the contract. This is what enabled the theft of the liquidity pool tokens that users had staked. It was revealed that the developer had used the add() function and drained the protocol. Beosin explained that the team at Swaprum had upgraded the normal liquidity collateral reward contract to another, which contained backdoor functions. It stated,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The backdoor function add() will transfer LP tokens from the contract to the _devadd address. By querying the _devadd address, it will return the &lsquo;Swaprum: Deployer&rsquo; address. The Swaprum: Deployer uses the stolen LP tokens in the previous step to remove liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Swaprum team also completely wiped out their online footprint, deleting all their social media profiles across platforms such as Twitter, GitHub, and Telegram. However, the project&rsquo;s official website is still operational. The now-defunct decentralized exchange also highlighted a positive security check from CertiK. However, it remains to be seen whether the certification is genuine.&nbsp;</p>
SAPR Token Essentially Worthless&nbsp;
<p>As expected, the decentralized exchange&rsquo;s native SAPR token lost all its value following the rug pull. Currently, the token is trading at $0.000022, with a trading volume of only $83. This represents a 99% decline from its price of $0.147 before the rug pull. The Swaprum rug pull is easily one of the biggest rug pulls on the Arbitrum Network. It eclipsed the loss suffered during the hack of DeFi protocol Hope Finance, which was the victim of a $2 million exploit that took place in February.</p>
Rug Pulls On The Rise
<p>The crypto space has seen an unmistakable rise in rug pulls or exit scams. Just the month of May itself has seen two other rug pulls apart from Swaprum. On the 5th of May, CertiK froze $160,000 that was stolen during the Merlin DEX rug pull. Merlin fell victim to an insider rug pull which resulted in a loss of $1.8 million. XIRTAM, an educational project backed by CultDAO, also pulled off a rug pull, with the team behind the project stealing 2000 ETH out of the funds raised for the platform.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent Messari report reveals Ripple&rsquo;s XRP surged by over 55% in Q1 2023, outperforming the overall cryptocurrency market. </p>
<p>According to a report by Messari, Ripple&rsquo;s XRP outpaced the overall crypto market in Q1 2023, having grown by over 55% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Messari revealed XRP&rsquo;s market capitalization increased from $17.4 billion on January 1 to an impressive $27.4 billion on March 31, representing a Q1 surge of 59.9%. While XRP&rsquo;s market cap grew by 59.9%, its price surged by 55% during the first quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall cryptocurrency market only observed an increase of 46% during the same period.</p>
<p>XRP started the year at $0.35 but gained immensely during a market-wide rally to reach a high of $0.43 on January 23. The asset&rsquo;s price, however, faced resistance at this price and ended January with an increase of 19.71%.</p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s native token, however, declined in February to a price of $0.36 but closed the month off at $0.37. XRP witnessed a decline of 7.27% during February.</p>
XRP Moved in March
<p>XRP moved with strong bullish momentum during March, registering an overnight growth of 20% on March 22. Ripple&rsquo;s XRP was on its way to hitting its very bullish target of $0.50 but ultimately fell short, reaching a high of $0.49.</p>
<p>The asset gained on the back of the US banking crisis and anticipation of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The price further grew as speculation circulated that Ripple&rsquo;s case with the SEC would soon come to an end.</p>
<p>XRP was on track to end March with a bang when it soared to a 10-month high of $0.58 on March 29, having witnessed a solo run of 56% in just two weeks. The asset fought off a few bearish attacks to close March at $0.54. March&rsquo;s rally saw XRP gain 43%, ending the first quarter with a price increase of 55%. Against the backdrop of its stunning Q1 growth, Ripple reported that it sold over $361 million worth of XRP tokens during the first three months of 2023.</p>
<p>Q2 has not proved too profitable for XRP yet, which, at the time of writing, exchanged hands at $0.46.</p>
Things Are Looking Up for Ripple
<p>Ripple had a victory this week in its ongoing legal battle against the SEC. A court denied the SEC&rsquo;s request to seal documents related to former SEC official William Hinman&rsquo;s statements about Ether. Hinman, the former director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Corporate Finance, delivered a prudent speech in 2018, suggesting that Ether was not a security.</p>
<p>Hinman&rsquo;s statements are significant to the case as they provide a precedent for a digital asset like XRP.</p>
<p>Ripple further announced it made a $250 million acquisition of Metaco &ndash; a well-known crypto custodian. Seen as a positive sign for the future of both Ripple and Metaco, the move sees Ripple take on sole responsibility at Metaco while still allowing current CEO Adrien Traccani to manage operations independently. Traccani has been instrumental in getting Metaco where it is now.</p>
<p>Customers would benefit significantly from this deal, says Monica Long, the President of Ripple:</p>

<p>Adding these capabilities to Ripple&rsquo;s already growing product solutions means we can continue to support customers as they look to embrace the true potential of crypto and blockchain in real-world applications.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins burst onto the scene in 2013, tickling the funny bone of the cryptocurrency world. Over the past decade, these seemingly light-hearted tokens have evolved into lucrative investment opportunities, spawning numerous millionaires and capturing global attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, despite their popularity, most meme coins have been criticized for their lack of utility and dependence on fleeting trends. This narrative took a different direction when DigiToads (TOADS) a meme coin yet utility-rich play-to-earn and stake-to-earn token, appeared on the scene. This new ICO, boasting a 25x growth potential, has caught the attention of analysts who believe it could surpass well-known tokens like ApeCoin and Shiba Inu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what is the secret behind the success of this promising ERC20 token?</p>
<p>DigiToads Leading Among The Top Crypto Coins</p>
<p>DigiToads is an innovative cryptocurrency project that has successfully merged the world of meme coins with real-world utility. Designed to disrupt the crypto landscape, DigiToads offers a unique play-to-earn and stake-to-earn model, attracting investors and engaging users in a thriving gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p>At the heart of DigiToads lies the Toad-Cade, an engaging game where users can battle and breed their Toads, represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This gaming platform allows players to earn rewards, creating an exciting environment where users can participate and profit from their in-game activities.</p>
<p>This hyper-deflationary token has implemented a comprehensive staking system, allowing investors to earn passive income by staking their cool NFTs. This feature appeals to many investors, from crypto enthusiasts to those seeking steady investment returns.</p>
<p>The DigiToads project has experienced remarkable success during its presale, having already raised over $2.45 million. This intense buying pressure indicates the project's future potential and investors' confidence in its growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presale is currently in progress, with the price of TOADS sitting at $0.024 and expected to reach $0.055 upon launch, presenting a significant opportunity for early investors.</p>
<p>To further solidify its position in the market and enhance its accessibility, DigiToads is set to launch on both decentralized and centralized exchanges. With listings on Uniswap, a popular decentralized exchange, and BitMart, a well-known centralized platform, the project is poised to reach a broader audience and gain further credibility within the crypto community.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>ApeCoin and Shiba Inu Analysis</p>
<p>ApeCoin and Shiba Inu are popular meme coins that have been at the center of attention for some time. ApeCoin, backed by the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, was initially designed to be a governance token and medium of exchange within the ApeCoin ecosystem. However, despite its association with a popular NFT project and has had a little stunt growth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Shiba Inu started as a Dogecoin-inspired meme coin and has since evolved into a more expansive ecosystem. With its decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, and the development of its own blockchain, Shibarium, Shiba Inu has created a utility level many other meme coins lack. However, Shiba Inu's inflationary tokenomics has had some investors looking out for a newer project that could possibly have better returns.</p>
<p>Bottom Line</p>
<p>Overall, DigiToads stands out among many top altcoins and meme coins like ApeCoin and Shiba Inu by offering a unique ecosystem with passive income opportunities, deflationary tokenomics, and a transparent team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DigiToads combines the playful nature of meme coins with utility and credibility, positioning itself as a compelling alternative for investors seeking long-term value appreciation in the DeFi market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Amid whispers and speculation, the cryptocurrency world is abuzz with rumours of an impending revolution as Tradecurve's (TCRV) presale quietly emerges as a potential game-changer, silently toppling the giants of the industry such as XRP (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its innovative approach, Tradecurve (TCRV) is positioning itself as a force to be reckoned with, stirring excitement among investors and enthusiasts alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article will uncover the newest developments in XRP (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT) and analyse why Tradecurve (TCRV) is the ultimate pick for crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>XRP (XRP) Shows Strong Performance with 1.48% Rise: Revisits $0.46 Threshold</p>
<p>In the realm of digital assets, XRP (XRP) displayed an upward trajectory on Wednesday, registering a noteworthy ascent of 1.48%. Building upon a previous gain of 3.37% the day before, XRP (XRP) concluded the trading session at $0.44825. A remarkable event unfolded as XRP (XRP) revisited the $0.46 mark, marking its return after a hiatus of ten sessions.</p>
<p>The day commenced on an optimistic note as XRP surged to an early morning peak of $0.46138. Demonstrating resilience, XRP (XRP) successfully breached both the First Major Resistance Level (R1) at $0.4500 and the Second Major Resistance Level (R2) at $0.4583. However, a subsequent reversal compelled XRP (XRP) to dip to an early afternoon nadir of $0.43765. Skillfully evading the potential downturn indicated by the First Major Support Level (S1) at $0.4261, XRP (XRP) swiftly rebounded, concluding the day at $0.44825.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) Faces Steep Decline, Approaches Critical Support Level of $5.30</p>
<p>Since its peak at around $7.8 per coin earlier this year, Polkadot (DOT) has experienced a rapid decline, finding itself in a downward spiral. Currently, the native DOT token teeters perilously close to a crucial support level, around $5.30, as renewed selling pressure continues to mount. The predictable nature of this sell-off can be attributed to Polkadot's (DOT) operation within an intensely competitive domain of the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>A standout characteristic of Polkadot (DOT) lies in its unique ability to foster interoperability among diverse blockchains. This revolutionary feature facilitates seamless communication, data sharing, and the execution of smart contracts.</p>
<p>A remarkable bridge is created by employing a relay chain, which bridges the gap between disparate blockchains, enabling them to collaborate and coexist harmoniously. By transcending the boundaries of individual blockchains, Polkadot (DOT) paves the way for a new era of interconnected decentralised systems.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Presale Alert: Tradecurve (TCRV) Introduces Game-Changing Trading Platform at $0.01</p>

With the launch on the horizon, Tradecurve (TCRV) is currently in stage 2 of the presale, generating excitement among potential investors.

<p>Tradecurve will introduce automated trading and leverage the power of artificial intelligence, granting users access to a diverse array of algorithmic and AI-based trading systems. By incorporating these advanced technologies, Tradecurve (TCRV) aims to extend financial inclusion to millions of individuals, making trading applications accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) also addresses security concerns by implementing enhanced security measures, ensuring the protection of user assets, and significantly reducing trading costs.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bull markets are the most exciting times in the market, and precedent shows that a single cryptocurrency is capable of starting a bull market. The last 2021 bull market was a run that started with Dogecoin(DOGE), and the market never looked back until it touched the $3 trillion market cap. Some mini-runs we&rsquo;ve seen during this bear market have also been inspired by top-gaining cryptocurrencies for the short term.</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) is an honorable mention regarding market excitement, especially following the token airdrop, which caused a small price run-up for other cryptocurrencies. However, there&rsquo;s an even better play in the market at the moment, and you better get in early on Uwerx.</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) Causing Market Excitement</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) is one of the earliest Ethereum layer-2 solutions in the crypto market, launched in August 2021. So when the network announced last year that it would run an airdrop, there was increased activity on the network with users trying to secure airdrop allocations.</p>
<p>The airdrop eventually came in March 2023 and was allocated to early users on the network. The minimum 625 ARB allocation was worth well over $800 at launch, and the maximum allocation of 10,200 ARB was enough to cause market excitement. The market saw high trading volume in the days that followed, and today, Arbitrum turnovers higher daily volume than networks like Avalanche(AVAX), Shiba Inu(SHIB), Tron(TRX), Polkadot(DOT), and even Polygon(MATIC).</p>
<p>However, this traction does not compare to the new excitement Uwerx is creating.</p>
<p>Can Uwerx(WERX) Kickstart A Bull Run?</p>
<p>Uwerx is bringing some new excitement to the market with its presale token backed with great utility. One of the major signs of a bull market is we begin to see money from other industries come into crypto. In this case, Uwerx is merging the global gig economy with the crypto market. But what exactly does Uwerx do?</p>
<p>Uwerx is an emerging blockchain-based freelance platform that aims to use the resources available on blockchain to create a better platform for independent workers. Uwerx&rsquo;s new platform will feature many unique features, but more importantly, it prioritizes giving back more value to its users.</p>
<p>Contrary to predominant freelance platforms, Uwerx will likewise operate a decentralized platform to connect independent workers to jobs, clients, and businesses. Uwerx will include features including transparent pricing, incentivization, personalized matching, and several built-in tools to foster effective work contracts for freelancers. The native token WERX will serve as a massive store of value for the platform and will be the primary currency of the platform. However, Uwerx will also allow users to process payments with other cryptocurrencies, solving one of the biggest payment limitations in the industry.</p>
<p>Uwerx is primed for a run after presale, and early buyers on presale get in at a very low price. At a $0.0225 presale price, early buyers have a potential 10,000% profit to look forward to. In the worst-case scenario, the final presale price is around $0.095 - $0.115, which is some decent 10x profit for early buyers even before launch; don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office has slapped a $4.3 million fine on the crypto exchange Coin Cafe due to its allegedly outrageous fee structure.&nbsp;</p>
NY AG Fines Coin Cafe
<p>The New York-based popular cryptocurrency platform has been allegedly charging its users exorbitant fees for using the platform. As a result, it has been ordered to hand over a total of $4.3 million in retribution and fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, noted that</p>

<p>&ldquo;The company was charging investors exorbitant and undisclosed fees to use its wallet storage, despite marketing its wallet storage as &lsquo;free&rsquo; on its website.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the exchange has also been accused of not disclosing the fee structure and draining out entire customer funds.&nbsp;</p>
Fee Restructuring Drains Customer Funds
<p>The matter was first uncovered when multiple customers raised concerns about depleting funds from their Coin Cafe accounts. These allegations against the firm led to an investigation into the company&rsquo;s business practices and fee transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that the firm had initially onboarded clients advertising its crypto wallet as a free product. However, since September 2022, the company changed its fee structure multiple times and surreptitiously added fees without informing customers, which resulted in charges of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in October 2022, Coin Cafe implemented a policy where users who did not engage in cryptocurrency transactions within a 30-day period were subject to a charge of either 7.99% or $99 per month, whichever amount was higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Attorney General&rsquo;s office claimed that the exchange misled its customers and violated consumer protection regulations by failing to disclose these additional charges.&nbsp;</p>
The Settlement Agreement&nbsp;
<p>As a consequence of the investigation, Coin Cafe has had to surrender $4.3 million, which includes restitution of $508,000 to 340 individuals and an additional penalty to the state of New York. Additionally, as part of the settlement agreement, Coin Cafe is obliged to provide refunds to U.S.-based investors who request reimbursement within the upcoming year. By May 23, Coin Cafe must send email notifications to all U.S.-based customers, informing them of their eligibility for a refund.</p>
<p>Finally, The cryptocurrency exchange has also committed to implementing comprehensive changes to its fee structure and ensuring transparency in its operations going forward.</p>
Need For Transparency?&nbsp;
<p>The Attorney General has claimed that the incident highlights the need for increased regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency sector, especially regarding fee structures and consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the company had successfully obtained the state&rsquo;s BitLicense in 2023, it had not officially registered with the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office, which is a requirement for companies dealing with crypto trading in the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, the fact that the company continued to overcharge customers even after obtaining the BitLicense indicates that unfair practices can be conducted right under the nose of the regulatory bodies.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Revolut, Britain's most valuable fintech company, could face disappointment as the Bank of England plans to reject its application for a banking licence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority, responsible for licensing, has informed the government of its intention to issue a statutory warning notice to Revolut, citing concerns over the company's balance sheet. Revolut contends that auditors' concerns were related to revenues, not the balance sheet.</p>
<p>According to a report in the UK Telegraph, the warning notice has not been served yet and urgent talks are underway behind the scenes in an effort to salvage the licence application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revolut, an app offering many financial services, has expanded globally, making it one of the world's most valuable fintech firms and Britain's most valuable tech start-up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite already holding a Lithuanian banking licence, securing approval from the Bank of England has been seen as a crucial stepping stone for Revolut to expand into other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Revolut had expressed confidence in obtaining a UK licence, but recent challenges have cast doubt on its prospects. The company's auditors, BDO, raised concerns about the &ldquo;completeness and occurrence&rdquo; of revenues amounting to &pound;477 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CEO Nik Storonsky voiced frustration with British regulators, citing long wait times for communication and an overly bureaucratic regulatory environment, suggesting that the company may be more inclined to go public in the US rather than the UK.</p>
Opinion
<p>The on-going saga of Revolut and of several other crypto-related companies wishing to receive licences in the UK appears to have no end. The UK is an incredibly conservative nation with traditional banking etched into its genes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very well for the government, or at least parts of it, to say that the UK wants to become a global hub for crypto. Many pro-crypto utterances and promises appear to be made in the political and international spheres, but the UK will have to contend with its deeply embedded banking industry, which has much power and influence over regulators and in the country&rsquo;s parliament.</p>
<p>The US also has massive influence in the UK, and its very harsh treatment of crypto is likely to be accompanied by much lobbying of the British government for it to go back on many of the pro-crypto promises it has made so far.</p>
<p>However, with Brexit forcing the UK to look for new markets, it still has a great opportunity to land a big chunk of crypto business and become the premier safe harbour for digital assets in Europe. The internal battle over crypto legitimacy in the UK will be very interesting to witness.</p>]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hashkey Group, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency investment landscape, is embarking on an ambitious funding drive for a valuation of $1 billion.&nbsp;</p>
Hashkey attempts to secure large funding
<p>According to Bloomberg, sources familiar with the matter have disclosed that Hashkey is currently engaged in preliminary discussions to secure a substantial funding round ranging from $100 million to $200 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the deal is steadily progressing, the specific details, including size and valuation, are yet to be finalised and remain subject to potential adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a diversified portfolio spanning venture funding, asset management, and trading, Hashkey is among the many local firms striving to expand their customer base within Hong Kong's rapidly liberalising environment.&nbsp;</p>
Hong Kong - a new financial hub
<p>The government of Hong Kong has been diligently fostering the development of the digital asset sector as part of a broader endeavour to restore the city's reputation as a pioneering financial hub. As part of these efforts, the city is poised to enable retail trading of major cryptocurrencies on licensed exchanges like Hashkey, ultimately rejuvenating the local economy and reversing the previous talent exodus triggered by Covid-related restrictions.</p>
<p>At present, Hashkey and BC Technology Group Co.'s OSL bourse are the sole licensed operators in the field. However, prominent exchanges such as OKX and Bitget have expressed their intent to seek licensure under Hong Kong's new regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s new found commitment to crypto businesses running out of the islands perhaps stems from the Chinese government&rsquo;s rethinking of its strategy towards crypto. It might appear that China will use Hong Kong as a ring fenced testing ground for cryptocurrency technology, while keeping crypto out of the Chinese mainland, at least for now.</p>
<p>From next month, Hong Kong will initiate its new licensing regime which will allow retail investors to trade certain major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an apparent hardening of its stance against crypto, Pakistan&rsquo;s government has stated that it would ban cryptocurrency services operational in the country and would never legalize crypto trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banning crypto was one of the requirements put forward by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).&nbsp;</p>
A Fresh Ban&nbsp;
<p>The announcement was made by Aisha Ghaus Pasha, the Minister of State for Finance and Revenue, during a session of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue on the 16th of May. The minister added that banning cryptocurrencies and crypto services operating in the country was one of the conditions set by the Financial Action Task Force. The task force had only recently removed Pakistan from its gray list. FATF&rsquo;s gray list consists of countries that the body considers lacking when it comes to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. However, these countries are viewed as working to ensure compliance and remedy their issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several other officials, such as State Bank of Pakistan Director Sohain Jawad, extended their support to the decision. According to reports, the State Bank of Pakistan and the Technology Ministry were working together to draft the ban legislation. While the Financial Action Task Force cannot impose any sanctions, its findings could influence government and corporate policies globally. In 2022, the State Bank of Pakistan announced that it planned to ban crypto. This was the first clear position the bank had taken on the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other banks have started reaching out to customers, informing them that cryptocurrency trading is illegal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As per regulatory instructions from the State Bank of Pakistan(SBP), any remittance of foreign exchange directly/indirectly outside Pakistan to overseas foreign exchange trading, margin trading, and CFD trading apps/websites/platforms through any payment channel is not allowed/permitted by SBP, and such payments are inherently risky and illegal.&rdquo;</p>

Crypto Community Voices Disapproval&nbsp;
<p>The Pakistani economy is facing an unprecedented crisis, with the government engaged in tense negotiations to secure a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As a result, FATF compliance when it comes to crypto becomes something of a necessity. However, the crypto community in the country criticized the move to announce a crypto ban. One handle stated that the government officials were destroying the country in the name of the FATF and the International Monetary Fund. Another user summed up his disapproval, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray that government focuses on the right area, which leads to scams and the apps which trap people, instead of banning crypto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another user going by the name of Crypto Arena added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People are making handsome income with crypto trading, and Govt wants to take this last hope from the Poor People of Pakistan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ban comes at a time of political turmoil as well, with former Prime Minister Imran Khan locked in a tense standoff with police in Lahore.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Adoption As Hedge Remains High&nbsp;
<p>Pakistani newspaper Dawn had reported that despite banks formally warning customers against using their debit and credit cards for crypto trading, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular in the country. According to Zeeshan Ahmed, the country general manager at Rain Financial, the annual volume of cryptocurrency trading has only gone up, rising to $25 billion from $18 billion just a year ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political turmoil and economic uncertainty has seen many Pakistanis convert their salaries into stablecoins to utilize as a hedge. Pakistan&rsquo;s Rupee has slid to an all-time low of 300 against the USD. Chairman of KTrade Securities and CEO of BlockTech Pakistan, Ali Farid Khwaja, stated that the population is worried about a sovereign default since the government has failed to secure support from the International Monetary Fund.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect that many people are buying USDT on crypto platforms as a way to get exposure to the US dollar. Even Bitcoin has performed well against the Pakistani Rupee. During the crypto run, reportedly more than 20 million Pakistanis had opened accounts on crypto platforms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s currency has fallen over 55% against the dollar over the past year, and stablecoins have emerged as a convenient way to access the US dollar for a majority of the population.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an apparent hardening of its stance against crypto, Pakistan&rsquo;s government has stated that it would ban cryptocurrency services operational in the country and would never legalize crypto trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banning crypto was one of the requirements put forward by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).&nbsp;</p>
A Fresh Ban&nbsp;
<p>The announcement was made by Aisha Ghaus Pasha, the Minister of State for Finance and Revenue, during a session of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue on the 16th of May. The minister added that banning cryptocurrencies and crypto services operating in the country was one of the conditions set by the Financial Action Task Force. The task force had only recently removed Pakistan from its gray list. FATF&rsquo;s gray list consists of countries that the body considers lacking when it comes to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. However, these countries are viewed as working to ensure compliance and remedy their issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several other officials, such as State Bank of Pakistan Director Sohain Jawad, extended their support to the decision. According to reports, the State Bank of Pakistan and the Technology Ministry were working together to draft the ban legislation. While the Financial Action Task Force cannot impose any sanctions, its findings could influence government and corporate policies globally. In 2022, the State Bank of Pakistan announced that it planned to ban crypto. This was the first clear position the bank had taken on the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other banks have started reaching out to customers, informing them that cryptocurrency trading is illegal.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sister entity Alameda Research have sued their former executives Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh.</p>
<p>The new management at FTX alleges that its former executives mismanaged funds and failed to conduct proper due diligence before acquiring Embed.</p>
FTX Moves To Claw Back Funds
<p>The move is part of a series of lawsuits filed by FTX&rsquo;s new leadership as they look to recover around $240 million connected to FTX&rsquo;s acquisition of stock trading platform Embed Financial Technologies. Embed closed weeks before FTX filed for bankruptcy. The move is viewed as the first formal action by current FTX CEO John Ray against the company&rsquo;s former management and executives. The plaintiffs in the suits filed include FTX, its sister hedge fund Alameda Research, and West Realm Shires (WRS) Inc. The latter is the corporate entity under which FTX US operated as a cryptocurrency trading company.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, aiming to retrieve the funds spent during the acquisition.</p>
Details Of The Lawsuit
<p>According to documents filed with the court, FTX, Alameda Research, and West Realm Shires have accused former management of taking advantage of lax controls and a lack of recordkeeping and inflating the value of Embed. The papers further state that the management went on to purchase the platform for far more than it was worth. Furthermore, the lawsuit states that the defendants, addressed as &ldquo;FTX Insiders&rdquo; in the lawsuit, failed to conduct any sort of due diligence on Embed, instead prioritizing speed over all else in the transaction.</p>
<p>As a result, they ended up accepting all the terms set by Embed Founder and CEO Michael Giles during the negotiations. The lawsuit further added that Giles walked away from the negotiations after securing a deal worth around $157 million and an &ldquo;extravagant and unwarranted retention bonus&rdquo; as an incentive to wrap up the deal as quickly as possible. Negotiations with Giles began at the end of March 2022, with both parties signing a &ldquo;Memorandum of Terms&rdquo; by mid-April 2022. This gave the platform an enterprise value of $220 million, with a $75 million retention bonus to employees. This figure included the $55 million paid to Giles.</p>
<p>The deal was finalized a few weeks before FTX went bankrupt, with the group of FTX Insiders spending $248 million to acquire the company. The lawsuits allege that while the deal was concluded in six months, all essential terms were agreed upon in just a couple of weeks. The suit also pointed to the fact that the then-president of FTX had encountered several bugs in the Embed platform before concluding the deal, with even Giles admitting that the platform was facing multiple issues every day. The lawsuit further added that even Embed insiders were surprised that FTX was paying such a large amount for the company after just one meeting with Giles.</p>
FTX Hopes To Recover $250 Million
<p>The plaintiffs also accused Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh of causing the entity to issue Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs). These could be converted into common stocks in the event of the entity filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. FTX is hoping to revoke the SAFEs and recover all the funds that the company spent during the Embed acquisition. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have also asked the court to issue directives to the defendants to bear all legal costs related to the lawsuit.</p>
