			            <description><![CDATA[CoinShares found that digital asset investment products saw inflows of $29 million following three weeks of outflows.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investment products for XRP, the native crypto asset of the Ripple network, have recorded the 16th consecutive week of institutional inflows since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>According to data <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-144-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-7d29c8c04df5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">analyzed</a> by CoinShares in its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, XRP saw $0.5 million in inflows during the past week.</p>
<h2>XRP Sees Inflows for the 16th Week</h2>
<p>CoinShares found that digital asset investment products saw inflows of $29 million following three weeks of outflows. Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-funds-soak-in-27-million-inflows-following-positive-inflation-data/" data-wpel-link="internal">recorded</a> the highest influx of $27 million, with its short funds experiencing outflows of $2.7 million.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s dominance was followed by Ethereum’s, which led altcoins with inflows of $2.5 million, Uniswap with $0.7 million, XRP with $0.5 million, and Solana with $0.4 million. XRP’s inflows represent 12% of its assets under management (AUM). The asset’s AUM has spiked by 127% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of regional activity, Canada saw the most inflows of $24 million, followed by Switzerland with $8 million and the United States with $0.9 million. Despite Canada’s notable growth, the country is behind others from a year-to-date perspective.</p>
<p>CoinShares deduced that the improved investor sentiment was due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which fell slightly below expectations, raising suspicions that a September rate hike would not happen. The data also suggests that the broader crypto market remains supportive despite low trading volumes.</p>
<h2>XRP Gains Market Dominance</h2>
<p>While XRP records constant inflows, the digital asset is also gaining significant popularity in the crypto space. <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-poised-to-surpass-btc-eth-and-ada-as-the-leading-payment-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that a CryptoCompare study found the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to be the fastest and most cost-effective blockchain network for payments, making it a more sustainable choice for businesses seeking quick and affordable payment solutions.</p>
<p>Compared to Bitcoin’s average transaction processing time of 10 minutes, the XRPL handles transactions in 3.3 seconds with a cost of $0.00003. This is also significantly better than Ethereum’s 15 seconds and Cardano’s 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Data from CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">shows</a> that XRP has gained market dominance and is currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, a feat the digital asset attained since Ripple Labs <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/has-ripple-xrp-won-or-will-the-sec-appeal-what-will-happen-next/" data-wpel-link="internal">won</a> a partial victory in a three-year-long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market continues to surprise investors, with Solana ($SOL) being the latest token to experience significant upside.</p>
<p>$SOL has soared 11% in the past week, putting the price just below the crucial $25 level.</p>
<p>However, $SOL isn&#8217;t the only cryptocurrency gaining ground – the new Web3 project Launchpad XYZ ($LPX) is also making waves as its presale phase hits the $1.2 million milestone.</p>
<h2>Bulls Regain Control as $SOL Price Surges</h2>
<p>Solana has posted a bullish close in six of the last seven days, showcasing a level of consistency not seen since mid-June.</p>
<p>After dropping 30% from July’s peak, $SOL has bounced back, with the bulls seemingly in control.</p>
<p>Price has climbed above the 20-day and 50-Day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the daily time frame, indicating that the short and medium-term trends have flipped bullish.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266570" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="284" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from CoinMarketCap</a> shows that $375 million worth of $SOL was traded in the past 24 hours – making it the eighth largest cryptocurrency globally, as measured by trading volume.</p>
<p>This surge in trading activity shows that interest in Solana remains high among market participants.</p>
<p>Coupled with the positive sentiment in the crypto market as a whole, sentiment remains optimistic among many investors about $SOL’s growth trajectory for the remainder of 2023.</p>
<h2>Solana’s Thriving NFT Sector Fuels Token Growth</h2>
<p>One of the main factors contributing to Solana’s recent price rise is the platform’s expanding NFT capabilities.</p>
<p>Solana has become a go-to blockchain for launching new NFT collections, with <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/blockchains" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from CryptoSlam</a> showing that it is now only behind Ethereum in terms of daily sales.</p>
<p>Over 890,000 NFT transactions occurred on Solana in the past 30 days, leading to a total sales volume of $75.4 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266568" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="164" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20-300x82.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Leading projects like Gruuvies, Tensorians, and Solcasino.io have also chosen Solana due to its speed, low fees, and growing user base – and this influx of activity has prompted additional interest in the network.</p>
<p>Naturally, the more NFT activity on Solana, the higher the demand for $SOL, helping drive the token&#8217;s recent price increase.</p>
<p>As such, the thriving NFT sector on Solana looks poised to fuel further growth for $SOL in the second half of 2023.</p>
<h2>Launchpad XYZ Presale Heating Up &amp; Raises $1.2 Million Ahead of Exchange Listings</h2>
<p>While Solana’s price keeps rising, another crypto asset gaining momentum is <a href="https://shrt.care/11df4205?referrer=solana-price-keeps-rising-while-launchpad-xyz-raises-1-2-million" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ ($LPX)</a>, which recently crossed $1.2 million raised in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p>This ambitious project aims to drive mainstream adoption of Web3 assets by simplifying access to cryptocurrencies, NFTs, blockchain gaming, and the metaverse.</p>
<p>During Launchpad XYZ’s ongoing presale, investors can purchase $LPX, the platform’s native token, for just $0.0445 ahead of the planned exchange listings for later this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266567" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="339" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Many believe this decision could prove fruitful, given the comprehensive nature of the Launchpad XYZ platform.</p>
<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://launchpad.xyz/assets/documents/LaunchpadXYZ_Whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">project’s whitepaper</a>, Launchpad XYZ will offer an advanced trading terminal, trading signals, educational materials, and a “Launchpad Quotient” score for ranking digital assets.</p>
<p>The platform will even have an AI-powered assistant called “Apollo” that provides data-driven insights and setups from experienced traders.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-8.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266563" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-8.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="235" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-8.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-8-300x117.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-8-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>There are also built-in incentives to hold $LPX tokens long-term, including discounted fees, NFT whitelist access, and exclusive entry to cryptocurrency presales.</p>
<p>Members of the <a href="https://t.me/Launchpad_Official_Channel" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ Telegram channel</a> are also discussing the project’s roadmap, which notes plans for a decentralized exchange (DEX) and NFT directory.</p>
<p>With an experienced founding team and $1.2 million already raised, Launchpad XYZ looks like a project to watch closely ahead of its upcoming exchange listing.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Logan Paul, a multifaceted entertainer and crypto enthusiast, has received criticism from various quarters regarding his recent $1m bet proposition.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Logan Paul is gearing up for his next event, a boxing match against Brazilian Dillon Danis scheduled for October 14 in Manchester, England.</p>
<p>Danis, widely recognized as an MMA fighter and Conor McGregor&#8217;s training partner, will be coached by the Irishman for the upcoming fight.</p>

<p>Upon learning about this, Paul launched an explicit rant, accompanied by insults, while offering a one million dollar bet on the match.</p>
<h2>Logan Paul Faces Criticism</h2>
<p>This move has drawn heavy criticism from the crypto community, mainly due to Paul&#8217;s failure to reimburse victims of his CryptoZoo (ZOO) project.</p>
<p>Launched in 2021, CryptoZoo promised a cryptocurrency game featuring the ZOO token and NFTs. Despite initial hype during the bull market, the project has failed to meet expectations. Earlier this year, Paul <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/change-of-heart-logan-paul-apologizes-to-coffeezilla-amidst-fallout-over-nft-project/" data-wpel-link="internal">pledged</a> to rectify the situation for affected investors, but this has yet to materialize. He is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/logan-paul-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-alleged-cryptozoo-nft-rug-pull/" data-wpel-link="internal">facing</a> a class-action lawsuit associated with regard to the above.</p>
<p>Consequently, his willingness to wager $1 million on a match outcome has left many unamused. In response to Paul&#8217;s outburst, Danis took to Twitter, highlighting that Paul may have money to bet, but has failed to pay off those he scammed.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Kusama has confirmed that Shibarium is nearly complete, while also revealing another important partnership.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu has shared yet another announcement with its community.</p>
<p>The ecosystem&#8217;s marketing strategist took it to Twitter (now known as X) to reveal that the SHIB Doggy DAO has partnered with a leading digital asset advisory and investment firm.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266593" style="width: 537px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-266593 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg" alt="shiba_inu_img" width="537" height="429" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg 537w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img-300x240.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266593" class="wp-caption-text">Source: X</figcaption></figure>
<h2>SHIB Doggy DAO Shakes Hands with ATH</h2>
<p>The new partnership is struck between Alpha Transform Holdings (ATH) and SHIB Doggy DAO. The latter is the decentralized autonomous organization that&#8217;s governed by holders of the SHIB token and funds the projects that are now built on Shibarium.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ATH is a digital asset advisory and investment firm that&#8217;s comprised of a team of veteran leaders from heavyweights like Nasdaq, News Crop, and Disney and has advised projects like Tether and even Ethereum, per the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/14/2724869/0/en/Alpha-Transform-Holdings-Joins-SHIB-Doggy-DAO-Foundation-as-Advisor.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the matter was Chief Investment Officer and CEO at Alpha Transform Holdings, Enzo Villani, who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“SHIB continues the incredible trajectory. Shibarium has already seen great momentum. With over 21 million wallets and over 250,000 smart contracts written to their Layer 2 blockchain testnet, there are many brands in entertainment, media, and finance that will be interested in engaging with this vibrant community.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Shibarium Nearly Complete</h2>
<p>In a comment on the partnership, the lead developer behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; said that Shibarium is &#8220;nearly complete.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now that Shibarium is nearly complete, and our full structure placed at the feet of the world, we couldn&#8217;t ask for a better partner to help shepherd this next phase of the Shiba global phenomenon. [&#8230;] We look forward to Alpha Transform helping our Foundation swiftly and effectively chart the best course possible for the future of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The SHIB price hasn&#8217;t yet reacted to the news, trading 2% down in the past 24 hours but 11% up for the day, following an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shib-rallies-14-weekly-but-warning-signs-flash-3-things-to-watch-this-week-shiba-inu-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">impressive weekly rally.</a></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prime Trust &#8211; a once-leading cryptocurrency custodian &#8211; filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware approximately two months after the Nevada Financial Institutions Division claimed it operates in an &#8220;unsafe and unsound manner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company was among the leaders in its field a few years ago, holding funds on behalf of other fallen behemoths such as FTX and Celsius Network.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest to Go Bankrupt</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the firm&#8217;s </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X274/12452/PLEADINGS/1245208152380000000024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, its estimated liabilities (on a consolidated basis) range from $100 million to $500 million, while the number of creditors is up to 50,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite being based in Las Vegas, Nevada, Prime Trust filed for bankruptcy protection in the district of Delaware since it had its domicile, principal place of business, or principal assets in this region for 180 days prior to the date of the petition.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency custodian had regulatory issues with the Nevada watchdogs in June when they issued a cease and desist order, claiming the firm had major liquidity cracks and could not honor clients&#8217; withdrawal requests. Shortly after, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/prime-trust-placed-in-receivership-by-nevadas-regulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a petition to place Prime Trust in receivership.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;With consideration of the above, Prime is in an unsafe financial condition and/or is insolvent. Additionally, Prime&#8217;s condition will only progressively worsen as customers continue to withdraw from Prime,&#8221; the agency maintained at the time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulator estimated that the crypto firm owed more than $85 million in fiat currency to customers but had only $2.9 million. It also had $69.5 million worth of cryptocurrency debt, while its digital asset holdings equaled $68.6 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prime Trust was once an industry leader, storing assets and providing services to the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the crypto lender Celsius Network. Both firms filed for bankruptcy last year, adding their names to the long list of entities that collapsed amid the prolonged bear market or some alleged fraudulent actions.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Who Else Went Bankrupt?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The crypto winter, which seemed to have intensified in the spring of 2022 (around the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/here-is-what-happened-to-luna-and-why-the-price-can-continue-crashing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terra crash</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">), hampered investors&#8217; interest and significantly affected the operation of many firms serving the sector. As such, some could not operate properly and filed for bankruptcy protection.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">SHIB appears at a crossroad as the price is quickly losing its bullish momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.000010; $0.000094</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.000012 </strong></p>
<h2>1. Rejection under Key Resistance</h2>
<p>The rally continued until Sunday when the price started to fall. This is the first time in over a week when sellers showed strength and were able to stop the rally. If this continues, then SHIB may enter a correction.</p>

<h2>2. Bearish Divergence</h2>
<p>The daily RSI is showing a clear bearish divergence. The price made a higher high, while the RSI momentum indicator made a lower high. This shows that bulls are starting to lose control over the price.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266541" style="width: 2447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266541" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04" width="2447" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png 2447w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-1536x753.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2447px) 100vw, 2447px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266541" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Momentum Shifting Bearish?</h2>
<p>Similarly to the RSI, the MACD histogram has been making lower highs for four days. This is a clear warning sign that momentum may soon change if buyers don&#8217;t return soon.</p>
<p>While a bearish cross is still some distance away, this price action may encourage sellers to step up their pressure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266534" style="width: 2447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266534" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26" width="2447" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26.png 2447w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-1536x753.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2447px) 100vw, 2447px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266534" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SHIB is neutral.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SHIB Price</h2>
<p>Even if a correction unfolds this week, SHIB has good support at $0.000010 and $0.000094. Only if these levels fail to hold would the price action turn bearish. The resistance remains at $0.000012.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain data analyzed by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex shows that bitcoin (BTC) miners have entered an accumulation phase in preparation for the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 2024.</p>
<p>According to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report, the miner reserve metric <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitfinex-Alpha-67-1.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">indicates</a> a significant accumulation trend from May 27, 2023, which has increased since bitcoin&#8217;s recent downturn from the $30,000 price level.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Miners Accumulate BTC</h2>
<p>The bitcoin halving, which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/breakdown-of-btcs-price-performance-after-previous-halvings-will-history-repeat/" data-wpel-link="internal">occurs</a> every four years or after 210,000 blocks, is a mechanism that slashes the network&#8217;s miners&#8217; rewards by half to reduce the speed at which new BTC is created and possibly increase the asset&#8217;s value. The upcoming one is the fourth since BTC&#8217;s inception and is expected to reduce the network&#8217;s rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.</p>
<p>In response to the upcoming event, miners have shifted from a selling spree that began in August 2022 to the recent accumulation trend. Bitfinex found that July recorded restrained on-chain BTC outflows with a sudden increase towards its end. The exchange noted that the move was &#8220;likely a protective measure against potential resistance against buyers.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/whats-the-cost-to-mine-1-btc-for-top-bitcoin-miners-bernstein-clarifies/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin mining firms</a> have enhanced liquidity positions, reducing their tendency to sell more BTC. This can be attributed to the surge in their stock prices following the buzz around BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With their strong financial reserves, the miners can expand their mining equipment and handle potential price downturns.</p>
<h2>Institutional Crypto Investors Apply Caution</h2>
<p>As bitcoin miners increase their holdings, institutional crypto investors are applying caution to their investments. Bitfinex said this is because the broader market is &#8220;languid,&#8221; and trading volumes have slumped by 62% year-to-date.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Volatility indicators show that we are in for quieter times overall. Bitcoin&#8217;s historical metrics seem to be settling, pointing towards an impending stabilization in market swings, with traders indicating a balanced market,&#8221; the exchange said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, bitcoin funds continue to see large outflows, while institutional investors have stopped shorting BTC via investment products for the first time in 14 weeks. The movement of funds aligns with investors locking in their profits.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The overall behavior of institutional investors has been reflective of a cautious investment strategy into crypto assets and increasing profit-taking in the wake of a languid summer trading season,&#8221; Bitfinex added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, several altcoins, including Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, have registered positive cash inflows.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a token that&#8217;s closely related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem has been making headlines. The cryptocurrency in question is called BAD, and it&#8217;s short for Blockchain + AI + DAO.</p>
<p>Throughout the past 24 hours alone, BAD&#8217;s price is up 20%, bringing its total monthly gains up to around 440%. But why?</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266519" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg" alt="bad_shib_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu and Bad Idea: What&#8217;s the Relationship?</h2>
<p>Right off the bad, it&#8217;s important to note that BAD is a token that brings forward a decentralized experiment, seeking to combine Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-dao/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</a> in a &#8220;risky, meme-worth concoction.&#8221;</p>
<p>In essence, the planning of the project, as well as other tasks, are handed to the community.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also been a notable relationship between BAD and Shiba Inu. Earlier in August, the lead developer of SHIB &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; pointed out how he sees the partnership going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>BAD has more to do with our next phase than just a silly voice in a keynote. It&#8217;s about being thought leaders in a world of copycats.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why is BAD Price Pumping?</h2>
<p>BAD&#8217;s been on a roll during the last 30 days, as the cryptocurrency has surged by more than 440% throughout the period.</p>

<p>As it can be seen in the chart above, the surge started more or less when Kusama posted about the long-term plans of Shiba Inu, including Bad Idea.</p>
<p>Moreover, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist, Lucie, has also recently highlighted the partnership between both projects, pushing the community to vote in favor of a free audit for BAD through CertiK.</p>
