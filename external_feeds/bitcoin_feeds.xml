The exchange&#x2019;s legal team dismissed the notion of an &#x201C;emergency,&#x201D; claiming that it is &#x201C;manufactured by the SEC for its own purposes.&#x201D; </strong></p>
<h2>&#x2018;Why Now?&#x2019;&#x2014;Binance Hits Back at SEC&#x2019;s TRO Bid, Questions Timing and Urgency</h2>
<p>Approximately a week ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a move to secure a court&#x2019;s approval in order to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-court-approval-to-freeze-binance-us-crypto-assets-citing-customer-safety-concerns/">freeze the assets</a> of Binance US, the United States subsidiary of Binance. The SEC&#x2019;s aim behind filing for a temporary restraining order was to safeguard customer assets, as stated in their request. However, Binance <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.43.0_1.pdf">responded</a> on June 12 by opposing the TRO request and asserting that there is no urgent situation and that customer assets are secure.</p>
<p>According to Binance&#x2019;s legal team, if the SEC had been aware of Binance&#x2019;s regulatory violations and its open provision of services to U.S. customers for an extended period, they question &#x201C;Why did the SEC let these platforms grow to their current size if it was always illegal?&#x201D; Additionally, the lawyers highlight the fact that the SEC filed a lawsuit against <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase </a>the very next day, prompting them to insist that the SEC provide a satisfactory response to the fundamental question of &#x201C;Why now?&#x201D; The attorneys firmly argue that the request for a temporary restraining order is &#x201C;unwarranted and improper,&#x201D; as they perceive it to be based on the &#x201C;unfounded and subjective worries&#x201D; of the SEC&#x2019;s staff.</p>

<h2>SEC &#x2018;Does Not Have Authority&#x2019; Requiring Registration When Crypto Registration Definitions Have Not Been Defined by the U.S. Government</h2>
<p>&#x201C;The case alleges only registration violations against [Binance Holdings Limited (BHL)] and only control person liability for registration violations against Mr. Zhao,&#x201D; the court filing details. &#x201C;The SEC&#x2019;s brief does not identify a single instance in which BAM customer assets were mishandled or misused. Its charges against BHL and Mr. Zhao, focused exclusively on failure to register, do not demonstrate that the dramatic remedies the SEC seeks are justified at all.&#x201D; Furthermore, Binance vehemently asserts that the SEC lacks legal grounds due to the absence of a proper definition for crypto assets by Congress or under federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The lawyers&#x2019; state:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC does not have authority to require registration when it has not answered the threshold question of what cryptocurrency assets, if any, constitute securities under federal securities laws. This complex question is the subject of intense debate and extensive legal proceedings across the nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Binance&#x2019;s stance aligns with the concerns raised by numerous other cryptocurrency enterprises, emphasizing the crucial fact that the U.S. government has yet to establish a clear definition distinguishing crypto assets as either securities or commodities. In a public statement, SEC Chair Gary Gensler acknowledged that bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) does not fall within the purview of federal securities laws. However, he also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-insists-most-crypto-tokens-are-securities-says-the-law-is-clear/">expressed his belief</a> that the majority of contemporary crypto assets should be classified as securities, with only enforcement actions providing specific instances of the U.S. regulatory body designating certain assets as investment contracts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Because if the SEC cannot establish that registration was required (be it for offers and sales of securities, as an exchange, as a broker-dealer, or as a clearing agency), it cannot prevail on the merits,&#x201D; Binance&#x2019;s lawyers explain.</p>
<p>Although Binance&#x2019;s legal team opposes the temporary restraining order (TRO) request, they express openness to a proposed consent order (PCO) that would entail Binance US refraining from transferring assets to its parent company or any other entities. The PCO would also facilitate &#x201C;accounting and expedited discovery,&#x201D; and as a gesture of good faith, all private keys and administrative keys would be provided to the government. Moreover, Binance asserts that the company and its CEO, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-buying-bank-not-solution-for-banking-problems-says-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Changpeng Zhao</a> (CZ), have been in communication with the SEC since 2021. The lawyers further claim, however, that BHL and CZ were unaware of being targeted by the SEC until February 2023.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on Binance&#x2019;s legal battle with the SEC? Do you believe the SEC&#x2019;s emergency claim is justified, or is it indeed manufactured for its own purposes?</strong></em></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>

This research enables experts to dissect and identify the specific mining rigs responsible for contributing hashrate to the network, while also evaluating the energy consumption and effectiveness of these machines. Intriguingly, the data reveals that Bitmain has exerted its dominance over the industry for an extended period, with three primary Antminer models now commanding the majority of today&#8217;s hashrate.</strong></p>
<h2>Groundbreaking Methodology Shows Researchers Can Dissect and Identify Miner Type, Energy Usage, E-Waste, and Efficiency</h2>
<p>Karim Helmy, a researcher at Coin Metrics, <a href="https://twitter.com/karimhelpme/status/1668592283871244288?s=20">revealed</a> a new mining study, titled &#8220;<a href="https://5264302.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5264302/special-insights/coinmetrics-research_the-signal-and-the-nonce.pdf">The Signal &amp; The Nonce</a>,&#8221; that takes a fresh approach to exploring the hashpower of the Bitcoin network. Introducing an innovative methodology, the study utilizes nonce patterns to unveil the market share held by each significant application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rig that drives the network&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-593211 size-full" title="New Study Highlights Bitmain’s S19 Mining Rigs Dominate Bitcoin Network’s Hashrate" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nonce.jpg" alt="New Study Highlights Bitmain’s S19 Mining Rigs Dominate Bitcoin Network’s Hashrate" width="1200" height="685" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nonce-300x171.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nonce-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nonce-768x438.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nonce-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nonce.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>To decipher the data, Helmy acquired or leased a diverse range of ASICs that were the subject of the research. In order to gather insights, he established a proxy pool utilizing Luxor&#8217;s relay system. This relay intercepted and meticulously recorded a substantial volume of nonces generated by each ASIC device. Subsequently, the collected data was encoded and transformed into various formats, enabling the identification of patterns with enhanced clarity like never before.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-593208 size-full" title="New Study Highlights Bitmain’s S19 Mining Rigs Dominate Bitcoin Network’s Hashrate" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hashbyasic.jpg" alt="New Study Highlights Bitmain’s S19 Mining Rigs Dominate Bitcoin Network’s Hashrate" width="1280" height="1075" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hashbyasic-300x252.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hashbyasic-1024x860.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hashbyasic-768x645.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hashbyasic.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>A few notable points emerge from the data, including “Bitmain’s sustained dominance in the hardware market,” as outlined in the research. Moreover, it is noteworthy that Bitmain&#8217;s 2016 Antminer S9 has displayed “surprising resilience,” as these older miners have recently fallen below the threshold of detectability. Presently, Bitmain&#8217;s S19j stands as the most dominant ASIC, with the machines generating over 34% of the <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">total hashrate</a>. When considering the combined contributions of the S19 and S19 XP units, they account for nearly 42% of the hashrate.</p>

<p>Although the growth rate of the S19 XP has risen, according to Coin Metrics, Microbt&#8217;s Whatsminer M50s ASIC machines are now undetectable. Furthermore, Coin Metrics uses these statistics to evaluate the overall efficiency of the hardware utilized in the network. This information allows miners to accurately evaluate their position compared to competitors and determine the ideal timing for hardware upgrades. In a tweet, Helmy <a href="https://twitter.com/karimhelpme/status/1668592298836520961?s=20">stated</a>, &#8220;The current network composition is staggeringly efficient.”</p>
<p>The report also assessed Bitcoin&#8217;s energy consumption and compared it to the electricity consumption index developed by Cambridge University&#8217;s Centre for Alternative Finance and Digiconomist. According to Coin Metrics&#8217; study, the network utilized fewer gigawatts of power in contrast to the indexes released by these two entities. “This newer methodology has several advantages over the existing body of research,” the researchers opine. “We estimate the network’s power draw at roughly 13.4 GW, or about 16% less than Cambridge’s estimate of 15.9 GW for the month of May 2023.”</p>

Uniswap states that the dex version will offer a variety of new features, including a method to customize liquidity pools with a functionality called &#8220;hooks.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Customization Takes Center Stage With Uniswap v4</h2>
<p>Uniswap has <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1668603580184502276?s=20">unveiled</a> an update on the project&#8217;s upcoming Version 4 (v4) dex iteration and shared a blog post about the team&#8217;s vision for the new version and early code. “We see Uniswap as core financial infrastructure [and] think it should be built in public with space for community feedback and contribution,” the team noted on Tuesday. While v4 will bring several changes, the most prominent feature mentioned is customizable liquidity.</p>
<p>“Enter hooks, which are plugins to customize how pools, swaps, fees, and LP positions interact,” Uniswap’s <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4">blog post</a> about the subject details. “Developers can innovate on top of the Uniswap Protocol’s liquidity and security to create customized AMM pools through hooks that integrate with v4’s smart contracts.”</p>

<p>Example adjustments mentioned include a time-weighted average market maker (TWAMM), dynamic fees based on volatility, onchain limit orders, out-of-range liquidity depositing to lenders, and custom onchain oracles. Other potential features could involve auto-compounded LP fees back into LP positions and internalized MEV profits with the ability to distribute them back to LPs. Uniswap believes that these ideas merely scratch the surface of what developers can customize and achieve with hooks. Uniswap says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Really, the sky&#8217;s the limit. Because each pool is now defined by more than just the tokens and fee tier, we&#8217;ll see pools of all colors, shapes, and sizes. Uniswap v4’s core logic, like v3, is non-upgradeable. While each pool can use its own hook smart contract, hooks can be limited to only specific permissions determined at pool creation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Uniswap concludes that the release of the code will be governed by a Business Source License 1.1, which imposes restrictions on the utilization of the v4 source code in a commercial or production environment for a maximum duration of four years. After this period, the license will transition to a GPL license, remaining in effect indefinitely. The team concludes that, similar to v3, Uniswap Governance and Uniswap Labs retain the authority to grant exemptions to this license.</p>

The latest development arrives just ahead of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for June 14. The prevailing market sentiment leans towards the anticipation that the Fed will maintain the current benchmark interest rate. </strong></p>
<h2>Consumer Price Index Report Shows U.S. Inflation Slows to 4% Amid Market Expectations for Steady Interest Rates</h2>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">report</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reveals that the annual inflation rate dipped to 4% in May. This data marks the smallest increase since March 2021, a significant turning point when inflation began its rapid ascent, prompting the Federal Reserve to adopt measures such as monetary tightening and interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>“The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose 0.1 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, after increasing 0.4 percent in April,” the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. “Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 4.0 percent before seasonal adjustment.”</p>
<p>The announcement had a positive impact on Wall Street as all four key stock indexes experienced gains, while the crypto economy witnessed a 0.62% rise on Tuesday morning. However, the New York-based <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">spot prices</a> of gold and silver took a hit, with gold declining by 0.23% and silver shedding 0.37%. Market participants eagerly await the upcoming FOMC meeting tomorrow to ascertain whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will opt for an increase in the federal funds rate.</p>

<p>Presently, the interest rate stands at its highest point in 16 years, and the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">CME Fedwatch tool</a> indicates a staggering probability of over 93% that there will be no rate hike this month. Approximately 6.9% of market participants anticipate a 25-basis-point (bps) increase by the U.S. central bank. Nevertheless, history has shown the Fedwatch tool to be remarkably accurate, suggesting that the 25bps hike may be deferred until the subsequent FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>While there is a prevailing belief among many that the Federal Reserve will refrain from increasing the rate this month, a considerable number of analysts and economists hold the view that the Fed will maintain this pause throughout the entirety of 2023.</p>
<p>“The encouraging trend in consumer prices will provide the Fed some leeway to keep rates unchanged this month and if the trend continues, the Fed will not likely hike for the rest of the year,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/13/cpi-inflation-report-may-2023-.html">told CNBC</a> on Tuesday following the latest CPI report.</p>

The native token of Binance fell to a six-month low to start the week, following recent sentiment surrounding the exchange. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> also rebounded today, hitting a multi-month high.</strong></p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> rebounded from a recent losing streak on Tuesday, as bulls rushed in to buy the recent dip in price.</p>
<p>After a low of $220.60 on Monday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>/USD climbed to a peak of $245.64 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#x2019;s rally sees the token move away from yesterday&#x2019;s bottom, which was the lowest point price had hit since December 17.</p>

<p>Despite today&#x2019;s rally, price is still in oversold territory, with the relative strength index (RSI) below the 30.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 24.58, which is marginally above a ceiling at 24.00.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> is now trading at $241.98, which is close to a support point of $242.00.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>Another notable gainer on Tuesday has been <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, which moved to a multi-month high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.5614 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after price bottomed out at $0.5139.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s surge, the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> spiked to its highest point since March 28, when it peaked at $0.5848.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, earlier momentum has since eased, with the token now trading at $0.5326.</p>
<p>Overall, it appears that this occurred as bulls were unable to sustain a breakout of the $0.5490 level.</p>
<p>The RSI is currently hovering close to a resistance level of 58.00, which is another key component stopping price from climbing further.</p>

The company won’t be able to maintain the trading platform or pay employees and vendors, defense attorneys said in a court filing.</strong></p>
<h2>‘No Need for the Draconian Relief Sought by the SEC,’ Binance US Lawyers Say</h2>
<p>Binance US, the American subsidiary of the largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has asked a federal judge to reject a request filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) to freeze billions of dollars’ worth of assets under its management.</p>
<p>Last week, the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-court-approval-to-freeze-binance-us-crypto-assets-citing-customer-safety-concerns/">sought</a> court approval to freeze crypto assets on the platform for the duration of a legal fight against Binance.US, Binance Holdings Ltd. and Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao, citing concerns over the safety of customer funds.</p>

<p>“Operations would quickly grind to a halt,” attorneys representing Binance US said in a court filing on Monday, quoted by Bloomberg. The lawyers warned that the exchange will not be able to pay employees and suppliers while emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>With a freeze of all corporate assets, banking partners would most likely cease to honor requests to transfer funds for any purpose, including customer redemptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">sued</a> , it accused the exchange of “blatant disregard of US securities laws” and “years of violative conduct.” Mishandling of customer funds and misleading investors and regulators were listed among the alleged violations. The defense team insisted, however, that customer assets are safe and stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no need for the draconian relief sought by the SEC.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the banking partners of Binance US has already informed the crypto platform it will no longer hold its assets starting on June 14, the filing further reveals. This partner also froze all activity on the company’s account until after the court rules on the SEC’s motion, the report notes.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Binance US informed customers that it’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-halts-usd-deposits-withdrawals-asks-users-to-withdraw-dollars-by-june-13/">suspending</a> dollar deposits and withdrawals. The exchange asked users to withdraw their holdings in U.S. currency by June 13 as it transitions into a crypto-only trading platform.</p>

Consumer prices for May are expected to fall to 4.1% &#x2014; double the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s 2% target. Ethereum remained below $1,800.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Ahead of the upcoming inflation report in the United States, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved back above the $26,000 level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $25,686.04 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to a peak of $26,261.14 earlier today.</p>
<p>The move saw bitcoin near a recent resistance level at $26,300, which is one of the last hurdles stopping bulls from moving towards $27,000.</p>

<p>In order to get towards this level, a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI) will also need to be broken.</p>
<p>This is the 47.00 level on the indicator, and as of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 44.02.</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) moving average will need to also shift course, and divert away from its current downward path.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) moved marginally higher, however it continued to trade below $1,800.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to a high of $1,757.89 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes a day after the price was at a bottom of $1,723.09.</p>
<p>The latest surge came as bulls took charge at a floor of $1,730, with the RSI bouncing from a floor of its own at 38.00.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 39.33, with the next visible point of resistance being 43.00.</p>
<p>Should the index move beyond the aforementioned ceiling, there is a strong possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will climb to $1,800.</p>

The findings indicate that support for a CBDC remains relatively low among survey respondents.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. CBDC Support Remains Low: Survey Highlights American Hesitation</h2>
<p>In late May 2023, the Cato Institute, a public policy research organization, and Yougov, a public opinion and data firm, <a href="https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/poll-only-16-americans-support-government-issuing-central-bank-digital-currency#76-americans-are-more-concerned-about-cbdcs-potential-risks-potential-benefits">unveiled a survey</a> examining American attitudes toward the potential introduction of a CBDC. From February 27 to March 8, 2023, they polled 2,126 individuals, inquiring about their stance on a CBDC under various circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2023-05/cato-cbdc-survey-toplines.pdf">one question</a> asked participants whether they would endorse or oppose a government-issued CBDC if it allowed the government to monitor all purchases. Just 13% expressed full support for this type of CBDC, while 68% were thoroughly opposed. Approximately 20% remained uncertain and expressed no clear preference either way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-592994 size-full" title="Majority of Americans Hesitant to Embrace Central Bank Digital Currency, Survey Finds" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/catos1.jpg" alt="Majority of Americans Hesitant to Embrace Central Bank Digital Currency, Survey Finds" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/catos1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/catos1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/catos1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/catos1-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/catos1-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/catos1-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/catos1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Another query posed to respondents was whether they would favor or reject a CBDC that allowed the government to control their spending. In this scenario, only 10% fully backed the idea, whereas 74% were adamantly against it. Roughly 16% professed they were unsure and could not firmly commit to either side. When asked about their support for a CBDC designed to combat money laundering and fraud, 42% declared total approval.</p>
<p>Of those surveyed on this topic, about 28% entirely rejected such a fraud-reducing CBDC while roughly 31% could not definitively say if they would support it. Furthermore, when questioned about endorsing a CBDC that ensures welfare recipients use funds as intended, there was an even split: exactly 40% strongly supported it while approximately 31% firmly disapproved and 28% were undecided.</p>

<h2>Cato&#8217;s Polled Respondents Mostly Concerned a CBDC Will Give the Government Total Control Over Spending</h2>
<p>In general, as far as a CBDC with no set criteria, 34% of Americans oppose the U.S. central bank launching a CBDC and 16% favor the idea. Interestingly, nearly half of those surveyed (49%) did not have a clear opinion on the matter, which may be due to a lack of familiarity with the concept; in fact, 72% of respondents admitted to being unfamiliar with CBDCs. When asked about their concerns regarding a potential CBDC, 66% of respondents cited worries about government control over their finances, while monitoring was the second most common concern.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-592995 size-full" title="Majority of Americans Hesitant to Embrace Central Bank Digital Currency, Survey Finds" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6765555.jpg" alt="Majority of Americans Hesitant to Embrace Central Bank Digital Currency, Survey Finds" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6765555-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6765555-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6765555-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6765555-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6765555-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6765555-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6765555.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Looking ahead, only 22% of those polled believe that an American CBDC is likely to launch, while the majority (78%) do not anticipate such a development. When it comes to political affiliations, around 15% of the surveyed group identified as Libertarians. Interestingly, most Democrats and Independents did not express a clear opinion on the matter. On the other hand, a majority of Republicans were firmly opposed to the creation of a CBDC.</p>
<p>According to the survey, the most attractive aspect of a CBDC was its purported ability to combat money laundering and financial crime. The second most appealing feature was a CBDC that bolstered the welfare system. However, a striking 76% of respondents expressed greater concern about the potential risks associated with a CBDC than its potential benefits.</p>

Honduras is now another country that has requested entry into the financial organization, alongside Argentina.</strong></p>
<h2>Honduras Requests Entry to BRICS Bank</h2>
<p>The New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS bank, has received a formal application from the government of Honduras to be part of the financial institution.</p>
<p>The request, delivered personally by Honduran President Xiomara Castro, is part of a state <a href="https://twitter.com/XiomaraCastroZ/status/1665801747892260870?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit</a> by invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, directed to complete economic, cultural, and political agreements.</p>
<p>Castro visited BRICS bank president Dilma Rousseff in Shanghai, where the institution <a href="https://twitter.com/NDB_int/status/1667395829446119424?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaffirmed</a> its &#8220;commitment to promoting sustainable development &amp; international cooperation.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a speech during Castro&#8217;s reception, Rousseff explained the BRICS bank was open to receiving more members in its development plans and stated Castro&#8217;s visit was of &#8220;great importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Castro explained that this request seeks to find alternatives to the traditional finance models that &#8220;in many cases brought more poverty and misery.&#8221; She <a href="https://twitter.com/upholdreality/status/1667720269438361600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We think that there are all the possibilities that we could find mechanisms that will allow us to develop our economy and find permanent allies to provide a different level of quality of life to our people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the visit, Honduras also <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-06-11/Honduras-opens-embassy-in-China-1kxK66GP80o/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> its first embassy in China.</p>

<h2>New Development Bank Expansion</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ndb.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Development Bank</a>, although established in 2014, has started to gain relevance recently with the rise of the BRICS bloc and its proposal of decentralization of global finance. The bank already has the participation of three countries — Bangladesh, Egypt, and the UAE — besides the ones that are part of the BRICS bloc: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Argentina is another of the countries expecting to be admitted in the coming months. The entrance of the country to the BRICS bank will be supported by Brazil, according to Rousseff, who also told Argentine Economy Minister Sergio Massa that Argentina&#8217;s admission would be <a href="https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202306/630022-massa-rousseff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted</a> on in August.</p>
<p>Also, according to recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-in-membership-talks-with-saudi-arabia-report-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, the bank is in talks to accept Saudi Arabia as a member, seeking to diminish its dependence on Russia, which currently holds a 19% stake in the bank.</p>
