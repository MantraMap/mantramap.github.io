<ul><li>SushiSwap has approved a key proposal to increase the fee allocation to the Treasury to 100%.&nbsp;</li><li>The community also approved a proposal to clawback more than 10 million SUSHI tokens.&nbsp;</li><li>Head Chef Jared Grey proposed to increase the Kanpai allocation to strengthen the Treasury last year.</li><li>Both proposals were approved with overwhelming support from the community.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>SushiSwap is set to implement two key proposals after they were approved by its community recently. Both proposals are part of Jared Grey’s vision and future roadmap for the decentralized exchange (DEX). Grey is the DEX’s CEO or the “Head Chef”. The proposals were approved by the community with overwhelming support, with the implementation coming within a month of approval.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>SushiSwap will divert all exchange fees to the Treasury</strong></h2>



<p>The initial <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sushiswap-run-out-of-money-in-1-5-years/">proposal</a> by Head Chef Jared Grey was posted on the governance forum back in December 2022. The idea was to increase Kanpai to 100% of the trading fees sent to the Treasury. By diverting all the fees to the Treasury for 1 year, SushiSwap would be able to extend its runway, which Grey claimed was just 1.5 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A second proposal was <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth/proposal/0xf0353dcc69b766e96e2d1f65f76be2f13c03c1df7ed5ef483e9352e0da59a821" rel="nofollow noopener">approved</a> by the community, as per which more than 10 million SUSHI tokens sitting in the Merkle Distributor will be clawed back. The proposed duration to claim the tokens will be 3 months. At the time of writing, the value of these tokens stood at nearly $14.7 million. The clawed-back SUSHI will be deposited into the Treasury.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These measures to boost SushiSwap’s Treasury are being taken to help the DEX maintain its operations amid a brutal crypto winter that led to a loss of $30 million last year. So far, the annual expenses have been brought down from $9 million to $5 million. Head Chef Jared Grey posted a proposal for <a href="https://forum.sushi.com/t/new-tokenomics-calculators-proofs/11701" rel="nofollow noopener">new tokenomics</a> earlier today and has welcomed the feedback from his community and the broader crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We believe the best token model outcome is supported by healthy dialogue and feedback and welcome your increased engagement in the discussion surrounding Sushi’s newly proposed model,”</p><cite>Head Chef Jared Grey</cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>Binance held token collateral and user funds in the same cold wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange claims it was a mistake and is currently rectifying the issue.&nbsp;</li><li>The cold wallet currently holds both customer funds and reserves for over 40 Binance-peg tokens.</li><li>The exchange previously stated that all B Tokens were backed 1:1.</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest exchange was caught in controversy earlier today after reports alleging the mixing of user funds with token reserves came out. Binance reportedly admitted to holding customer funds in the same account that holds the reserves for almost half of the Binance-peg tokens, also known as B-Tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance 8 wallet held both reserves and user funds</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-24/binance-bnb-acknowledges-storing-users-crypto-with-reserves-in-error#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the exchange held the reserves for nearly half of the 90 B Tokens in <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance 8</a>, which is a cold wallet that also contains a considerable amount of customer funds. Data from Etherscan shows that this wallet currently holds over $10 billion worth of crypto tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data from the exchange’s <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/collateral-btokens" rel="nofollow noopener">official website</a> provides a detailed breakdown of the holdings. As is evident from the listings, the tokens held in the cold wallet are more than the amount of B Tokens issued by the exchange, which indicates the mixing of token collateral with user funds.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Binance 8’ is an exchange cold wallet. Collateral assets have previously been moved into this wallet in error and referenced accordingly on the B-Token Proof of Collateral page. Binance is aware of this mistake and is in the process of transferring these assets to dedicated collateral wallets,”</p><cite>a spokesperson told Bloomberg</cite></blockquote>



<p><br>The spokesperson stressed that all B Tokens were fully collateralized and held 1:1. The same was claimed by the exchange last week in a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/increasing-the-transparency-of-11-backing-for-btokens-3211397767770218173" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>. The mixing of funds came under heavy scrutiny after the downfall of the Bahamas-based crypto exchange and former rival <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ceo-says-exchange-may-be-restarted/">FTX</a>. This very reason promoted the publishing of proof-of-reserves (PoR) from several exchanges to restore the public’s faith in their operational ability.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Binance processed 205,000 transactions between May 2018 and January 2023, per a Chainlysis report from Tuesday.</li><li>The leading crypto exchange also reportedly facilitated $90 million in BTC trading volume for Bitzlato post-August 2021, after announcing plans to beef up anti-money laundering checks.</li><li>Bitzlato is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and its Founder Anatoly Legkodymov was charged with money laundering.</li></ul>



<p>On-chain security firm Chainlysis reported on Tuesday that Binance facilitated over $345.8 million in Bitcoin trading volume for investigated Russian crypto exchange Bitzlato. Bitzlato was accused of money laundering by the U.S. Department of Justice and its Founder Anatoly Legkodymov was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a> on money laundering charges. </p>



<p>Bitzlato fell under scrutiny for allegedly handing $700 million in illegal wealth in an operation that prosecutors said: “fueled a high-tech axis of crypto crime”. The platform was accused of adopting lax background checks and acting as a primary money laundering front connected to Russian crime organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-binance-moved-346-million-120123053.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29pbmRlc2suY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALzQjvw4595-ypxrhTdx0ZkQ2WA5fIUfz4kXsllMq7pFiKoiys_7AWUN7pTJAC78vdqVgQflhsOQ0vWkGOTKwyOzp0GwAoCTxGDc2OTmKF0eqoNxqua1SyuYSwQPVOiRxy8fiIFx3tgwdnDdP0MeQFdtWcPGfh0lnONrofWYtPL0" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-binance-moved-346-million-120123053.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29pbmRlc2suY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALzQjvw4595-ypxrhTdx0ZkQ2WA5fIUfz4kXsllMq7pFiKoiys_7AWUN7pTJAC78vdqVgQflhsOQ0vWkGOTKwyOzp0GwAoCTxGDc2OTmKF0eqoNxqua1SyuYSwQPVOiRxy8fiIFx3tgwdnDdP0MeQFdtWcPGfh0lnONrofWYtPL0" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters </a>report on the matter, Binance was responsible for some 205,000 digital asset transactions between May 2018 and mid-January 2023 when American authorities cracked down on Bitzlato. </p>



<p>The U.S Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) also named Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s crypto exchange was one of three major counterparties for the Russian platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the report said that $90 million of BTC transactions were processed after August 2021. Notably, Binance unveiled plans to implement tight anti-money laundering (AML) checks and improved Know-Your-Customer (KYC) standards in the same month. </p>

<h2>Binance Confirms Error Involving B-Tokens And Customer Asset Storage</h2>



<p>A Bloomberg report said that crypto’s largest centralized exchange erroneously stored customer funds and token collateral in the same wallet. The leading exchange kept collateral for tokens issued on its Binance Smart Chain or BNB Chain network and user assets in a “single wallet called Binance 8”.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-voyager-digital-court-approval/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-voyager-digital-court-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CZ’s company</a> spotted the issue but the juggernaut crypto platform is already working to resolve the matter, per the report. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Binance 8 is an exchange cold wallet. Collateral assets have previously been moved into this wallet in error and referenced accordingly on the B-Token Proof of Collateral page. Binance is aware of this mistake and is in the process of transferring these assets to dedicated collateral wallets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Developers finalized the &#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217; on Thursday.</li><li>The move marks the first major test phase for Ethereum&#8217;s hyped Shanghai updated in March 2023.</li><li>ETH Developer Marius Van Der Wijden noted configuration difficulties on Geth but said progress is underway.</li></ul>



<p>Ethereum developers <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> a ‘shadow fork’ of the Shanghai update built to test the withdrawal of Staked Ether (ETH) from crypto&#8217;s leading altcoin blockchain. Developers dubbed the test environment &#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217;, suggesting the first of many testnets. </p>



<p>A shadow fork refers to a testing ground or trial network built to simulate the main blockchain, in this case, Ethereum. The shadow fork allows engineers and developers to run code, smooth bugs, and finalize an upgrade before shipping to the mainnet. A similar approach was leveraged when preparing for the massive transition to proof-of-stake in 2022. </p>



<p>&#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217; was designed to test the withdrawal mechanism for staked ETH that is expected to roll out with the Shanghai update. According to Marius Van Der Wijden, a developer at the ETH Foundation, the shadow fork was successfully finalized on Monday around 5:30 am ET. </p>



<p>Van Der Wijden noted that some bugs emerged when applying the shadow fork configurations on Geth, an execution client of ETH networks that handles key operations like transactions and execution of smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ETH coders tackled the issues, however, and “all nodes are in agreement” said Van Der Wijden in a tweet. The next step for developers in Shanghai’s first shadow fork is to create evil nodes to further test the update. Evil nodes create invalid blocks and try to pull other network nodes away from the main chain. </p>

We will start some evil nodes,.</p>&mdash; MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) <a href="https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1617530244302532615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Ethereum Developers Move To Unlock 16 Million Staked ETH</h2>



<p>The Shanghai update currently believed to go live in March 2023 will unlock over 16 million ETH currently staked on Ethereum by validators. Indeed, the massive staked Ether makes up over 13% of ETH’s total supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers plan to build in a daily withdrawal cap to cushion the potential price impact from mass withdrawals. The cap is set at around 57,600 ETH per day. Liquid staking platform <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido Finance</a> currently tops the staked ETH leaderboard with over 4.6 million Ether <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/">locked</a> through the service. </p>



<p>The number of validators on ETH&#8217;s network also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed</a> 500,000, a landmark moment as entities prepare for withdrawal functionality with the Shanghai upgrade.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Over 6,000 Uniswap community members voted on the proposal from 0xPlasma Labs.</li><li>Around 80% voted to launch the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange on BNB Chain.</li><li>The 0xPlasma Labs proposal opined that the DEX would enjoy added liquidity and onboard over a million active users by tapping the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.</li></ul>



<p>The Uniswap community <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">voted</a> in favor of launching Ethereum&#8217;s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on BNB Chain to tap broader crypto liquidity and expand beyond ETH’s native blockchain network. </p>



<p>Some 6,495 community members spent a total of 24.9 million UNI voting on the proposal submitted by 0xPlasma Labs, a blockchain company led by Ilia Maskimenka. The results of the vote showed that 80.28% of members voted Yes spending 20 million UNI to back their decision. 19.72% of the votes spent 4.9 million UNI to oppose deploying the DEX on BNB Chain.</p>



<p>Ethereumworldnews previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/0xplasma-labs-uniswap-binance-bnb-chain/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/0xplasma-labs-uniswap-binance-bnb-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> the proposal’s first draft which rolled out on December 12, 2022. 0xPlasma Labs, an on-chain infrastructure developer focused on building tools for Uniswap, opined that the proposal would propel broader access to Ethereum’s largest DEX and tap liquidity from DeFi’s second-largest ecosystem. </p>



<p>The proposal will now advance to a governance vote. </p>



<h2>Uniswap To Compete With PancakeSwap</h2>



<p>Indeed, launching Uniswap on BNB Chain could throw the trading venue into direct competition with PancakeSwap. Launched in 2020, PancakeSwap was built as a decentralized exchange for the BNB Chain ecosystem, similar to how Uniswap was built for Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DefiLama data showed that PancakeSwap boasted over $2.45 billion in total liquidity locked (TVL) with most of its TVL on Binance Smart Chain. Also, another $1.05 billion was locked up in staking facilities on the exchange at press time. The leading DEX on Binance’s blockchain also records hundreds of millions in daily trading volume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uniswap V3 could look to tap more than a million active user addresses on BNB Chain and secure a share of $5 billion in TVL on DeFi’s second-largest ecosystem. Currently, the Ethereum-based DEX has around $2.68 billion in TVL spread across ETH’s main chain, and layer 2 side chains like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Genesis filed for bankruptcy protection late on Thursday revealing $3.6 billion owed to the top 50 creditors.</li><li>Top unsecured claimants included Gemini, Babel Finance, VanEck, and Cumberland among others.</li><li>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss once again threatened legal against Genesis&#8217;s parent company DCG and CEO Barry Silbert. </li></ul>



<p>The Winklevii Founded Gemini was <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/genesis/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTQzOTA3OQ==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">named</a> a top creditor in a list of unsecured claims published by bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global. Genesis filed for bankruptcy late on Thursday roughly two months after the imposition of the crypto exchange FTX. </p>



<p>According to the court filing submitted in the Southern District of New York, Genesis owes over $3.6 billion to its top 50 unsecured creditors. The crypto lender also confirmed between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and liabilities. The filing covers Genesis Global Holdco LLC, Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd, and Genesis Global Capital LLC which served as the partner firm for Gemini’s beleaguered Earn product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thursday’s unsecured claims list noted that Gemini is owed $766 million. Two other creditors are owed a combined $692.2 million but both names were redacted in the court filing. Other members of the top 50 creditors category include Mirana Corp (owed $151 million), Babel Finance (owed $150 million),&nbsp; and VanEck New Finance Income Fund (owed $53 million) to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DCG subsidiary said the late filing was a “strategic action to achieve a global resolution to maximize value for all clients and stakeholders”. The filing comes a few months after the fall of FTX and uncertainty surrounding the lenders’ parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG)</p>



<h2>Winklevoss Threatens Lawsuit Against Genesis Parent Company DCG</h2>



<p>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss threatened to sue the crypto lenders&#8217; parent company DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert for lying to investors about the company’s financial health. Cameron tweeted on Friday that the bankruptcy filing “does not insulate Barry, DCG, and any other wrongdoers from accountability”. </p>



<p>Both parties engaged <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-barry-silberts-resignation-dcg/">embroiled</a> in a public spat ever since Genesis Global Capital paused withdrawals, essentially cutting off liquidity for Gemini’s Earn program and its 340,000+ users. The crypto lender supposedly buckled amid back-to-back exposure to crippled entities Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. </p>

<p>John Ray III, the current CEO of FTX, has hinted at the possibility of restarting FTX.com, the international crypto exchange that lies at the center of Sam Banklam-Fried’s failed crypto empire. Mr. Ray, who was brought in last November to clean up the mess made by SBF and his team, has spent the past two months salvaging assets from the exchange in a bid to secure some value for the exchange’s investors and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>John Ray: Restarting FTX is on the table</strong></h2>



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ftx-chief-says-crypto-exchange-could-restart-11674143168" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, new CEO John Ray III revealed that he has set up a task force to explore the possibility of restarting FTX. The CEO acknowledged that rebooting the exchange may be feasible. Shutting it down and returning available assets to customers would be the other available option. If reviving the exchange leads to more recovery than the liquidation of assets, then the exchange will be restarted.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Everything is on the table…If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”</p><cite>CEO John Ray</cite></blockquote>



<p>Mr. Ray told WSJ that recovering assets was particularly difficult in this case because there was no centralized register that listed the company’s cash and investments. Gary Wang, the exchange’s co-founder, and Alameda Research’s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/alamedas-caroline-ellison-says-sbf-ftx-execs-received-secret-loans-worth-billions/">Caroline Ellison</a> initially helped to locate the exchange’s funds. Both executives have pleaded guilty and secured deals with prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankmain-Fried, who has maintained that filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy was a mistake, welcomed the possibility of restarting FTX. John Ray took issue with comments made by SBF since the bankruptcy, calling them “unhelpful and self-serving.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/" rel="nofollow noopener">FTX Token</a> ($FTT) has gone up more than 30% since the news of a possible revival of the exchange came out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Raydium exploiter drained a total of $4.4 million in digital assets from the Solana DEX in December 2022 before moving the funds to Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain.</li><li>A wallet controlled by the hack transferred $2.7 million of the stolen loot to sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash on Thursday.</li><li>The incident was one of several attacks on the decentralized finance ecosystem throughout last year. </li></ul>



<p>A hacker who stole almost $5 million from Solana-native decentralized exchange Raydium moved a part of the funds from an Ethereum wallet to sanction crypto mixing protocol Tornado Cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The activity was noted on Thursday by the on-chain security firm CertiK. According to the company, the exploiter transferred $2.7 million in stolen Ether (ETH) to the mixer. EtherScan data indicated that the hacker’s wallet moved a total of 1,774.5 ETH over 42 transactions. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>The initial hack <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/raydium-hacker-bridges-solana-to-ethereum/">occurred</a> in December 2022 as previously reported. An unidentified exploiter obtained keys to the admin account for Raydium’s smart contract code. The compromised credentials allowed the hacker to drain liquidity pool (LP) tokens from the DEX. After, the individual bridged the digital assets to Ethereum’s blockchain and converted the funds to ETH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A total of $4.4 million in crypto was stolen off the Solana-based exchange, per reports. </p>



<h2>Tornado Cash Saga</h2>



<p>The attempt to leverage Tornado Cash and other crypto mixers is not uncommon among decentralized finance (DeFi) criminals. Indeed, the U.S Treasury Department sanction the Ethereum-based protocol on suspicions that North Korean cyber-criminal organizations used the service to fund illicit operations.</p>



<p>Although, reports from on-chain observers like Chainalysis disputed claims that the bulk of global money laundering and illicit wealth is funneled through the crypto industry. Per the blockchain company’s review, crypto makes up for less than 5% of illegal cash flow.</p>



<p>Alexey Pertsev who wrote the code for Tornado Cash was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-will-reportedly-stay-in-jail-for-two-months-after-his-appeal-gets-dismissed-by-the-court/">arrested</a> by Dutch police back in August 2022. Pertsev remains jailed until February 20 as a Netherlands judge deemed the developer a flight risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Raydium Hack Among Over $3 Billion In DeFi Attacks </h2>



<p>Raydium counted among a raft of attacks on DeFi protocols in 2022. Hackers had drained over $1 billion in assets from crypto projects as of September. October was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/12/28/over-3-billion-stolen-in-crypto-heists-here-are-the-eight-biggest/" rel="noopener">tagged</a> the worst month for DeFi hacks.</p>



<p>To date, the 2022 exploit of Ronin’s bridge remains the largest hack in DeFi history. The exploit which was attributed to the North Korean group Lazarus <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ronin-network-hacked-for-173-6k-ethereum-and-25-5m-usdc/">stole</a> over $600 million in Ethereum and USDC from the cross-chain service.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A VC fund co-founded by Peter Thiel closed almost all of its 8-year-long bet on Bitcoin last year.&nbsp;</li><li>The winding down of the crypto investments came right before 2022’s crypto crash in May.&nbsp;</li><li>Shortly after selling the crypto holdings, Thiel suggested that Bitcoin’s price may rise 100-fold.</li><li>The fund currently manages more than $11 billion and has very little exposure to crypto.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Billionaire investor Peter Thiel reportedly cashed out big on crypto last year. The Founders Fund, a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel, made its initial investment in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-developer-loses-3-6-million-bitcoins-hack/">Bitcoin</a> in early 2014 when the flagship crypto was trading at around $700. This was followed by large investments in crypto, however, the bulk of the crypto exposure was to Bitcoin. Crypto investments became one of the fund’s core positions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Peter Thiel’s fund sold crypto investments before the market crashed</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a1d5597-7145-4035-987b-ff033bba3d75" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a>, the 8-year-long crypto bet made by Thiel’s Founders Fund was wound down towards the end of March 2022. This included the majority of the fund’s exposure to the crypto portfolio. This sale came just a month before the crypto contagion of 2022 that started in May. The fund netted a whopping $1.8 billion from this sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, Peter Thiel said in April 2022 that he was optimistic about the future of Bitcoin. The billionaire investor had suggested that BTC, which was worth around $44,000 at the time, could rise by 100 times. These comments came just days after his fund had sold its Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sale of the Founders Fund’s crypto portfolio has not previously been reported. People familiar with the matter told FT that as of now, the fund has no significant exposure to crypto assets. The fund currently has more than $11 billion under management and has&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://foundersfund.com/portfolio/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">invested</a>&nbsp;in popular companies like SpaceX and Lyft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Stargate Finance looks to power liquidity transfer across decentralized networks without downgrading security and efficiency, per Stargate&#8217;s official announcement.</li><li>The LayerZero Labs&#8217; protocol will start by enabling support for Tether&#8217;s USDT stablecoin for Metis users on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Ethereum.</li><li>Metis CEO Elena Sinelnikova noted that the partnership should propel growth for the multi-chain economy, making crypto more accessible to everyday users.</li></ul>



<p>LayerZero Labs’ Stargate Finance will onboard its liquidity transport protocol on layer 2 network Metis as Stargate moves toward bridging crypto assets and digital currency liquidity across multiple blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unveiled by LayerZero Labs in March 2020, Stargate boasts network composability allowing users and decentralized applications (dApps) to move native assets between otherwise isolated blockchains. The solution operates as a cross-chain protocol with its own unified liquidity pools and optimized finality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LayerZero supposedly built the protocol to further plans of an Omni-chain ecosystem where crypto users can seamlessly interact with web3 solutions like decentralized exchanges and yield aggregators, regardless of the native blockchains those solutions were initially built on.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Pushing Crypto Adoption And Accessibility With Cross-Chain Technology</h2>



<p>Commenting on the news, Metis CEO and Co-Founder Elena Sinelnikova opined that onboarding Stargate Finance will further broader cryptocurrency adoption by improving accessibility to digital assets. Sinelnikova also noted that the partnership signals significant progress toward “eliminating the barriers between blockchains, and opening the doors to a more decentralized, multi-chain economy.”</p>



<p>Metis is a layer 2 protocol based on Ethereum’s blockchain network. Similar to other layer 2 chains, Metis improves scalability, enabling faster transactions at lower costs without trading the network security that Ethereum is famed for. </p>



<p>The project also moves a step further with an NFT bridge, a web3 storage solution, a framework for decentralized autonomous companies (DACs), and a middleware protocol dubbed Polis.&nbsp; LayerZero Labs Co-Founder and CTO Ryan Zarick added that integrating with Metis paves the way for deeper communications between protocols and solutions on Ethereum’s layer 2 network.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The integration of Metis is another big step in LayerZero’s expansion into the Layer 2 ecosystem of Ethereum, allowing for a unified flow of messaging across the entire Ethereum ecosystem. We’re extremely excited to support the Metis ecosystem and its developers and are looking forward to building amazing things together.</p><cite>&#8211; CTO Ryan Zarick.</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Stargate Finance Brings USDT To Metis Users</h2>



<p>According to the official announcement, Stargate Finance will provide support for Tether’s USDT stablecoin on Metis. Users leveraging Metis’ layer 2 solutions on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/">Ethereum</a> will be able to tap crypto’s largest stablecoin by market cap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the partnership with Metis marks a watershed moment for <a href="https://stargate.finance/" rel="nofollow noopener">Stargate Finance</a> since its launch. This is the first time the project has expanded beyond LayerZero Labs, the Stargate Finance team told EthereumWorldNews.</p>
