<p>At the time of publication, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-up-8-amid-positive-news-polygon-sees-major-integration-with-the-graph-network/">MATIC</a> was changing hands at $0.92, up 3.94% in the last 24 hours. Banque SYZ (Bank Syz), a prominent Swiss private bank with $30 billion in AuM, has announced the introduction of its &#8220;Syz Crypto&#8221; product, via which the Geneva-based company will provide its Swiss and foreign clients with digital asset services, including as trading and custody. According to a formal press statement released on Monday, Bank Syz will support Polygon (MATIC) and a few other cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the service. To create LGND Music, a Web3 music platform, Polygon, Warner Music Group, and e-commerce and interactive platform builder LGND have formed a multiyear partnership. When it launches in January 2023, LGND Music is intended to be a platform for music and collectibles that enables <em>&#8220;digital collectibles from any blockchain in a proprietary player,”</em> thereby making it possible for users to play their digital collectibles on the go.</p>
<p>Key Levels<br />Resistance Levels: $1.130, $1.150, $1.000<br />Support Levels: $0.800, $0.689, $0.521</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p><br />The MATIC price has been in a broadly sideways range since late July. On November 8, the price dropped to a low of $0.076, initiating a downside consolidation. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-here-are-key-levels-to-watch-nike-to-mint-nft-apparel-on-polygon-after-web3-platform-launch/">MATIC/USD</a> price is currently in a battle with the MA 50 barrier at $0.925 following a day-high. <br /><br />The price could rise to $1.113 after the MA 50. MATIC&#8217;s successful move above the MA 200 ($0.795) and prior&#8217;s days&#8217; high of $0.919 lends support to an upside move for the pair.</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63441 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>On the 4-hour time frame, the MA 50 and 200 intersection at $0.925 could halt bullish movements in this region. However, a move higher might enable MATIC&#8217;s price to surpass the $1.00 psychological zone set. <br /><br />Meanwhile, selling interest below current levels may find support around the $0.800 level, which was taken from the most recent low before falling lower. The RSI indicator has risen past the neutral 50 level, which points to potential consolidation.</p>

<p>A US court has instructed the bankrupt cryptocurrency company <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/former-celsius-executive-hired-by-jpmorgan/">Celsius</a> to refund its customers $44 million in crypto assets.<br /><br />The crypto lender, which declared bankruptcy in July 2022, has been ordered by Chief Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn to return millions of dollars in cryptocurrency to its customers. The company has been ordered to refund its users $44 in crypto assets in September.<br /><br />Judge Glenn reportedly stated during the ruling, <em>&#8220;I want this case to move forward.&#8221; &#8221; I want creditors to recover as much as they possibly can as soon as they possibly can.&#8221;</em> <br /><br />In other news, the company has successfully petitioned the court to extend its exclusivity period until February 15, 2023, giving it the exclusive right to submit company reorganization plans under Chapter 11 guidelines.<br /><br />The Celsius team announced its liabilities were between $1 billion and $10 billion at the time of bankruptcy filing, with over 100,000 creditors.<br /><br />According to one report, Celsius had over $200 million in escrow. However, the majority of these funds (approximately $200,000) were reportedly transferred from interest-bearing to escrow accounts shortly before the bankruptcy filing. This could have given them the option to claim ownership of the funds in the custody accounts under the preferential transfer rules.<br /><br />However, the court order now requires that funds held in escrow accounts be returned to customers, even if they did not enter the company&#8217;s interest-bearing accounts. Celsius advisors and stakeholders determined that the funds held in the custody accounts belonged to the customers, not Celsius, and obtained the court order.<br /><br />Even after Celsius declared bankruptcy, there has been considerable uncertainty about the funds held by the company. Several high-level executives have been accused of focusing on themselves rather than the community. These allegations have primarily targeted ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky. He withdrew $10 million from the platform, according to reports in early October. Celsius immediately froze all user accounts and transactions while claiming that user funds were safe. A few days after this news broke, two other top executives were accused of stealing user funds.<br /><br />Former CSO Daniel Leon and CTO Nuke Goldstein allegedly withdrew $56 million with Mashinsky shortly before the company declared bankruptcy. The fact that all three top executives put their interests ahead of the community has been a source of contention for the community, leading to a general feeling of ill will, particularly toward the disgraced former CEO himself.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-developers-target-march-2023-153950997.html"> next hard fork</a>, dubbed <em>&#8220;Shanghai,&#8221;</em> will allow users to withdraw ether staked with network validators in March 2023, according to Ethereum developers.<br /><br />In a session held, core developers established a rough timeline for when the Shanghai upgrade should be completed. Shanghai, also known as<em> &#8220;Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895,&#8221;</em> is a planned upgrade that will enable validator staking withdrawals, which are currently unavailable on the network.<br /><br />Users cannot withdraw staked funds from the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-blockchain-developer-announces-new-smart-contract-language-called-fe/">Ethereum blockchain</a> at this time. Shanghai would address this issue while also providing greater flexibility and convenience to those who staked ether on the network before The Merge, the last upgrade in which Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake consensus.<br /><br />Due to potential technical difficulties or other unforeseen issues, there is no guarantee that the proposed timeline will be met.</p>
<p>Pooja Ranjan, a project manager at Ethereum Cat Herders who was present at the meeting said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Withdrawals will be enabled with Shanghai currently planned in March on the mainnet, if everything goes as planned.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developers also discussed a second hard fork, scheduled for sometime after Shanghai in the third quarter of 2023, which will introduce <em>&#8220;proto-danksharding,&#8221;</em> or EIP 4844, an upgrade that will increase the network&#8217;s capacity to handle more transactions.<br /><br />EIP 4844 will introduce a new type of transaction format to Ethereum called <em>&#8220;shard blob transactions,&#8221;</em> which will allow Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and access off-chain data to address the scaling needs of blockchain apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone in the world now is looking for a good, really good option for making money, in this case, everyone tries to avoid some falsified methods, and some unreliable or little-known methods, people focus on something that is already quite popular and at least a little profitable and try to make money, this is related to cryptocurrency mining, even the <a href="https://minery.io/ae/">mining companies in UAE</a>.</p>
<h3>Should we start mining at all? What is it and its signs</h3>
<p>First of all, it is worth noting that mining itself is essentially an operation when you solve some complex mathematical problems with the help of some of your equipment (it can of course be something that has access to the Internet). Each solved task is recorded in a kind of history of all your performed operations &#8211; this is called a blockchain, a kind of database of mining operations.</p>
<p>Although it sounds quite simple in words, but before diving into this business and this industry as a whole, it should be noted that it is worth learning all the unknown concepts related to mining. For example, to study in more detail about the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/some-important-terms-of-blockchain-technology-in-terms-of-bitcoin/">concept of blockchain</a>, or to study what these mining algorithms are. This industry has its own special moments that need to be studied and then quickly processed. Yes, it is also logical that depending on which cryptocurrency you choose, the difficulty of its mining will be the same, because each cryptocurrency has its own algorithm, and in this case has its own model of mathematical calculation. Plus, some of them are more profitable for mining, some less profitable, due to their price or even popularity. In any case, the mining process depends on the equipment you are going to use for this, because the more powerful it is, the better and more qualitative your mining process will be.</p>
<h3>In fact, the more powerful the better for mining?</h3>
<p>Of course it is. In principle, in order not to exert too much effort, you can mine even with the help of a simple phone, but then you will not make money from it, and even more so you will not open your own business or even more so you will not earn some kind of passive income for yourself. At first, people used simple computers or groups of computers for mining, with good video cards (by the way, it works even now, although it is not as profitable and popular).</p>
<p>Already after that, the most experienced businessmen in this field began to use entire mining farms for their own purposes, if we speak briefly and explain easily and accessible, then you can imagine that this farm is simply a collection of a very large number of interconnected video cards to your personal computer computer, and now it is probably the most used method for cryptocurrency mining, it helps a lot and makes the process itself super high-quality. Usually from six to 12 video cards are pushed there. Or there are special Asic machines created for mining, although this is by itself a more expensive pleasure. However, if you still decide to invest here, it is worth considering everything carefully in order to get the highest quality and profitable result.</p>
<h3>Is it even worth starting mining, and its profitability</h3>
<p>It is worth noting that every year the earnings from cryptocurrency mining, its profit, becomes smaller and smaller, all because the equipment grows, the amount of necessary equipment grows, and its prices also grow. Therefore, in some countries where these devices are particularly expensive, it is not recommended to start this business at all. In addition, it is also worth considering the cost of electricity consumption, because it is an obvious fact that the more powerful our devices are, the more energy they need, and accordingly, the greater the amount of electricity they consume, although if we are talking about the UAE, here with everything was quite successful with this and in principle if starting this business here is not such a bad idea.</p>
<p>Also, quite often there is a question about the legality of this industry and its reliability on the market. Well, to tell the truth, everything is quite legal in principle (in most countries of the world), there is nothing illegal to be written in the constitution and there are no contradictions regarding the legality of this business.</p>
<p>If we talk about reliability, then if you have already chosen mining, then you definitely do not need to worry about security in this area. As we have already mentioned, every transaction here, every mathematical operation you perform has its own mining algorithms, this is very cool, because it adds protection to your account in which you have invested. Also, thanks to the protection that is in the blockchain, only you will be able to see your data regarding what you have already done from transactions, from calculations, no one else will be able to do this, all this is only yours personally.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Legality and reliability are, of course, an indicator, but everyone who wants to invest here is not primarily interested in this, but is interested in how much he can and in general will be able to earn at least something, so everyone should take into account all the factors that can affect this industry and on our performance in this area. Only after thinking everything through, forming a strategy and investing successfully, you can really get it all back and even more.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/12/06/dev-0139-launches-targeted-attacks-against-the-cryptocurrency-industry/">Microsoft&#8217;s</a> security division has investigated an attack in which a malicious actor targeted various cryptocurrency investment firms.</p>
<p>The threat actor, identified as DEV-013, was able to infiltrate chat groups on the popular messaging app Telegram and pose as a representative of a cryptocurrency investment firm. They pretended to talk about trading fees with VIP clients of major exchanges. The hacker had extensive knowledge of the subject, which made it easier for them to gain the trust of their victim.<br /><br />They intended to dupe <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/us-treasury-prohibits-tornado-cash-mixer-for-crypto-funds-laundering/">cryptocurrency investment</a> funds into downloading an Excel file. While the document contains accurate information about the fee structures of major cryptocurrency exchanges, it also contains a malicious macro that executes another Excel sheet in the background. This allows the bad actor to gain remote access to the infected system of the victim.<br /><br />Microsoft&#8217;s findings also imply that there may be other campaigns targeting crypto companies that use the same techniques. According to the tech titan, the cryptocurrency industry is &#8220;a field of interest&#8221; for cybercriminals. They can target both large and small businesses. Microsoft advises taking additional precautionary measures to avoid such attacks.<br /><br />This August, cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies discovered a cryptocurrency mining malware campaign that had infected over 111,000 users. Microsoft and the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker Intel announced a partnership last April to prevent malicious crypto mining.</p>

<p>An independent global auditor has confirmed that all the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/here-is-what-historical-data-presents-for-bitcoin-in-december-ftx-japan-to-allow-withdrawal-of-funds/">Bitcoin</a> currently circulating on Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is fully accounted for.<br /><br />The audit enables any exchange user to confirm the security of their Bitcoin balance using on-chain data.<br /><br />Binance&#8217;s bitcoin was 101% collateralized as of November 22nd, according to the <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/">auditing</a> service Mazars Veritas. That is, it has slightly more bitcoin than its liabilities/customer assets), which total 575,742 BTC.<br /><br />The figure is consistent with Binance&#8217;s initial reveal of its proof of reserves last month when it reported net Bitcoin assets of 582,485 BTC. Such bitcoin can be found on the native Bitcoin blockchain, as well as on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Binance Smart Chain.<br /><br />After the collapse of FTX, which made the crypto community wary of crypto exchanges lending out customer deposits, proof of reserves has grown in popularity. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the defunct exchange, has now confirmed that customers were effectively trading fake Bitcoin on the platform.<br /><br />Merkle-tree proofs are designed to provide blockchain-based proof that user assets have not been tampered with. Mazars&#8217; auditing page includes a tool that allows users to check their on-chain balance by pasting their Merkle hash from Binance.<br /><br />However, as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1598734821701824513">argued</a> last month, Merkle Tree proofs are insufficient to prove an exchange&#8217;s solvency because they provide no information about the liabilities of a given firm. As a result, the tool must be used in conjunction with a professional audit of those debts to ensure the entity&#8217;s financial health.<br /><br />Soon after FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy, Kraken issued its Proof of Reserves (alongside its Proof of Liabilities), allowing users to confirm that their accounts had been audited.</p>

<li>Chainlink Staking v0.1 is now live on Ethereum mainnet</li>
<li>LINK remains down 2.93% in the last 24 hours at $6.81</li>
<li>The initial implementation which is the staking v0.1 enables eligible community members to stake up to 7,000 LINK</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a big day for <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/link-price-analysis-link-price-grows-36-chainlink-announces-partnership-with-south-koreas-top-coffee-brand/">Chainlink</a>, as Early Access for Chainlink Staking v0.1 is now live on the Ethereum mainnet. At the time of publication, LINK, the native token, had yet to react to the big news as it remained down 2.93% in the last 24 hours at $6.81. The initial implementation, which is staking v0.1 enables eligible community members to stake up to 7,000 LINK in the limited-size v0.1 staking pool. The capped Staking Pool will lead to General Access in two days, on December 8, 2022, at noon ET, giving users the chance to stake up to an initial limit of 7,000 LINK per address, subject to the initial 25 million LINK pool cap and other applicable participation requirements. In the initial v0.1 pool, 22.5 million LINK are allotted for community Stakers on a first-come, first-served basis, while 2.5 million LINK are allotted and reserved for node operator Stakers.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $12.29, $9.50, $8.00<br />Support Levels: $6.50, $5.52, $4.50</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/link-price-analysis-bulls-pause-but-rebound-might-not-be-over-yet-us-hedge-fund-giant-partners-with-chainlink/">LINK/USD</a> softened after piercing the moving averages of 50 and 200 on the daily chart. The pair has been grinding up along the moving averages and has further weakened on a lack of positive drivers. November’s high of $9.48 may prove to be a tough level to crack. A bearish relative strength index (RSI) now indicates a slowdown in the upward momentum.<br /><br />An initial break below the $7.00 level triggered the first round of profit-taking, turning it into fresh resistance. The next level of $6.21 is the immediate level to gauge follow-up interest, and its breach would send Chainlink to $5.52. Overall, LINK/USD price dips remain attractive to bulls, especially at initial support near the $6.0 level.</p>
<h4>LINK/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>The LINK/USD 4-hour chart shows that the price has fallen below the horizontal level of $7.50, moving average of 50 zones. The price even moved below the $7.00 level and settled well under the moving average of 200 (4 hours). On the downside, initial support is near the $6.50 level. <br /><br />There is also an expected rebound zone forming along the support near $6.20 on the same chart. The next major resistance is near the $8.00 level. Any more loss might send the price toward the $6.20 support level, on the flip side, the price might revisit the $7.80 level.</p>

Tether&#8217;s partner, Capital Union, a leading international boutique financial institution based in the Bahamas, manages this reserve. Capital Union is also in charge of the reserve&#8217;s custody and auditing.<br /><br />According to the company, one of the key benefits of Tether Introducing CNHT, a Stablecoin Pegged to the Chinese Yuan is that it enables cost-effective and secure Chinese Yuan transactions and eliminates the need to pay large transaction fees when sending CNHT across borders, as CNHT can be sent almost instantly and without the need for middlemen.<br /><br />CNHT is also fully compliant with Chinese regulations and is available on a number of exchanges, including OKEx and Huobi.<br /><br />It is the first stablecoin to be launched on the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tron-unveils-plans-to-invest-100-million-in-blockchain-gaming-fund/">Tron blockchain,</a> and it aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective way for people to exchange currencies.<br /><br />The introduction of this new stablecoin is expected to improve liquidity and lower transaction costs for those who use it. It will also make access to the Chinese yuan and other international currencies easier for users.</p>

<p>Following the team&#8217;s 3-0 extra-time loss to Morocco in the FIFA World Cup, the Spain National Football Team Fan Token (SNFT), according to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spain-national-fan-token">CoinGecko</a>, fell 42% from $0.09 per coin to $0.03 today.<br /><br />Crypto sports bettors have invested their money in tokens bearing the names of their preferred teams ever since the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/chz-price-analysis-chiliz-price-jumps-15-in-week-amid-fresh-wave-of-hype-ahead-of-fifa-world-cup-2022/">World Cup</a> began. Some tokens, such as the Argentine Football Association Fan Token (ARG), function similarly to DAO governance tokens by allowing owners to vote on upcoming fan events but not on the team&#8217;s strategy or roster.<br /><br />Sports fan tokens are all about the game, even though the majority of tokens can fluctuate with the turbulence of the cryptocurrency market.<br /><br />The price of the ARG token fell after Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina on November 23, 2022, as supporters sold their tokens. According to Coingecko, the Argentina team fan token initially traded at $8.10 per coin on November 20, 2022, but after the team&#8217;s defeat three days later, it dropped to $5.35 and has been falling ever since.<br /><br />Even a victory, however, does not ensure that a token&#8217;s value will rise. Argentina defeated Australia 2–1 on December 3, 2022. The price of the ARG token was trading at $3.57 at the time, failing to surpass the highs of the previous week.<br /><br />Team tokens are used for more than just the World Cup. In April, digital asset platform Socio announced a partnership with thirteen NFL teams, including the Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, to create fan tokens.<br /><br />The following month, Socio announced a partnership with Major League Soccer to produce fan tokens for all 26 teams.<br /><br />Image Credit: Shutterstock</p>
