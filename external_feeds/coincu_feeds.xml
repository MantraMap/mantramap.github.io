<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin is undeniably the most secure blockchain and widely accepted cryptocurrency in the world. However, Bitcoin has some limited capabilities that affect global adoption, such as the lack of advanced smart contracts needed for DeFi applications. Therefore, Stacks Network (STX), a Layer 2 that supports Smart Contracts and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/170791-bitcoin-layer-2-stacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helps expand</a> the Bitcoin network, was born. The project under review is ushering in a new era for Bitcoin functionality. So what is Stacks Network (STX), and how does it work?</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Stacks Network?</h2>

<p>Stacks is a layer-2 solution of Bitcoin powered by the Stacks token (STX), extending the functionality of Bitcoin. Built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, Stacks brings smart contracts to Bitcoin without the need to fork or make any changes to Bitcoin. This opens up an entire ecosystem of Bitcoin decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that leverage the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>



<p>Stacks was originally founded as &#8220;Blockstack PBC&#8221; by two former Princeton University students, Muneeb Ali, and Ryan Shea. In 2017, Blockstack PBC raised $50 million in a token sale, and in 2018 launched a testnet in Q2, followed by a mainnet in Q4.</p>



<p>2019 saw the Stacks public offering become the first regulated token sale by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That same year, STX was listed on several major crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, and its price started to rise.</p>



<p>In 2020, STX hit an all-time high of over $2.50, making it one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the year. Later that year, Blockstack rebranded to Stacks to separate the ecosystem and open-source project from Blockstack PBC, which was renamed Hiro Systems PBC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does the Stacks Network (STX) work?</h2>



<p>Stacks is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, using Bitcoin as the payment layer. The Stacks network links to Bitcoin through a Proof-of-Transfer mechanism, which runs parallel to Bitcoin&#8217;s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) is an adaptation of Proof-of-Burn (PoB). With PoB, users &#8220;burn&#8221; or destroy their own Bitcoin to mine new blocks on the Stacks network. Burned Bitcoin recycling has been done in Bitcoin&#8217;s Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="622" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971-1024x622.png" alt="Stacks Network, Layer-2 Helps Extend Bitcoin Network" class="wp-image-188681" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971-1024x622.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971-300x182.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971-768x467.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971-1536x933.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971-750x456.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971-1140x693.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-971.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Stacks Network, Layer-2 Helps Extend Bitcoin Network 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stacks.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stacks Foundation</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, with PoX, miners have to send Bitcoins to specific Bitcoin addresses participating in consensus instead of burning Bitcoins. Block generation on the Stacks blockchain is determined through grading, where miners compete to be selected to generate the next block by sending Bitcoins to randomly determined addresses. This process ensures that block production is decentralized and fair.</p>



<p>To build new blocks in the Stacks blockchain, miners commit the block hash of each Stacks block to the Bitcoin chain using OP_RETURN in Bitcoin transactions. This means that the state of the Stacks blockchain is settled on the Bitcoin blockchain and benefits from its immutability, and stack nodes can use this data stored on the Bitcoin chain to verify the integrity of the Stacks blockchain state. The metadata from newly mined Stacks blocks is anchored to every Bitcoin block, allowing users to verify the standard Stacks chain through Bitcoin blocks.</p>



<p>In addition, since only the block hash of the Stacks block is written to the Bitcoin chain, it allows blocks consisting of thousands of transactions without taking up additional Bitcoin block space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What makes Stacks Network so special?</h2>



<p>The founders of Stacks spent eight years developing the project. It is because of this in-depth research and subsequent development of a solid foundation that Stacks offers several key features that make it unique from other networks:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Proof-of-Transfer (PoX)</strong></h3>



<p>Stacks uses a Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism where &#8220;stackers&#8221; play an important role in maintaining the security of the blockchain by voting on which chain forks they want to support and deciding if they want to support branching that chain stacking rewards are distributed every cycle. With the sBTC upgrade of the Stacks network, stackers will have a new role of signing threshold signature wallets containing pegged Bitcoin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stacking</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="944" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974-1024x944.png" alt="Stacks Network, Layer-2 Helps Extend Bitcoin Network" class="wp-image-188684" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974-1024x944.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974-300x277.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974-768x708.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974-1536x1416.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974-750x692.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974-1140x1051.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-974.png 1822w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Stacks Network, Layer-2 Helps Extend Bitcoin Network 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Stacking is temporarily locking down STX tokens to support the Stacks blockchain. By locking STX, you provide valuable consensus and security through Proof-of-Transfer (PoX), the Stack&#8217;s only consensus mechanism. The stacker earns the original BTC that miners on Stacks switch to the protocol to mine the new STX. A stacking cycle is 2,100 Bitcoin blocks long or about two weeks. You can check the status of the current cycle, including the estimated minimum reward, at stacking.club/cycles/current.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Post-conditions</strong></h3>



<p>Post-conditions are unique to the Stacks chain and can be added to transactions to provide additional safety measures. If the execution of a transaction violates one or more of the posting conditions, the entire transaction will be reversed. The Xverse Wallet makes it easy to view and understand the conditions posted on the transaction, allowing you to confirm that the transaction is safe before proceeding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Qualified by SEC</strong></h3>



<p>Stacks is the first cryptocurrency to receive an SEC certificate for sale in the US, allowing it to launch a $28 million Reg A+ cash offering for its STX tokens in July 2019.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Finitude (coming soon)</strong></h3>



<p>Stacks is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, which means it uses the same underlying technology and security features as Bitcoin. In addition to having a strong foundation in immutability, it also allows developers to build applications that can take advantage of the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">STX tokens</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-973.png"><img decoding="async" width="730" height="467" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-973.png" alt="Stacks Network, Layer-2 Helps Extend Bitcoin Network" class="wp-image-188683" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-973.png 730w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-973-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" title="Stacks Network, Layer-2 Helps Extend Bitcoin Network 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>STX is the native token of Stacks Network. Instead of using electricity, Stacks miners use mined BTC to mine newly minted STX tokens. Stack owners can then lock their STX by consensus to earn BTC, making STX the only crypto asset natively priced in BTC and yielding BTC earnings. This creates an economic incentive for users to secure the network and contribute to its development.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Stacks Network is currently the most comprehensive Layer 2 on Bitcoin, with infinite scalability when supporting Subnets, helping to develop the Bitcoin network and bring BTC to DeFi. But still ensure the safety of the main network and help dApps built on Stacks inherit the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>Stacks Network was originally founded with the mission of empowering people to take control of their data and assets by providing a more accessible decentralized economy and user-owned internet. With its commitment to bringing decentralized finance (DeFi) to Bitcoin, its unique features, and innovative use of the Bitcoin blockchain, the Stacks cryptocurrency platform clearly has promising growth potential.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Xverse Wallet is a powerful tool for Bitcoin enthusiasts, allowing users to take advantage of the advanced capabilities provided by the Bitcoin Stacks layer. It is considered an advanced Bitcoin wallet, built for everyone, available for Chrome on the desktop and for iOS and Android.</strong> <strong>In particular, Xverse supports buying, selling, and trading <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186244-bitcoin-ordinals-is-taking-nfts-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT Bitcoin Ordinals</a> storming the market. So let&#8217;s learn about what Xverse Wallet is and its features.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Xverse Wallet?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-969.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="630" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-969.png" alt="Xverse Wallet Review: Connecting Users With Trend Bitcoin Ordinals And More" class="wp-image-188674" title="Xverse Wallet Review: Connecting Users With Trend Bitcoin Ordinals And More 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Xverse is an advanced Bitcoin wallet that allows users to connect to Bitcoin DeFi, a decentralized application and digital collectibles (NFT) powered by Stacks.</p>



<p>Simply put, Stacks brings smart contracts to Bitcoin using a unique &#8220;PoX&#8221; consensus mechanism. This means that it works in conjunction with the Bitcoin blockchain and uses it as a secure means of broadcasting its block headers. Simply put, blocks are built on top of each other, making it increasingly difficult to damage a block, similar to Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Stacks uses the Clarity programming language specifically designed to program Bitcoin smart contracts with a primary focus on security. Users can also purchase STX, BTC, and other SIP-10 tokens within the app using fiat services on the junction, including Binance, Moonpay, and Transak.</p>



<p>Its non-custodial design aims to be the next option for Web3 interactions on Bitcoin via the Stack. It offers a wide range of features, whether you want to trade NFTs, use the DeFi protocol, or earn Bitcoin rewards by accumulating your STX.</p>



<p>The Xverse wallet is available on mobile and desktop, providing users with the ability to unleash the power of Bitcoin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Xverse wallet features</h2>



<p>Xverse Wallet supports Stacks, Bitcoin, and all other SIP-010 tokens, fungible tokens built on Stacks. Additionally, Xverse supports buying, selling and trading Bitcoin Ordinals &#8220;NFT&#8221;.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Send and receive BTC</strong></h3>



<p>Both Xverse&#8217;s mobile and desktop apps allow you to buy, send, and receive BTC directly in your wallet. It does this by generating a unique Bitcoin address that is used only for Bitcoin transactions.</p>



<p>If you attempt to use this address for any other purpose, such as sending or receiving STX or Orders, you may lose your crypto along with any other assets that are part of the transaction pandemic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Send and Receive STX</strong></h3>



<p>Likewise, Xverse gives you a unique address to send and receive STX. This address is separate from your BTC address and is only used for STX transactions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Send and Receive Orders</strong></h3>



<p>Although Ordinals live completely on-chain, they utilize a different address than BTC and STX. Hence, Xverse provides you with your own Ordinals-capable wallet address that can be used to buy, send, receive, and store Bitcoin Ordinals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sending and Receiving Stax&#8217;s NFTs</strong></h3>



<p>Your STX NFT address is only used to receive SIP-010 tokens (fungible tokens).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Connect with Dapps</strong></h3>



<p>Using Xverse, you can directly connect to Stacks decentralized applications secured with Bitcoin, Swap tokens with ALEX or Arkadiko, and trade NFT on Gamma or Tradeport in addition to linking to other applications used via several protocols such as Hiro Library, Micro-Stacks, and Wallet Connect.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Security capabilities</h2>



<p>Similar to other popular crypto wallets, Xverse&#8217;s security comes from user-generated passwords and 12-word mnemonic phrases owned by users and unknown to Xverse. Additionally, the mobile app uses a 6-digit PIN and biometric authentication, including FaceID and TouchID, for added security.</p>



<p>In addition, Xverse has partnered with the Least Authority to perform regular security checks to assess which system components may have been compromised and to ensure they are still configured correctly. User assets are still intact and safe.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.xverse.app/download" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.xverse.app/download</a>. If you are a brand new user, you can select &#8220;Create New Wallet.&#8221; If you have an existing Stacks or Bitcoin wallet, you can simply click on &#8220;Restore Wallet&#8221; and enter your seed phrase to restore your wallets.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: Back up your wallet </strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-962.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-962-1024x576.png" alt="Xverse Wallet Review: Connecting Users With Trend Bitcoin Ordinals And More" class="wp-image-188667" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-962-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-962-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-962-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-962-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-962-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-962.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Xverse Wallet Review: Connecting Users With Trend Bitcoin Ordinals And More 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Xverse is a self-custodial wallet, meaning you have 100% control over your assets. It&#8217;s crucial to securely back up your 12-word secret recovery phrase. You will need the phrase to restore your wallet if you switch devices or lose access to your current one. Writing down the phrase offline (ideally engraved on metal) and testing it for accuracy is highly recommended to prevent theft, and storing it in a secure location such as a safety deposit box (or two!) is advisable.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: Choose your preferred security mode</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-963.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-963.png" alt="Xverse Wallet Review: Connecting Users With Trend Bitcoin Ordinals And More" class="wp-image-188668" title="Xverse Wallet Review: Connecting Users With Trend Bitcoin Ordinals And More 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>You can opt to allow Biometric/PIN authentication for easier access. Alternatively you can opt for each transaction requiring your password for higher security.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: Fund your wallet</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Above is our share about what Xverse wallet is, its features, fees as well as its advantages and disadvantages. Especially in light of the explosive trend of collecting or recording Bitcoin Ordinals, you will need a Bitcoin Ordinals wallet like Xverse.</p>



<p>This is a Chrome browser extension and mobile app that allows you to manage your Bitcoin private keys. Xverse is a web3 Bitcoin ecosystem in one place, allowing you to manage BTC and other tokens like STX and interact with decentralized applications. Unlike some wallets, Xverse does not store any user information or has access to your private keys. You retain all power over your crypto identity.</p>



<p>However, there are still specific weaknesses in Xverse, such as being affected by phishing attacks and not being able to convert cryptocurrencies directly to cash in the wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>A proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard ENS and 1INCH to the Ethereum Aave V3 Market is under review.</em></li>



<li><em>Also, on Arbitrum, the Aave community is holding a temperature check vote on the proposal to bring ARB to the V3 market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aave community is conducting ARFC voting on the two proposals of adding <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x637d661f1c720aded816291dd01fb093ae8b1b38c322795fae5ceede876a8015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1INCH</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xd33381a83222b33afa8277f86fae5ee46d4e3455ba09dfc091f626e59ecc29ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ENS</a> to the V3 market on Ethereum. If a consensus is reached and the proposals are refined, ARFC will be submitted for snapshot voting for final approval. Both ballots will close on May 20.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-959.png"><img decoding="async" width="1788" height="1000" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-959.png" alt="Aave Is Proposing ENS And 1INCH Support On Aave V3 Ethereum" class="wp-image-188663" title="Aave Is Proposing ENS And 1INCH Support On Aave V3 Ethereum 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>In addition, the Aave community is conducting a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x058f8e69b69a27495ee9796fc6952326d94eb24fe0071050db166d5d5e1da242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temperature check</a> vote on the proposal of adding ARB to the V3 market on Arbitrum. If the vote is passed, it will enter the ARFC stage. Voting on the proposal will close on May 23.</p>



<p>Since the ENS and 1INCH in the migration plan have a low market cap and trading volume, Chaos Labs, the team driving the effort, has set borrow limitations to account for no more than 1% of the average daily trading activity.</p>



<p>The supply cap was calculated using the supply cap approach and V2 data. They have also updated the IR Slope1 to reflect changes in interest rates over the last few months, as well as the liquidation bonus levels to match current liquidity levels in DEXs.</p>



<p>Support for ARB in Arbitrum v3 pools increases TVL and user experience in the increasingly popular v3 Arbitrum market, as well as income prospects for Aave.</p>



<p>By allowing borrowing, it enables users and institutions to take a distinct stance on this Governance token as the network evolves and a decentralized community emerges. According to the proposal, it also more closely connects the Aave community with Arbitrum and, by extension, Ethereum.</p>



<p>At present, Aave has enabled anonymous voting in the Snapshot voting stage, and it is temporarily unable to check the voting support and opposition rates.</p>



<p>Aave already <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185878-aave-to-launch-its-v3-on-metis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its v3 on the Ethereum layer 2 ecosystem Metis Network after an overwhelming affirmative community vote over the weekend.</p>

<p>Hashkey, which runs one of the city&#8217;s only two legal digital currency exchanges, is in early-stage negotiations to fund $100 million to $200 million. The company is one of numerous locally-based businesses trying to increase their consumer base in an environment that is increasingly liberalizing.</p>



<p>The sale is moving forward, but details such as size and value might change since they haven&#8217;t been completed, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because they were discussing private discussions.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong government is encouraging the growth of the digital asset industry as part of a larger drive to reestablish the city&#8217;s reputation as a cutting-edge financial hub.</p>



<p>On June 1, Hong Kong will implement a new licensing scheme for virtual-asset service providers and will allow individual investors to trade key tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. It contrasts with how regulators across the world are wrestling with how to regulate the business in the aftermath of last year&#8217;s market fall and a series of blowups, including the stunning bankruptcy of the FTX exchange.</p>



<p>To stimulate the local economy, the city will enable retail trading of major currencies on regulated exchanges like Hashkey.</p>



<p>Hashkey and BC Technology Group Co.&#8217;s OSL bourse are now the only two having licenses. OKX and Bitget have announced their intention to seek for a license under Hong Kong&#8217;s new regulatory environment.</p>



<p>This year, Chinese state-run banks have courted crypto firms, one of the numerous indications that Beijing supports the city&#8217;s overarching ambition. This is due in part to the government&#8217;s perception of the financial hub as a test bed for longer-term policy, notwithstanding the mainland&#8217;s prohibition on most types of cryptocurrency activity.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188361-hong-kong-monetary-authority-cbdc-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the start of the e-HKD Pilot Project, which might pave the way for a retail central bank digital currency to be implemented (CBDC). The initiative will work closely with many stakeholders to study e-HKD use cases as well as implementation and design concerns.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188084-greenland-to-expand-crypto-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, a subsidiary of Greenland Holdings intends to apply for a virtual asset license in Hong Kong. Greenland is the first state-owned corporation to express an interest in joining Hong Kong&#8217;s digital trading market, showing that the Hong Kong government&#8217;s efforts to promote the city as a virtual asset trading hub have been successful.</p>

<p>IBEX Mercado, a supplier of Bitcoin Lightning payment services, has announced a new relationship with Grupo Salinas, one of Mexico&#8217;s leading multinational giants.</p>



<p>The new development in Mexico is yet another step toward the top cryptocurrency&#8217;s total institutional acceptance. On top of the underlying blockchain, the Bitcoin Lightning network provides a layer 2 solution. The Lightning network leverages native Bitcoin via micropayment channels to complete transactions more effectively and at a reduced cost.</p>



<p>On stage, IBEX CEO José Lemus introduced the partnership:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“With this partnership, we’re opening the doors to every bitcoin and Lightning company and financial tech company that wants to leverage Lightning technology … [we will be] rolling out new technology with Grupo Salinas that will enable mexicans to pay their groceries with bitcoin, electronics and to receive remittances.” Lemus explained his excitement about the announcement, saying that this is the “tip of the iceberg of what will go on in Mexico.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The news comes only days after Microstrategy creator Michael Saylor disclosed ambitions to use the Bitcoin Lightning Network in the business sphere. The IT business, which is the biggest institutional Bitcoin holder, revealed plans to introduce a product suite for corporate account holders that includes a Bitcoin wallet and a Lightning address.</p>

<p>Total Play, one of the leading internet service providers in North America, incorporated Bitcoin Lightning payments on Thursday. The internet service provider offered a simple payments dashboard that prompts the customer to choose between on-chain Bitcoin payment and BTC Lightning payment.</p>



<p>This might be a big development in the United States neighboring country since widespread Bitcoin adoption could educate people about crypto use cases. Total Play Telecommunications is ranked eighth among the top twenty corporations in Mexico with the most IP allocations, according to the <a href="https://db-ip.com/country/MX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DB-IP</a>.</p>



<p>When on-chain transactions are halted due to technical challenges, the Lightning Network solution may be employed as a stopgap fix. The incorporation of Bitcoin Lightning into Grupo Salinas&#8217; goods and services through IBEX might propel Mexico to the forefront of the digital revolution, offering residents a safe, contemporary, and efficient payment alternative.</p>

<p>When investing in Deepcoin, investors should be aware that the platform charges fees for every trade they place. While this may seem like an inconvenience, it&#8217;s important to understand how the fees are calculated and what they are used for.</p>



<p>First, investors should note that the actual cost of their crypto orders will be reserved as taker fees for the transactions they place. This means that the fee is based on the value of the order itself, and is not a separate charge on top of the trade.</p>



<p>Additionally, investors will need to pay a transaction fee after the execution of the order. This fee is calculated based on the actual specific price of the transactions, using the formula:</p>



<p>Trading Fee = Contract Face Value * Trading Fee Rate/ Order Price</p>



<p>Order Value = Contract Face Value * Contract Size / Order Price</p>



<p>By understanding this formula, investors can get a better idea of how much they will be charged for each transaction, and can make more informed decisions about their investments.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that the taker fee for Deepcoin is currently set at 0.06 percent, while the maker fee is 0.04 percent. While these fees may seem small, they can add up over time, so investors should be sure to factor them into their investment strategy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Deepcoin Payment Methods</h2>



<p>The site provides multiple options for investors to deposit and withdraw funds. Users can choose between using wallets or fiat gateway to deposit funds. If an investor opts to use a fiat gateway, the platform currently supports Visa and Mastercard payment methods for both deposits and withdrawals. On the other hand, if the investor already holds digital currencies, they can deposit or withdraw crypto coins using the wallet and the site. It&#8217;s important to note that these transactions will only take place through the bitcoin mobile app for the fiat gateway.</p>



<p>For users who prefer to deposit cryptos using the crypto app and the website, they can create a Deepcoin wallet account. By doing so, they gain access to the platform&#8217;s cryptocurrency wallets, which can be explored through the official convenient mobile support app functionality. Users can easily follow the guides provided to make secure and protected investments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Deepcoin Mobile Support</h2>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in mobile trading activity recently. With the convenience of smartphones, many traders have found it easier to perform trading activities on-the-go. This trend has been noticed by many investors, who are now using their smartphones for a variety of tasks, such as merging leverage, adjusting leverage, monitoring split position margins, depositing regular cash, splitting leverages, and marking entry points.</p>



<p>Deepcoin, one of the leading blockchain platforms, has taken note of this trend and developed a dedicated trading platform for mobile devices. This allows investors to access all the functionalities and features of the platform through the app. Whether they are using iOS or Android, investors can download the mobile app and view the trading chart of the derivatives market, review inverse perpetual contracts, access deposit methods, contact mobile support, set take profit, assess risk appetite, deposit fiat on-ramps, and access the resources page for their own research.</p>



<p>Not only are individual investors taking advantage of the convenience of mobile trading, but many US investors and bitcoin companies are also investing in desktop and mobile apps to manage tokens, transfer funds, assess futures and liquidity processes, control asset management deals, and provide tips to other investors. The popularity of these apps has spread across the globe, with investors across different parts of the world, such as Singapore, the USA, and the UK, taking advantage of the ease and accessibility of mobile trading.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CBDC systems that operate on several networks may be utilized for cross-border and cross-currency payments.</em></li>



<li><em>The paper by the New York Federal Reserve and the MAS focuses on the technical challenges of CBDCs.</em></li>



<li><em>For all test situations, settlement took less than thirty seconds.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Project Cedar Phase II and Project Ubin+ (Cedar x Ubin+), according to a <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/nyfed-and-mas-publish-results-of-joint-wholesale-cross-border-payments-research-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the New York Federal Reserve, have achieved headway in cross-border real-time settlements using central bank digital currencies (CBDC).</strong></h5>

<p>According to the report, the various teams were able to perform cross-border transactions with near real-time settlement finality across distinctly distributed ledger (DLT) and hashed timelock contract (HTLC) technology stacks.</p>



<p>The New York Federal Reserve&#8217;s New York Innovation Centre&#8217;s Project Cedar and the MAS&#8217;s Project Ubin+ stated on May 19 that they investigated a cross-border multi-currency use case in which vehicle (or bridge) currencies are used as a bridge to exchange currency pairings that are not frequently traded.</p>



<p>According to a footnote in the paper, the research focused on technical difficulties and did not represent any choice to install CBDCs or the underlying tech stacks anyplace in particular.</p>



<p>The experiment&#8217;s efficiency allowed cross-border payments to be completed simultaneously (atomic settlement) and in near-real time, as well as interoperability and autonomy across distinct central bank currency ledgers.</p>



<p>Cedar x Ubin+ investigated the capacity of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to link at least three simulated currency ledgers, minimize settlement risk, and shorten settlement time. The teams made use of replicated CBDCs and fictitious payments.</p>

<p>According to Michelle Neal, Chief of the Markets Group at the New York Fed:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Cross-border payments are a major railway for facilitating the functioning of the global economy. Our research collaboration with the MAS reveals key opportunities for central bank innovation to play an important role in easing wholesale payment flows globally and improving settlement outcomes.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the study, the researchers constructed eight distinct scenarios to test their interoperability hypothesis. All deals resolved almost 6.5 payments per second on average, with a high of 47 payments per second, according to the atomic settlement testing.</p>



<p>Settlement occurred in less than thirty seconds for all test cases (normally, settlement takes roughly two days), including payment chains needing multiple cross-ledger currency swaps.</p>



<p>The paper proved that interoperability may be achieved across ledgers with varying technological architectures. Atomic settlement (simultaneous settlement) was achieved by making the ability of each member of the payment chain to claim their respective funds conditional on the ability of all participants to claim their respective funds, significantly reducing the counterparty risk associated with a given transaction.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Office of the New York Attorney General revealed that it had taken action against crypto company Coin Cafe for its unfair business practices. </strong></h5>

<p>Coin Cafe was charging its users extremely high fees, which the company failed to adequately inform them about. The company advertised its wallet service as free, but charged tens of thousands of dollars in fees to its New York residents. The agency found that certain user account balances were completely depleted as a result of these fees.</p>



<p>Coin Cafe changed its fee structure four times, and in October 2022, it introduced an exorbitant fee increase. The company began to charge users the greater of 7.99% or $99 per month if they did not transact crypto over a 30-day period. As a result of its actions, Coin Cafe surrendered $4.3 million to the agency.</p>



<p>While Coin Cafe successfully obtained the state&#8217;s BitLicense in 2023, it continued to charge its users high fees even after obtaining the license. In addition, the company failed to register with the New York Attorney General&#8217;s office, which it should have done to comply with regulations.</p>



<p>Coin Cafe will now pay restitution to investors, including $508,000 to 340 individuals in the state of New York. The company will continue to operate but must limit its monthly fees to 0.002% and must adequately inform its users of all fees.</p>



<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James called out Coin Cafe&#8217;s practices and stated that this case is &#8220;another example of why the cryptocurrency industry needs to be better regulated.&#8221; This announcement also mentioned recently proposed crypto-specific regulation from James that could lead to further enforcement.</p>

<p>Kumar emphasized that cryptocurrencies still allow illicit financial transactions to occur around the world, and that this poses a major challenge to global financial security.</p>



<p>As the G7 prepares to discuss various agenda items for the year, including the regulation of cryptocurrencies and the overall industry, Kumar has called for &#8220;concerted global action&#8221; to ensure that no &#8220;safe haven&#8221; can exist in the financial system of the world for such transactions. The FATF is currently working on &#8220;multiple fronts&#8221; to help countries combat &#8220;digital financial flows&#8221; that are &#8220;fueling crime and terrorism.&#8221;</p>



<p>The FATF has updated its Recommendations, the global standards on combatting money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing, to include crypto-assets and related financial activity. However, Kumar has expressed concern over the relatively poor progress made by countries in implementing these new standards as part of the Recommendations. As of 2019, only 27% of countries were compliant with the updated standards that include crypto, while the remaining majority of 73% are completely or partially non-compliant and have yet to begin work on supervising the crypto industry.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FATF-Chief-Demands-Action-Against-Crypto-Anarchy-1-1.webp"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FATF-Chief-Demands-Action-Against-Crypto-Anarchy-1-1-1024x683.webp" alt="FATF Chief Demands Action Against Crypto Anarchy 1 1" class="wp-image-188614" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FATF-Chief-Demands-Action-Against-Crypto-Anarchy-1-1-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FATF-Chief-Demands-Action-Against-Crypto-Anarchy-1-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FATF-Chief-Demands-Action-Against-Crypto-Anarchy-1-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FATF-Chief-Demands-Action-Against-Crypto-Anarchy-1-1-750x500.webp 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FATF-Chief-Demands-Action-Against-Crypto-Anarchy-1-1-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FATF-Chief-Demands-Action-Against-Crypto-Anarchy-1-1.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="FATF Chief Demands Action Against Crypto Anarchy 44"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To address this issue, Kumar recommends that countries focus on two areas to ensure cryptocurrencies cannot be used for illicit financial transactions. The first area is ensuring transparency of beneficial ownership, which is &#8220;crucial in fighting money laundering, corruption, tax evasion, and sanctions evasion.&#8221; The second area is recovering the proceeds of crimes. Kumar wrote that asset recovery helps strengthen trust in law enforcement as it helps victims directly and is an &#8220;effective&#8221; method of stopping economic crimes. However, countries have barely done any work on asset recovery and only a small fraction of the global illicit financial flows are ever recovered.</p>



<p>Moreover, Kumar believes that many countries do not have the experience to tackle illicit financial flows when they become digital. To address this challenge, the FATF intends to roll out a new program which will include the so-called &#8220;travel rule&#8221; to help them adapt. The travel rule will mandate virtual asset service providers like exchanges to pass along information to one another and supervisory bodies for crypto transactions that cross a certain threshold. This will help ensure that countries have the necessary tools to combat illicit financial flows in the digital age.</p>



<p>Kumar&#8217;s letter highlights the need for a concerted global effort to regulate the crypto industry and prevent illicit financial flows. While progress has been made in updating the FATF&#8217;s Recommendations to include crypto, more work needs to be done to ensure that these standards are implemented by countries. By focusing on transparency of beneficial ownership and asset recovery, countries can help prevent illicit financial flows and strengthen trust in law enforcement. The FATF&#8217;s new program, which includes the travel rule, will also help countries adapt to the new digital landscape and combat financial crime effectively.</p>

<p>The lobbying group issued a warning that failure to act could enable &#8220;adversarial nations&#8221; to further their activities in the space that could &#8220;endanger U.S. leadership and dollar primacy.&#8221; It cited China as an example of such adversarial action, pointing out that China has developed an internationally focused Blockchain-based Services Network (BSN) to &#8220;incorporate global development and trade and fill the U.S.-created vacuum.&#8221;</p>



<p>It also mentioned that a growing number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, France, Brazil, and India, are considering or choosing to trade with China directly in yuan, which could lead to a decrease in the use of the U.S. dollar.</p>

<p>The lobbying group concluded that regulatory and legal opacity in the U.S. is &#8220;hampering the nation&#8217;s ability to lead and take advantage of this innovation revolution,&#8221; and that &#8220;this abdication is severely hampering domestic development and ceding advantages to other nations at the expense of the U.S. innovator and investor.&#8221;</p>



<p>In light of this urgent need for a regulatory framework, the Chamber of Digital Commerce has proposed the creation of a &#8220;Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Solarium Commission.&#8221; The proposed commission&#8217;s name references Project Solarium, created in the wake of World War II and the dawning of the Cold War by President Eisenhower to counter the threat of Soviet expansion.</p>



<p>The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, created in 2019, was established to develop a strategic approach to defend against cyber attacks. The crypto advocacy group is calling for a similar strategy on digital assets and blockchain technology, which &#8220;desperately needs consensus in the wake of other nations&#8217; advances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Founded in 2014, the Chamber of Digital Commerce is an American advocacy group that promotes emerging technologies in the blockchain sector. On May 19, the group backed Senator Tom Emmer&#8217;s introduction of the Securities Clarity Act, which aims to provide much-needed regulatory clarity for the crypto asset and blockchain industry in the U.S.</p>



<p>Securities and Exchange Commission remains adamant that the existing rules that were formed decades ago still apply to this new form of digital finance and its underlying technology. The call for a regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. is becoming increasingly urgent, as other countries continue to make strides in the space and threaten to leave the U.S. behind in this innovative and rapidly developing field.</p>
