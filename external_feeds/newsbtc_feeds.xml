					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) has seen some pretty tragic price action in the last couple of months, which has dragged its price down toward two-year lows. It still continues to maintain this downtrend and is barely moving, just like the rest of the crypto market, but some developments among large ADA investors could see some bullish momentum for the digital asset. Cardano Whales Begin Accumulating In New Year Toward the end of 2022 when momentum in the crypt market was dropping, there had been some selling from large ADA investors. This was not out of the ordinary as the holidays have historically triggered selling and profit-taking.  Related Reading: MATIC Holders Suffer Massive Losses, Here’s How Many Wallets Are In The Red Cardano whales had sold over 569 million ADA during this time. The result was more selling pressure on the digital asset that dragged its price down below $0.25, making its lowest price point since early 2021. As Santiment notes, this saw the total holdings of investors holding between 1 million and 100 million ADA on their balances drop drastically just as 2022 drew to a close. ADA whales increase holdings &#124; Source: Santiment However, this investor class seems to have entered the new year with renewed vigor as they have already begun buying back the tokens they had dumped. The report shows that in the first five days of 2023, these large investors have already added more than 217 million ADA to their stash. This brought the percentage of supply that they now hold back up to the 57.22% level, not the highest it’s ever been, but certainly an encouraging figure. ADA Enjoys The Spoils Of Accumulation The price of ADA is already reacting to the number of coins that these Cardano whales are buying. Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has jumped back into the green, and its price has already moved above $0.27 once more.

A continuation of the accumulation trend could possibly lead to a much larger break out for the digital asset, especially now that investor sentiment is doing much better.

ADA price trading at $0.26 &#124; Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com Perhaps more important is the fact that the bulls are already mounting support at the $0.26 level. The successful switch from a resistance point to a support point also shows the determination of the bulls to continue the uptrend. However, there is still the threat of bears dragging down the price of the digital asset, especially with trading volume not growing as expected. Another fall below $0.25 will likely end up putting ADA’s price at pre-2021 levels.

					<description><![CDATA[In its latest quarterly update, Grayscale announced the rebalancing of funds for the fourth quarter of 2022. As part of the rebalancing, Grayscale sold off a certain amount of its Digital Large Cap Fund and dumped its held tokens, including Avalanche Network token AVAX.   AVAX has slipped by 2% following the sell-off in the past 24 hours. According to Grayscale, the sold-off AVAX tokens were replaced with the purchase of the existing fund components in proportion to their respective weightings. Grayscale Purchased And Existing Tokens The AVAX sell-off was only part of the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. In its CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index and Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund portfolio rebalancing, the company sold off Algorand native token ALGO. In its CoinDesk DeFi Select Index methodology, Grayscale adjusted its DeFi Fund’s portfolio and purchased Synthetix (SNX) after selling some existing assets.  Related Reading: Grayscale Says It May Return 20% Of Investor Capital, Bitcoin Refuses To Budge As of now, the Grayscale portfolio fund now includes 65% Bitcoin (BTC), 30% Ethereum (ETH), 1.86% Cardano (ADA), 1.39% Polygon (MATIC), and 1% Solana (SOL). Meanwhile, its DeFi Fund’s Fund Components include  65.05% Uniswap (UNI), 12.39% Aave (AAVE), 8.15% MakerDAO (MKR), 6.02% Synthetix (SNX), 4.58% Curve DAO Token (CRV), and 3.81% Compound (COMP).  Since July, Grayscale has been carefully monitoring the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index. The index launched in April tracks the market capitalization-loaded performance of “the largest and most liquid digital assets.” During Grayscale usage of the Index, the quarterly scheduled rebalancing resulted in the dumping of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), and more Uniswap (UNI) purchases. AVAX Slips After Grayscale Dumped Before the sell-off, AVAX was still sitting at a $12 zone; however, after Grayscale dumped its holdings, the AVAX token dropped by 2% and traded at $11.39 Friday morning.  AVAX has appreciated over the past months. It has surged from around $9 to $13. Notably, Grayscale fund’s portfolio, which currently has $163 million in assets under management (AUM), only held a small portion of AVAX tokens. As of September 30, AVAX made up less than 1% of the company’s fund’s assets, according to its previous quarterly report. Related Reading: Avalanche: Will 2023 Bring A Fruitful Recovery For The AVAX Ecosystem? There was no significant move from ALGO, which was also removed from the Grayscale portfolio fund. It fell from a range of $0.17 to $0.15. As of the time of writing, ALGO currently trades at $11.73 with a 24-hour trading volume of $45 million.  On the other hand, AVAX seems to be gaining momentum to the upside at the time of writing as it has already formed a retracement; a reversal is likely to happen. AVAX currently trades at $11.73, down by 0.8% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $125 million over the same period.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market is still recording the swings of the prevailing crypto winter, especially XRP. Most of the assets have not been impressive in their price movements. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the crypto market has pushed the cumulative market cap to around $812.00 billion. This indicated a drop of 0.88% over the past 24 hours. With the declining market trend, XRP stands among the assets that have lost value. The price dip has attracted crypto whales. They have moved millions of XRP tokens to different crypto exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Falls, Is It A Wise Idea To Short? Whales Show Interest In XRP According to WhaleAlert, an on-chain data provider, there have been several transactions involving XRP. It recorded that crypto whales have transferred about 385 million XRP to crypto exchanges within 24 hours. The cumulative tokens are worth almost $131 million in the current market prices. The data provider noted that besides the most significant single transaction, many whales had moved about 70 million XRP tokens to several crypto exchanges. The value is worth about $25.6 million. The report indicated that most transfer transactions were on Bitstamp, costing $10.1 million. In addition, one of the whales moved XRP tokens worth about $11.8 million to the Bitso crypto exchange. Also, an unknown crypto whale is reported to have purchased up to 35.1 million XRP tokens. The transaction occurred during this present XRP price dip through the Bitso exchange. As a result, the whale accumulated Ripple tokens worth about $11.8 million. Notably, the largest single transaction from a whale, as recorded by the data provider, involved a transfer of over 280 million XRP tokens. The tokens are worth almost $95.4 million.

Instead, XRP has dropped by almost 12% over the past 30 days. During today&#8217;s early trading hours, XRP dipped by 3%. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $0.3364. Also, XRP recorded about $691.2 million as its trading volume over the past 24 hours. Its market cap now sits at $16.93 billion, keeping the token at the 6th position in the CoinMarketCap ranking of crypto assets. The price trend for XRP still has some elements of instability and uncertainty. Recall that over the past three days, XRP indicated slight volatility as the price climbed to around $0.35. The coin showed a considerable presence of the bulls through its price movement. However, XRP still couldn&#8217;t sustain the reclaimed value as the token fell to the $0.33 level. A recent report disclosed that Ripple&#8217;s case with SEC might still last longer. Seven days ago, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse estimated that the lawsuit might run for 3 to 4 months more but should end in Q1 of 2023.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange depositing transactions are now at a 4-year low, indicating that the bottom may be here. Bitcoin 30-Day MA Exchange Depositing Transactions Have Declined As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the metric&#8217;s current levels are the same as in Q1 2019. The &#8220;exchange depositing transactions&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total number of Bitcoin transfers that are headed toward centralized exchanges. The difference between this metric and the more popular exchange inflow is that the latter indicator tells us the total amount of BTC being deposited to exchanges, that is, the combined sum of the value of each transaction going to exchanges (rather than their total number), which is a value that can be inflated by a few whales and are thus not representative of the trend being followed by the entire market (especially the retail investors). But since the exchange depositing transactions only focus on the pure number of individual transfers taking place rather than their amounts, the metric could give a more accurate picture regarding whether the average investor is sending coins to exchanges or not at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Large Dormant Supply On The Move Since one of the main reasons holders deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, a high value of this indicator can have bearish implications for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, low values imply not many investors are applying selling pressure right now. The below chart shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin exchange depositing transactions over the last several years: The 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have been pretty low in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin exchange depositing transactions have declined for quite a while and have recently hit pretty low values. The current levels are the lowest the indicator has observed since Q1 2019, four years ago.

This means that the appetite for depositing coins to exchanges, and thus for selling BTC, is at historically low levels.

However, the quant in the post also notes that the bottoming process being possibly here doesn&#8217;t discount the possibility that there could still be a final downward push left for Bitcoin.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has struggled below $17,000 for multiple weeks now, and it recently dipped below the $16,900 mark. This downward move on the Bitcoin chart could be attributed to the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. The minutes of the meetings revealed that the Federal Reserve System would stick with higher interest rates for the foreseeable future. This has evidently sent ripples through the market, causing participants to react negatively. The technical outlook of the asset has reflected a fall in accumulation, but indicators are still positive about the Bitcoin price over the upcoming trading sessions. From the daily chart, it can be inferred that BTC will make a recovery in the next trading sessions. Bitcoin continues to hold itself steady above the $16,600 price mark. Currently, the price of the asset is consolidated, with major altcoins following the same price trajectory. Over the last 24 hours, BTC slipped 0.6%. The Bitcoin price at the moment is trading at a 76% discount from its all-time high of 2021. The market capitalization of Bitcoin decreased slightly, indicating that sellers outnumbered buyers at press time. Related Reading: Binance Acquisition Moves See BNB Riding A Wave of Enthusiasm Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $16,700 at the time of writing. The coin recently lost the $16,800 support level; however, this is extremely short-term as BTC will soon initiate recovery on the chart. A slight push from the buyers will help BTC propel itself above the $16,800 mark, which indicates that the overhead resistance for the coin stood at $16,900. Clearing the $16,900 price mark will pave the way up to $17,000. On the other hand, if demand doesn&#8217;t show up immediately, BTC could retrace further to sit at $16,600 before it starts to move northward again. The amount of BTC traded in the last session declined to indicate slight bearishness. Technical Analysis Despite a fall in the number of buyers, the technical outlook has managed to remain positive for Bitcoin price. The Relative Strength Index noted a downtick, which indicated that buyers were slowly exiting the market. On the other hand, however, Bitcoin has displayed a positive sign on the daily chart.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin price has struggled below $17,000 for multiple weeks now, and it recently dipped below the $16,900 mark. This downward move on the Bitcoin chart could be attributed to the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes.</p>
<p>The minutes of the meetings revealed that the Federal Reserve System would stick with higher interest rates for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>This has evidently sent ripples through the market, causing participants to react negatively. The technical outlook of the asset has reflected a fall in accumulation, but indicators are still positive about the Bitcoin price over the upcoming trading sessions. From the daily chart, it can be inferred that BTC will make a recovery in the next trading sessions.</p>
<p>Bitcoin continues to hold itself steady above the $16,600 price mark. Currently, the price of the asset is consolidated, with major altcoins following the same price trajectory. Over the last 24 hours, BTC slipped 0.6%. The Bitcoin price at the moment is trading at a 76% discount from its all-time high of 2021. The market capitalization of Bitcoin decreased slightly, indicating that sellers outnumbered buyers at press time.</p>

<p>BTC was trading at $16,700 at the time of writing. The coin recently lost the $16,800 support level; however, this is extremely short-term as BTC will soon initiate recovery on the chart.</p>
<p>A slight push from the buyers will help BTC propel itself above the $16,800 mark, which indicates that the overhead resistance for the coin stood at $16,900.</p>
<p>Clearing the $16,900 price mark will pave the way up to $17,000. On the other hand, if demand doesn&#8217;t show up immediately, BTC could retrace further to sit at $16,600 before it starts to move northward again. The amount of BTC traded in the last session declined to indicate slight bearishness.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Solana-based BONK has been all the craze since the start of the new year. The meme coin had risen from obscurity to the largest meme coin on the Solana ecosystem in less than two weeks, recording massive gains for investors during this time. However, the hype seems to have reached its peak and BONK has begun the dreaded downward correction. BONK Falls 50% In 24 Hours In the last day, the price of BONK  has rapidly declined, losing more than 50% of its value during this time. It hit its all-time high price of $0.0000049 on Thursday when the hype was at its peak but since then, has fallen to $0.000002.

This was after recording a more than 4,000% return rate in a 10-day period and reaching a market cap of over $200 million. However, as is the case with meme coins, holding on to such gains becomes impossible with no real utility and eventually, the sell-offs dragged its price back down. Being a digital currency driven by purely social sentiment, this was expected to happen, just like it did with predecessors such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. This drawdown in price has also seen the price surge recorded in Solana over the last week slow down significantly.

With a downturn such as this, BONK could be seeing the start of the end just like Shiba Inu had done in October 2021. As such, it could be wise to get out of the cryptocurrency now if the losses were to continue for the next few days. But it is also important to take into account the growth of the meme coin, as well as the attention it is receiving in the market. For example, BONK remains one of the most visited pages on Coinmarketcap. It is second only to RichQUACK, another meme coin that has not done well in the last week. What this shows is that there are still a lot of eyes on the cryptocurrency, which could give it a leg up.

Now, this is only at the peak of the hype and does not mean that the meme coin would be able to sustain such levels but is important to note nonetheless. Transactions surpass Ethereum &#124; Source: Twitter However, it is essential to remember that when a digital asset falls 50%, it would need to see a 100% increase to get back to its previous price, which can be a hard feat to accomplish for a meme coin. In the end, investors should keep in mind that meme coins are more volatile than the average large-cap cryptocurrency.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin keeps moving with no clear direction in the first week of 2023. Following a rejection from a critical resistance zone, the cryptocurrency returned to its range and could be gearing up for a re-test of support.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Falls, Is It A Wise Idea To Short? In the meantime, altcoins are blooming, with many recording profits on high timeframes. As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $16,700 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, BTC records similar price action.  BTC In The Short Term, What&#8217;s Driving The Price Action? Bitcoin is reacting to macroeconomic developments and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy in the short term. As NewsBTC reported yesterday, investors are hesitant to trade in any direction due to uncertainty around global markets. The situation is likely to persist during January. Today the U.S. released new economic data, but with &#8220;mixed&#8221; results, according to a pseudonym analyst:  Economic Data a bit mixed. More jobs than expected but lower hourly earnings which is the second most important number I&#8217;d say. The matter in which the market will digest this is the most telling factor in my opinion. The unemployment rate in the United States printed 3.5% for December 2022, which came much lower than the market expected. The Fed uses this metric to gauge the efficacy of its monetary policy.  The higher unemployment, the more they can tame inflation, but the U.S. job market has been resilient and has remained strong despite the Fed&#8217;s intentions. In that sense, Bitcoin and risk-on assets reacted with small losses.  The lower-than-expected results in unemployment provide room for the Fed to continue tightening. However, the risk of an economic recession increases as the financial institution pushes on to bring down inflation.  Bitcoin Will Make It During A Recession? In a recessionary economic scenario, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategy, Mike McGlone, believes Bitcoin will thrive. The analyst is bullish on BTC for the long term but shared some reservations about its immediate future.  McGlone expects Bitcoin to revisit critical support at around $10,000 to $12,000 in an economic recession. This massive crash will ripple across the nascent industry and operate as the final catalyzer for another rally. The analyst said: The rising potential for a severe global economic slowdown may be a top crypto performance factor in 20222. Out bias is that Bitcoin is more likely to come out ahead in most scenarios (…).

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has been making a slight recovery on its chart. Although the coin has been consolidating over the past few weeks, BTC has been attempting to make an upward movement. Over the last 24 hours, the coin has registered a 0.6% appreciation. Looking at the weekly progress, BTC has been stuck between two price levels of $16,400 and $16,900, respectively. Going by the technical outlook, the coin has depicted positive sentiments, with buyers slowly returning to the market. It also formed a bullish pattern on the daily chart, which meant that the price might encounter a recovery over the upcoming trading sessions. The accumulation showed up on the chart, which meant that the coin was experiencing demand over the past trading sessions.
