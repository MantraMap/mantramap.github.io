			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Depot will trade under the ticker symbol "BTM" after a SPAC merger.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Depot &#8211; a US-based Bitcoin ATM provider &#8211; announced it will start trading on Nasdaq on July 3 after partnering with the fintech company GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Previous reports revealed that the agreement between the two entities is worth $885 million. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216;BTM&#8217; Pops up on Nasdaq</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The partners <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/30/2698079/0/en/Bitcoin-Depot-and-GSR-II-Meteora-Acquisition-Corp-Announce-Closing-of-Business-Combination.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">announced</a> the finalization of the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger. The combined organization will be renamed Bitcoin Depot Inc. and will be run by the current management team. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The common stock should begin trading on July 3, 2023, under the Nasdaq ticker symbol &#8220;BTM.&#8221; The public warrant is scheduled for the same day with the abbreviation &#8220;BTMWW.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brandon Mintz &#8211; CEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot &#8211; described the move as &#8220;an important milestone and an incredibly proud moment&#8221; for the entire team. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Bitcoin Depot is well positioned with the largest market share in North America, and the additional capital from this transaction will help support our numerous growth opportunities while advancing our mission to safely, securely bring Bitcoin to the masses,&#8221; he added.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gus Garcia &#8211; Co-CEO and Director of GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. &#8211; said his entity is &#8220;excited&#8221; to support Bitcoin Depot&#8217;s expansion path. He believes the latter is &#8220;poised to continue its momentum to take advantage of the highly fragmented Bitcoin ATM market&#8221; in the USA and abroad.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thus, Bitcoin Depot adds up to the growing list of crypto-related companies that started trading on the online global marketplace &#8211; Nasdaq. Others include the popular exchange Coinbase, the cryptocurrency miners Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain, and more. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Depot&#8217;s Issues in Texas</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The BTC ATM operator recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-scam-in-texas-led-to-lawsuit-between-a-bitcoin-atm-operator-and-a-local-sheriff-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a lawsuit against the sheriff&#8217;s office of McLennan County, Texas, claiming the latter unlawfully confiscated $15,000 from one of its machines. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities seized the amount from a Bitcoin ATM in Waco after scammers lured an 82-year-old woman to deposit it there. Sheriff Parnell McNamara said the money belonged to the victim, adding that the company &#8220;can go to hell.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The $15,000 she put in the machine was still in the wallet that she had put it in. So we retrieved that $15,000 and brought it back to the office. We photographed it, put it into evidence, and ultimately got it back to the victim so she wouldn&#8217;t be further traumatized by these creeps,&#8221; he explained.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The firm argued that the sheriff&#8217;s office had the jurisdiction to seize the funds but not return them to the person. The lawsuit also outlines that Bitcoin Depot was not the fraudster, meaning they should not be blamed for the woman&#8217;s actions.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The MAS will also supposedly prohibit domestic cryptocurrency organizations from offering staking and lending services to retail investors.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will reportedly insist that cryptocurrency firms keep clients&#8217; assets in a designated trust by the end of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The step comes several months after the infamous meltdown of FTX, which triggered colossal investor losses. Numerous individuals and entities have blamed the exchange for comingling user funds and scamming customers. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The New Requirements</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/singapore-tells-crypto-platforms-to-keep-client-money-in-a-trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Bloomberg, the Singaporean regulator will enforce the obligation to grant maximum customer protection.</span></p>
<p>Apart from storing users&#8217; assets in a trust, crypto organizations might be banned from providing lending and staking services to retail investors. It is worth noting that Thailand&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also <a href="https://www.sec.or.th/TH/Pages/News_Detail.aspx?SECID=10018" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">taken</a> a similar measure.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The MAS started contemplating those rules in October 2022, a month before<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal"> the collapse of FTX</a>, which shocked the entire industry. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Singapore has recently emerged as a flourishing crypto region, whilst its regulatory framework has attracted multiple firms. The cryptocurrency exchange Gemini </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/gemini-to-increase-headcount-above-100-in-singapore-amid-hostile-us-regulatory-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> last month that it will increase its workforce in the city-state by over 100 members. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For his part, Stuart Alderoty &#8211; Chief Legal Officer at Ripple &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-clo-praises-singapores-regulatory-framework-amid-us-sec-turmoil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">highlighted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Singapore&#8217;s approach towards the sector, saying it has established a &#8220;workable framework that truly unites consumer protection, market integrity, and innovation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His comments came shortly after Ripple </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">obtained</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> an in-principle payments license from the MAS. Recall that the enterprise blockchain provider has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-the-case-so-far-and-whats-next-for-the-xrp-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a long-going spat</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the SEC in the United States. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto Adoption in Singapore Spikes</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Providing additional security to Singaporean crypto participants sounds reasonable, considering the rising number of locals that have recently joined the ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Independent Reserve </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/over-40-of-singaporeans-own-crypto-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in one of its surveys that 43% of Singapore&#8217;s residents hold some amount of digital assets (a level unseen since the 2021 bull market). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">54% have hopped on the bandwagon to diversify their portfolios, whereas half of the investors who purchased cryptocurrencies in the last year did so following advice from family members, friends, or influenced by social media. Bitcoin is the most popular digital asset in Singapore, with 87% aware of it. Ethereum is second with 51%.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The rising popularity of altcoins shows that more Singaporeans are beginning to gain more awareness about other cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is a promising sign for the industry as more investors gain exposure to various types of blockchains and projects that have innovative utility and potential to be adopted more widely for real-world applications and use cases,&#8221; Lasanka Perera – CEO of Independent Reserve Singapore – said.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Mere days after Coinbase went on the attack, Bittrex followed suit.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Coinbase filed to dismiss the charges brought against it by the SEC. Motivating its approach, the exchange accused the agency of overreach, stating that crypto assets may not even come under their purview.</p>
<p>The leading US crypto exchange also accused the SEC of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-files-request-for-dismissal-of-charges/" data-wpel-link="internal">ignoring</a> prior approvals given for the sale of some of the digital assets named in its lawsuit.</p>
<p>Emboldened by Coinbase’s move, Bittrex has decided to follow suit.</p>
<h2>Lawsuits and Bankruptcies</h2>
<p>Although Bittrex is also in court due to bankruptcy procedures, the motion filing for dismissal of charges pertains to a different lawsuit, filed shortly after the company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bittrex-receives-wells-notice-from-sec-for-violating-investor-protection-laws/" data-wpel-link="internal">decided</a> to leave America behind. At that point, it had already been under investigation since 2017 and had been in fruitless talks with the SEC since 2022.</p>
<p>In the end, a Wells notice, followed by a full-blown lawsuit, was filed against Bittrex for listing unregistered securities. However, the firm has now hit back at the SEC, stating that the crypto assets they were sued over are not securities at all.</p>
<h2>Publicly Traded Crypto Assets Misclassified as Securities</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.321164/gov.uscourts.wawd.321164.40.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">court documents</a>, Bittrex argued that although crypto assets may be considered securities when they launch, they change their status once they are traded on secondary markets. As such, these crypto assets should be classified as commodities.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Tokens are not a new kind of security; they are different in kind from anything the Commission has ever considered a security. They bear far more resemblance to commodities or property than to the “investments” that were the focus of “Congress’ purpose in enacting the securities laws.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Bittrex’s legal team argued that even if the court were to find that said crypto assets do, in fact, qualify as securities, the SEC has no right to attempt to regulate them since US Congress has not authorized the agency to do so.</p>
<p>Bittrex’s legal team has likened the SEC trying to control crypto assets to the FDA’s attempt to control tobacco or the EPA’s experiment to regulate greenhouse gases, both considered as government agency overreach.</p>
<p>In closing, Bittrex’s legal counsel also pointed to a 2021 <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/chrg/CHRG-117hhrg44837/CHRG-117hhrg44837.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">declaration</a> by Gary Gensler himself, in which he admitted to Congress that the SEC has no legal framework for cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Whether Coinbase and Bittrex will have any success with these attempts is up for debate – nevertheless, they are clearly indicative of the growing frustration with spur-of-the-moment regulation attempts from the SEC, who seem to prefer lawsuits over good-faith attempts at breaching the gap with crypto platforms.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto markets may have renewed momentum but the same has not happened on the NFT scene as leading collections remain way down from their peaks.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have not recovered anywhere near the levels that crypto markets have. Even the largest collections in the industry, such as Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club, are heavily discounted.</p>
<p>On July 3, Reflexivity Research co-founder Will Clemente revealed that BAYC was down 90% from its all-time high. Floor prices for the Ape-themed NFTs have slumped over the past few days, falling 23% over the last week.</p>
<p><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub/analytics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to NFT marketplace OpenSea, the floor price for the collection is now just below 30 ETH, or around $58,440. This sounds a lot, but it is the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bayc-floor-price-crashes-to-67-eth-lowest-in-8-months/" data-wpel-link="internal">lowest</a> it has been in over a year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>NFT Activity Slump</h2>
<p>However, BAYC remains one of the most popular collections to be traded. According to CryptoSlam, BAYC is the largest one by 30-day trade volume which is reported as $48.8 million in sales.</p>
<p>In May, <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nft-traders-sell-bayc-below-floor-price-to-buy-pepe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that NFT traders were selling BAYC below floor prices to buy PEPE memecoins.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a cyber-thief known as “Fake_Phishing182232” manage to pilfer two Apes late last week worth around 70 ETH. On July 1, Peckshield alerted users about the theft of BAYC #8177 and #2330, which were quickly sold by the hacker.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>BAYC is not the only NFT collection to see a slump in floor prices.</p>
<p>According to CoinGecko, NFTs from the Azuki collection have dumped in floor price over the weekend. A massive 63.6% decline of 15.4 ETH to current floor prices of 5.6 ETH has happened on Azuki NFTs over the past week.</p>
<p>Azukis is currently embroiled in an internal battle between the project’s DAO and its founder known as “Zagabond.”</p>
<p>CoinGecko is currently <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">reporting</a> major 24-hour floor price slumps for several prominent NFT collections. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, DeGods, and Elemental have all seen 15-20% declines over the past 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Crypto Markets Remain Buoyant</h2>
<p>Contrary to what is going on in the NFT space, cryptocurrency markets remain buoyant during the Monday morning Asian trading session.</p>
<p>Total capitalization is up 1.1% on the day to $1.25 trillion as BTC and ETH hold on to gains made in June.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bayc-floor-price-crashes-to-67-eth-lowest-in-8-months/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> has remained in consolidation, so markets are currently being driven by the altcoins such as Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Avalanche.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NFTs continue to attract not only more users but also capture the eyes of fraudulent entities. Web3 threat actors have set their sights on digital collectibles, with millions of funds being lost through different scams and attacks.</p>
<p>A new report suggested that such thefts in the NFT space declined in June but remain rampant.</p>
<h2>NFT Theft: June Edition</h2>
<p>Shedding light into the NFT crime landscape for the month, PeckShield&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1675705679196336128" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">analysis</a> revealed that fraudsters stole approximately $2.27 million worth of NFTs. Despite this, June saw a 23% decline compared to the previous month, which recorded $2.95 million. This can be attributed to dwindling floor prices.</p>
<p>The latest figure is also over 85% lower than February&#8217;s high of a whopping $16.2 million.</p>
<p>The blockchain security firm further identified that half of the stolen NFTs were promptly sold on various marketplaces within a span of three hours of the theft. Prominent NFT marketplaces such as Blur emerged as a hotspot where nearly 86% of ill-gotten funds were sold, followed by OpenSea with 13.76%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the floor prices of NFT collections, such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Otherdeed, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki Elementals, as well as DeGods, have all <a href="https://nftpricefloor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">tanked</a> significantly.</p>
<p>Many whales view the market conditions to be an opportunity to amass more NFTs at low prices. Lookonchain revealed that a whale under the pseudonym &#8220;Machi Big Brother&#8221; raked in 84 Azuki NFTs over the past day to become the second-largest holder.</p>
<p>In terms of overall exploits in the digital asset industry, June was <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1674811493613969409" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">ranked</a> the second-highest month this year.  Exploiters managed to pilfer over $92 million across 42 hacks.</p>
<h2>NFT Exploits and Scams</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Nikhil Gopalani, the COO of RTFKT, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/rtfkts-coo-says-he-lost-his-nfts-in-phishing-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">lost</a> $173,000 worth of NFTs from his wallet in an apparent phishing attack. Later investigation pointed out that Gopalani may have accidentally provided confidential information to a hacker who was posing as an Apple representative.</p>
<p>Phishing, scam projects, stolen and plagiarized NFTs, market manipulation, and rug pulls continue to dominate the NFT space. As reported earlier, more than $100 million worth of NFTs were <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/over-100-million-worth-of-nfts-stolen-over-the-past-year-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">stolen</a> throughout 2022.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After forming a bearish double-top pattern and undergoing a period of consolidation, Ripple&#8217;s price struggled to break below the 100-day moving average. However, it finally declined below the moving average, reaching $0.44. This decline indicates a bearish outlook for Ripple&#8217;s short-term prospects.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<p>A<strong>The Daily Chart</strong></p>
<p>Upon analyzing the Daily Chart, it becomes evident that Ripple&#8217;s price exhibited high volatility around the crucial resistance level of $0.5. This resulted in the formation of a bearish double-top reversal pattern. Consequently, there has been a significant decline, breaking below the critical support level represented by the 100-day moving average.</p>
<p>Currently, the price is retracing back to the previously broken level at $0.485, creating a pullback. If it&#8217;s successful, another decline toward the next crucial support region can be anticipated. This region encompasses the substantial support of the 200-day moving average at $0.4328, as well as the static support zone at $0.42.</p>

<h3><strong>The 4-Hour Chart</strong></h3>
<p>Shifting our attention to the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price has finally dropped below the middle trendline of the ascending channel. Ripple is returning to the broken level at $0.49, forming a pullback.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the recent market turmoil, the price has also declined below the ascending trendline (marked in green). It is currently testing it through a pullback at the same level as the middle trendline of the channel.</p>
<p>Consequently, if both the channel&#8217;s middle trendline and the ascending green trendline reject the price, there is a strong possibility of a cascade toward the static support region at $0.42.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has been trending upward over recent weeks, leading investors to feel optimistic that a new bull market is on the horizon. Yet, there are still key resistance levels to be taken out for ETH to experience a new long-term bullish trend.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On the daily chart, the price has been rallying higher following a decisive rebound from the 200-day moving average, along with a breakout from the 50-day moving average to the upside. The aforementioned 50-day moving average, currently located around the $1,850 mark, has recently supported the price, pushing it to the upside.</p>
<p>Currently, the $2,200 level is the most likely target in this timeframe. A breakout above the $2,200 level would be instrumental for the market to enter a long-term bullish trend once more.</p>
<figure id="attachment_258417" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-258417" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily.jpeg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-258417 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily.jpeg" alt="eth_price_chart_0703231" width="1280" height="796" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily.jpeg 1280w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-300x187.jpeg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-1024x637.jpeg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-768x478.jpeg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-50x31.jpeg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-258417" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, things appear more interesting. Ethereum&#8217;s price has broken out of the large falling wedge pattern, but the $1,920 resistance level has rejected ETH several times. Even so, the cryptocurrency has been held by the higher boundary of the falling wedge and has been trending upwards consistently.</p>
<p>The $1,920 level is currently getting broken to the upside as the market climbs towards the $2,000 psychological level. Furthermore, while the RSI indicator is presently demonstrating bullish momentum dominance, it is approaching the overbought zone.</p>
<figure id="attachment_258416" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-258416" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H.jpeg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-258416 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H.jpeg" alt="eth_price_chart_0307232" width="1280" height="796" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H.jpeg 1280w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-300x187.jpeg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-1024x637.jpeg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-768x478.jpeg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-50x31.jpeg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-258416" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Sentiment Analysis</span></p>
<h3>Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio</h3>
<p>To gain insights into the current market sentiment and determine whether Ethereum is entering a new bull market or continuing the current bear market, it would be valuable to examine the sentiment in the perpetual futures market.</p>
<p>Analyzing the Taker Buy-Sell Ratio metric, which is smoothed by a 100-day exponential moving average, provides valuable information about the dominance of long or short traders. A ratio above 1 suggests a bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 indicates a bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>Despite the gradual recovery in Ethereum&#8217;s price over the past few months, the Taker Buy-Sell Ratio remains below 1. This suggests that there is ongoing bearish sentiment in the futures market. Some investors may be shorting the market to hedge their spot portfolios, while others are engaging in short-selling for profit, indicating a belief that the bear market is not yet over.</p>
<p>If this behavior continues among futures traders and the demand in the spot market diminishes, it could lead to selling pressure and a potential bearish reversal shortly.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market had another strong day as the global market capitalization surged by 1%. While Bitcoin continues to trade sideways above $30k, Ethereum is dominating the bull rally.</p>
<p>ETH is now up over 4% in the weekly time frame and is close to breaching the $2k price level.</p>
<p>The strong inflows into the crypto market have boosted other major altcoins, such as Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin as well as newly launched tokens, such as yPredict and Ecoterra.</p>
<h2><strong>Ethereum Inches Toward $2k </strong></h2>
<p>Major altcoins are in a state of euphoria, with Ethereum leading the way. Ether has surged 2.3% over the past day, bringing its weekly rally to 4.2%. The token is currently trading at $1,963 and is extremely close to hitting the $2k mark for the second time this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258429" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-2.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="325" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-2.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-2-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-2-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>ETH is currently displaying bullish strength due to the institutional adoption of crypto, led by Bitcoin. Several TradFi giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/fidelity-joins-the-rush-for-a-bitcoin-etf-following-blackrock-ark-invest-and-others.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">filed for spot Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence shows that various institutions have previously applied for spot Bitcoin trading as many as 30 times, but have been rejected by the SEC. Therefore, an approval from the top market watchdog would likely be incredibly bullish for the entire crypto industry, including Ethereum.</p>
<p>The crypto market tumbled after SEC officials claimed that the recent filings have been inadequate. However, brokerage firm Bernstein believes that the chances of approval by the SEC are “fairly high” as institutions such as Fidelity are already refiling their applications.</p>
<p>Ethereum is also enjoying its fair share of institutional attention. A new crypto exchange EDX, backed by giants Charles Schwab, Citadel, and Fidelity, has offered Ethereum trading to its users. The exchange offers trading for only three other crypto assets &#8211; Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the sudden institutional attention on Ethereum may be a signal that the token will not be labelled a security by the SEC.</p>
<p>The market is also exploding due as economic data continues to signal cooling inflation levels. The <a href="https://www.livemint.com/videos/why-the-us-federal-reserve-didn-t-raise-rates-mint-primer-mint-11688360495082.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve</a> already paused its interest rate hike last month. If the central bank continues to pivot from its hawkish stance, ETH and other altcoins can see remarkable price growth.</p>
<h2><strong>Which Altcoins Could Also Surge?</strong></h2>
<p>The current bull rally has been rewarding for altcoins, especially high-utility projects with enormous real-world value.</p>
<p>Other altcoins like Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are pumping, while YPredict and Ecoterra are two presale tokens that are also displaying significant growth.</p>
<h2><strong>AI-Powered Trading Platform YPredict Nears $3 Million In Presale</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_72a7e4de.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">YPredict</a> has emerged as one of the most talked about crypto presales of recent weeks. The token has raised $2.7 million and is close to hitting the $3 million mark.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258428" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-2.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="352" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-2.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-2-300x175.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-2-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>$YPRED is currently priced at $0.09 but that will increase by 28% as it moves to the next stage of presale, offering an exciting opportunity for early investors.</p>
<p>AI-based crypto projects are in high demand &#8211; they have already amassed over $5 billion in market capitalization. YPredict’s wide variety of market tools and ML-based predictive trading can help it become a major player in this space.</p>
<p>All $YPRED holders are eligible for free-of-cost access to the Predictions platform &#8211; it comprises accurate price models of thousands of crypto assets and securities. Meanwhile, traders can use the Analytics platform to gain valuable market insights through top-notch pattern recognition algorithms, transaction analysis and sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>The yPredict Marketplace is the company’s flagship platform &#8211; it allows top AI &amp; ML experts to publish accurate and vetted data models. Traders can subscribe to these models and make informed real-time decisions.</p>
<p>Apart from powering this all-in-one ecosystem, $YPRED also offers lucrative rewards to holders. Investors can earn up to a whopping 45% quarter staking reward and also enjoy exciting discounts while using the yPredict platform.</p>

<h2><strong>Exciting Recycle2Earn Token Ecoterra Nears Launch, Is A Tier-1 Listing Next?</strong></h2>
<p>Top eco-friendly token <a href="https://bs_d432f031.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ecoterra</a> is another crypto gaining traction and has entered the final stage of its triumphant presale. It has now raised $5.7 million and is well on its way to hitting the targeted $6.7 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258427" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="395" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Despite the turbulent market conditions, $ECOTERRA has been a fan favourite of crypto investors throughout the presale, likely due to its exciting real-world utility. The Ecoterra project incentivises individuals and corporations to play their role in reversing anthropogenic global warming.</p>
<p>With the help of blockchain technology and lucrative tokenomics, the project is aiming to create a sustainable circular economy of recycled products.</p>
<p>Corporations can create a stellar reputation by purchasing recycled raw materials at low cost &#8211; meanwhile, Individuals can earn $ECOTERRA tokens for recycling waste products through the R2E application.</p>
<p>Companies and individuals can also play a huge role in helping achieve carbon neutrality. They can purchase verified carbon units through Ecoterra’s Carbon Offset Marketplace and reduce their greenhouse gas footprint.</p>
<p>While the platform accepts payments in Bitcoin, USDT and even fiat, the $ECOTERRA token is the preferred option &#8211; it costs low transaction fees and allows the possibility of staking.</p>
<p>Due to its high utility, the token is considered a likely candidate for a Tier-1 exchange listing, which could result in a bullish surge. Investors can take advantage of this by purchasing $ECOTERRA through bank cards or by swapping ETH or USDT tokens. The project is also offering a 10% bonus to every user buying the token in the final stage.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[PoW-based digital assets have been on a roll lately, with gains of up to triple digits at one point.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Proof of work (POW) cryptocurrencies absolutely dominated gains last week. The SEC&#8217;s actions and plunging energy prices might be why. Plus, there&#8217;s Litecoin&#8217;s halving event happening next month.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no denying the market&#8217;s recent moves. In fact, proof of work&#8217;s dominance during the last week in June was so absolute that four out of the five top gainers on the 7-day pane were such assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) 7-day gains: 53%</li>
<li>eCash (XEC) 7-day gains: 44%</li>
<li>Bitcoin Satoshi&#8217;s Vision (BSV) 7-day gains: 38%</li>
<li>Litecoin (LTC) 7-day gains: 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>The only cryptocurrency to rally higher than these the week ending July 2 was Compound (COMP). That all four of these surging rallies were for POW coins is definitely a conspicuous pattern. Two other top gainers for the week are also POW cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Ethereum Classic (ETC) soared by 13% over its average trading price on crypto exchanges a week ago. That placed it 13th among the top gainers for the period. Meanwhile, Zcash (ZEC) jumped up by 8% to slide into 14th for the week behind Ethereum Classic.</p>
<h2>Proof of Work Coins a Regulatory Hedge?</h2>
<p>What was it about POW crypto assets last week? Why were they the ones to surge the most and with such eye-popping gains?</p>
<p>Because Jim Cramer said not to buy them on Monday: <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/betting-against-cnbcs-jim-cramer-helps-crypto-trader-book-profits/" data-wpel-link="internal">just kidding</a> (he didn&#8217;t, really).</p>
<p>But it may seriously be a result of last month&#8217;s elevated SEC activity against the blockchain industry. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-coinbase-and-binance-lawsuits-super-bullish-for-btc-and-eth-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">leaning harder</a> on proof of stake coins.</p>
<p>Falling energy prices may also have something to do with this proof of work coin rally. These blockchains use enormous amounts of electricity to secure and operate their services. Crude oil <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">is down</a> 14% since early April, and oil <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-heads-first-monthly-gain-this-year-supply-tightens-2023-06-30/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">just posted</a> its fourth consecutive quarterly decline for Q2.</p>
<p>Furthermore, U.S. gas prices collapsed as POW coins rallied last week. CNN says petrol rates are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/business/gas-prices-july-4th-travel/index.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">taking an</a> almost unprecedented plunge, even as Americans hit the roads <em>en masse</em> for the 4th of July holiday.</p>
<p>Add to all these factors, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoins-hash-rate-hits-ath-as-halving-countdown-narrows-and-ltc-nears-100/" data-wpel-link="internal">Litecoin&#8217;s halving</a> event next month, and you have the week&#8217;s perfect storm for proof of work coins.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>How could crypto investors have known this would happen ahead of time and had long exposure to these digital assets? Keeping up on the news like the SEC regulations and thinking strategically about cause and effect can help turn up leads for trades to qualify with further research.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowing the halving calendar for all proof of work coins with any kind of liquid exchange market might have clued crypto investors into these gains.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s proof of work crypto rally saw the combined market caps of a handful of POW coins gain some $3 billion. As a result, the richest wallet <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/richlist/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">on the</a> Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain gained $145 million in market exchange value in seven days.</p>
<p>No telling for sure whose it is, but Roger Ver, Calvin Ayre, and Jihan Wu are good suspects. These Bitcoin Cash perma-bulls are apt to be among the largest BCH bag holders.</p>
