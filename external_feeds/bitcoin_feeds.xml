He added that things will &#8220;probably start looking better&#8221; in the second quarter of 2024.</strong></p>
<h2>Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Recession and Fed&#8217;s Rate Hikes</h2>
<p>Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk has reiterated his warning about a recession in the U.S. He tweeted Friday that if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates again next week, the &#8220;recession will be greatly amplified.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musk-tweet-fed-raising-rates.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20221210%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20221210T063736Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8cc2437ad1ec07326ae47085ad7fcd6185f2c1e1dda0c1f48a68fb03b28e23db"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-563369" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musk-tweet-fed-raising-rates.jpg" alt="" width="918" height="261" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musk-tweet-fed-raising-rates-300x85.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musk-tweet-fed-raising-rates-768x218.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musk-tweet-fed-raising-rates.jpg 918w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" /></a></p>
<p>Musk was further asked on Twitter how long he thinks the recession will last. The Tesla boss replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just a rough guess, but things probably start looking better in Q2 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was not the first time Musk warned about the consequences of the Fed hiking interest rates. At the end of November, the billionaire said the trend was concerning. He <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-warns-of-severe-recession-urges-the-fed-to-cut-interest-rates-immediately/">urged</a> the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates immediately, stating that the U.S. central bank is &#8220;massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.&#8221;</p>
<p>He agreed with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood that the Fed&#8217;s actions <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ark-invest-ceo-warns-feds-actions-could-lead-to-1929-like-great-depression-elon-musk-agrees/">could lead to</a> a 1929-like Great Depression.</p>

<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled a 50-basis-point rate hike in December following four consecutive 75-basis-point hikes. &#8220;It makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,‚Äù Powell <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/powell-december-signals-50-basis-points-183019709.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. Fed officials will announce their decision on Wednesday after a two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.</p>
<p>According to gold bug Peter Schiff, &#8220;The risk is not the Fed causing a recession by unnecessarily tightening too much as it thinks a strong economy will prevent inflation from falling.&#8221; He explained in a tweet last week: &#8220;The risk is the current recession gets worse, causing the Fed to pivot too soon, as it mistakenly believes inflation will decline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people are expecting a mild recession in 2023, including analysts at Citi Group. The impending recession &#8220;won&#8217;t be that deep, but it will be meaningful,&#8221; <a href="https://money.yahoo.com/expect-a-mild-recession-in-2023-citi-economists-175456778.html">said</a> David Bailin, chief investment officer and head of Citi Global Wealth Investments. Some, however, expect a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economists-warn-of-severe-recession-as-fed-continues-raising-interest-rates-to-fight-inflation/">severe recession</a>, including veteran investor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-of-the-worst-recession-in-his-lifetime/">Jim Rogers</a>.</p>

<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Investors Will Get Richer</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has predicted that owners of bitcoin will get richer while &#x201C;fake money savers&#x201D; will be the biggest losers.</p>
<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Thursday that people who own gold, silver, and bitcoin will get richer when the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and Wall Street pivot and trillions of dollars are printed. &#x201C;Fake money savers will be the biggest losers,&#x201D; he stressed.</p>

<p>The famous author has warned on several occasions that the U.S. pension crisis is much worse than we thought. In 2020, he co-authored a book titled &#x201C;Who Stole My Pension?&#x201D; with Edward Siedle. In the book, the authors discussed &#x201C;the greatest retirement crisis in the history of our nation and &#x2026; the entire world.&#x201D; When pension funds <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/06/bank-of-england-says-pension-funds-were-hours-from-disaster-before-it-intervened.html">almost collapsed</a> recently in England, Kiyosaki <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-us-dollar-will-crash-by-january-suggests-buying-bitcoin/">warned</a> that a similar situation could happen in the U.S.</p>

<p>Kiyosaki previously explained that &#x201C;the U.S. dollar became fake money&#x201D; when President Richard Nixon removed it from the gold standard in 1971. &#x201C;This is because rather than being tied to real money,&#x201D; such as gold, &#x201C;it was tied to the &#x2018;full faith and credit&#x2019; of the United States,&#x201D; the Rich Dad Poor Dad author noted. In September, he said the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-end-of-fake-money-is-here-shares-3-lessons-to-help-investors-amid-market-crashes/">end of fake money</a> is here; he expects the U.S. dollar to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-us-dollar-will-crash-by-january-suggests-buying-bitcoin/">crash</a> by January.</p>
<p>The renowned author has said repeatedly that he doesn&#x2019;t trust the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, President Joe Biden, and Wall Street. In February, he warned that the Fed and the Treasury are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-fed-treasury-destroying-dollar-advises-saving-bitcoin/">destroying</a> the U.S. dollar, advising people to buy bitcoin.</p>
<p>He recently stressed that cryptocurrency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-im-still-bullish-on-bitcoin-crypto-cannot-be-blamed-for-ftx-collapse/">cannot be blamed</a> for the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, emphasizing that bitcoin is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-bitcoin-isnt-the-problem-calls-former-ftx-ceo-the-bernie-madoff-of-crypto/">not the problem</a>. He called former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-bitcoin-isnt-the-problem-calls-former-ftx-ceo-the-bernie-madoff-of-crypto/">Bernie Madoff of crypto</a>. Earlier this month, Kiyosaki explained that he is a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-im-a-bitcoin-investor-when-btc-hits-new-bottom-i-get-excited/">bitcoin investor</a>, not a trader, and he gets excited when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> hits a new bottom.</p>

<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried to Testify Before Congress</h2>
<p>Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has agreed to testify before the House Committee on Financial Services after the committee&#8217;s chair, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, politely tweeted <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/maxine-waters-criticized-for-praising-sbf-lawmaker-says-we-appreciate-that-youve-been-candid/">inviting</a> him to testify several times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still do not have access to much of my data ‚Äî professional or personal. So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won&#8217;t be as helpful as I&#8217;d like. But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th,&#8221; Bankman-Fried tweeted to Rep. Waters Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will try to be helpful during the hearing, and to shed what light I can on FTX US&#8217;s solvency and American customers, pathways that could return value to users internationally, what I think led to the crash, [and] my own failings,&#8221; he detailed in a follow-up tweet, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had thought of myself as a model CEO, who wouldn&#8217;t become lazy or disconnected, which made it that much more destructive when I did. I&#8217;m sorry. Hopefully people can learn from the difference between who I was and who I could have been.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another congressional hearing is set for Wednesday, Dec. 14. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chair of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-calls-sam-bankman-fried-to-answer-for-failure-of-ftx-and-alameda-research/">sent a letter</a> to Bankman-Fried last week requesting him to testify. At the time of writing, the former FTX CEO has not agreed to testify before the Senate committee.</p>
<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 and Bankman-Fried stepped down as the CEO. The company is now being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-doj-investigate-ftx-regulators-suspect-crypto-exchange-mishandles-customer-funds/" target="_self" rel="noopener">investigated</a> for various charges, including mishandling customer funds. FTX&#8217;s new CEO, John Ray, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ceo-says-ftx-is-the-worst-case-of-corporate-failure-with-untrustworthy-financial-data-and-unacceptable-practices/?preview_id=559385">told</a> the bankruptcy court: &#8220;Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Xrp-Whales Move Massive Tokens Over the Last 7 Days</h2>
<p>On Saturday, Dec. 10, 2022, the crypto asset xrp (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>) has been trading for prices between $0.386 to $0.390 per unit. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is the seventh largest crypto asset in terms of market capitalization as the token&#x2019;s overall valuation today is $19.60 billion. On Saturday, data shows there&#x2019;s an estimated $423 million in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> trading volume worldwide during the past 24 hours. Over the last 30 days, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> has gained over 17% in value against the greenback.</p>

<p>Amid the market gains this past month, there&#x2019;s been a lot of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> whales moving significant numbers of tokens to and from exchanges and to unknown wallets as well. For example, Whale Alert <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ripple/1AEB46DAFF8B02B230FC9046AB5DF2C75C125D04930F8451412B222DD53C32AD">caught 40 million xrp (XRP)</a> move from the trading platform Bitso to an unknown wallet on Dec. 8, 2022.</p>

<h2>Post-Merge Ethereum Fees Continue to Remain Much Lower Than Last Year</h2>
<p>On Nov. 9, 2021, the average transaction fee on the Ethereum network was around 62.84 nominal U.S. dollars per transaction, according to <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3y">bitinfocharts.com</a>. Today, the average gas cost required to send ether is estimated to be around $2.87 which is 95.43% cheaper than it was over a year ago in November 2021.</p>
<p>The Ethereum network uses gas or a fee to prevent spam on the network and every transaction onchain requires a certain amount of gas to push the transfer. Ethereum fees have been a lot better since The Merge and more specifically since June 18, 2022.</p>
<p>Since then, average ether fees have been under the $5 range for roughly 175 days with a brief spike above $5 per transaction on Nov. 8, 2022. That was the same day crypto markets experienced extreme price fluctuations due to the FTX collapse.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-563456 size-full" title="Stats Show Ethereum Transaction Fees Have Remained Under $5 During the Last 175 Days" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aver.jpg" alt="Stats Show Ethereum Transaction Fees Have Remained Under $5 During the Last 175 Days" width="1490" height="500" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aver-300x101.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aver-1024x344.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aver-768x258.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aver.jpg 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px"></p>
<p>Besides that day, for most of the 175-day period, average ether fees have been under the $3 range in value. The same can be said for Ethereum&#x2019;s median-sized gas fees which remained under $2 per transfer throughout most of the time frame.</p>
<p>Current stats from <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">etherscan.io&#x2019;s gas tracker</a> indicate that high-priority fees are much less than bitinfocharts.com&#x2019;s average and median-sized fee values. At the time of writing on Saturday, Dec. 10, 2022, etherscan.io&#x2019;s gas tracker shows a high-priority Ethereum gas fee is estimated to be around 21 gwei or $0.48 per transfer.</p>
<p>However, that cited value is to simply send the crypto asset ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>), as it costs more gas to interact with a smart contract that either sends an ERC20 token or performs an onchain swap. For example, the onchain fee for an Opensea non-fungible token (NFT) listing is estimated to cost $1.74 per transaction.</p>

<p>Sending an ERC20 token like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> or USDC is estimated to cost $1.31 per transfer, and swapping an ERC20 coin may cost a user around $4.48 in gas fees on Saturday. While onchain fees on Ethereum have been low, <a href="https://l2fees.info/">layer two (L2) fees</a> have been even lower during the last 175 days.</p>
<p>Arbitrum fees to send ether are around $0.03 per transfer and an Optimism L2 transfer is estimated to be around $0.10 per transaction. Similarly, Zksync, Loopring, Polygon Hermez, Boba, and Aztec L2 transactions are also much lower in value than traditional onchain Ethereum network transfers.</p>

Moreover, the now-bankrupt crypto trading platform‚Äôs exchange token FTT is still trading above $1 per unit, and it managed to climb 23.4% higher against the U.S. dollar during the past seven days.</strong></p>
<h2>FTT Coin Pumps After Crypto Community Members and Sam Bankman-Fried Discuss a New FTT Token Idea</h2>
<p>For some odd reason, the digital asset <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ftx-token">ftx token (FTT)</a> is still holding value and on Dec. 10, 2022, it‚Äôs been trading for prices between $1.58 to $1.82 over the last 24 hours. FTT is an exchange token associated with FTX from the very beginning, and it was launched more than three years ago in 2019.</p>
<p>In fact, this week FTT‚Äôs price has increased 23.4% against the U.S. dollar and during the last two weeks, the price climbed 17.5% higher. It‚Äôs uncertain why FTT has risen more than 20% this week, but it might be because there‚Äôs been talk of issuing a new FTT token.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-563425 size-full" title="Talks of Issuing a New FTT Token Fuel Coin‚Äôs Price Despite FTT's Broken Tokenomics Scheme" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fttbusd_2022-12-10_09-42-56.png" alt="Talks of Issuing a New FTT Token Fuel Coin‚Äôs Price Despite FTT's Broken Tokenomics Scheme" width="1554" height="1158" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fttbusd_2022-12-10_09-42-56-300x224.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fttbusd_2022-12-10_09-42-56-1024x763.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fttbusd_2022-12-10_09-42-56-768x572.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fttbusd_2022-12-10_09-42-56-1536x1145.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fttbusd_2022-12-10_09-42-56.png 1554w" sizes="(max-width: 1554px) 100vw, 1554px" /></p>
<p>On Dec. 9, the crypto proponent Ran Neuner tweeted about the issuance of a new FTT token. ‚ÄúFire up the FTX exchange,‚Äù Neuner <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptomanran/status/1601103705935577090?s=20&amp;t=KvHmg4pvttBISEl3bwCWcQ">said</a> on Twitter. ‚ÄúIssue a new FTT token. Distribute the token to creditors/depositors. Accrue 100% of profits to token holders. It will be the biggest exchange in the world and users will be made more than whole,‚Äù Neuner added.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) responded to Neuner‚Äôs tweet. SBF <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1601129063221202945?s=20&amp;t=KvHmg4pvttBISEl3bwCWcQ">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I continue to think that this would be a productive path for parties to explore ‚Äî I *hope* that the teams in place will do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>A great number of people made fun of the idea and mocked both Neuner and SBF in the Twitter thread. Bitcoiner Layah Heilpern <a href="https://twitter.com/LayahHeilpern/status/1601254389355712512?s=20&amp;t=KvHmg4pvttBISEl3bwCWcQ">responded</a> and said: ‚ÄúBut then the cycle repeats and we‚Äôre back at square one‚Ä¶‚Äù Another user replied to Heilpern in the thread and <a href="https://twitter.com/Buck_Coin/status/1601255871979585536?s=20&amp;t=KvHmg4pvttBISEl3bwCWcQ">remarked</a>: ‚ÄúExactly, how absurd is this.‚Äù</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, Neuner doubled down on the idea. ‚ÄúIf [Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao] and or [Bybit CEO Ben Zhou] are willing to back me and guide me, I‚Äôm happy to champion this.‚Äù Neuner continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing would make me happier than making everyone whole again. And I really think it‚Äôs possible.</p></blockquote>
<h2>FTT&#8217;s Tokenomics Scheme Was Broken Well Before FTX Collapsed and It&#8217;s Even Worse Today, LUNA 2.0 Reimbursement Was a Disaster</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs quite possible this discussion affected the current price of FTT, as charts show the token saw an enormous pump on Dec. 9, 2022, the same day as Neuner‚Äôs and SBF‚Äôs tweets about a new FTT token. On that day, FTT was swapping for $1.58 per unit and it climbed 13.29% higher to $1.79 per unit by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Oftentimes with discussions tied to creating a new token that&#8217;s based on an existing coin, it causes people to purchase the token in hopes they will get a forked 1:1 airdrop. However, if there was a forked coin based on the current snapshot of FTT, one single address would be eligible for 59.55% of the entire supply.</p>
<p>Another address, the infamous <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elliptic-analysis-says-477-million-stolen-from-ftx-accounts-drainer-becomes-35th-largest-eth-holder/">FTX Accounts Drainer,</a> would be eligible for 13.94% of the supply. SBF wouldn&#8217;t be able to airdrop new FTT tokens to holders without airdropping close to 60% of the supply to Alameda Research and close to 14% of the supply to an unknown hacker, that is possibly associated with the business.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There would have to be some sort of magical method to repay FTX creditors and depositors, and a new token would arguably be a really messy design from the get-go. Presently, FTT is extremely illiquid, and specific exchanges have blocked FTT deposits because of the hacker and because the token‚Äôs locked supply was unlocked by an unknown entity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means the entire supply of FTT is circulating in the wild and a small handful of entities could singlehandedly crush the market. Out of the thousands of crypto tokens today, FTT‚Äôs market cap is not listed on sites like coingecko.com, in terms of overall market cap ranking, due to the locked coins in circulation factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one time, FTT was worth $84.18 and today, the price is 98.1% lower in USD value.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, the troubled Terra blockchain community and the project‚Äôs leader, Do Kwon, attempted to make users whole again after that blockchain ecosystem collapsed, with the LUNA 2.0 fork. </span>The LUNA fork barely scratched the surface in terms of making LUNA and UST users whole again, and the distribution of new LUNA tokens was a messy process that led to mistakes. For example, some Terra users did not get what they were supposed to receive when the Phoenix airdrop took place.</p>
<p>Terra developers had to reimburse these users with another airdrop. Furthermore, developers allocated a lot of users‚Äô airdropped funds into vesting periods and airdropped recipients have found their new LUNA tokens are locked for a few years.</p>

The token rebounded from losses suffered on Friday, moving closer to a key resistance level in the process. Dogecoin, on the other hand, fell lower on Saturday as traders attempted to find a stable point of support.</strong></p>
<h2>Uniswap (UNI)</h2>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) was one of Saturday‚Äôs notable movers, as prices rebounded from declines suffered the day prior.</p>
<p>After sinking to a bottom of $6.10 on Friday, UNI/USD marginally rebounded, climbing to a high of $6.27 in the process.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $6.35, which was last hit December 5.</p>

<p>In order to recapture this point, UNI bulls will first need to rise beyond a ceiling of 56.70 on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at a level of 54.75, which has contributed to the current market volatility, with traders unsure if they should maintain previous positions.</p>
<p>However, should we see price strength surge beyond the aforementioned resistance at 56.70, then it is possible that UNI bulls could send prices towards the $7.00 mark.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) on the other hand remained in the red, following a failed breakout of a key resistance point on Friday.</p>
<p>Following a move to a high of $0.09858 yesterday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.096 on Saturday.</p>
<p>The move comes as the meme coin was unable to surge past its ceiling of $0.0990 during Friday‚Äôs session.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this point of resistance coincides with another ceiling ‚Äî that of the RSI.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is currently tracking at 51.96, which is marginally below a ceiling of 53.00.</p>
<p>Should we see this wall broken, it is likely that the meme coin could head back towards the $0.1000 region.</p>

Markets now expect that the Fed could continue hiking rates, following a higher than expected increase in producer prices. Ethereum mainly consolidated on Saturday, as prices moved back towards a key price floor. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) remained above the $17,000 level to start the weekend, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $17,100.84 during Saturday&#x2019;s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $17,280.55.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s decline, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> continued to move below its recent resistance level of $17,200.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, it now appears as if bitcoin could be moving towards a floor of $16,750, which comes as market volatility remains high today.</p>
<p>The turbulence came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move between a floor of 50.00 and a ceiling of 52.00.</p>
<p>In order for bulls to fully regain market sentiment, a breakout of the 52.00 mark must occur, which could then lead to the return of upwards momentum.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Like bitcoin, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also consolidated to start the weekend, with price moving close to a key point of support.</p>
<p>Following a peak of $1,290.06 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD moved to a bottom of $1,260.82 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s drop, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency moved closer to a recent floor of $1,230.</p>

<p>From the chart, it seems that today&#x2019;s consolidation comes as bulls failed to break out of a resistance point at $1,300.</p>
<p>As of writing, ethereum now seems as though it is heading for its aforementioned floor at the $1,230 point.</p>
<p>This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average now appears to have halted recent gains, and is slowly shifting downwards.</p>

However, the regulator wants the extracted digital currency to be sold outside the country or only under special legal regimes in Russia, as an exception.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia‚Äôs Central Bank Suggests Restrictions Be Added to Proposed Crypto Mining Law</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (<a href="https://www.cbr.ru/eng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBR</a>) ‚Äúconceptually supports‚Äù the draft law seeking to legalize the crypto mining sector, but at the same time maintains that the digital currencies obtained in the process should be mostly sold on foreign exchanges and only to non-residents.</p>
<p>In comments for the Russian Interfax news agency, the bank‚Äôs press service added that in case the coins are exchanged domestically, this should happen exclusively through licensed platforms operating in a controlled regulatory environment. A representative elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We allow the possibility of lifting such restrictions within the framework of experimental legal regimes, provided that transactions with cryptocurrencies are made through an authorized organization.</p></blockquote>
<p>The official emphasized that the monetary authority adheres to its position, expressed and reiterated on multiple occasions so far, that the circulation of cryptocurrency within the Russian Federation is ‚Äúinadmissible.‚Äù</p>
<p>In November, a group of lawmakers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amendments-to-russias-digital-asset-law-aim-to-allow-mining-ban-crypto-exchange-and-ads/">submitted</a> to the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, a bill designed to regulate the mining of currencies like bitcoin and other crypto activities through amendments to the country‚Äôs existing law ‚ÄúOn Digital Financial Assets.‚Äù</p>
<p>The draft offers miners the two options for the sale of the minted coins referenced by the Bank of Russia. In either case, the Federal Tax Service should be notified about the transactions. Payments through means different than the Russian ruble are banned even under current law but amid sanctions the idea of legalizing cross-border <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-mining-bill-permitting-cross-border-crypto-payments-filed-in-russian-parliament/">crypto settlements</a> has been gaining traction.</p>
<p>However, the filed bill does not mention that the mined cryptocurrency should be sold only to non-residents of Russia and its provisions do not refer to an ‚Äúauthorized organization‚Äù for transactions carried out under the special legal regimes inside the country.</p>

<h2>Finance Ministry Rejects Central Bank‚Äôs Latest Position</h2>
<p>Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Deputy Minister of Finance Alexey Moiseev commented that the CBR has a new position, which in his view amounts to a ban on mining outside the said legal regimes. He said that his department does not accept this ‚Äútotal licensing‚Äù policy.</p>
<p>For months, the ministry and the bank have been arguing over the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies in Russia, with the Minfin taking a more liberal stance while the monetary authority proposed a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-proposes-wide-ban-on-cryptocurrency-use-trade-mining/">blanket ban</a> on related activities, including mining and trading.</p>
<p>Despite these persisting differences, the head of the parliamentary Financial Market Committee Anatoly Aksakov was quoted as stating earlier this week that he expects lawmakers to pass the new legislation before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Executive Director of the Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain (<a href="https://racib.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racib</a>), Alexander Brazhnikov, pointed out that when trying to sell abroad, Russian miners are likely to face restrictions by foreign exchanges. And while trading the coins in Russian special regulatory zones is a good idea, their establishment would take at least a year.</p>

Chipper Cash has also reportedly laid off 50 employees as it seeks to cope with the deteriorated macroeconomic environment.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX&#8217;s Simple Agreement for Future Equity</h2>
<p>Chipper Cash, one of the several African fintech startups to receive funding from FTX, saw its valuation drop from $2 billion to $1.25 billion after it secured additional funding from the now-collapsed crypto exchange, a Techcrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/06/ftx-marked-down-chipper-cashs-valuation-from-2b-to-1-25b/">report</a> has said. The latest revelation came just as Chipper Cash was reported to have retrenched as many as 50 employees.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/african-fintech-giant-raises-150-million-in-funding-round-led-by-ftx-firm-now-valued-at-over-2-billion/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, Chipper Cash, which was launched in 2018 by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, saw its valuation rise to over $2 billion after it received $150 million in a Series C extension round that was led by FTX in late 2021. Before that, the fintech had raised $100 million via its Series C round.</p>
<p>However, according to the Techcrunch report, the drop in the fintech‚Äôs valuation stems from the $35 million it received from FTX. Chipper Cash needed the new funding, which reportedly came in the form of a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) grant, to help it deal with a tough macroeconomic environment, the report added.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Chipper Cash the Latest African Fintech to Lay Off Workers</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in what has seemingly become a custom adopted by fintechs when they lay off employees, Erin Fusaro, the vice president of engineering at Chipper Cash, urged tech firms looking for talented workers to consider hiring her former colleagues.</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning [Dec. 5] a significant amount of Chipper staff were let go in a layoff. While I was not among them, many of my close colleagues and friends were. If you‚Äôre looking for talented engineering leadership, engineers, technical program managers, analysts, or IT staff,&#8221; Fusaro said in a Linkedin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erinefusaro_this-morning-a-significant-amount-of-chipper-activity-7005542441739063296-JmxT/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">post</a>, &#8220;please comment here and I&#8217;ll do my best to start connecting people.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-nigerian-crypto-exchange-quidax-cuts-its-workforce-by-20/">Quidax</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-web3-startup-says-funds-are-stuck-with-ftx-lays-off-employees/">Nestcoin</a> are two African fintechs to have similarly asked their better-positioned industry peers to consider recruiting their former employees.</p>
