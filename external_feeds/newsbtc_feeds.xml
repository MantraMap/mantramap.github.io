					<description><![CDATA[While the broader cryptocurrency market recently took a nosedive, some mysterious Ethereum whale successfully escaped with $41 million worth of ETH. Days later, the price of ETH went down, along with BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Did this whale know something the rest of the market didn&#8217;t? Ethereum Whale Sells $41 Million Before Market Crash In the early hours of August 18, the crypto market saw investors reacting to SpaceX selling its $373 million Bitcoin holdings, pushing down Bitcoin by more than 8% in a matter of minutes. During this period, the crypto market cap dropped to $1.1 trillion,  and Ethereum also saw its value plummet by almost 6%.  Related Reading: Valkyrie Taps Into Ethereum Momentum With New ETF Filing On-chain data provided by Lookonchain reveals that a smart Ethereum whale dumped 22,341 ETH worth $41 million just prior on August 14. On-chain investigation shows that the whale moved their ETH holdings to the Binance exchange and then withdrew $41 million worth of Tether USDT. While this whale still made a loss of $1.7 million in the sale, if they hadn&#8217;t moved their funds, they would have lost at least $5 million in the crash.  The whale was very smart and dumped 22,341 $ETH ($41M) before the market crashed. Even though he lost ~$1.7M this time, he successfully avoided the market crash. Perhaps he will buy $ETH back at a cheaper price in the future.

					<description><![CDATA[According to Coinglass, the crypto market witnessed more than $1.04 billion in liquidations during this period. Of this, a BNB position on the Venus lending protocol belonging to the perpetrator of the BSC bridge $560M hack was liquidated. The BSC Bridge Hack: Understanding One of Crypto&#8217;s Biggest Exploits The BSC brdige hack in October 2022 was one of the biggest exploits in crypto and DeFi history, with the hacker stealing nearly $593 million in BNB. But the story didn’t end there as the hacker tried to launder as much money as they could.  Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH After the attack, the hacker deposited 900,000 BNB worth $200 million on Venus as collateral to borrow $150 million worth of stablecoins. With more than $598.25 million in TVL, the Venus protocol is the second-largest DeFi protocol on the Binance Smart Chain.  According to DeFi researcher Ignas, the position was the &#8220;single largest potential liquidation in all #DeFi that cannot be closed.&#8221; This is because, while the BNB Chain was halted and the network upgrade after the exploit, the ecosystem was put at risk, as liquidation of such an amount could lead to a further plummet in the price of BNB.  As a result, the Venus DAO voted to whitelist BNB Chain as the sole liquidator of the hacker&#8217;s address in case of a margin call. Notably, a drop in the price of BNB to $220 would see the hacker&#8217;s collateral liquidated.  Now, with the price of the token experiencing a selloff in the past few days, the team has chosen to manually liquidate the position to reduce the impact of a margin call on the BSC ecosystem.  On-chain data from PeckShieldAlert shows that the position has been liquidated for 5.6 million BNB tokens worth $52.3 million, a fraction of the total position.  Following today’s market movement, the BNB Bridge exploiter account was made healthy as promised by @BNBCHAIN using whitelisted liquidation without any resulting shortfall or further impact to $bnb https://t.co/TGZ7nbiDPN — Venus Protocol (@VenusProtocol) August 18, 2023 What’s Next For BNB? Since that time, the price of BNB has dropped below $220.

Meanwhile, Ramaswamy is known to have taken a pro-crypto stance since the beginning of his campaign. As part of his campaign, he has promised to create a more viable environment for the crypto industry in the US.  The presidential candidate has gone as far as incorporating Bitcoin donations into his campaign funds. During a Bitcoin 2023 conference in May, he announced that his campaign committee was “officially” accepting Bitcoin donations.  Interestingly, another presidential candidate Robert F.

This isn’t surprising, considering that many US voters are said to be actively invested in digital assets.  Last year, a poll conducted by the crypto-focused political group GMI PAC revealed that 44% of US voters own or are considering owning digital assets. As such, it is expected that politicians will be looking to target this group of voters.  Presidential candidates like Ramaswamy and Kennedy have shown their inclination toward crypto. Kennedy, for one, has described cryptocurrency as a “symbol of democracy and freedom.” Republican Presidential Candidate Ron DeSantis is another huge fan of Bitcoin. The Governor has promised to end “Biden’s War on Bitcoin” if elected. He also believes every citizen should have the right “to do Bitcoin,” as he mentioned during an X space with Elon Musk.

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB), a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has seen a notable increase in high-value transactions, with each one costing $1 million or more. Following a strong price increase in the first half of August, this spike in transactions clearly gathered traction. Following the coin&#8217;s price explosion, a notable pattern started to emerge: whales made significant volumes of crypto movement even as the meme coin&#8217;s prices saw a correction. A huge shift was recently revealed by data provided by Whale Alert, a website that tracks significant cryptocurrency transactions, and it was masterminded by a single entity that had a sizeable amount of Shiba Inu tokens. 🚨 🚨 4,657,881,590,632 #SHIB (40,747,148 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/g1D0dVuUjY — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 17, 2023 Related Reading: Solo Climber: The Lone Crypto Surging 11% In Top 100 Roster On A Weekend Shiba Inu Whale Moves $40 Million In Meme Coins This crypto whale carried out an unprecedented transfer of 4.65 trillion SHIB tokens, or about the equivalent of $40 million.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Ordinals, once the shining star of the NFT world, is experiencing a significant downturn in both sales volume and transactions, igniting discussions about the lasting appeal of these digital collectibles.  According to a recent report from DappRadar, the fervor that propelled Bitcoin Ordinals to record-breaking heights earlier this year has dwindled, with sales volume plummeting by over 97% from its peak in May 2023.

					<description><![CDATA[The last few days have been eventful for the crypto market following a major crash on Thursday that resulted in the loss of $1 billion in market cap. In another unnerving development, it appears that Binance, the world’s largest exchange, may be in some form of trouble as a crypto analyst shares some insight on the company. Related Reading: Binance To Delist These Three Tokens In August Due To Non-Compliance Binance To Record Heavy Losses If BNB Trades Below $212, Analyst Says According to an X post on Friday, a crypto analyst with the name MartyParty painted a rather gloomy picture for Binance and its 150 million users. The analyst began by stating there was a reason the Binance Coin (BNB) is yet to fall below $212.  After Bitcoin tumbled on Thursday, BNB, like most cryptocurrencies, also plummeted in value, falling from $231.85 to $215.02. Although the token did attempt a market rebound on Friday, it soon fell again but found support at the $214 price zone.  MartyParty believes there is a reason why BNB is gaining support at these levels away from the $212 price mark. According to the analyst, the Binance exchange has a BNB-backed loan set to liquidate at $212.  Initially, the liquidation price for the said loan was $220, but it was later shifted in June. Although the analyst didn&#8217;t reveal the exact amount of this supposed loan, it seems massive as he stated it could lead to a “fatal margin call”  for the Binance exchange upon liquidation.  According to MartyParty, Binance is presently in “self-preservation mode” with its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao selling BTC from a particular wallet to purchase TUSD, which in turn is invested in BNB to keep the Binance native token above $212.  In addition, this crypto analyst also made another interesting theory behind Binance’s supposed problem. He stated that US financial regulators are allegedly selling crypto holdings of the US Marshals Service in order to forcibly liquidate Binance’s loan position and kick CZ out of the crypto industry.  Related Reading: SEC’s Ethereum Futures ETF Approval: A Resounding Victory For ETH’s Security Status? Crypto Community Reacts To Worrying Post On Binance Following MartyParty’s post, there have been multiple reactions, with some crypto users siding with the analyst and nudging investors to dump the BNB token, saying that Binance is currently in a similar position as the FTX exchange in 2022. The FTX exchange collapsed in November 2022 due to a cascade of events triggered by reports which stated that Alameda Research &#8211; FTX’s trading arm &#8211; held an unusually large amount of FTT &#8211; FTX native cryptocurrency similar to Binance’s BNB.  During the hype of the debacle, an inside source revealed that Alameda Research was quietly collecting loans from FTX, which were collateralized by the FTT token.  However, on the other hand, some other crypto analysts have disagreed with MartyParty’s post calling it false and only aimed at spreading FUD. A particular analyst with the handle Alice on X has described the whole report as a “bizarre conspiracy theory” as the loan in question was not taken out by the Binance exchange but rather by Venus Protocol, a lending protocol on the BNB chain. For now, Binance, CZ, or the US government are yet to issue any statement confirming or denying the post by the analyst MartyParty.  At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $215.55, with a 1.59% decline in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, the token boasts a market cap of $33.16 billion and ranks as the fourth biggest cryptocurrency in the market.

					<description><![CDATA[Yuga Labs &#8211; creators of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection &#8211; has unveiled its plans to cut ties with NFT marketplace OpenSea. This comes as a response to the platform’s proposed shift to an optional royalty system. On Thursday, August 17, OpenSea announced that it is changing its creator fees framework, making royalties optional for new collections after August 31, 2023. The NFT marketplace also disclosed that it would disable the Operator Filter, a feature that enforces creator royalties. According to the announcement, NFT collections that utilized the Operator Filter up until August 31 will have their creator royalties enforced till February 29, 2024, when the fees will become optional.  In the blog post, OpenSea explained the rationale behind its decision, saying the Operator Filter was designed to empower creators with greater control. However, the marketplace claims that it has not received the much-needed acceptance in the web3 ecosystem. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH Yuga Labs Responds To OpenSea’s Decision  On Friday, August 18, Yuga Labs published an open letter on X (formerly Twitter), subtly criticizing OpenSea’s decision to make creator fees optional on all secondary sales for all collections by February 2024. The BAYC creator also disclosed its plans to wind down support for OpenSea’s SeaPort, a marketplace protocol that enables the buying and selling of NFTs. Daniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Lab, said in the response: Yuga Labs will begin the process of sunsetting support for OpenSea’s SeaPort for all upgradable contracts and any new collections, with the aim of this being complete in February 2024 in tandem with OpenSea’s approach. Alegre noted that while the purpose of NFTs has been to revolutionize true ownership of digital assets, it has also been about empowering artists and creators. “Yuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,” he added. Yuga Labs’ stance will likely be a significant blow to OpenSea, but perhaps not one the marketplace wouldn&#8217;t have foreseen. In January, the BAYC creators blacklisted about four marketplaces &#8211; with an optional royalty model &#8211; from its Sewer Pass collection. OpenSea Halts Support For The BNB Smart Chain OpenSea also recently announced its decision to disable the minting and listing of NFTs on the BNB smart chain. According to the post on X, this move was informed by the marketplace&#8217;s “need to align resources with the most promising efforts”.

					<description><![CDATA[According to Bloomberg, in a key development for the cryptocurrency industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly set to allow the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ethereum (ETH) futures. This move marks a significant win for numerous firms that have long sought to introduce such products. While the SEC has previously hesitated to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies, the decision to greenlight an Ethereum futures ETF could have profound implications for Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a non-security.  This development also holds potential ramifications for other cryptocurrencies, as the SEC&#8217;s stance on where the line between security and non-security lies becomes a subject of litigation. Ethereum Paradigm Shift According to Bloomberg’s report, sources familiar with the matter claim the SEC is unlikely to block the ETFs based on futures contracts for Ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Related Reading: More Blood Ahead?
