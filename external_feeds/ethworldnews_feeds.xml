<ul><li>Celsius’ creditors are seeking a judge’s help to get info on FTX users involved in a series of suspicious trades.&nbsp;</li><li>The Unsecured Creditors Committee believes that the trades manipulated the price of the CEL token.&nbsp;</li><li>The creditors want to subpoena FTX to demand information related to the users behind the wallets that executed the suspicious trades.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Celsius Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors is seeking the help of a New York bankruptcy judge to get information related to a series of suspicious trades made by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-announces-ledgerx-sale-for-50-million/">FTX</a> users last year. The creditors believe that the trades manipulated the price of the bankrupt crypto lender’s native token CEL. </p>



<h2><strong>Celsius Creditors Want Info On FTX Users</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/celsius-creditors-seek-to-unmask-suspicious-ftx-crypto-trades#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the latest bankruptcy hearing of Celsius saw its creditor committee enter an application in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking permission to issue subpoenas to FTX, the Bahamas-based crypto exchange which collapsed in November last year. As per the <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174904262380000000129.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a>, the subpoenas are to get information about the FTX users who made suspicious trades last year. </p>



<p>The defunct lender’s creditors stated in court that ten crypto wallets belonging to said FTX users executed a series of suspicious CEL trades between April and August last year, which led to a considerable fluctuation in the token’s price. The trades carry significant value for Celsius’ bankruptcy case because some of them were made between the date on which the platform’s withdrawals were paused and the date when the lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Subpoenas request information on the identities and user accounts of the entities or individuals associated with the Identified FTX Wallets associated with all short positions with respect to CEL Tokens on the FTX Exchange from April 1, 2022, to August 30, 2022.” </p><cite>Court filing by Celsius Creditors Committee</cite></blockquote>



<p>The trades bring under question the fair market value of the CEL token on bankruptcy day. The current bankruptcy plan by the company valued CEL at 20 cents on the petition date. The creditors have disputed the value of CEL, citing the suspicious trades that may have manipulated the token’s price. </p>

<p>Franklin Templeton has launched its OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-launch-v3-polygon-zkevm/">Polygon</a>, arguably the most popular Ethereum scaling solution. The New York-based investment giant, which boasts a whopping $1.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), announced earlier today that its OnChain market fund was supported on Ethereum via Polygon. </p>



<h2><strong>Franklin Templeton May Extend To Networks Beyond Polygon</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230426005743/en/Franklin-Templeton-Money-Market-Fund-Launches-on-Polygon-Blockchain" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> earlier today, Franklin Templeton described Polygon as a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain with a proven track record which will help it further the distribution of its OnChain money market fund. The expansion is part of the investment firm’s efforts to increase its operational efficiency through blockchain-integrated systems. The aim is to bring more value for the fund’s shareholders by enhancing security, reducing costs, and enabling faster transaction processing. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Extending the reach of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to Polygon enables the Fund to be further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem, specifically through an Ethereum-based blockchain.” </p><cite>Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Going live on Polygon will help Franklin Templeton tap into the Ethereum ecosystem which gives access to a $260 billion market. The fund’s first blockchain debut came in 2021 when it was launched on the Stellar network. The OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund is the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One share of the fund is represented by one BENJI token. BENJI token holders can gain exposure to the money market fund in digital wallets using the Benji investments application. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson believes that the future of the crypto industry will be regulated and that industry players need to accept it. Her comments came during the Consensus Festival earlier today.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The CEO of Bittrex Global has revealed his company’s plans to fight the charges filed by the U.S. SEC. </li><li>CEO Oliver Linch believes that the securities regulator is mistaken in charging the crypto exchange with the violation of securities laws.</li><li>Linch has maintained that his company never served any customers in the United States.  </li></ul>



<p>The latest crypto firm <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-bittrex-violation-federal-laws/">sued</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly planning to fight back in court. Oliver Linch, the Chief Executive of Bittrex Global, has stated his company’s plans to fight against the allegations leveled by the securities regulator last month. </p>



<h2><strong>Bittrex CEO: The SEC Is Mistaken</strong></h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/26/bittrex-global-ceo-says-firm-will-fight-sec-charges-did-not-serve-us-customers/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinDesk</a>, Bittrex CEO Oliver Linch revealed that his company plans to vigorously defend against the charges brought by the SEC. According to Linch, the securities regulator is mistaken in its decision to charge Bittrex, its former CEO and an associated platform, with violation of local securities law. </p>



<p>The SEC sued Bittrex, its former CEO Bill Shihara, and Bittrex Global earlier this month, for allegedly operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The regulatory agency also charged the exchange’s foreign affiliate Bittrex Global, for failing to register as a national securities exchange. The SEC alleged that the foreign affiliate catered to clients in the United States by operating a single shared order book with the U.S. exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking on the alleged shared order book, Linch believes that the SEC hasn’t offered a sufficient explanation as to what the underlying issue is. “We think that they&#8217;re mistaken in the way they conceive of it legally and in terms of facts,” he added. The CEO further revealed that the regulator did not allow his company to explain the facts of the matter before getting sued.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Bittrex was an entirely separate legal entity and only provided services in the U.S. and only served U.S. customers. And they&#8217;re the ones that have had to shut down their operations… Global continues on providing the services to rest-of-world clients as it ever has.” </p><cite>Oliver Linch, <strong><strong>CEO</strong></strong> of <strong>Bittrex Global </strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>The complaint filed by the SEC on April 17, 2023, alleged that between 2017 and 2022, the crypto exchange generated at least $1.3 billion in revenues through transaction fees from investors while offering services as an unregistered exchange. Furthermore, the SEC alleged that the former CEO worked with crypto asset issuers who wanted to get their tokens listed, to scrub “problematic statements” from their offering materials to avoid attention from regulators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Circle announced its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol or CCTP to allow asset transfers between Ethereum’s blockchain and the Avalanche network.</li><li>USDC users will be able to move stablecoins across Ethereum and Avalanche using CCTP, increasing Circle’s utility across multiple chains.</li><li>The stablecoin issuer released its latest market structure upgrade weeks after a U.S. banking crisis rocked USDC’s market cap but CEO Jeremy Allaire said the company came out stronger.</li></ul>



<p>USDC issuer Circle <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1651212222973071362?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1651212222973071362?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unveiled</a> its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol or CCTP to allow stablecoin token transfers between Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain and Avalanche. CCTP is the latest market structure upgrade from the crypto payments company after a U.S. banking crisis shook confidence in USD Coin (USDC), crypto&#8217;s second largest stablecoin by market cap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today marks a new milestone! Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CCTP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">#CCTP</a>) is now on mainnet for <a href="https://twitter.com/ethereum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/avax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@Avax</a>. <a href="https://t.co/ExIAWywNGt" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/ExIAWywNGt</a></p>&mdash; Circle (@circle) <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1651212222973071362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>CCTP: No Bridge, No Problem</h2>



<p>CCTP works by burning USDC tokens on one chain, Ethereum for instance, and minting the equivalent token amount on another chain like Avalanche. This allows users to move USDC between blockchains, essentially increasing Circle&#8217;s multi-chain utility. </p>



<p>The protocol improves security by opting for a more crypto-native mechanism of burning and minting. Prior to the protocol&#8217;s release, users would have to rely on cross-chain bridges that leverage &#8220;wrapping&#8221;, a method with loopholes that cyber criminals exploit in some cases.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>CCTP removes the need to bridge USDC via traditional lock-and-mint approaches, improves liquidity across the blockchain ecosystem, and enables developers to provide their users a seamless and secure experience moving USDC natively across chains.</p></blockquote>



<p>USDC is a crucial off-ramp tool that allows crypto users to cash out from their virtual currencies into fiat like the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT also provide a cushion to soften market volatility, making it possible to users and traders to retain monetary value in the case of market meltdowns. </p>



<h2>Circle Upgrade&#8217;s Structure After US Banking Crisis</h2>



<p>Investor confidence in Circle and its USDC stablecoin dipped after Silicon Valley Bank suffered a bank run in March, trapping around <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-may-recover-3-3-billion-from-svb/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-may-recover-3-3-billion-from-svb/" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3.3 billion in USDC reserves</a> over a weekend. The matter was later resolved although Circle&#8217;s token temporarily its peg to the U.S. dollar.</p>



<p>USDC&#8217;s reserve fell some $10 billion since the debacle but Circle CEO Jeremey Allaire insists that the company has come out stronger. Allaire shared these remarks during the CoinDesk Consensus conference in Austin, Texas. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We&#8217;ve successfully navigated this crisis, and have actually upgraded the market infrastructure behind USDC to be by far the strongest, safest digital dollar on the internet today, hands down, there&#8217;s no question.</p></blockquote>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Authorities in the Bahamas are working on drafting and implementing improved laws to govern crypto businesses in the country.</li><li>The move comes months after FTX, a major crypto exchange domiciled in the Bahamas, collapsed and wiped out tens of millions in investments.</li><li>FTX’s crash became a lightning rod for regulators who favor regulations that boot out crypto from the broader financial system.</li></ul>



<p>Bahamas regulators are in the process of redrafting crypto regulations to impose stricter policies and protect investors in the aftermath of FTX&#8217;s crash, the crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. </p>



<p>In 2020, the country unveiled its Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges or DARE regulation to promote digital innovation and encourage crypto businesses to set up shop locally. </p>



<p>These regulations were revisited after SBF&#8217;s FTX crashed last November and incinerated hundreds of millions of investor funds. According to a <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">consultation paper</a> released on Tuesday, the new law would bring in a new and comprehensive regulatory framework for overseeing stablecoin, staking services, and mining businesses.</p>



<p>Also, operators of a digital asset exchange must ensure the systems used in its activities are appropriate for the scale of its business under the new proposed laws. </p>



<p>Executive director of the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB), Christina Rolle, said the bill would be “among the most advanced pieces of digital asset legislation in the world,”  if it passes. </p>



<h2>Bahamas On Alert After FTX</h2>



<p>The collapse of Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX has seemingly sparked concern and has galvanized the Bahamas to tighten their crypto laws. Charges from U.S. authorities allege that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried along with <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty/" rel="noreferrer noopener">other executives</a> defrauded users, and investors and violated U.S. campaign donation policies. </p>



<p>After filing for bankruptcy in November, Bankman-Fried was arrested in December and then extradited to the U.S. for criminal prosecution. </p>



<p>The FTX collapse is said to be one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. At a press conference in Manhattan, the US attorney for the southern district of new york, Damian Williams, alleged that the former chief executive and others stole billions of dollars from the company&#8217;s customers to make personal investments and to finance expenses and debts of his private trading firm, Alameda Research.</p>



<p>SBF could face a lifetime behind bars if found guilty on charges from the 13-count indictment levied by federal prosecutors. Bankman-Fried has notably pleaded &#8220;<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/not-guilty-sam-bankman-fried-charges-ftx/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/not-guilty-sam-bankman-fried-charges-ftx/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Not guilty</a>&#8221; to the charges. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Avalanche L1 network shipped a key upgrade to better the network for developers and blockchain builders.</li><li>The upgrade called Cortina migrated the X-chain on Avalanche so that the whole blockchain now runs on a single consensus engine.</li><li>AVAX, the native asset on this blockchain, jumped 5% in price after Cortina went live on the mainnet on April 25.</li></ul>



<p>Layer 1 proof-of-stake network Avalanche shipped the Cortina upgrade to the blockchain&#8217;s mainnet as part of the project&#8217;s roadmap. Cortina was <a href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/cortina-x-chain-linearization-a1d9305553f6" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/cortina-x-chain-linearization-a1d9305553f6" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">designed</a> to bootstrap the network for efficiency and incentivize developer activity. This is achieved by optimizing the network that AVAX runs atop. </p>



<p>Around 11 AM ET on April 25, Cortina went live on the mainnet and upgraded to Avalanche Go v1.10.0. According to the core team, this represents the node implementation stack for the entire chain. </p>



<p>Cortina was first rehearsed on the Fuji testnet. Developers published a pre-release code for the upgrade that was activated back on April 6. The upgrade also refines the delegation of fees among validators who chose to stake after Cortina, introducing batch rewards. </p>



<p>AVAX, the native asset on this blockchain, jumped 5% in price after Cortina went live on the mainnet on April 25. The crypto coin traded above $17 during trading hours on Wednesday. AVAX also spiked in price as leading token Bitcoin (BTC) clawed back into the $29,000 range following more U.S. banking sector uncertainty. </p>

<h2>Single Consensus Engine For Avalanche Post-Cortina</h2>



<p>Yesterday&#8217;s Cortina upgrade implemented changes across the primary chains on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/amazon-and-avalanche-to-bring-scalable-blockchain-solutions-to-enterprises-and-governments/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/amazon-and-avalanche-to-bring-scalable-blockchain-solutions-to-enterprises-and-governments/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avalanche</a>. For starters, one of the chains known as the X-Chain can now run a consensus model called Snowman++. The two other chains, P-Chain which is the platform chain and C-Chain which manages contracts also run Snowman++. </p>



<p>This means that the entire network now runs on a single consensus engine. Furthermore, the gas limit on the C-chain bumped up from 8 million to 15 million. This will allow developers to build and ship decentralized apps or dApps that require more intricate designs. </p>

<ul><li>FTX debtors have reached an agreement with an affiliate of Miami International Holdings to sell LedgerX.&nbsp;</li><li>LedgerX will be sold to M7 Holdings for $50 million after it emerged as the top bidder in the exchange’s bankruptcy auction.&nbsp;</li><li>FTX US acquired LedgerX’s parent firm for $298 million back in 2021.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>FTX is set to sell its futures and options exchange and clearinghouse unit LedgerX to an affiliate of Miami International Holdings. The bankrupt crypto firm and its associated debtors reached an agreement with M7 Holdings LLC to sell the crypto derivatives exchange after M7 Holdings emerged as the top bidder during the exchange’s bankruptcy auction. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX&#8217;s Deal Is Subject To Approval From The Bankruptcy Court</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-announce-agreement-with-an-affiliate-of-miami-international-holdings-for-the-sale-of-ledgerx-301807349.html" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from FTX earlier today, the LedgerX deal was agreed upon after a comprehensive sales process as part of the Bahamas-based exchange’s Chapter 11 proceedings that included multiple bidders. The total proceeds from this transaction is expected to be approximately $50 million. Court filings show that a sale hearing was initially scheduled for April 12, but was postponed two days ahead of the hearing. The deal is subject to approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are pleased to reach this agreement with MIH, which is an example of our continuing efforts to monetize assets to deliver recoveries to stakeholders.&#8221; </p><cite>John Ray III, CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX. </cite></blockquote>



<p>Ledger Holdings, the parent company of LedgerX, was acquired by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-brett-harrison-trading-hub-crypto/">FTX US</a> in 2021 for a whopping $298 million. Crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, a part of the parent firm, announced in September last year that it would return external capital to investors and continue managing the $400 million in assets under management (AUM) it had at the time. LedgerX reportedly had a trading and clearing revenue of $1.2 million and a negative EBITDA of $17 million in 2022. </p>

<ul><li>Binance US has sent a letter to Voyager informing it of the termination of the purchase deal.&nbsp;</li><li>The $1 billion deal to acquire Voyager Digital has faced multiple hurdles including objections from federal regulators.&nbsp;</li><li>Voyager has stated that it will directly distribute its remaining assets to customers via its platform.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The termination of Binance US’ $1 billion deal to acquire the assets of Voyager Digital has become the latest development for the crypto lender, which is currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. Binance’s American arm drove the final nail into the billion-dollar asset purchase deal earlier today by sending a letter to Voyager, revealing that the deal had been called off.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Voyager Will Directly Distribute Remaining Assets To Customers</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> thread earlier today, Voyager stated that it was disappointed by Binance US’ decision to terminate the asset purchase agreement. The bankrupt crypto lender now plans to initiate self-liquidation, in line with its Chapter 11 plan. The firm will directly distribute its remaining cash and crypto assets to customers using the Voyager platform. In the meantime, the Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors stated that it will explore potential claims against Binance US. </p>



<p>Voyager Digital acknowledged the termination of the deal in a <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175304252380000000171.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made earlier today in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Binance US’ letter to the bankrupt crypto lender didn’t mention the reason for the termination of the deal. The legal notice did highlight the fact that since the purchase agreement hadn’t been executed till April 18, 2023, the exchange was no longer bound to go through with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement posted on Twitter, Binance US revealed that it made the “difficult decision to exercise its right to terminate the asset purchase deal due to the current regulatory landscape for the crypto industry in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>While our hope throughout this process was to help Voyager&#8217;s customers access their crypto in kind, the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community.”</p><cite>Binance US</cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="qme" dir="ltr">🤷‍♂️</p>&mdash; CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1650941963955236887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Binance US’ decision to call off the deal comes less than a week after federal regulators in the United States stopped their efforts to get the deal suspended through a court order. Interestingly, when a crypto influencer suggested that the exchange’s decision to pull out of the acquisition deal was part of the conditions for an imminent settlement in the case filed against Binance by the CFTC, CEO Changpeng Zhao neither confirmed nor denied the influencer’s hunch. CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-official-settlement-binance-lawsuit/">indicated</a> in an interview earlier today that she hadn’t ruled out the possibility of a settlement in the lawsuit and was hoping to find a “path forward” with the exchange. </p>

<ul><li>The CFTC is reportedly in communication with Binance over the ongoing lawsuit regarding the exchange’s conduct.</li><li>Commissioner Kristin Johnson revealed that the regulator hopes to find a path forward with the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The commissioner didn’t rule out the possibility of a settlement with the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may choose to settle its lawsuit against the world’s largest crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/jane-street-binance-vip-in-cftc-lawsuit/">Binance </a>and its Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao. In an interview with CNBC, CFTC Commission Kristin Johnson revealed some positive developments in the case that may lead to a solution out of court in the future. </p>



<h2><strong>CFTC Is Talking To Binance About The Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/cftc-commissioner-hopes-to-find-path-forward-in-binance-lawsuit.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson revealed that the commodities regulator has been in “continuing conversations” with Binance. The content of these conversations reportedly includes the regulator’s take on the potentially problematic business conduct of Zhao’s crypto exchange. The exchange has also been in talks with the CFTC to explain their side of the case in an effort to find a path forward. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I want to be really careful not to prejudge what will actually happen in the litigation. And I want to say that typically, in the context of any litigation, we are always ready to have conversations and typically even ahead of the litigation.”</p><cite>Kristin N. Johnson, CFTC Commissioner </cite></blockquote>



<p>While no decision has been taken yet on whether to settle the lawsuit against Binance or not, Commissioner Johnson stated that she hopes to find a “path forward” in this matter. Her statement marked the first time that a CFTC official commented on the Binance lawsuit since it was filed on March 27, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked about the regulatory landscape for crypto in the United States, the CFTC official stated that she was counting on Congress to come up with crypto-specific regulations soon. “Under immediately existing laws, there is provision to understand how securities laws would apply to any digital assets that qualify as securities. And those (are) the same in the context of commodities&#8221; she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A Gibraltar court ruled for crypto exchanges to work with liquidators from beleaguered crypto trader Globix as the platform hopes to recover $43 million in digital assets. </li><li>The court asked Binance to freeze suspected transfers linked to funds that liquidators say went missing last year. </li><li>Crypto exchanges Bitstamp, <a href="http://crypto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crypto.com</a>, and Kraken were ordered to identify certain account holders, per an April 13 court ruling cited by the Financial Times. </li></ul>



<p>Globix, a cryptocurrency trading venue that filed for liquidation on the 10th of March 2023 has secured a court order that freezes digital assets and incentivizes crypto exchanges to hand over customer information as they search for $43 million of missing funds. </p>



<p>Following an extensive investigation into the alleged theft, a Gibraltar court ordered Binance, to halt attempts to move assets from several Globix-linked crypto wallets. The court has also ordered Bitstamp, crypto.com, and Kraken to identify account owners linked to the collapsed crypto trader and hand over customer information.</p>



<h2>Globix in Gibraltar</h2>



<p>Miracle World was a crypto exchange operating as “Globix” or “Globix Cash”, with investors in Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>The crypto trader was trying to carve a niche in crypto investing by letting customers choose automated trading strategies and pick attractively valued tokens. This plan was interrupted as a crisis of confidence gripped the crypto market, causing several major crypto tokens including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to lose a chunk of their value. </p>



<p>Several once-prominent firms in the crypto landscape also filed for bankruptcy due to the ripple effects of this market shakedown. </p>



<p>After the crypto market crisis in 2022, Globix closed its doors to investors in June last year. Daniel Carreras, the sole shareholder, and director, also a Gilbraltarian citizen, voluntarily put Globix into liquidation last month after a prolonged period of struggling to pay investors. He said the company suffered digital theft and plans to recover the funds by working with the necessary authorities. </p>



<p>It is believed that this is the first time an injunction in relation to crypto assets has been made in Gibraltar. While the country has previously developed plans of becoming a global crypto hub, the failure of several major crypto firms in Singapore and FTX in the Bahamas has pushed financial centers to reassess regulatory policies. </p>



<p>Globix was not licensed by the local regulators but its current situation has seemingly called into question whether the architects of Gibraltar’s crypto ambitions can adequately identify risks to consumers. The government of Gibraltar said the case demonstrates the need for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gibraltar-authorities-release-10th-regulatory-principle-to-tackle-market-manipulation/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gibraltar-authorities-release-10th-regulatory-principle-to-tackle-market-manipulation/" rel="noreferrer noopener">firms to be licensed and supervised.</a>  </p>
