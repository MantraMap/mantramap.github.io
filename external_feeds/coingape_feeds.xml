A reversal from this FIB support is considered healthy for the long bull, offering buyers an opportunity to recuperate the bullish momentum. Can the current recovery cycle in Ethereum price surpass the last swing high of $2130? </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum Fear and Greed index at 60% reflects a positive sign to prolong the bullish rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bullish breakout from 1948 will kickstart a new recovery cycle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.8 Billion, indicating a 4.8 gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/UEul1aJb.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 25th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum price</a> bounced back from the $1800 support and surged 5.5% higher to currently trade at $1923. Despite a 1% price jump today, the ETH price struggles to surpass the flipped resistance of $1948, indicating the sellers are actively defending this barrier</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price breaks the $1948 barrier, the buyers will gain an early sign of uptrend resumption. With sustained buying, the ETH price may break another minor resistance of $2015 and challenge the last swing high of $2136.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-carbon-negative-cryptos/">Top 10 Carbon Negative Cryptos For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A daily candle closing above the aforementioned supply zone is crucial for buyers to regain trend control. Considering the trader’s own capital and risk appetite the buyer can maintain stoploss below the low of the breakout candle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential rally may push the ETH price to $2400 or $2576 high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the selling pressure is at the $1948 resistance a potential reversal may encourage sellers to form a famous bearish pattern called <a href="https://coingape.com/education/head-and-shoulder-pattern-how-to-identify-it-on-a-crypto-chart/">head and shoulder</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent correction, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) line sustainability above the midline reflect the overall market trend bullish.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> acts as strong dynamic support during the occasional pullback in a bullish trend.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1930</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $2000 and $2136</span></li>

Thus, the largest crypto <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> witnessed strong buying pressure and surged 8.3% higher to reach the current price of $29200. Can this recovery surpass the last swing high of $30600 and prolong the bullish rally?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bullish breakout from the $30650 barrier may set the Bitcoin price at 13% before hitting a significant resistance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent correction, the 50-day EMA offers suitable pullback support. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $10.5 Billion, indicating a 23% loss\.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/BvaDxaO5.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent recovery in <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> has nearly undermined last week&#8217;s correction, increasing the possibility of buyers challenging the $30600 peak. The buyers also breached a local resistance of $28800 offering an additional confirmation for a 5% rise to hit the aforementioned resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout from the $30600 offers an entry opportunity and intensifies the buying pressure to set the price rally to $32400, followed by $34500 or $37500. By considering their own capital and risk appetite, the long traders can put stoploss below the $30000 support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-upcoming-binance-listing/">15 New Cryptocurrencies In Upcoming Binance Listing For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> shows a triple bearish divergence indicating underlying bullish momentum in weakening. Thus, interested buyers must remain cautious at $30600 as any sign may of a famous bearish pattern called a double top and tumble of the Bitcoin price to $25000 psychological support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Fibonacci retracement level: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent correction in the Bitcoin price rebounded from 23.6% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">FIB</a> is considered healthy for a long bull run.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the rising <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(20, 50, 100, and 200) indicate the buyers hold multiple support to sustain a bullish rally during occasional pullbacks.</span></p>

Here’s how interested trades may trade this pattern to grab the upcoming recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The space between the triangle pattern is narrowed enough to consider a no-trading zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout from either trendline of the triangle pattern is needed to trigger a direction move</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the HBAR coin is $204.5 Million, indicating a 104% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/yzASHOs8.png" alt="HBAR Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of the symmetrical triangle pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/hedera-hashgraph/">Hedera price</a> spread is narrowing within two converging trendlines. The price has reached nearly the peak of the triangle and is poised for a breakout move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a higher possibility, a breakout above the overhead trendline will signal the continuation of the prior uptrend. A daily candle closing above the trendline will offer buyers a strong launchpad to jump higher.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-upcoming-binance-listing/">15 New Cryptocurrencies In Upcoming Binance Listing For 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential rally may surge the altcoin to $0.07, $0.079, or $0.1 recording a max gain of 55%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below the pattern’s support trendline could worsen the situation for HBAR. This breakdown may also plunge the coin price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and accelerate the selling pressure.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) slope wavering around the midline indicates indecisiveness among market participants.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-and-200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope above the HBAR reflects the market sentiment is bearish.</span></p>

<h2>Drop In Shiba Inu Burn Rate A Major Concern?</h2>
<p>Data depicts that Shiba Inu price has been stagnant over the last 60 days. SHIB has failed to breach the $0.00001183 price level since March 3, 2023. The ongoing price decline has left the SHIBArmy disappointed. This directly reflects in plummeting burn rate.</p>
<p>According to the tracker, Shiba Inu burn rate has dropped by 70% in the last 24 hours. Only One million SHIB has been to a dead wallet in a single transaction. However, the tracker reported just 2.56 million SHIB being burnt on April 29, 2023. While Zero Shiba Inu coin burn was reported on April 27, 2023. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shiba-inu-shib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Shiba Inu News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<p>The cumulative decline in Shiba inu Coin burn rate mirrors the enthusiasm among the SHIB holders regarding its much anticipated metaverse project. Shiba Inu is trading at an average price of $0.000010, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume is down by 20% to stand at $65.5 million. However, it is important to note that SHIB price is up by over 26% on Year to Date (YTD) basis.</p>

<p>At the same time, Ethereum Whales seems to be confident in holding the Shiba Inu coin amid the price drop. As per the data, the biggest 100 ETH whale wallets are holding around $601 million worth of SHIB. It is the Biggest token position by dollar value by the top 100 Ethereum whales. It makes almost 12% of these wallets&#8217; total holdings.</p>

Vogelsteller’s tweet was in response to a tweet by a Twitter user, Eddie Roach who noted that all of the core contributors to Ethereum have gone on to establish their own blockchain protocols.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Roach&#8217;s tweet listed Vitalik Buterin, the primary developer of the Ethereum protocol, Gavin Wood, Polkadot’s founder, Vogelsteller and Hoskinson. Disagreeing with the claims made by Roach, Vogelsteller said Charles Hoskinson;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;was never really a founder of ethereum. He built literally nothing for ethereum that I am aware of. He was just early on at the right place, at the time, hanging out. So I would remove him from the pic as well.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">To correct this picture a little bit:<a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VitalikButerin</a> is the ethereum founder, so he doesn’t count. <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@IOHK_Charles</a> was never really a founder of ethereum. He built literally nothing for ethereum that I am aware of. He was just early on at the right place, at the time, hanging… <a href="https://t.co/zHFV4zLANR">https://t.co/zHFV4zLANR</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) <a href="https://twitter.com/feindura/status/1652241094451642368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the claims riled the community in a way, Vogelsteller clarified that his position was not based on an attempt to offend anyone, but from pure facts. The developer is the founder of the Lukso Network. The protocol is branded as a “next generation EVM blockchain based on Casper PoS that will revolutionize the way brands, creators and users interact in Web3 and with blockchain technology in the New Creative Economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Lukso is relatively obscure when compared to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/polkadot-dot-price-gunning-for-a-70/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Polkadot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and Cardano, the developer is optimistic that the protocol will be comparable to the others in the next 2 years.</span></p>
<h2><b>Charles Hoskinson Responds</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Vogelsteller had the right to claim a spot among the developers of Ethereum being the main person that developed ERC20 and Web3.0.js, the discount on Hoskinson’s role has been met with sarcasm by the Cardano founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Responding to the tweet, Hoskinson wrote;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks Fabian. Glad to get your opinion on my worth and contributions. I suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether. Also given my profound incompetence, I&#8217;d love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self manifest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sort of strife that the conversation spurred has been frowned at by some industry observers. Top crypto leaders like Binance CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao </span><a href="https://coingape.com/binance-ceo-cz-calls-crypto-industry-fud/"><span style="font-weight: 400">regularly advocate shunning FUD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and embracing unity in order to help propel the broader industry.</span></p>

The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Federal Reserve</a>’s meeting will be followed by jobless claims data and unemployment rate between May 4-5, 2023. While the market expects a 25 bps hike for the last time in a series of target rate hikes, any signs of dovish outlook going into June 2023 Fed meeting could keep the markets buoyed. However, there could be a bear trap event around the Fed rate decision, as the new target rate is likely to be 5-5.25% as against the central bank’s target of keeping inflation down to 2%.</p>

<p>Also, traders expect that cooling inflation and stability in the job market could trigger a Fed rate hike pause when the central bank meets again on June 14, 2023, for the FOMC meeting. If the rate hike pause takes effect, the crypto market could potentially take a bullish position in anticipation of what could be a Fed pivot, which means rate cuts in further meetings.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Bullish In Next 45 Days?</h2>
<p>As the market expects a rate hike pause in the June 14 meeting, any indication of a dovish stance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the post FOMC press conference could be key for setting the market mood for the next 45 days. However, further fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and jobs data could dent the prospects of a rate hike pause in near future. Earlier, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-price-analysis-hints-more-4-5-fall-this-week-is-it-time-to-reaccumulate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Bitcoin price could see resistance at $31000 level, as against the current price range of $29,243.</p>
<p>As per the CME FedWatch Tool, as many as 84% of the respondents are <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expecting</a> that the US Fed takes a 25 bps hike decision in the May 3 meeting. Hence, a rate hike on expected lines may likely trigger a Bitcoin price drop, before taking an upward path, depending on Powell’s comments. Already, Goldman Sachs economists said they don’t expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June 2023. Hence, the next 45 days could overall be bullish for Bitcoin price, even as many predict BTC to go as high as $100,000.</p>

This comes after its key developer, Edward Kim, shared images of the whitepaper for the AI chain called Block Entropy on Saturday.</p>
<h2>LUNC&#8217;s New Block Entropy AI App</h2>
<p>Although details are pretty vague at the moment, Kim mentioned that the TestNet playground &#8212; a simulation tool that allows users to test and explore &#8212; will go public sometime next month and will only support a limited number of &#8220;machine-learning inference tasks&#8221; like AI image diffusion, text language models, and even be able to generate music.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Just-In: Elon Musk Unveils New Twitter Feature That Could Benefit Crypto Influencers" href="https://coingape.com/just-in-elon-musk-unveils-new-twitter-feature-that-could-benefit-crypto-influencers/" rel="bookmark">Elon Musk Unveils New Twitter Feature That Could Benefit Crypto Influencers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>While a full release of the whitepaper is expected to happen soon, Kim highlighted that advancements in distributed training mechanisms, Python APIs, SNARK verification methods and further fine-tuning modules for generating better results would not be released initially and are slated to launch in subsequent phases.</p>
<h2>Accessing Block Entropy&#8217;s Testnet</h2>
<p>However, access to TestNet is not free for all. A user must first send real LUNC tokens to a distinct <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-does-burning-crypto-mean-how-token-burn-impacts-investors/">burn address</a> and then submit the transaction hash into the TestNet faucet in order to acquire access. According to Kim, this will serve as a preview of the much-anticipated burn faucet that will be deployed sometime later next month. The quantity of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/lunc/">LUNC</a> that you burn will be proportional to the number of testnet tokens that you get in return and these can only be utilized for machine learning activities, as they have no proprietary value of their own.</p>
<p>In addition, Kim highlights the fact that the Interchain Accounts (ICA) module, which is an essential element in the development, has already been completed and is presently undergoing testing on the LUNC L1 TestNet. This will be then followed by the approval of a governance proposal and subsequent coordination with the Joint L1 Task Force Team in order to include ICA in LUNC.</p>
<p>In light of this LUNC news, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic">price of Terra Classic</a> is presently exchanging hands at $0.0001114 which represents a gain of 0.64% in the past 24 hours as opposed to an increase of 0.41% recorded over the last seven days.</p>

In 2021, the bank announced a partnership with Ripple as part of its plan to swiftly improve cross-border payments and remittance services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, the collaboration between ChinaBank and QNB in utilizing Ripple&#8217;s ODL, emphasizes the rising popularity of blockchain-based solutions in the international remittance sector.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ripple&#8217;s ODL Payment Solution</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ripple&#8217;s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) payment solution uses digital assets, such as XRP, to enable real-time cross-border payments. It functions by first converting one currency into XRP, and then converting that XRP into the desired currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through this method, the need for conventional correspondent banking relationships is removed, along with the costs and delays that go along with them. In comparison to standard cross-border payment methods, ODL is a quick, effective, and affordable option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, Ripple’s ODL has been launched across several countries to improve payment transactions. In 2021, the payment platform </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-launches-first-on-demand-liquidity-odl-corridor-in-japan/"><span style="font-weight: 400">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> its services in Japan. At the time, Ripple said it hopes that the first implementation of ODL in Japan would help it accelerate the adoption of the popular tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Similarly, Ripple </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-expands-further-in-europe-xrp-price-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last year that it has expanded its ODL services to Europe, specifically to France and Sweden. According to the announcement, LemonWay, a payment service for online marketplaces based in France, will leverage RippleNet&#8217;s ODL to improve its payment process by using XRP. Additionally, Swedish money transfer provider Xbaht will use ODL to provide instant and low-cost retail remittances.</span></p>

Despite its stellar performance in the first few months of 2023, Bitcoin seems unsure of its future direction. The vital 50-day moving average for Bitcoin, which is placed at $27,000, has provided some support for the cryptocurrency. As a result, this has led to a rally with the objective of smashing through the crucial resistance level of $30K. However, although the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">crypto market</a> currently appears to be optimistic, there still remains the possibility of a rejection from this price bracket.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Price Volatility</h2>
<p>In the early part of this week, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price of Bitcoin</a> soared back above $30,000, which got the Bitcoin maximalists or <em>maxis</em> in short extremely thrilled. Unfortuitously, the marginal spike in price was quickly forgotten on news of major crypto players shifting out of the United States due to regulatory uncertainty. This led to a decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s value as it bid farewell to $30K and traded to the lower end of $26,000.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Just-In: Elon Musk Unveils New Twitter Feature That Could Benefit Crypto Influencers" href="https://coingape.com/just-in-elon-musk-unveils-new-twitter-feature-that-could-benefit-crypto-influencers/" rel="bookmark">Elon Musk Unveils New Twitter Feature That Could Benefit Crypto Influencers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As things stand, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price movement exerts weakness because the optimistic attitude does not appear to be adequate to break through the next key resistance zone. If BTC is able to successfully defend its current price level of $29K, only then a protracted fresh rally could be foreseen.</p>
<h2>BTC Price To Drop Further?</h2>
<p>The volume of Bitcoin Futures trading, on the other hand, is nine times more than that of Bitcoin&#8217;s Spot trading and as a result, the market has become more susceptible to changes in price. According to a prominent market expert who goes by the alias Maartunn on Twitter, pointed out that the trading volume in the futures market is approximately 900K on a daily basis, while the volume in future trading is approximately 100K.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Volatility Ahead: Ratio between Spot/Futures Volume hits an all-time high <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f631.png" alt="😱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The volume in Bitcoin Futures Trading is 9 times as high as in Bitcoin Spot Trading, making the market more responsive to price fluctuations.<a href="https://t.co/4VaXxiqOxo">https://t.co/4VaXxiqOxo</a> <a href="https://t.co/pbfOQSpZP4">pic.twitter.com/pbfOQSpZP4</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1652365009421213698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The primary reason for this massive disparity, as per Maartunn&#8217;s analysis, is that the Binance exchange recently disabled its zero-fee spot trading on the majority of their crypto pairs. This, in turn, has resulted in a significant decrease in the volume of spot trading on <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> which throws off the ratio and causes it to be &#8220;out-of-sync&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition to this, he mentions that during the times in the past when the Bitcoin dominance ratio was high in comparison to the period before it, it was roughly seven times close to the top while just once near the bottom in July 2021. In his concluding notes, he makes the bold observation that &#8220;it is guaranteed that we will see a period of extreme volatility.&#8221;</p>

The coin price bounced four times from the overhead resistance and twice from the support level reflecting indecisiveness among market participants. Here’s how you may trade this memecoin amid market uncertainty.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shiba Inu will remain sideways until the price is trapped within the $0.0000117 and $0.0000098 level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish divergence in the MACD indicator reflects a higher possibility for an upside breakout from range formation </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $101.4 Million, showing a 41% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/WFfPflrj.png" alt="SHIB Price Prediction" width="1813" height="818" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market, the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/AtzlZDgl/" rel="nofollow">Shiba Inu price</a> witnessed a significant correction in late April and plunged to local support of $0.0000098. Since last week, the coin price has been hovering above the aforementioned support trying to replenish the bullish momentum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the SHIB price trades at $0.0000102 with an intraday gain of 0.39%. If the buyers manage to sustain above this support, the prices may trigger a new bull cycle within this range and surge the altcoin 15% higher to hit the $0.0000117 ceiling.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-upcoming-binance-listing/">15 New Cryptocurrencies In Upcoming Binance Listing For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, for the altcoin to escape the sideway trade the price needs to breach either of the range level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout above the $0.0000117 will soar the price another 20% to reach the $0.000014 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below $0.0000098 will prolong the downtrend by 23% down to $0.000008</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>MACD: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to sideways price action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) show an evident rise indicating growth in an underlying bullish trend and a better possibility for a $0.000017 breakout.</span></p>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SHIB price at the lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger Band indicator</a> encourages buyers for a bullish reversal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.00001027</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.0000117 and $0.000014</span></li>

This new plan is an addition to the expanding list of unconventional implementations that Twitter is using to improve its user experience and promote free speech. As a result of this change, content creators on the micro-blogging platform &#8212; such as crypto influencers &#8212; are now able to earn incentives for the contributions they make to the site.</p>
<h2>Musk Unveils Subscription Feature</h2>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s most recent modification, which emphasizes user-focused enhancements, intends to improve follower engagement and develop new revenue streams on the site by enabling people all over the world to monetize different kinds of tweets. Twitter users now have the opportunity to charge a monthly fee to their followers by using the newly launched &#8220;Subscriptions&#8221; feature. Users can choose one of the price points that Twitter has established for this service and once the payment has been processed, subscribers are granted access to the creator&#8217;s exclusive content, which is hidden from the view of the general public.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Support content creators around the world in near &amp; far away places!</p>
<p>For many this represents a vital source of income &amp; enables them to put more time into creating great content for you. <a href="https://t.co/XzrFMLPytB">https://t.co/XzrFMLPytB</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1652329936823414784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The new effort has garnered positive acclaim from crypto influencers, who might utilize the tool to publish critical fundamental or technical analyses on digital assets like tokens and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFTs</a>, as well as relay key information relating to the world of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>. Moreover, Twitter will not charge a dime and instead direct all earnings to such creators. In a response to the official tweet, the 51-year-old <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">DOGE</a> evangelist was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>All proceeds go to content creators, we keep nothing.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Elon Musk Ushers New Change</h2>
<p>Since Musk took control of Twitter, the company has implemented a number of significant changes in an effort to transform itself into a profitable business. These changes include the implementation of <a href="https://coingape.com/whats-going-on-at-twitter-layoffs-twitter-outage-doge-down/">widespread layoffs</a> as well as the launch of the <a href="https://coingape.com/doge-fan-elon-musk-twitter-blue-subscription-feature/">Twitter Blue</a> subscription service. However, Musk saw it as a critical revenue stream for the company, even though many people who had already been verified on Twitter opposed the request to pay a monthly fee in order to get a blue checkmark on their profiles.</p>
<p>In related news, Musk discussed forthcoming improvements to the messaging protocol used by Twitter. Musk highlighted the introduction of encrypted direct messages in addition to other messaging system changes that are scheduled to take place in the following week. In addition to this, Twitter is working on a feature that would enable media publishers to charge users for individual articles with the simple click of a button. This is intended to allow customers who do not wish to commit on a monthly subscription and instead pay a certain price per article for occasional reading.</p>
<p>Musk went on to say that this new development &#8220;should be a major win-win for both media organizations and the public.&#8221;</p>

Earlier, the trader <a href="https://coingape.com/legendry-trader-peter-brandt-shares-new-bitcoin-target-eth-price-soars-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that Bitcoin price was likely to reach the $40,000 range. Referring to the ups and downs in Bitcoin dominance pattern for the last two years, Brandt said he was optimistic of a huge rise in BTC price if a breakout from the current level is seen.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Bitcoin Dominance chart has now formed a 24-month rectangle with multiple upper and lower boundary contacts. For now this is the confining range. However, a decisive breakout of this range would have huge significance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Several major crypto exchanges including OKX, Huobi, Crypto.com, Gate.io, and Poloniex have listed BONE.</p>
<p>Now, the community has two questions for lead developer <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shytoshi-kusama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shytoshi Kusama</a>, when Shibarium mainnet will be released and when Binance will list BONE?</p>
<h2>Binance Can List BONE on Shytoshi Kusama&#8217;s Request</h2>
<p>The Shiba Inu team confirmed BONE as the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-shibarium-beta-is-about-to-be-launched-confirms-shiba-inu-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only gas token for Shibarium</a> transactions and a reward token for validators and delegators. Shibarium will offer the benefits of scalability, faster transaction times, lower fees, and an expanded development framework.</p>
<p>With the Shibarium mainnet launch expected by the year&#8217;s end, most things around the Shibarium blockchain will involve BONE token. In fact, validators will lock a certain number of BONE tokens to provide security and stake BONE through <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/staking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staking</a> management contracts on the Ethereum mainnet. Moreover, delegators will stake BONE into validator nodes responsible for validating transactions. The BONE token is available since July 2021 for governance and now for Shibarium.</p>

<p>Also, transactions on Shibarium will burn Shiba Inu (SHIB) token and helps boost the SHIB rate. Despite so many use cases of BONE token, Binance hasn’t listed the token even in its “innovation zone.” In order to list BONE in a founder needs to submit a listing application form.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu community has backed the project and its developers such as Shytoshi Kusama, who is now considered the leader of Shiba Inu after founder Ryoshi remains anonymous. As per a Binance <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/binance-innovation-zone--listing-updates-421499824684901014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>, Shytoshi Kusama can submit a listing application form in the absence of Ryoshi.</p>
<p>Or else, Binance can list BONE in the &#8220;innovation zone&#8221; allowing only eligible users to trade it. Binance will eventually list BONE token when SHIB developers announce the Shibarium mainnet release date, which is expected by the end of the year.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that Binance moved Shiba Inu (SHIB) out of the innovation zone on April 18. Listing BONE on the exchange can take time. Nevertheless, the listing will be massive news for the community and push the token on a bull run.</p>
<p>BONE price is currently trading at $1.03, up 9% in a week after <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-exchanges-lined-up-for-shiba-inus-bone-listing-after-okx-huobi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six exchanges including OKX</a> and Huobi listed the token.</p>

In theory, this pattern is a bearish continuation that intensifies the selling momentum if the coin price breaks the pattern’s neckline support. However, the momentum indicator RSI shows an evident divergence indicating this pattern holds an opportunity to give a bullish outcome and buying opportunities to interested traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A descending triangle pattern governs the current downtrend in Aptos price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bullish breakout from local resistance of $10.9 with encourage APT price for a 12% rise before hitting major resistance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Aptos is $245.5 Million, indicating an 87% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/j/JlvHLWVC.png" alt="Aptos Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three months, the falling Aptos coin price formed a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/descending-triangle/">descending triangle pattern</a>. Under the influence of this pattern, the coin price is strictly resonating between a downsloping trendline and horizontal support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falling trendline constantly hammering the APT price with replies selling pressure will eventually plunge the price below the neckline support of $9.8. As of now, the coin price trades at the $10.7 mark and has recently rebounded from the neckline support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish reversal may trigger a bull cycle within this pattern, which may surge the price 12% higher to test the overhead trendline. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-liquid-staking-platforms-on-ethereum/">Top 6 Liquid Staking Platforms On Ethereum</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, a daily candle closing above the support may accelerate the selling pressure and tumble the coin price 27% down to hit the $7.1 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakout above the trendline will offset the bearish thesis and encourage a fresh recovery rally. This breakout may drive the prices to a bullish rally to $14.1, followed by 16.3% recording a potential rally of 50%.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Contrary to the falling price, the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> moving reflects decreasing bearish momentum in the market. Thus, if the market sentiment improves the APT price holds a strong possibility of upside breakout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exponential Moving Average:</strong> the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(20, 50, and 100) moving above the Aptos price created multiple resistance against buyers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptos Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $10.7</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $10.9 and $12.2</span></li>

According to the HKMA, these stablecoins present larger and more immediate threats to the economic and financial stability of the nation, which is why regulating them is a priority.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Hammers Down On Stablecoins</h2>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is of the opinion that the industry may responsibly and safely explore the possibilities of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</a> if appropriate guardrails are in place. As a consequence of this, the regulatory changes will place a greater emphasis on the legalization of stablecoins and will increase the collaborative ecosystem reaction to the threats of money laundering and terrorist funding.</p>
<p>While <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/data-publications-and-research/publications/annual-report/2022/">speaking</a> about the broader crypto regulations the country seeks to bring forward in 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a priority, we will start with regulating stablecoins that purport to reference to one or more fiat currencies, given the higher and more imminent monetary and financial stability risks that they may pose.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We believe that with the right guardrails in place, the industry can explore the potential of digital finance in a safe and healthy manner&#8221;, the regulatory agency further added.</p>

<h2>Growing Concerns Over Stablecoin Use</h2>
<p>Lately, stablecoins have been witnessing rampant regulatory pressure from the United States and beyond. As reported earlier on CoinGape, regulatory agencies like the NYDFS, the Justice Department and the SEC have been cracking down on businesses offering and operating stablecoins. Paxos, was one of the latest crypto firms to suffer the brunt of a burgeoning &#8220;anti-crypto crusade&#8221; as it was asked to stop minting <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/binance-exchange-review/">Binance exchange&#8217;s</a> BUSD stablecoin.</p>
<p>Stablecoins, which are increasingly utilized for international transactions and remittances, have prompted the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to launch a legislative initiative as a timely response to their rising popularity. According to HK&#8217;s financial watchdog, the fact that these digital assets come with a number of advantages can also turn out to be catastrophic if they are not adequately regulated.</p>
<p>While some oppose the extensive regulatory framework &#8212; citing slowdowns in innovation &#8212; the larger crypto community has welcomed the decision of regulating for guaranteeing the safety and wealth of crypto users. In light of this crypto news, the price of major stablecoins such as <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/usd-coin-usdc/">USDC</a>, UDT and TUSD remained pegged to the value of 1 USD while the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price of Bitcoin</a> is currently trading close to the $30K mark at the time of writing.</p>

However, such an environment is failing to translate into <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> rise, and hence indicating that it will remain same until Ripple secures a clear win.</p>
<h2>XRP Holders&#8217; Loss</h2>
<p>John Reed Stark, who had worked as a lawyer in the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division for a long time, admitted that the SEC&#8217;s actions in the XRP lawsuit led to investors losing in billions of dollars. He expressed his stance on crypto saying these tokens fail to fit in the criteria for both investment and currency, adding that fraudulent activities are deeply rooted in the ecosystem, However, he <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1652292529448992769" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> that investors lost great deal due to the SEC&#8217;s actions in the Ripple lawsuit. When asked about the SEC&#8217;s actions leading to wiping billions off the market cap of XRP, he admitted that it&#8217;s a fair point.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the end, the investor is the one who typically gets it the worst, which is devastating.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the recently released Ripple Q1 report, the company <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://ripple.com/insights/q1-2023-xrp-markets-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> total XRP sales of $361.06 million as against $226.31 million in the previous quarter. The company noted that the crypto market, including XRP, remained resilient in the first quarter despite the macro turbulence and banking crisis.</p>

This buying pressure encourages a majority of major cryptocurrencies to undermine the mid-April sell-off and recuperate the bullish recovery. Amid the potential recovery, here are the top three Cryptocurrencies showcasing a bullish setup for a significant rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xrp(XRP)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/2/2jI2XMeA.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the XRP price shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/#:~:text=It%20is%20formed%20when%20a,downtrend%20in%20the%20asset's%20price.">double bottom pattern</a>. In theory, this pattern resembles strong accumulation from buyers as the price rebounds from the same support zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, amid the recent correction phase, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> recently reverted from the $0.55 neckline and plunged 20% down to retest local support of $0.45. Anyhow, the retracement managed to sustain above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall bullish sentiment remains intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the XRP price reversal from 50% FIB at $0.44 encouraged buyers to a 14% rise and rechallenged the $0.55 barrier. Furthermore, a potential breakout from the neckline resistance will intensify the bullish momentum and surge the price 47% higher to hit the $0.8 high.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche(AVAX)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/marPDoK3.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/avalanche/">Avalanche coin price</a> is currently forming an inverted head and shoulder. This famous trend reversal pattern offers a suitable buying opportunity once the price breaks the pattern’s resistance neckline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing uncertainty in the market, the AVAX price is stuck in the right shoulder part of the pattern as mentioned above chart. If the coin price manages to sustain above the $14 support, the AVAX will rise 22% and challenge the neckline resistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under favorable conditions, a potential breakout above the $21.7 neckline will surge the AVAX price 42% higher to the $31 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainlink(LINK)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/FMTbZTeh.png" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market participants interested in buying <a href="https://coingape.com/price/chainlink/">Chainlink price</a> should mark the $5.5 and $9.5 levels. For nearly a year, the coin price has strictly resonated between these levels forming a definite sideways trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Chainlink price trades at the $7.2 mark and tries to sustain above local support of $6.8-$6.6. If the broader market sentiment turns negative, the breakdown below the aforementioned support will tumble the LINK price back to the $5.5 accumulation zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the less aggressive traders can wait for a breakout above the $9.5 barrier to confirm a bullish trend.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Arbitrum (ARB), a Layer-2 based scaling protocol on the Ethereum blockchain has shared its latest performance report, showcasing how it surpasses the later network in terms of total transactions processed. As contained in its latest tweet, layer-2 said its Arbitrum One protocol processed a total of 1.26 million for the week.

As contained in its </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1652070346919493632"><span style="font-weight: 400">latest tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, layer-2 said its Arbitrum One protocol processed a total of 1.26 million for the week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While that may be tagged a sheer coincidence, the Arbitrum Nova layer also processed a total of 1.18 million transactions for the time under review. These figures compare to that which the main Ethereum protocol processed which came in at just 939,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ethereum is considered a high performance blockchain protocol and is ranked the biggest smart contract platform in the crypto ecosystem. While its dominance remains unquestionable, transaction throughput is low and the cost of transactions is very high. Despite the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/how-ethereum-is-performing-after-the-merge/"><span style="font-weight: 400">latest transition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to Proof-of-State (PoS) consensus model, the scalability of Ethereum still remains at a low ebb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This flaw influenced the emergence of Layer-2 protocols like Arbitrum. There has been a prominent war amongst the L2 protocols but Arbitrum’s latest figures shows it is still in the lead. Besides the high transaction count, Arbitrum said it saw a number of new innovative protocols that launched on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another important highlight that it pointed out is the launch of a job board to aid the developers within its ecosystem to land top developers to help build out their projects.</span></p>
<h2><b>Subtle L2 War on Ethereum</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While there are a number of so-called Ethereum killers in the blockchain ecosystem, the actual war worth watching out for at this time is that between the layer-2 networks resident on the Ethereum mainnet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides Arbitrum, Optimism (OP), Polygon zkEVM, zkSync and Loopring (LRC) are among the top performing and functional L2s that are making waves in the industry today. While all have better scalability compared to Ethereum, their comparative advantage in terms of Transaction Per Second (TPS) and gas fees differ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Polygon also </span><a href="https://coingape.com/polygon-shares-key-growth-metrics-for-april-is-polygon-the-best-l2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">revealed its performance report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for its zkEVM sidechain recently, noting that a total transaction growth of 300% was recorded for the month of April. While each of these L2s boasts of different advantages, the aim is to help enhance the overall image of the Ethereum blockchain and this is working well thus far.</span></p>
