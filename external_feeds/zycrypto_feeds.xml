<p>Grayscale Investments revealed on Thursday that its ETF team is expanding as it nears the tail end of its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The new hires have sent an optimistic signal about a potential spot Bitcoin ETF landing in the U.S. markets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grayscale-prepping-for-etf-approval"><strong>Grayscale Prepping For ETF Approval?</strong></h2>



<p>Grayscale highlighted that it‚Äôs hiring for its ETF team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúOur ETF team is hiring,‚Äù Grayscale said on X (formerly Twitter), accompanied by a set of eyes emoji.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our ETF team is hiring. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="üëÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/FtM1VM0AcW">https://t.co/FtM1VM0AcW</a></p>&mdash; Grayscale (@Grayscale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1692163372241056254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The two positions, a product specialist and senior associate to assist its ETF team, have jointly accumulated more than 50 applications since being posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3658437380&amp;f_C=9242845&amp;geoId=92000000&amp;originToLandingJobPostings=3663770148%2C3644394640%2C3655966673%2C3687035969%2C3635007085%2C3658437380%2C3677214100%2C3677213133">LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/grayscaleinvestments/jobs/5643892003">job post</a>, Grayscale‚Äôs senior associate would ‚Äúcontribute to investment product development ideas and work with the ETF team towards their realization.‚Äù</p>



<p>The crypto asset manager is seeking a product specialist who will ‚Äúwork closely with the sales, operations, marketing, and product teams to optimize the investor experience,‚Äù with a particular focus on ETFs.</p>



<p>Some crypto community members are pondering the significance of the job postings as the widely anticipated decision in Grayscale‚Äôs lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission could be reached as early as tomorrow. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1692178295637594363">posited</a>:</p>



<p>‚ÄúIs this bullish spot approval? No idea, but I do know ETFs are and will be a huge growth area and so fyi for anyone looking for a job.‚Äù</p>



<p>Grayscale <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">sued </a>SEC last June for violation of the Administrative Procedures Act., following the regulatory agency‚Äôs denial to convert its flagship trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-nbsp"><strong>Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While some industry commentators like former SEC official John Reed Stark have claimed that<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1690707913789112320"> chances are very slim</a> the American financial watchdog gives a regulatory green light to the creation of a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF, the verdict in Grayscale‚Äôs suit could leave the commission with no choice.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Bloomberg‚Äôs Balchunas previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-just-shot-up-according-to-bloomberg/">suggested </a>that the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF have gone up. The agency, however, seems hell-bent on postponing any decision related to this crypto investment vehicle until next year ‚Äî but a surprise should not be ruled out.</p>



<p>Grayscale recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-asks-sec-to-green-light-all-spot-bitcoin-etfs-simultaneously-to-promote-fair-competition/">urged the SEC to approve all Bitcoin spot ETF applications simultaneously</a> if it approves any to prevent companies from having an unfair advantage over other applicants.</p>

<p>In what will undoubtedly be disappointing to XRP fans, a New York district court judge has accepted the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) request to file an interlocutory appeal of the verdict in its suit against Ripple Labs, which ended in a partial victory for Ripple in July.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-s-request-granted"><strong>SEC‚Äôs Request Granted</strong></h2>



<p>Last month, the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">declared </a>that while Ripple&#8217;s XRP token institutional sales violated federal securities laws, sales to investors via exchanges did not constitute investment contracts. The ruling was a catalyst that sparked an upward trend for XRP and other crypto tokens that were alleged to be securities by the SEC.</p>



<p>The legal skirmish between Ripple and the SEC has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">ongoing since December 2020 </a>when the U.S. securities regulator took legal action against Ripple and its top figureheads, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, over allegations they raised over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP, an alleged unregistered security.</p>



<p>Now, the SEC‚Äôs <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-hanging-by-a-thread-as-sec-finally-moves-for-appeal-against-ripple-what-to-expect-next/">request</a> to submit a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal in the ongoing dispute with Ripple has been granted by Judge Analisa Torres, according to a court document filed on Thursday. The agency can file its motion by August 18, 2023,&nbsp; Judge Analisa Torres postulated, and Ripple has until September 1, 2023, to file their opposition to the appeal.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, an interlocutory appeal happens when a ruling by a trial court is appealed while other elements of the case are still in motion. The federal judge‚Äôs determination enables the SEC to build and introduce a case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision comes only hours after Ripple made it known that it was opposed to the SEC‚Äôs move toward an interlocutory appeal. As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-claps-back-at-secs-request-to-challenge-ruling-that-xrp-isnt-a-security/">reported </a>earlier, Ripple‚Äôs legal team laid out several key arguments in opposition to the regulator‚Äôs request.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-on-xrp"><strong>Implications On XRP</strong></h2>



<p>It should be noted that the latest decision by Judge Torres does not mean the SEC can now appeal the XRP ruling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because this isn&#39;t very clear, the court has not granted leave to appeal &#8211; meaning SEC can appeal now.<br><br>It granted leave to file a motion for leave to appeal.  The court just decided &quot;ya we can deal with this issue&quot;.<br><br>So, the issue itself &#8211; whether an appeal will go forward now -‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/vBbgr4CaYK">https://t.co/vBbgr4CaYK</a></p>&mdash; Bill Hughes : wchughes.eth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f98a.png" alt="ü¶ä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@BillHughesDC) <a href="https://twitter.com/BillHughesDC/status/1692230785699316207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As aforementioned, the appeal process itself won&#8217;t halt the rest of the case. Moreover, the SEC will still need permission from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to file the actual appeal of the ruling. So even if Judge Torres does grant the SEC‚Äôs motion, then it will have another precipitous mountain to climb ‚Äî getting the Second Circuit&#8217;s approval.</p>



<p>XRP fans hoping for a parabolic value hike might have to wait a little longer as the project‚Äôs future as a whole could be in jeopardy amid SEC‚Äôs appeal efforts.</p>

<p>In a recent<a href="https://stellar.org/blog/sdfs-investment-in-moneygram-international"> post</a> on the Stellar website, Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director of the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), announced that Stellar had made a financial investment into MoneyGram (MGI). Stellar and MGI have worked together since 2021 and as early as 2019 on projects like stablecoins and money settlement in USDC on the Stellar blockchain.</p>



<p>The move makes Stellar a minority <a href="https://zycrypto.com/top-ripple-competitor-stellar-reportedly-in-talks-to-purchase-moneygram-xlm-soars-by-an-impressive-18/">investor in MoneyGram</a> and it will have a seat on the Board of Directors, in which Dixon will now represent SDF. It is unknown how much money changed hands but in a statement, Stellar said the funds came out of SDF‚Äôs cash treasury rather than its fund used to finance start-ups.</p>



<p>According to Dixon, the move focuses on expanding MGI‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital business, exploring blockchain technology, and contributing to the many other ways this financial technology company enables consumers and businesses to move and manage money in nearly every country around the world.‚Äù She added the investment would cement MGI‚Äôs role in the global payments market helping it to become ‚Äúa digital-forward leader in fintech‚Äù.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-and-moneygram-a-complicated-relationship"><strong>Ripple and MoneyGram ‚Äì a Complicated Relationship</strong></h2>



<p>Interestingly, Stellar was founded by Jed McCaleb, who also co-founded rival Ripple and served as its Chief Technology Officer before leaving the company. Ripple also had a partnership with MoneyGram, which involved a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-completes-50-million-equity-investment-in-moneygram-bolstering-cross-border-payments-with-xrp/">$50 million investment in MGI</a> and allowed it to use Ripple‚Äôs cross-border payments network.</p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Ripple in late 2020 for the alleged sale of $1.3 billion in unregistered securities. While the court has decided that in and of itself, XRP is not a security, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-claps-back-at-secs-request-to-challenge-ruling-that-xrp-isnt-a-security/">the case is still ongoing</a>, with a pending trial regarding the roles of CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman and co-founder Chris Larsen in the sales of XRP and a pending interlocutory appeal by the SEC.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/moneygram-officially-ends-partnership-with-ripple/">MoneyGram ended the cooperation</a> shortly after the SEC filed the lawsuit, with MGI‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer Larry Angelilli hinting at future cooperation ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a resolution to the case, especially if Ripple prevails, then I would say there would be no problem,‚Äù adding that this could be a long way off.</p>



<p>MoneyGram used Ripple‚Äôs platform and XRP for its FX business for the euro, Philippine pesos, Australian dollar, and Mexican pesos. U.S. exchanges stopped XRP trading shortly after the lawsuit.</p>



<p>During a panel discussion, Angelilli said that the move of the SEC made it impossible to use Ripple and XRP, highlighting that Stellar and XLM worked differently and that they could use both systems. However, there has been no announcement if MGI would revisit its relationship with Ripple post the court decision.</p>



<p>The news has not immediately resulted in an increased demand for XLM, the native coin of the Stellar blockchain. XLM is experiencing a sell-off with the broader market, currently trading at $0.12, down 4% in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>German-born programmer and Coil CEO Stefan Thomas has continued to find himself at a crossroads, with only two attempts left to crack a code that holds the potential to unlock a fortune of staggering proportions after he forgot his password.</p>



<p>Thomas owned an IronKey, a small hard drive that housed the private keys to a digital wallet containing an astonishing 7,002 Bitcoin (approximately 198M today), which he purchased back when the cryptocurrency traded at around $5.</p>



<p>The story began when Thomas misplaced a paper containing his password to the IronKey wallet. With only ten guesses available before the IronKey&#8217;s contents were encrypted forever, Thomas&#8217;s urgency to retrieve his lost wealth was solid. He tried eight combinations, each attempt yielding nothing but frustration and desperation.</p>



<p><em>‚ÄúI would just lay in bed and think about it,‚Äù</em> Thomas confessed in a 2021 interview. <em>‚ÄúThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn‚Äôt work, and I would be desperate again.‚Äù</em></p>



<p>In an interview last month, Stefan further spoke about his relentless efforts to unlock the Bitcoin trapped in his hardware wallet. Talking on the ‚ÄúThinking Crypto‚Äù YouTube channel, the pundit acknowledged that the recovery process was far from simple.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The process is still ongoing, so we&#8217;re still working on it,&#8221;</em> he <a href="https://youtu.be/eB24Z_ITM78?t=3435">stated</a>. He shed light on the intricate challenges faced due to the substantial sum at stake. &#8220;<em>When you&#8217;re dealing with so much money, everything takes forever,&#8221; he emphasized.</em></p>



<p>Stefan detailed the thorough approaches required for both physical and software attacks. &#8220;<em>Before you can do some physical attack, you first have to try it lots of times. Before you do a software attack, you first wanna try every angle,&#8221;</em> he explained. He further expressed his desire for closure, stating, <em>&#8220;Honestly, at this point, after 10 years, I don&#8217;t care. Just get it over with.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Stefan Thomas&#8217;s plight is not an isolated incident. In 2013, a computer engineer named James Howells accidentally discarded a driver, which held <a href="https://zycrypto.com/man-offers-72-million-to-search-for-hard-drive-with-7500-btc/">7,500 bitcoins</a>, during an office cleaning session. This event convinced him that the valuable item was resting in a landfill in Newport, south Wales. Despite James Howells&#8217; persistent appeals, the local council consistently denied his requests to search the landfill, citing environmental concerns.¬†</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature, while empowering users, has also led to numerous stories of forgotten passwords and inaccessible fortunes. Around 20 per cent of 18.5 million Bitcoins, valued at approximately $93 billion, are believed to be trapped in lost or stranded wallets.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s (SHIB) price slipped double-digits in the past 24 hours, contrary to community expectations of a strong upward trend brewing after the launch of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-in-view-amid-shib-exploding-ecosystem-activity-as-shibarium-debut-beckons/">much-hyped Ethereum layer-2 solution, Shibarium</a>, on Wednesday.</p>



<p>SHIB‚Äôs decline is attributed to certain Shibarium bridging issues encountered just a day after its rollout.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-botched-shibarium-sees-1-7m-stuck-between-networks"><strong>Botched Shibarium Sees $1.7M Stuck Between Networks</strong></h2>



<p>Shiba Inu‚Äôs Shibarium is off to a rocky start after going live late Wednesday.</p>



<p>A look at the network&#8217;s bridge contract, which moves funds from Ethereum to the layer-2 network, shows that roughly $1.7 million worth of ether is currently stuck between the two networks.</p>



<p>Blockchain security firm Beosin confirmed that the funds are indeed locked. They have recommended users briefly stop utilizing Shibarium as a precautionary measure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="üö®" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Transactions on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shibarium?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Shibarium</a> are stuck in a pending state. <br>$1.7M are currently locked on ETH. <br><br>Users are advised to temporarily stop using shibarium.<a href="https://t.co/io5puAibBc">https://t.co/io5puAibBc</a> <a href="https://t.co/q2SXqtthoO">https://t.co/q2SXqtthoO</a></p>&mdash; Beosin Alert (@BeosinAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1692003409602445743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama (a pseudonym) Shytoshi reportedly revealed that the assets stuck in the bridge could not be recovered, as per a screenshot that supposedly captures an internal conversation on Telegram between Shibarium devs.</p>



<p>Users swiftly voiced their concerns on the Shibarium Discord server, which led to admins temporarily ‚Äúrestricting access to certain channels due to the spread of misinformation and fake websites‚Äù.</p>



<p>The apparent sloppy launch for Shibarium impedes what was supposed to be the doorway to a fast and low-cost ecosystem. The bridge is part of a broader strategy to position Shiba Inu as a serious decentralized finance (DeFi) contender and subsequently increase its chances of leaving the meme coin category behind. Initially launched in August 2020, SHIB quickly joined the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE) as yet another meme coin to the annals of cryptocurrency comedy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shytoshi-publicly-denies-any-shibarium-technical-hiccups"><strong>Shytoshi Publicly Denies Any Shibarium Technical Hiccups</strong></h2>



<p>Shytoshi has ardently refuted claims that Shibarium has any inherent issues while assuring users about the security of their funds. Kusama <a href="https://blog.shib.io/shibarium-insane-influx/?ref=shiba-inu-ecosystem-newsletter">said </a>in a newsletter today that the ‚Äútechnical difficulty is not an issue of Shibarium, but instead, from the MASSIVE influx of transactions and users that happened at the same time when we announced that the Shibarium is live.&#8221;</p>



<p>‚ÄúThere is no bridge issue, any screenshot you see of me saying any issue is false and your funds are safu,‚Äù he continued.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the price of SHIB has slumped to a weekly low of $0.00000857 at press time, or down 11.2% in the last 24 hours, while governance token <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap">BONE </a>has slipped more than 13.7% during the same timeframe as community sentiment sours. The ecosystems‚Äô <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/doge-killer">LEASH </a>token fared far worse plunging 19.3% on the day.</p>

<p>On August 15th, cryptocurrency trader and analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe conducted a daily price analysis for Shiba Inu (SHIB), a meme-inspired cryptocurrency. He looked at the key price levels it needs to hold in order to sustain its bullish momentum in the coming months.</p>



<p>According to van de Poppe, as long as SHIB manages to stay above the critical support of around $0.00000941, there&#8217;s a high likelihood that it will continue to rise to $0.00000287.</p>



<p>If SHIB achieves van de Poppe&#8217;s bullish prediction, it would mark a significant increase of 29.98% from current levels for the second-largest meme coin in terms of market capitalization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shib-s-support-and-resistance-on-daily-timeframes"><strong>SHIB&#8217;s Support and Resistance on Daily Timeframes</strong></h2>



<p>Since June 10th, the price of SHIB has steadily increased after dropping to a low of $0.00000543. On daily timeframes, it&#8217;s noticeable that the meme coin has formed a strong support zone within the range of $0.00000749 and $0.00000800.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NbNVW33sP15cvFw7Ra8k4qz6vm6uViruF7RJycvhfA1cqfwYb2L-0wE9nkqZandsAo9VBOyIKPcZ6xQgMgrXe9MuC-4rNBGXWwEAtpfFGujIsjedYkhcKBV16uojH1z-yJGdTPMT72uwUaNfVEdny7o" alt=""/></figure>



<p>However, on August 13th, SHIB&#8217;s price fell below the $0.000001080 level, which is closest to its 55-period moving average (MA) and the nearest resistance it needs to break to sustain its bullish momentum.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is priced at $0.000008574, experiencing a 10.8% setback in the past 24 hours due to the ongoing price decline in Bitcoin (BTC).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shiba-inu-s-crypto-market-leadership"><strong>Shiba Inu&#8217;s Crypto Market Leadership</strong></h2>



<p>Currently, SHIB holds the 15th position among cryptocurrencies, with the highest market capitalization, having a market cap of $5.05 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. It is outranked in the meme coin category by the larger and pioneering Dogecoin (DOGE), which boasts a market capitalization of approximately $9.3 billion, securing the 9th spot in the top cryptocurrencies list.</p>



<p>Hence, a 29.98% surge would propel SHIB into the top 10 cryptocurrencies and solidify its standing as one of the leading meme coins after DOGE. Additionally, as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-sees-shibarium-outshining-x-worldcoin-shib-price-at-0-001-looking-likely/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, SHIB&#8217;s developers have been working diligently to expand the project&#8217;s reach and shed its reputation as a simple or useless meme coin.</p>



<p>Ultimately, considering SHIB&#8217;s massive following and community, achieving van de Poppe&#8217;s projected target might not be as far-fetched as it seems. Who knows, it could even ignite more enthusiasm for meme coins that capture the attention of non-crypto individuals, especially after the price surge seen in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pepe-outshines-shiba-inu-and-doge-with-23-surge-amid-big-whale-purchases/">PEPE</a>, a coin based on the Pepe the Frog meme.</p>

<p>In the latest development of the legal squabble between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the attorneys for the blockchain payments firm have fervently opposed the agency‚Äôs anticipated motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal relating to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">XRP sales ruling</a> made by U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres on July 13.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-opposition-detailed"><strong>Ripple‚Äôs Opposition Detailed</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple has stated categorically that it opposes the SEC‚Äôs move to appeal its partial loss in the XRP case that rocked the crypto industry.</p>



<p><em>‚ÄúWe oppose the SEC‚Äôs request for an interlocutory appeal,‚Äù Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1691917112019960288">postulated </a>on X (formerly Twitter). ‚ÄúThere is no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal.‚Äù</em></p>



<p>In a Wednesday court filing, Ripple‚Äôs legal team explained to Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York that because the SEC failed to meet aspects of the Howey test relating to Ripple‚Äôs distribution of XRP tokens, she should dismiss the SEC‚Äôs motion for leave to submit an interlocutory appeal.</p>



<p>Judge Torres ruled last month that the cryptocurrency XRP is not necessarily a security on its face. The decision was widely celebrated in the cryptocurrency space and sent the price of XRP soaring. The win was tipped as a potential precedent that can help strengthen any potential defense against the SEC, which has also labelled Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) as securities.</p>



<p>Ripple made nuanced arguments in a bid to counter the SEC‚Äôs motion for an interlocutory appeal. First, they contended that an appeal demands a ‚Äúpure‚Äù¬†legal query and that the SEC‚Äôs request doesn‚Äôt distinctly raise any new legal issues that necessitate a fresh review.</p>



<p>Ripple‚Äôs legal minds then argue that the SEC&#8217;s claim that the XRP case was wrongly decided is not adequate, as the regulator needs to prove that the two courts are in clear contention with each other over the core matters ‚Äî which has clearly not been the case here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next"><strong>What‚Äôs Next?</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC will need to get the green light from the United States District Court Southern District of New York to file the appeal and then from the Court of Appeals. If granted, then the regulator would need approval from the Second Circuit, which then would examine the interlocutory appeal.</p>



<p>Ripple claims that even if the SEC were to find favor with their appeal and subsequently clinch a victory, this wouldn‚Äôt mean the end of the litigation proceedings. Ripple highlights the existence of unresolved issues, vital among them being the firm‚Äôs fair notice defense and the deep-seated question of damages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This implies that the litigation, far from being made simple, could morph into a lengthy legal affair. Ripple‚Äôs attorneys are of the opinion that it is more reasonable for the regulator to appeal Judge Torres‚Äô decision after a final judgment is made with a complete record.</p>

<p>In a game-changing move, crypto payments provider BitPay has announced global backing for Ripple‚Äôs XRP token. This marks a big milestone in the widespread adoption of XRP.</p>



<p>BitPay users worldwide can now seamlessly use XRP to pay for goods and services, securely store it using self-custody within the BitPay Wallet, and swap the cross-border payments coin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-gets-bitpay-boost"><strong>XRP Gets BitPay Boost</strong></h2>



<p>BitPay has <a href="https://twitter.com/BitPay/status/1691510139008827393">informed </a>users on X (previously Twitter) of its full-fledged worldwide support of XRP.</p>



<p>This means all BitPay users can seamlessly spend XRP at global stores supported by BitPay. <em>‚ÄúMerchants can now accept XRP payments from over 100 wallets,‚Äù</em> the press release reads.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BitPay released worldwide support for XRP, allowing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitPay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitPay</a> users across the world to buy, store, swap and spend <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$XRP</a> across all BitPay solutions. <br><br>Learn more about XRP:<a href="https://t.co/ndvp5M0Gdp">https://t.co/ndvp5M0Gdp</a> <a href="https://t.co/CBFztrBAVh">pic.twitter.com/CBFztrBAVh</a></p>&mdash; BitPay (@BitPay) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitPay/status/1691510139008827393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At the moment, an exceptional list of at least 30 merchants is coordinating with BitPay to accept XRP. This group includes high-profile brands like AMC Theatres, Hublot, CryptoTurismo PacSun, and even reputable German-based precious metals dealer Auragentum. Notably, neither individuals nor merchants will be required to perform extra actions to start XRP utilization.</p>



<p>Allowing millions of users worldwide to utilize XRP while purchasing goods and services further drives the digital payments landscape as the service offers users and merchants a flexible and efficient means of conducting transactions.</p>



<p>Besides spending XRP, global users can also store and swap the cryptocurrency using the BitPay app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This announcement comes on the heels of Ripple‚Äôs <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-q2-report-clarifies-6-misconceptions-about-recent-xrp-legal-ruling/">favorable ruling</a> from Judge Analisa Torres after its three-year battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In her July verdict, the judge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">declared </a>that sales of the XRP token on exchanges do not constitute investment contracts.</p>



<p>This legal classification has spurred the momentum behind XRP&#8217;s incorporation into mainstream commerce, boosting its adoption as a preferred payment method among the aforementioned global merchants cooperating with BitPay.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-primed-for-parabolic-rise-nbsp"><strong>XRP Primed For Parabolic Rise?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Since tapping $0.93 highs in July, XRP bulls have been unable to push the price higher as bears remain firmly in the driver‚Äôs seat. The XRP‚Äôs price currently sits at $0.596093, an over 35% decline from the July peak.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, a crypto strategist going by the online moniker DefendDark has set a high target for the fifth-largest crypto. In a recent post on X, the analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/DefendDark/status/1691114707263123456">said </a>XRP could soon soar to as high as $3 based on historical trends. However, they expect more pain before the altcoin can rocket.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi all. We set a historical pattern 3 months back &amp; this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XRP</a> stands fantastically at the same price level now.<br><br>I know it sounds crazy but check below.<br><br>The wave trend indicates we can still touch $0.58 &amp; hit $3 (NFA) in the same week, says historical pattern. <br><br>Jeez. <a href="https://t.co/byPwgriN8c">pic.twitter.com/byPwgriN8c</a></p>&mdash; Dark Defender (@DefendDark) <a href="https://twitter.com/DefendDark/status/1691114707263123456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>XRP has garnered substantial attention since the partial court win in July and all of these new interests could catalyze a fresh rally for the token. As the regulatory threat around XRP recedes, the chances of the coin hitting a new all-time high are increasingly higher.</p>

<p>The Shiba Inu ecosystem is flaring with massive developments and partnerships as the Shibarium launch finally comes knocking.</p>



<p>Alpha Transform Holdings (ATH), a leading investment and digital advisory firm, has joined forces with the foundation behind SHIB Doggy DAO, a decentralised autonomous organisation governed by Shiba Inu token holders.</p>



<p>According to a Tuesday announcement, ATH will provide advice and support to the foundation as it funds projects built on the Shibarium blockchain.</p>



<p>The partnership is a major coup for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">SHIB Doggy DAO</a>, as it brings together a team of veteran leaders from Disney, News Corp, and Nasdaq with decades of experience in the blockchain industry. Enzo Villani, Michael Terpin, and Seth Shapiro are well-respected figures in the crypto space, and their expertise will be invaluable to the DAO as it seeks to build and grow the Shibarium ecosystem.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We are excited to partner with SHIB Doggy DAO to help them propel the Shibarium projects forward. We believe that Shibarium has the potential to be a major player in the blockchain space, and we are committed to providing the DAO with the support it needs to succeed.&#8221;</em> Said Enzo Villani, ATH‚Äôs CEO and Chief Investment Officer.</p>



<p>In addition to the partnership with ATH, the SHIB Doggy DAO has also been making other moves to prepare for the launch of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-sees-super-bullish-momentum-but-can-it-trigger-shib-price-to-astronomical-highs/">Shibarium</a>. In recent weeks, the DAO has announced several new projects built on the Shibarium blockchain, including a decentralised exchange, a lending platform, and a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.</p>



<p>The announcement comes even as the crypto community anticipates the Shibarium layer 2 protocol launch this week. So far this week, the team behind the project have been dropping hints since the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, where Shibarium is likely to be announced, kicked off on Monday.</p>



<p>And although the exact launch date of Shibarium had yet to be confirmed at press time, a <a href="https://twitter.com/_Mazrael_/status/1691575466581241898">tweet</a> from LUCIE, the Chief Marketing Strategist for Shiba Inu, earlier on Wednesday hinted that it could be launched on Thursday, August 17.</p>



<p>That said, the launch of Shibarium is expected to be a major milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem as it will drastically reduce gas fees, increase transaction speeds and make it easier for developers to build decentralised applications on the Shiba Inu blockchain.</p>



<p>With over 2 million wallets already registering for the beta testnet, the live Shibarium could potentially lead to a surge in the adoption of Shiba Inu amid the SHIB price outlook to $0.001 and other tokens in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>America‚Äôs biggest crypto exchange, Coinbase, has secured regulatory approval to roll out crypto futures trading for institutional investors in the United States, marking a significant milestone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-obtains-approval-to-list-bitcoin-ether-futures"><strong>Coinbase Obtains Approval To List Bitcoin, Ether Futures</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase has won approval to offer regulated crypto futures to U.S. customers.</p>



<p>The San Francisco-based exchange <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-financial-markets-inc-secures-fcm-approval-to-bring-regulated">announced </a>on Aug. 16 that it had received the green light from the National Futures Association (NFA) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This means that the company can now operate as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), and can therefore offer investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum futures to verified users in the United States.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the approval makes Coinbase the pioneer in offering U.S.-based customers traditional spot trading alongside regulated and leveraged crypto futures.</p>



<p>&#8220;Offering US investors access to secure and regulated crypto futures is key to unlocking growth and enabling broader participation in the crypto economy,‚Äù opined the CEO of Coinbase Financial Markets Andrew Sears.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the service will not be immediately available to clients. However, Coinbase has urged users to join a waitlist for early access.</p>



<p>As Coinbase postulated in its Wednesday statement, getting those approvals has been a long time coming. Coinbase submitted an application with the National Futures Association to register as an FCM in September of 2021. The firm has been laying the groundwork to offer crypto derivatives ever since, even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-set-to-up-its-crypto-game-with-the-acquisition-of-fairx/">acquiring </a>CFTC-registered derivatives platform FairX in early 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-suit"><strong>SEC Suit</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase is currently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">locked in a suit</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange and clearing agency.</p>



<p>Listing crypto futures in the U.S. opens up a potentially massive market for Coinbase, which the exchange claims represents roughly 75% of crypto trading volume worldwide. Coinbase has cited this new development as evidence of its commitment to comply with U.S. regulations.</p>



<p>Coinbase <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-wants-sec-lawsuit-tossed-out-says-crypto-falls-outside-the-regulators-purview/">filed a motion to throw out</a> the SEC case earlier this month, arguing that the regulator‚Äôs approach goes far beyond the existing legal framework.</p>

<p>The ongoing legal tussle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a new turn as an investment banker declarant has been granted approval by Judge Analisa Torres to make an appearance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-judge-allows-investment-banking-declarant-to-appear-in-xrp-suit"><strong>Judge Allows Investment Banking Declarant To Appear In XRP Suit</strong></h2>



<p>A new investment banker declarant is set to appear in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit after approval by Judge Torres of the U.S. Southern District Court.</p>



<p>As per court filings, the approved declarant is Andrew A. Kunsak of Sidley Austin LLP, and he is being onboarded so as to avoid divulging the sensitive information order sealed by the court.</p>



<p><em>‚ÄúAndrew A. Kunsak of Sidley Austin LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, a member of this Court in good standing, hereby respectfully enters an appearance for Investment Banker Declarant in the above-captioned action.‚Äù¬†</em></p>



<p>Ripple had previously opposed a similar appearance by an investment banker declarant from the law firm that sided with the SEC&#8217;s position, raising serious concerns for the defendants.</p>



<p>With the entry of the investment banking declarant, the court aims to address issues related to orders that rejected the SEC&#8217;s request to seal the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">Hinman speech files</a> and Ripple&#8217;s plea to keep private details associated with the financials of its defending executives.</p>



<p>The move by Judge Torres is to ensure that all parties receive the rulings in good faith following the July judgment. At the time, the court <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">decided </a>that Ripple‚Äôs XRP sales to retail investors via exchanges did not violate federal securities laws. The SEC, however, is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-hanging-by-a-thread-as-sec-finally-moves-for-appeal-against-ripple-what-to-expect-next/">gearing up to appeal Ripple‚Äôs victory </a>on XRP classification.</p>



<p>The SEC has been staunch in its contention that most cryptocurrencies in the market are securities and that it has the power to regulate them. An appeal underscores the regulator‚Äôs goal to clarify the crypto ecosystem under securities laws. The outcome could set a precedent for other crypto assets, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) ‚Äî which <a href="https://zycrypto.com/48-crypto-assets-considered-by-the-u-s-sec-to-be-securities-beget-questions/">are in the crosshairs </a>of the top American financial cop as investment contracts. This makes Ripple v. SEC a crucial case in the digital currency space.</p>

<p>Despite his previous skepticism about cryptocurrencies, former U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly holds more than $5 million in an Ethereum wallet. This puts Trump, who is bidding to return to the White House in 2024, near the crypto ‚Äúwhale‚Äù category. The $5 million in Trump‚Äôs Ethereum wallet is significantly bigger than the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/filing-reveals-donald-trump-holds-250000-500000-worth-of-ethereum/">$250,000-$500,000 figure</a> previously disclosed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anti-crypto-trump-nears-crypto-whale-status"><strong>Anti-Crypto Trump Nears Crypto Whale Status</strong></h2>



<p>In new financial disclosure records submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, Trump discloses owning just over $2.8 million in crypto held in an Ethereum wallet.</p>



<p>The Washington-based non-profit watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), <a href="https://twitter.com/CREWcrew/status/1691488099056988167">shared</a> the updated figure on Tuesday. The statements also reveal that the former U.S. president accrued over $4.9 million from licensing fees from a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT) using Trump‚Äôs image that his campaign rolled out as part of his bid to return to the Oval Office in 2024 after losing to current-President Joe Biden in 2020.</p>



<p>Sales of the NFTs skyrocketed after their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-is-selling-superman-themed-nft-trading-cards/">launch </a>in December 2022 and also after a New York state court first indicted the real estate mogul-turned-politician. Subsequently, the Republican candidate dropped the second collection of digital trading cards in April, and this batch also quickly sold out.</p>



<p>Trump‚Äôs new financial reports were eclipsed by the news of his fourth <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/1ccdf52e-1ba2-434c-93f8-2a7020293967.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_5">indictment </a>in Georgia for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-is-a-scam-but-nfts-are-okay"><strong>Bitcoin Is A ‚ÄúScam‚Äù, But NFTs Are Okay?</strong></h2>



<p>The huge size of Trump‚Äôs holdings makes him something of a crypto whale, which is ironic for a man who has voiced skepticism for the asset class in the past. During an <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6257768965001#sp=show-clips">interview </a>with <em>Fox Business</em> in June 2021, Trump said Bitcoin ‚Äújust seems like a scam‚Äù before adding that he wasn‚Äôt a fan of the asset ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs another currency competing against the dollar.‚Äù</p>



<p>Trump‚Äôs aversion to cryptocurrencies contrasts with the pro-crypto stance of other Republican presidential candidates like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/no-cbdc-in-florida-asserts-pro-crypto-governor/">Ron DeSantis</a>, who has vowed to end ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs War on Bitcoin‚Äù if elected. The Florida governor posited that every American citizen has ‚Äúevery right to do Bitcoin‚Äù while speaking extensively on Twitter with Elon Musk.</p>



<p>On the Democratic front, presidential challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made waves in the crypto community as an outspoken advocate of Bitcoin after making a pitstop at the Bitcoin Miami conference. He also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/presidential-hopeful-robert-f-kennedy-jr-discloses-buying-two-bitcoins-for-each-of-his-seven-kids/">admitted </a>to buying 14 Bitcoins for his seven children.</p>

<p>Mark Yusko, the CEO and Founder of $2 billion investment firm Morgan Creek Capital Management, has boldly predicted that the price of Bitcoin could hit six figures within a year.</p>



<p>Making the forecast during a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9lFRPCg1HE&amp;ab_channel=KitcoNEWS">interview</a> with Kitco News, Yusko discussed various aspects of the cryptocurrency market, including the regulatory environment and the implications of a potential <a href="https://zycrypto.com/multiple-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-on-the-way-cathie-wood-predicts/">spot Bitcoin ETF approval</a> on Bitcoin‚Äôs price in the coming months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-etf-approval-likely-but"><strong>ETF Approval Likely, but‚Ä¶</strong></h2>



<p>Yusko acknowledged the growing excitement around the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, particularly as major players such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-bullish-on-defi-blackrock-speaks-on-impact-of-recent-xrp-ruling/">BlackRock</a>, Fidelity, Wisdom Tree, and VanEck have submitted filings for such ETFs. He, however asserted that although there is an impending deadline of August 13th, by which the SEC is required to either approve or reject an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF from ARK Invest, the SEC can extend the deadline.</p>



<p><em>‚ÄúThere is a fast-approaching deadline that&#8217;s getting some attention August 13th this is the date by which the SEC is required to approve or reject Arc spot Bitcoin ETF application but and this is a big but the SEC also has the option to stretch the deadline until as late as January 2024,‚Äù </em>he said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-headed-for-100-000"><strong>Bitcoin Headed for $100,000</strong></h2>



<p>As for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundits-100000-bitcoin-price-target-by-next-halving-sparks-exciting-bet/">price forecast</a>, the billionaire‚Äôs analysis relied on Metcalfe&#8217;s law, which suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s value grows exponentially with the network&#8217;s size. According to him, the law puts Bitcoin&#8217;s fair value at $55,000. Furthermore, he predicted that with each halving event, the total value of the network could increase tenfold. He thus stated that he anticipates that the upcoming halving could push Bitcoin even higher.</p>



<p><em>‚ÄúSo should that spot ETF get approved, and we know we&#8217;re going to have the halving in April, you anticipate Bitcoin at between $100,000 and $150,000 by mid-2024,‚Äù</em> he said.</p>



<p>Yusko&#8217;s predictions come even as Bitcoin struggles to shake off a prolonged consolidation phase that has exerted downward pressure on its price over the past one and a half month. Technically, the $31,000 resistance area has proved challenging to breach, with the cryptocurrency‚Äôs volatility tapping a seven-month low.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the anticipation around a spot Bitcoin ETF approval and underlying solid network fundamentals continue to suggest an enduring interest in Bitcoin, which could help drive higher prices. BTC traded at $29,187 at press time after dropping around 0.1% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Despite the overall slump in volatility by the general crypto market, PEPE has sustained its exceptional growth trajectory into the third week of August, surging ahead of notable contenders such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-sees-super-bullish-momentum-but-can-it-trigger-shib-price-to-astronomical-highs/">Shiba Inu</a> and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-eyes-record-highs-as-elon-musk-hints-on-some-exciting-news-doge-payments-coming-to-x/">DOGE</a>.</p>



<p>PEPE made a resounding entrance onto the scene earlier this year, witnessing an astonishing surge of over 25,000% within days of its mid-April launch. This unprecedented leap left the community amazed and captivated by the unfolding. As August progresses, the enthusiasm surrounding the frog-themed coin seems to have rekindled, with a renewed interest from whales amplifying the excitement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whale-purchases-surge"><strong>Whale Purchases Surge</strong></h2>



<p>On Tuesday, August 15, &#8220;The Data Nerd,&#8221; an analyst renowned for tracking the movements of the so-called &#8220;smart money whales,&#8221; or those influential players known for their well-timed trades, unveiled intriguing insights into PEPE&#8217;s recent ascent.</p>



<p>Notably, the coin&#8217;s value has surged impressively by over 23% in the span of a week, as per CoinMarketCap, with this remarkable growth largely attributed to substantial acquisitions made by influential addresses within the crypto sphere.</p>



<p>Referencing his specialized tool, the NerdBot, the analyst highlighted several whales and intelligent wallets that have been steadily amassing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pepe-coin-shows-resilience-amidst-sec-selloff-recovery-rally-or-fakeout/">PEPE coins</a>, offering a glimpse into the minds of those who play the long game. Notably, he underscored the activities of three initial investor addresses‚Äî0xAf2, 0x720, and 0x778‚Äîeach of whom garnered unrealized gains exceeding 100 times their initial investment, with the addresses holding around $5 million in PEPE.</p>



<p>The analyst also underscored an influx of new wallets that have entered the PEPE ecosystem, driven by an earnest desire to accumulate tokens. Notably, during the preceding week, one address stood out prominently. On August 9, address 0x5a2 bought 41B coins at the dip with $8,700 resulting in a (17%) unrealized gain at press time.</p>



<p>On the same day, address 0x3ef, mirroring this strategic manoeuvre, procured a staggering 1.07 trillion PEPE tokens for $1.5 million. This acquisition has resulted in a gain of 12%, amounting to $162,000.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shib-doge-fall-back"><strong>SHIB, DOGE fall back</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, while PEPE&#8217;s remarkable success continues, its counterparts, Shiba Inu and DOGE, are experiencing a different fate. Despite robust surges earlier in the month, SHIB has taken a step back, posting gains of roughly 14% over the past week. On the other hand, DOGE has maintained a relatively stable trading pattern over the past month with diminished volatility. Notably, the surge in Shiba Inu&#8217;s value has been attributed to the imminent Shibarium launch, which is anticipated to unfold this week.</p>



<p>PEPE was trading at $0.000001264 at press time after an 8.24% drop in the past 24 hours.</p>
