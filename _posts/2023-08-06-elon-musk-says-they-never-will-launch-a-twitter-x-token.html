<p>Elon Musk has restated any rumours that Twitter or &ldquo;X&rdquo; will launch a crypto token. In a stern reply to a fellow Twitter user Musk dispelled talk of a token by saying, &ldquo;And we never will.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently dispelled rumours that Twitter (or &ldquo;X&rdquo;) would launch a crypto token. One Twitter user posted to the social media platform warning fellow users, saying:</p>

<p>Links to articles calling the so-called token &ldquo;$X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Twitter token&rdquo; have made rounds in the news cycle, claiming incredible gains in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The rumours come amid a significant Twitter rebrand as Musk aims to make X the new &ldquo;everything app.&rdquo; Understandably, users would suggest the likelihood of a Twitter or X-related cryptocurrency given the &ldquo;chief Twit&rsquo;s&rdquo; affinity for popular memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>
<p>Musk, or the &ldquo;Dogefather&rdquo;, acquired Twitter for a staggering $44 billion and temporarily changed Twitter&rsquo;s iconic blue-bird logo for Shiba Inu, Doge&rsquo;s characteristic logo.</p>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s move earned himself a lawsuit for racketeering and insider trading worth $258 billion and allowed DOGE to soar by 20%.</p>
X-Token Surges After Twitter Rebrand
<p>Although no affiliation with Twitter, X, or Elon Musk, an altcoin called the X token surged a whopping 1000% after Musk&rsquo;s announcement that Twitter will rebrand itself to X.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The X token has no link to X.com and was part of a project started by X, a decentralised NFT marketplace operating across several chains.</p>
