										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the team of Pods, a provider of structured products for crypto assets, unveiled its latest offering &#8211; the<a id="2fb0bf17-a869-42f0-8800-162c62a31f25" href="https://app.pods.finance/strategy/0x5fe4b38520e856921978715c8579d2d7a4d2274f-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://app.pods.finance/strategy/0x5fe4b38520e856921978715c8579d2d7a4d2274f-1/"> ETHphoria Vault</a>. This innovative yield strategy is designed explicitly for ETH enthusiasts who are bullish about its future prospects and want to earn even more from increasing prices.</p>
<p><strong>ETHphoria</strong> is a low-risk, principal-protected strategy designed for those bullish on the ether (ETH) market. By integrating Lido with call options, ETHphoria allows users to earn higher rewards as the market rises.</p>
<p>The strategy uses 100% of Lido&#8217;s weekly staking rewards to purchase call options with a 1-week expiry. If the price of ETH or stETH rises above the strike of those call options within a week, the call options are exercised, resulting in profits for depositors.</p>
<p>Pods has a hybrid on-chain / off-chain approach, where the principal remains on-chain, and the yield can have the optionality to build the derivatives part off-chain.</p>
<p>With this approach Pods has the best of 2 worlds: on-chain security for the principal, and off-chain liquidity for the yield, resulting in better returns for the end user.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;At Pods, we recognize the importance of consolidating a single strategy into one token, not only for enhancing DeFi composability but also for user convenience. Our users can seamlessly transfer deposits between addresses, utilize them as collateral on other protocols, and easily verify their holdings in a specific strategy. I strongly believe in the power of the simplicity of this approach.&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/0xbabi?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://twitter.com/0xbabi?s=20">&#8211; </a><a href="https://twitter.com/0xbabi?s=20" data-cke-saved-href="https://twitter.com/0xbabi?s=20">Rafaella Baraldo, CEO &amp; Ci-Founder of Pods</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the vault provides access to intricate strategies with a single click, withdrawal at any point after processing the deposit, and display of actual historical returns among other features. ETHphoria vault is live on mainnet:<a id="cf12d949-b13b-41f5-b58e-e91b47396f1d" href="https://app.pods.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://app.pods.finance/"> </a><a id="8dd7130a-89c8-4fb1-a518-53ecf2e3cf8e" href="https://app.pods.finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://app.pods.finance">https://app.pods.finance</a>.</p>
<p>ETHphoria leverages Lido, a <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2020/12/29/staking-ethereum-eth-is-now-live-on-lido/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading decentralized staking protocol for ETH</a>, to generate high yields. With a TVL of over $11.8 billion, Lido is a trusted choice for the DeFi community.</p>
<p>As ETHphoria evolves, Pods will continuously improve the vault&#8217;s functionality, you can check all the details in the<a id="6a4d01b9-e628-4ee4-8166-0ed843479165" href="https://blog.pods.finance/introducing-ethphoria-vault-785b5c9480d0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://blog.pods.finance/introducing-ethphoria-vault-785b5c9480d0"> Pods´ blog post</a> by Rafaella. Pods´ blog readers can check the backtest of this strategy and how it would have performed if it were available when ETH started in 2015 until the present.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team of <a href="https://www.pods.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pods</a> recently announced the mainnet launch of its 3rd strategy on Pods Yield: FUD Vault, which now complements ETHphoria and stETHvv.</span></p>
<p><strong>FUD Vault provides a way for users to benefit from market downturns by offering a mechanism to hedge against significant price drops in ETH while preserving the deposited principal.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-123897" src="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/pods-fud-vault.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="332" srcset="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/pods-fud-vault.jpg 626w, https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/pods-fud-vault-622x330.jpg 622w, https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/pods-fud-vault-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<h4><b>Who is this product for?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FUD Vault is designed for individuals who have uncertainties about the future performance of ETH and want to find a way to potentially profit even when the market is experiencing a downward trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By depositing funds into the FUD Vault, users can take advantage of a specific strategy that aims to mitigate the risks associated with a falling market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, if you feel uncertain or skeptical about the future performance of ETH and desire a strategy that allows for potential profit-making during market declines, the FUD Vault could be a suitable option.</span></p>
<h4><b>Product Values</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FUD Vault offers several key values to its users:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Simplified Strategy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: By consolidating a single strategy into one token, the FUD Vault enhances both DeFi composability and user convenience. Users can easily manage their deposits by transferring them between addresses, utilizing them as collateral on other protocols, and effortlessly verifying their holdings within a specific strategy. The aim is to streamline the user experience and provide a seamless interface for interacting with the vault.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Access to Intricate Strategies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With just a single click, users gain access to intricate strategies within the FUD Vault. These strategies are designed to optimize returns and navigate the complexities of the market. By offering these strategies in a user-friendly manner, the vault allows users to benefit from sophisticated investment approaches without needing in-depth knowledge or expertise.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexible Withdrawal:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Users can withdraw their funds from the FUD Vault at any point after the deposit has been processed. This feature ensures that users maintain control over their assets and can access their funds whenever they need them.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Transparent Historical Returns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The FUD Vault provides users with a clear display of actual historical returns. This transparency allows users to assess the performance of the vault and make informed decisions about their investments. By presenting accurate and up-to-date information, the vault aims to build trust and confidence among its users.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>How FUD Vault Operates</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you deposit USDC the vault immediately invests in Aave. Then, it utilizes the entire lending yield generated by Aave for purchasing ETH put options. These put options have a delta ranging from 0,03-0,12 and a maturity period of one week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple terms, the put options act as a form of insurance against a significant drop in the price of ETH. If the price of ETH decreases by more than 10% within the one-week timeframe, the put options are exercised and the resulting profits are distributed to the depositors of the FUD Vault.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Summary</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FUD Vault offers a user-friendly experience, providing convenient deposit management, access to intricate strategies, flexible withdrawal options, and transparent historical return information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These values ensure that users can easily navigate the vault, make informed decisions, and enjoy the benefits of the platform&#8217;s offerings.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">RockX, an Asia-based <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2021/01/19/moonstake-teams-with-rockx-to-expand-polkadot-dot-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">institutional-grade staking</a> services provider, announced today the broadening of its staking product suite with the addition of a new ether (ETH) native staking solution. This latest offering strengthens RockX&#8217;s position as a comprehensive provider of diverse staking needs, maneuvering quickly to the evolving crypto market landscape.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Navigating the Ethereum ecosystem presents institutions with unique challenges, including liquidity issues, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, counterparty failures, and a complex technological mastery hurdle, which have become more pronounced in the wake of the Shapella upgrade. RockX is committed to overcoming these hurdles by providing robust and secure solutions that simplify the staking process and instill confidence in its users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ETH native staking solution stands as a testament to this commitment, differentiating itself through optimal yield for validators via its pool solution on execution layer rewards, competitively low fees without charges on protocol rewards, and a swift, two-step staking process. The strategic introduction of these ETH staking solutions by RockX leverages the vast market potential as institutions increasingly venture into the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aligned with its long-term strategy to simplify institutional blockchain adoption, RockX is planning the full launch of a Staking API that supports blockchains later this year. This will offer institutions a scalable, secure, and efficient pathway for integrating their existing platforms with RockX, thereby facilitating speedier market entry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Already, RockX has registered an inflow of over 7,000 ETH staking post the Shapella upgrade and anticipates an additional 50,000 ETH in the coming weeks. RockX&#8217;s staking solutions have garnered the trust of leading crypto exchanges and wallets/custodians, including Amber Group, Bitgo, and Matrixport.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8220;Our partnership with RockX reflects our joint dedication to enhancing investor confidence and establishing a secure and efficient crypto ecosystem. We are enthusiastic about the potential of RockX’s institutional staking solution, which we believe will address liquidity needs of institutional clients while driving innovation in the blockchain industry.”</strong><br />
<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>&#8211; Annabelle Huang, Managing Partner of Amber Group</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Following the recent launch of its Liquid Staking product, Bedrock, and a White Label product designed for companies seeking to establish crypto businesses, the addition of an ETH native staking service showcases RockX’s devotion to helping institutions overcome hurdles to Ethereum adoption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8220;Our diversified staking solutions, headlined by the new ETH native staking tool, equip institutions with reliable and user-friendly resources in the blockchain domain. As the staking landscape continues to grow, we are thrilled to be at the forefront of this exciting evolution in institutional staking solutions.&#8221;</strong><br />
<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>&#8211; Chen Zhuling, CEO of RockX</strong></span></p>

<p>The partnership sees Hex Trust fully integrate LAND into its custody platform, Hex Safe, which <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2021/11/25/animoca-and-hex-trust-form-jv-to-offer-gamefi-blockchain-wallet-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports cryptocurrencies</a>, security tokens, and NFTs. <em>The Sandbox</em> has added Hex Trust as a certified partner to its directory list for custody services.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“We are always on the lookout to provide new ways to secure our community’s digital assets and bring peace of mind to The Sandbox’s community. After working with Hex Trust for the past few months, we are very excited to formally establish a partnership to further integrate their services into the metaverse.” </strong><br />
<a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Sebastien Borget, COO &amp; Co-Founder of The Sandbox</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>This integration enables institutional investors, brands, and corporations to store LAND assets with Hex Trust, instead of having to store these valuable virtual land assets in online hot wallets exposed to security and hacking risks.</p>
<p>Besides providing custody services for LAND, Hex Trust provides services to buy and sell LAND, as well as financing solutions, including leasing LAND assets and virtual mortgages. Hex Trust entered The Sandbox’s metaverse in 2022 and purchased an Estate in the ‘Web3 Zone’.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Hex Trust and The Sandbox have been working closely together over the last few months following the launch of our NFT custody services back in early 2020. It’s great to solidify our relationship with a certified partnership, continuing to provide the best-in-class custody services for assets in the metaverse to meet increasing institutional demand. As web3 continues to grow, more brands and investors will need highly-secure solutions provided by custodians to store their assets with peace of mind in a fully-compliant manner.”</strong><br />

<p>Infinity’s <a href="https://www.infinity.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.infinity.exchange/">wholesale exchange</a>, the first of several planned infrastructures, provides inter-exchange clearing, fixed and floating rate markets, as well as enterprise-grade risk management utilizing hybrid on-chain/off-chain infrastructures that deliver transaction efficiency, security, and scalability.</p>
<p>Infinity is a pioneering interest rate protocol that forms the basis for benchmark rates, institutional-grade lending, borrowing, and risk management in DeFi. The money market exchange protocol was founded by ex-Morgan Stanley Head of Structuring, Kevin Lepsoe.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Infinity is building critical infrastructure for DeFi, and its protocol enabling price discovery and management of risk within DeFi is transformative for institutions, Infinity’s groundwork paves the way for institutional flows on-chain, new levels of rates, and risk innovation, and we are keen to support their advances in the hybrid finance space.”</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.laserdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.laserdigital.com/"><strong>&#8211; Olivier Dang,  Head of Ventures at Laser Digital</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Laser Digital was recently unveiled by Nomura to spearhead its digital asset ambitions and is chaired by Steve Ashley, who previously led Nomura’s wholesale division, with Dr. Jez Mohideen as its CEO. Headquartered in Switzerland, Laser Digital’s investments are focused on DeFi, centralized finance (CeFi), web3, and blockchain infrastructure.</p>
<p>The investment comes as the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) published guidelines for crypto exposures in December 2022, with bank-prescribed risk weightings for tokenized assets to be treated on par 1:1 with their analog counterparts. The guidelines for banks come into effect on 1 January 2025.</p>
<p>With USD $300 trillion of credit securities outstanding and multiples of that in the loan, derivative, and equity markets, the new guidelines portend a major wave of tokenization across financial and real assets.</p>
<p>Presently in Beta, the Inifinity mainnet is scheduled to launch by the end of Q2 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eventus, a provider of multi-asset class trade surveillance and market risk solutions, announced today that <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2022/07/05/crypto-software-suite-1token-adds-support-deribit-derivatives-options-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2022/07/05/crypto-software-suite-1token-adds-support-deribit-derivatives-options-futures/">cryptocurrency derivatives exchange</a> Deribit has chosen the firm’s Validus platform to provide market abuse monitoring on the exchange.</p>
<p>Headquartered in <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2020/01/10/crypto-derivatives-exchange-deribit-goes-offshore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2020/01/10/crypto-derivatives-exchange-deribit-goes-offshore/">Panama City, Panama</a>, Deribit is one of the largest cryptocurrency options exchanges by volume and open interest, with approximately 90% market share in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) options. The exchange also offers select futures on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>David Dohmen, Deribit&#8217;s Chief Legal, Compliance &amp; Regulatory Officer said the exchange considered several trade surveillance systems in anticipation of operating under the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/08/09/pavocoin-ag-execs-head-to-the-uae-to-participate-in-the-dubai-blockchain-summit-on-august-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dubai</a> and as Deribit looked to expand into additional jurisdictions while maintaining the highest compliance standards.</p>
<p>He articulated: “Once I joined Deribit and our search for a surveillance vendor was underway, I was able to share that Eventus’ customer service is excellent. I’ve looked at and worked with a variety of trade surveillance systems, including Validus in two of my former roles since 2019. I was most impressed with the dedication and diligence of the Eventus team to continuously work with its clients to help improve how the system can meet our needs and resolve any issues we encounter along the way. They care about getting things done; it’s not just about the numbers.”</p>
<p>Additional factors in Deribit’s selection of Eventus, Dohmen said, were the firm’s vast experience with crypto asset exchanges and competitive pricing, plus the point that Validus is intuitive and easy to use.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;We are delighted to help Deribit achieve heightened surveillance capabilities. As the exchange continues to grow and expand its business to new regulatory jurisdictions, our Validus platform provides the scalable, agile solution the compliance team will need as its volumes increase and regulatory requirements become more complex.”</strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ThunderCore, a <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2019/05/13/silicon-valley-based-blockchain-platform-provider-thundercore-launches-its-mainnet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading blockchain &amp; web3 ecosystem</a> announced today that they are making a new development push, partnering with new validators as the chain rolls out its new crypto staking model.</p>
<p><strong>The newest ThunderCore validators include the famous <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2021/10/18/crypto-exchange-huobi-japan-approved-to-offer-derivatives-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto-asset exchange</a> Huobi and one of the earliest staking platforms in the space, MyCointainer. Users of both will now be able to stake ThunderCore&#8217;s native asset TT to earn rewards.</strong></p>
<p>Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, ThunderCore is an environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) chain, which means that its consensus mechanism for validating transactions is based on incentivized crypto staking.</p>
<p>ThunderCore&#8217;s new PoS staking model, also known as ThunderCore 2.0, will dramatically increase both user staking and validator nodes.</p>
<p>Such decentralization is crucial to secure PoS chains like ThunderCore, which must withstand coordinated attacks by malicious actors seeking to control two-thirds of the network while adding more trustworthy validators also improves scalability and accelerates user growth.</p>
<h3><strong>Validator Expansion</strong></h3>
<p>As a new partner, Huobi will implement and maintain a ThunderCore node, further securing the ThunderCore ecosystem. Additionally, Huobi&#8217;s tens of millions of users will have access to ThunderCore PoS staking, while TT will be available to stake on Huobi Earn.</p>
<p>On top of operating a node, MyCointainer will allow for deposits and withdrawals on the platform. MyCointainer users will have access to TT trading pairs against BTC, USDT, and other major cryptos and fiat pairs.</p>
<p>The expansion of the validator network represents a significant step forward for ThunderCore, solidifying its position as a leading blockchain.</p>
<h3><strong>DeFi Outreach</strong></h3>
<p>With the new ThunderCore 2.0 PoS staking model, the popular blockchain has overhauled its tokenomics, aiming to become a bigger DeFi player in the years to come. Having already nurtured its native DeFi ecosystem, the ThunderCore developers are now seeking to court top DeFi protocols such as Curve Finance, AAVE, SushiSwap, Stargate, and many others.</p>
<p>The ThunderCore team has begun this effort by making overtures to the leading DeFi projects.</p>
<p>Diversifying ThunderCore&#8217;s native DeFi ecosystem allows the team to build a brighter future with the support of the project&#8217;s multi-chain feature, decentralization, and community-driven economics.</p>
<p>The team offers ThunderCore&#8217;s user-retention and mass-adoption strategy (over 400K monthly active users), one-stop-shop TT Wallet, high levels of interoperability, extensive partnerships, and a range of developer incentives and tools, among other points.</p>
<p>Corresponding proposals are in the works for the other major DeFi protocols.</p>
<h3><strong>Future Plans</strong></h3>
<p>ThunderCore will continue to welcome new validators to its PoS network. This aligns with the team&#8217;s commitment to providing a secure and decentralized platform for its users.</p>
<p>Adding new, reputable organizations to the validator network enhances the security of the blockchain, making it a top choice for decentralized applications. Meanwhile, increased staking rewards under the new tokenomics are a tangible benefit to the community that furthers the same goals.</p>
<p>Also, ThunderCore will be encouraging more DeFi projects to open up shop. The high-performance chain offers many benefits for DeFi, including sub-second transactions, gas fees at a fraction of a cent, and massive scalability.</p>
<p>Some features listed below make ThunderCore an ideal home for DeFi developers looking to build and grow on a reliable and secure network.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ThunderCore for Developers &#8211; </strong>ThunderCore is among the most hospitable homes for developers in the Web3 industry. The company has long believed that if you attract the best developers, then the users will follow. To that end, they have made various efforts to nurture their developer community:</li>
<li><strong>ThunderGene API Tool &#8211; </strong>ThunderCore&#8217;s groundbreaking API tool allows for the easy integration of Web3 features into Web2 apps. With ThunderGene, it&#8217;s possible to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens inside a Web2 app while outsourcing the burden of wallet security to the cutting-edge TT Wallet.</li>
<li><strong>$100M Web3 Fund &#8211; </strong>Along with partners 886 Studios and Outliers Fund, ThunderCore maintains a $100M fund to assist those who would like to build decentralized applications on its chain.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Growth Fund &#8211; </strong>In addition to the $100M Web3 Fund, ThunderCore also operates a Developer Growth Fund, which is about to undergo a major update. The fund guides projects to completion with technical, promotional, financial, and operational assistance.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pods, creators of a DeFi platform, announced today that earlier this year, the team raised $5.6M in seed funding to create structured products for crypto-assets. The financing featured investors such as IOSG, Tomahawk, Republic, Framework Ventures, and more.</p>
<p>The first strategy on Pods Yield is stETHvv (Ethereum Volatility Vault). stETHvv is a low-risk product focused on ETH accumulation. It combines <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2021/02/25/lido-teams-with-unslashed-to-cover-200m-worth-of-staked-ether-against-slashing-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lido&#8217;s yield</a> with weekly strangles to earn more every time the ETH price bounces up or down.</p>
<p>Currently, Pods platform users can deposit ETH and stETH into the vault stETHvv (short for stETH Volatility Vault) and be exposed to a low-risk, complex-to-execute strategy in one click.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“At Pods, we are proud of what we have achieved and thrilled to continue building the future of DeFi. I am honored to announce that we have completed a $5.6 million seed round. The Pods team is excited about this next stage of building world-class structured products for crypto assets. We have talked to hundreds of stakeholders to understand their needs and improve our platform according to their feedback. Recently Pods did four security audits on its Pods Yield product, two of them with OpenZeppelin in November and December 2022. We are not only generating results but have developed a range of products dedicated to assisting DeFi protocols to diversify their treasury into low-risk strategies, making their treasury strategy more resilient”</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.pods.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Rafaella Baraldo, Founder &amp; CEO of Pods</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Today, most DeFi yield strategies depend on liquidity mining campaigns, incur a hard-to-estimate risk, and most use spot markets. Pods foresee opportunities to set up automated derivatives strategies independent of liquidity mining. Risk and return analyses are transparent and quantitative.</p>
<p>As a DeFi protocol, Pods presents an alternative to yield on crypto-assets as opposed to CeFi lenders. Pods Yield is a series of open-source smart contracts that algorithmically runs a known investment strategy, receive deposits, and process withdrawals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deribit, the <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2022/07/05/crypto-software-suite-1token-adds-support-deribit-derivatives-options-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular cryptocurrency derivatives exchange</a>, announced today it has launched a new &#8216;<a href="https://insights.deribit.com/exchange-updates/proof-of-reserves-deribit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proof of Reserves</a>&#8216; tool for clients using the trading platform. Now, clients are provided with the functionality to verify their assets to be included in Deribit&#8217;s overall reserves.</p>
<h3><strong>How it Works</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Deribit provides all addresses for all on-chain assets and it delivers a daily file with all liabilities (all client balances) in a hashed way. Note, assets held by third-party custodians cannot be included in the report as they are not under Deribit’s direct control. Therefore, the data file that is fully accessible to all interested parties only contains the accounts that hold assets on Deribit.</li>
<li>Clients get a key allowing them to find their balances in the overall file and can be certain their assets are covered with Deribit&#8217;s on-chain balance.</li>
<li>All code used to create Deribit’s modified Merkle Tree is available so clients can verify the accuracy of the frontend data. To prevent the same nonces from being assigned to different users with comparable asset levels, reducing the size of liabilities, Deribit gives each account a unique &#8216;Proof ID&#8217;. A client can convert the &#8216;Proof ID&#8217; into the identifiers found in the daily snapshot file and shown in the verification section of the <a href="https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/proof-of-reserves" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proof of Reserves page</a>.</li>
<li>The aggregate of the assets included in the asset file should always be less than the aggregate of assets available on-chain. The difference is the Deribit reserve ratio, which includes the <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/03/26/bitcoin-derivatives-exchange-deribit-completes-major-system-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurance funds</a> and Deribit revenues. If the total on-chain balance is higher than the asset file balance (visible in the front end and in the file itself), then Deribit has Proof of Reserves.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tenderly, creators of a blockchain development platform, today announced that it is the first web3 development platform to offer simulations through RPC on its Tenderly Web3 Gateway, the company&#8217;s production node as a service.</p>
<p>Note, Tenderly already processes more than 50 million simulations per month through its Transaction Simulator. Now, the company is introducing the same capabilities to the world of JSON-RPC.</p>
<p>Just recently, Tenderly entered the node infrastructure space with its Tenderly Web3 Gateway, which is built on top of more than four years of dev tools and observability experience, and Tenderly continues to deliver new products into the node space.</p>
<p><strong>The Tenderly Web3 Gateway is a tightly integrated part of its development platform that helps engineers streamline the process of building and deploying smart contracts. The gateway has support for 20+ EVM-based (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, Tenderly provides developers with a variety of options to achieve greater speed, improve scalability, and reduce costs.</strong></p>
<p>Now, with the addition of simulations to Tenderly Web3 Gateway, Tenderly enables developers to build smarter and more efficient decentralized applications (dApps) with more powerful and easy-to-use dApp building blocks. Setting up simulations and sending transactions on-chain is made possible through a single RPC URL and a custom-built RPC method.</p>
<p>The importance of simulating transactions before sending them is reflected in that developers have greater insight into the execution of their transactions, including more visibility into failures and errors, as well as gas consumption issues.</p>
<p>Armed with this essential information, developers can embed transparency and predictability directly into their dApp, increasing transaction visibility and reducing the chances of failures and/or costly mistakes for all of their users. Additionally, beginner developers who are exploring smart contract optimization options can also benefit from Tenderly Web3 Gateway due to its simple and easy-to-use design.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Our initial launch of Tenderly Web3 Gateway last month was just the tip of the iceberg for what we plan to do in the node provider space. By integrating simulations with Tenderly Web3 Gateway, we set the direction for the evolution of the node provider ecosystem. We already have the next big thing in our sights and under development that will even further simplify web3 developers&#8217; life.&#8221;</strong><br />
<a href="https://tenderly.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Andrej Bencic, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Tenderly</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Key features of the Tenderly Web3 Gateway include:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom-built RPC endpoint</strong> &#8211; To run simulations through the gateway, all developers have to do is add a single RPC URL to their code and call a custom-built RPC method. This eliminates the need to integrate separate APIs for simulations and deployment, ensuring a faster development process without configuration pain.</li>
<li><strong>Fast response time</strong> &#8211; The multi-regional architecture of Tenderly Web3 Gateway automatically routes simulation requests to the location nearest to the user, which reduces latency and ensures the simulation results are returned almost instantaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Simulate against real mainnet data</strong> &#8211; When running simulations through Tenderly Web3 Gateway, a transaction is executed against a copy of the most up-to-date Mainnet data, eliminating the guesswork and manual effort that goes into ensuring the success of transactions before they hit the blockchain. Web3 developers can integrate this functionality into their dapps to provide a more transparent and predictable experience for their users.</li>
<li><strong>100% accurate simulation results</strong> &#8211; Since transactions are simulated against the latest state of the blockchain, developers get accurate insights into what would happen before sending the transaction. The simulation results received back from Tenderly help developers correct errors and understand the outcome of transactions being added to the blockchain.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DFINITY Foundation, the not-for-profit organization contributing to the development of the <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2021/05/07/dfinity-foundation-launches-its-blockchain-powered-internet-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Computer (IC)</a> — a high-speed, internet-scale public blockchain — has announced today the Internet Computer&#8217;s mainnet integration with Bitcoin, bringing smart contract functionality to the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Now, the Internet Computer can serve as a layer-2 for Bitcoin where smart contracts on the Internet Computer can hold, send and receive bitcoin natively, without the need for bridges or other 3rd-parties. This provides a trustless foundation for varied DeFi and web3 applications seeking to code Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Blockchains are like walled gardens, incapable of interaction between one another. When this comes to Bitcoin, applications, such as DeFi applications, that could benefit most from interacting with the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency do not have the ability to do so. The Internet Computer&#8217;s integration with Bitcoin is a true game-changer for the industry, finally bringing smart contract functionality to Bitcoin and enabling a whole new landscape of DeFi and dapp development never before possible using BTC.&#8221;</strong><br />
<a href="https://internetcomputer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Manu Drijvers, Director of Engineering at the DFINITY Foundation</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>With IC integration, bitcoin can be used for DeFi activities like yield farming, lending, payments, and more&#8230;</strong></h4>
<p>This is achieved through the Internet Computer&#8217;s enhanced Chain-key cryptography. The direct integration with Bitcoin averts the need for bridged and wrapped Bitcoin, a technique used to facilitate interaction between different blockchains, but one that is error-prone and often hacked.</p>
<p>To enable fast bitcoin transactions between smart contracts on the Internet Computer, the DFINITY Foundation is now working on Chain-Key Bitcoin (ckBTC). Here, ckBTC will act as a local ledger facilitating fast transactions with low fees and only settle transactions on the Bitcoin network when necessary.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits / Developers</strong></h3>
<p>The Internet Computer&#8217;s integration with Bitcoin also provides a more secure alternative to centralized bridges in the form of threshold ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). The implementation of ECDSA empowers the Internet Computer&#8217;s canister smart contracts, to directly conduct bitcoin transactions without an intermediary or bridge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2021/05/25/dfinity-launches-200m-developer-grant-program-for-the-internet-computer-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICP&#8217;s developer community</a> has long expressed a strong demand for this feature&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>DEX projects such as Helix or IC Lighthouse are already building on the Bitcoin and Chain-Key signing features to offer bridgeless inter-chain token swaps. Moreover, a few ecosystem dApps are also ready to launch some creative use cases beyond DeFi.</p>
<p>Among them is the crowdfunding platform, CrowdfunNFT – which will accept funding for projects in BTC. The aim is to expand the crowdfunding market overall and bring in a fresh set of project backers to crypto. Other examples of use cases in development are transactions in BTC on NFT marketplaces and peer-to-peer transfer of BTC directly on social media and messaging dApps.</p>
<p>Bringing new programmability to Bitcoin will open more unique and imaginative use cases in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase, the <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2021/05/25/coinbase-launches-new-fully-integrated-crypto-prime-brokerage-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular bitcoin &amp; crypto exchange company</a>, announced today it will be rolling out &#8216;Easy Bank Transfers&#8217; for UK users. The new feature delivers an easy way to add funds to Coinbase accounts.</p>
<p>Through a partnership with TrueLayer, one of Europe’s leading open banking platforms, Coinbase is able to support Easy Bank Transfers, which relies on <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/what-is-open-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open banking technology</a>.</p>
<p>In the weeks ahead, users will be able to link their bank account directly with their Coinbase account, without needing to enter their bank details, for a more convenient and user-friendly experience.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Coinbase is one of the first major crypto platforms to offer users rapid, secure deposits into their Coinbase account via open banking. Easy Bank Transfers solve these issues for Coinbase users: users no longer have to manually type out payee details, rely on copy/paste, be sent through long verification steps, or anxiously wait for confirmation that a payment was successful.&#8221;</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; The Coinbase Team</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Open banking delivers several other key benefits for Coinbase users, including:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security</strong> &#8211; No one can access users’ login details or banking passwords through open banking.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong> &#8211; Transferring funds via open banking is often faster than making a conventional online transfer, especially on mobile, because of how your bank account is linked to Coinbase.</li>
<li><strong>Control </strong>&#8211; The user has full control over who sees their banking information, and is able to specify exactly what level of access is permitted.</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong> &#8211; Companies can only take payments with the user&#8217;s authorization as the account owner.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Biconomy, a web3 development platform &amp; toolkit that superpowers <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2021/01/11/biconomy-raises-seed-round-of-1-5m-to-enable-developers-to-simplify-web3-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain technology stacks</a>, today announced it has launched a software development kit (SDK) to transform the way developers build easy-to-use decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>Since 2019, Biconomy has been engaged with the<a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2020/03/06/biconomy-selected-as-the-first-blockchain-project-from-india-for-outlier-ventures-accelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> web3 infrastructure space</a> by building easy-to-integrate, plug-and-play APIs for developers to scale their projects. The <a href="https://www.biconomy.io/sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biconomy SDK</a> introduces time-saving steps for developers such as reducing multi-step transactions into one-click interactions, simple-to-use smart contract wallets, and a conveniently gasless and chainless experience for users.</p>
<h3><strong>Easier Development</strong></h3>
<p>As institutional and retail adoption of cryptocurrencies and dApps grow, dApp developers can onboard more web2 users by hiding the nuts and bolts behind complex on-chain transactions. This way, the majority of web2 users can onboard and interact with dApps easily — playing games, buying and trading NFTs and other digital assets — without deep knowledge of blockchain technology. dApps can save their users a ton of time and costs.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“There is no point building in web3 if no one can use your products. User onboarding and retention are key for the growth of individual dApps and the crypto environment as a whole. Biconomy was built with the next billion web3 users in mind and we are fulfilling this goal by meeting developer and user needs. From gasless to one-click transactions, we are making sure engaging with web3 feels second nature and as easy as signing your name.&#8221;</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.biconomy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Ahmed Al-Balaghi, Co-Founder of Biconomy</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The introduction of the Biconomy SDK opens up further opportunities. Developers can offer users practical UX benefits such as secure web2-like social logins and recovery for accounts.</p>
<p>One-click interactions for multistep transactions. Transaction batching removes the need for repeated authorization. Gasless and chainless experiences. Convenient fee payments in ERC20 tokens and fiat on-ramps and credit card purchases of crypto or NFTs.</p>
<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>
<p>Biconomy SDK brings blockchain-agnostic, web2-like experiences to your dApp in a non-custodial manner.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what is possible with the SDK today:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy User Onboarding &#8211;</strong> Social login, account creation &amp; recovery to seamlessly onboard web2 users.</li>
<li><strong>Fiat On Ramp &#8211; </strong>Let end-users easily &amp; reliably buy/sell crypto within a dApp.</li>
<li><strong>Gasless Transactions &#8211;</strong> dApps can sponsor gas fees to make user interactions as simple as web2 transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Paying Gas Fees In ERC20 Tokens &#8211; </strong> Users can utilize any ERC20 asset in their wallet to pay gas fees.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Transaction Bundling &#8211;</strong> Allow developers to build methods to do transaction batching which enables users to execute multiple actions, even across multiple chains, in a single transaction (e.g. approve &amp; deposit can be done in one transaction without changing anything in dApp smart contracts).</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Chain Contract Calls &amp; Asset Transfer &#8211;</strong> Coming soon, the Biconomy SDK will provide in-dApp cross-chain asset bridging and contract calls to enable a chainless experience for end-users.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trust Wallet, a self-custodial and <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2019/02/04/binance-backed-trust-wallet-joins-foundation-for-interwallet-operability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet</a> application, has announced the launch of its brand-new browser extension wallet. Supporting all EVM chains, as well as Solana, it is available now on browsers including <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trust-wallet/egjidjbpglichdcondbcbdnbeeppgdph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome</a>, Brave, and Opera.</p>
<p>The browser extension complements Trust Wallet&#8217;s mobile wallet, which is the world&#8217;s leading mobile crypto wallet with 60 million downloads and over 10 million monthly active users globally. Both versions of Trust Wallet deliver enhanced web3 accessibility and offer a more seamless wallet experience for both desktop and mobile environments.</p>
<p>With Trust Wallet&#8217;s browser extension, users can manage, store, send, and receive over 8 million tokens across all EVM chains and Solana. This includes Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche with e ability to custom-add other EVM chains. More non-EVMs will be added in the upcoming months and will be announced in due course.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Trust Wallet browser extension improves the multi-chain experience for users on desktops. Network auto-detect allows for a seamless dApp experience without needing to manually add networks. Also, the browser extension enables users to effectively discover things beyond centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as web3 gaming, metaverse, DeFi, tokens not found on CEXs, and more.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Our users&#8217; number one request is the Browser extension and they want one with the same good user experience as the Trust Wallet mobile app and the multi-chain coverage. We build for users to empower them whichever device they prefer, to continue to access the exciting dApps on different chains. This is our initial step, and we will listen to users&#8217; and developers&#8217; feedback to improve.&#8221;</strong><br />
<a href="https://trustwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Eowyn Chen, </strong></a><strong><a href="https://trustwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO of Trust Wallet</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Features that already exist on Trust Wallet&#8217;s mobile app like multi-wallet support, NFT support, fiat on-ramp providers, and non-EVM blockchain integrations will be added to the browser extension to bring more parity between the desktop and the mobile version. However, there are unique features that will be launched on extension first like hardware wallet support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hash Blockchain Limited (HBL), a member of the HashKey Group (HashKey), a <a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2019/08/23/blockchain-payments-network-terra-gets-investment-from-hashkey-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain asset financial services group</a> in Asia, announced today it has received approval from the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) to operate a virtual asset trading platform, under a Type 1 (dealing in securities) license and a Type 7 (automated trading services ATS license) for professional investors.</p>
<p><strong>With the SFC licenses, HashKey Group has now become the world’s first digital asset group with virtual asset licenses from the Hong Kong SFC, the Financial Services Agency of Japan, and an exemption to operate under the Payment Services Act from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Trading with HashKey</strong></h3>
<p>HashKey PRO is the name of HBL’s institutional-grade crypto asset trading platform. HashKey PRO will provide professional investors with automated trading services for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, as well as stablecoins, security tokens, and more.</p>
<p>Unlike other unregulated crypto trading platforms, HashKey PRO is designed to ensure there is a high level of client asset protection. Client assets are segregated and held in custody by HashKey Custody Services Limited, which holds a Trust or Company Service Provider license in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>HBL’s license issuances come after a statement on October 31, 2022, by the city’s Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, which outlined its vision and approach to develop Hong Kong into an international virtual assets hub.</p>
<figure id="attachment_122781" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-122781" style="width: 189px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-122781" src="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/michaelleehaashkey.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="189" srcset="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/michaelleehaashkey.jpg 474w, https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/michaelleehaashkey-330x330.jpg 330w, https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/michaelleehaashkey-250x250.jpg 250w, https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/michaelleehaashkey-80x80.jpg 80w, https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/michaelleehaashkey-75x75.jpg 75w, https://www.cryptoninjas.net/wp-content/uploads/michaelleehaashkey-350x350.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-122781" class="wp-caption-text">Michel Lee, HashKey Group</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;The recent policy statement is a testament to the Hong Kong government’s dedication and commitment to fortify the city’s status as a frontrunner and leader in blockchain and virtual asset innovation and regulation. We are delighted to have received the licenses given the backdrop of this positive announcement. This enables us to provide regulated and compliant virtual asset trading services as we continue to help build the financial, technological, and service infrastructure to facilitate and contribute to the rapid growth and the long-term development of the ecosystem.”</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.hashkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Michel Lee, Executive President of HashKey Group</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Regulation Background</strong></h3>
<p>In 2022, the Hong Kong government and regulators have been setting out new guidelines and a licensing framework to regulate virtual asset trading activities in the interest of consumer and investor protection.</p>
<p>A joint circular announcement was issued by the SFC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on January 28 2022 stating that registered institutions and licensed corporations are required to partner only with SFC-licensed VATPs in order to provide virtual asset dealing services to their clients.</p>
<p>At Hong Kong FinTech Week 2022, the SFC also released a Circular on Virtual Asset Futures Exchange Traded Funds, stating that the SFC will start accepting applications for the authorization of such funds. The SFC has started reviewing the “professional investor only” requirement applicable to the investment of virtual asset products and is preparing a circular to set a modified security token regime to treat tokenized assets in line with traditional assets on a “same business, same risk and same rules” approach.</p>

<p>Just recently, BetDEX became one of the first licensed sports betting exchanges built on the blockchain. Under the Online Gambling Regulation Act (OGRA), the BetDEX Exchange received licensed approval from the Isle of Man for all forms of online gambling and gaming, including online sports betting.</p>
<p>Upon launch, BetDEX will accept users from countries across Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. The fully non-custodial exchange is powered by the Monaco Protocol.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;After a successful open beta we are excited to officially launch the BetDEX Exchange in select countries and territories around the world. As the world&#8217;s first fully licensed web3 sports betting exchange, we&#8217;re looking forward to onboarding members into a booming space. Launching just ahead of the world&#8217;s premier sporting event is an exciting moment as our community can wager on matches throughout the duration of the World Cup and beyond.&#8221;</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.betdex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Varun Sudhakar, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of BetDEX</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In the near future, BetDEX is expected to accept wagers on tennis, cricket, and more.</p>
<p>Since introducing its open beta in early October, the BetDEX Exchange has accepted wagers from over 12,000 early access members. A &#8220;beta&#8221; tag will remain on the exchange until 2023, but customers will be able to wager real money immediately upon launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OKX, one of the largest crypto exchanges by volume and a leading web3 platform, today announced its registration as a Digital Asset Business in The Bahamas under the newly adopted Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Act.</p>
<p>The company has also formed a new subsidiary, OKX Bahamas, for which it appointed Dr. Jillian Bethel, a Bahamian native and blockchain industry luminary, as CEO. With plans to serve as a regional hub, OKX Bahamas has opened a Nassau-based office and plans to fill 100 job openings locally.</p>
<p>OKX Bahamas will cater to Latin America and the Caribbean&#8217;s growing population of cryptocurrency investors and traders.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“OKX is thrilled about our expansion into The Bahamas under the innovative DARE Act. We are prioritizing growth in regulated markets because we want to enable responsible crypto activity globally. By working with forward-looking authorities like the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, we can create safe and sustainable environments for crypto to exist.”</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.okx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>&#8211; Tim Byun, Global Government Relations Officer, OKX</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>OKX selected The Bahamas as a strategic growth location because of the effective regulatory framework created by the Securities Commission of The Bahamas. Already known as a prestigious international business and financial center, The Bahamas is emerging as a global leader in digital assets through its progressive legislation and regulatory structures.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The DARE Act has made The Bahamas a pioneer in digital asset adoption, and I’m proud to lead the OKX Bahamas team in championing crypto. As a gateway to the Caribbean and the broader Americas, The Bahamas is opening new doors for local talent and global businesses to thrive here with forward-looking policy.”</strong><br />

<p>This registration in The Bahamas comes on the heels of OKX receiving a provisional Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) license in Dubai, where it has also opened a regional hub to serve qualified investors within the UAE and surrounding countries.</p>
