<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Marathon Digital Holdings and Zero Two have unveiled a new mining operation in the Middle East.</em></li>



<li><em>The operation&#8217;s initial mining location will be in Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Masdar City.</em></li>



<li><em>The second mining location will be in Mina Zayed, Abu Dhabi&#8217;s harbor district.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/178444-marathon-digital-produced-825-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Digital</a>, a bitcoin miner, has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/09/2664929/0/en/Marathon-Digital-Holdings-and-Zero-Two-To-Develop-and-Operate-the-First-Large-Scale-Immersion-Bitcoin-Mining-Facilities-in-Abu-Dhabi.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forged</a> a partnership with Zero Two, which is sponsored by Abu Dhabi&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, to establish the Middle East&#8217;s first large-scale immersion bitcoin mining operation.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-374.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-374.png" alt="Marathon To Launch 250-megawatt Capacity Mining Operation In Abu Dhabi" class="wp-image-186396" title="Marathon To Launch 250-megawatt Capacity Mining Operation In Abu Dhabi 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Marathon Digital <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1312/marathon-digital-holdings-and-zero-two-to-develop-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on May 9 that the joint venture would be situated in Mina Zayed and Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates, with two mining sites totaling 250 megawatts.</p>



<p>The bigger 200MW facility will be built in Abu Dhabi&#8217;s sustainability center, Masdar City, while the smaller 50MW plant will be located in the Mina Zayed port zone.</p>



<p>Marathon and Zero Two want to power the facilities using extra energy from Abu Dhabi&#8217;s grid, saying that this will boost base load and sustainability.</p>



<p>The Middle Eastern alliance comes as the White House campaigns for a new levy that would require crypto miners in the nation to pay 30% of their energy bills.</p>



<p>Zero Two will hold 80% of the ADGM Entity, while Marathon will possess 20%. The mining operation is anticipated to receive $406 million in capital expenditure throughout the development period of 2023. These gifts will include both financial and in-kind contributions. Marathon and Zero Two have already purchased equipment and infrastructure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-375.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="759" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-375.png" alt="Marathon To Launch 250-megawatt Capacity Mining Operation In Abu Dhabi" class="wp-image-186397" title="Marathon To Launch 250-megawatt Capacity Mining Operation In Abu Dhabi 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The digital assets mined by the ADGM Entity will be distributed twice each month and in line with Zero Two and Marathon&#8217;s equity ownership, respectively.</p>



<p>The companies said that they launched a pilot operation in Abu Dhabi to explore the feasibility of immersion mining. In hot areas, immersion mining, which includes immersing mining gear in a liquid coolant, is challenging. Nonetheless, two businesses were able to develop their own immersion solution and discovered that this strategy was practical.</p>



<p>The news of the prospective mining facility comes as officials from the US-based crypto exchange Coinbase visit the UAE to assess the region&#8217;s potential as a strategic hub for its worldwide operations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX sends $60M to bankrupt Alameda Research wallet in 16 transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>Alameda Research&#8217;s wallet holds $285.86M in crypto assets.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX creditors try to recover assets, while speculation surrounds FTX&#8217;s relaunch.</em></li>

<p>This was accomplished through 16 transactions, which included 10 deposits of $5 million USDT and 337,859 MASK (roughly $1.30 million). It&#8217;s worth noting that OKX has promised to cooperate with FTX debtors and law enforcement officials to return any funds linked to the bankrupt firm on its platform.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="488" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1024x488.jpeg" alt="Screenshot 2023 05 09 145538" class="wp-image-186386" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1024x488.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-300x143.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-768x366.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-750x358.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1140x544.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538.jpeg 1516w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="OKX Transfers Whopping $60M To Alameda&#039;s Crypto Wallet 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Arkham Intelligence</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Moreover, during the last seven days, the Alameda wallet has received over 1 million Stargate tokens (STG) and over 5 billion units of the GPEPE meme coin from an unknown wallet. This is quite interesting considering that Alameda&#8217;s largest crypto holding was $61.40 million USDT, with other top holdings being 100 million BitDAO tokens worth $48.61 million, 19,292 Ethereum (ETH) worth $26.5 million, $12.35 million USDC, 28.9 million Stargate tokens worth $18.43 million, and 16.39 million Polygon tokens worth $14.63 million. The firm also holds altcoins like Lido (LDO), FTX Token (FTT), Serum (SRM), among others. Overall, its crypto assets are worth $285.86 million.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that FTX creditors have continued efforts to recover the exchange’s assets. The bankrupt firm has moved to claw back $3.9 billion from Genesis and has been involved in selling several assets belonging to the company.</p>



<p>There is increased speculation that suggests the possibility of FTX restarting operations. A recent court filing confirmed plans to restart FTX’s Japanese subsidiary.</p>

<p>The macro backdrop has changed little in the past few weeks, but market watchers will be focusing on “Binance and whether people are seriously storing cryptos in cold wallets,” according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange Oanda, in a <a href="https://www.marketpulse.com/newsfeed/oil-gets-bullish-alongside-gold-bitcoin-wavers/emoya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuesday note</a>.</p>



<p>As for Bitcoin, it appears to be stuck in a trading range, but if we have a de-risking moment on Wall Street, that will be enough to send cryptos toward the lows seen in mid-March, Moya wrote. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was off roughly 0.4% on Tuesday to change hands at around $1,844. Despite this, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) jumped over 9% for the day to trade at around $121.29, while Lido&#8217;s governance token (LDO) recently rose by 6% to $1.85.</p>



<p>As measured by the Market Index (CMI), the overall crypto market performance was up roughly half a percentage point for the day. However, equity markets turned mixed ahead of Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April, with the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) slid 0.1%.</p>



<p>In bond markets, the note on the 2-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to sit around 4.02%, while the 10-year Treasury yield remained almost flat from Monday, same time, to reach 3.52%.</p>



<p>Investors across the board will be watching the CPI for clues about how the U.S. Federal Reserve will act at its next policy meeting in June. The Fed approved a 25 basis points (bps) increase earlier this month to push the Federal Funds rate to its highest level in 16 years. This development has sparked debate about how the economy will develop in the coming months, with some analysts predicting a strong rebound while others are more cautious. As such, there is a great deal of uncertainly at present, and investors are keeping a close eye on the latest developments to inform their decision-making.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Transactions on the Litecoin network have reached all-time highs as a result of the meme coin craze.</em></li>



<li><em>The consequent high costs on the Bitcoin network sent crypto users seeking for alternatives, contributing to the network&#8217;s rise in transactions.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) has lately seen a large increase in whale transactions.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="506" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png" alt="Litecoin Transactions Surge Over 450% Thanks To BRC-20&#039;s Attraction" class="wp-image-186370" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Litecoin Transactions Surge Over 450% Thanks To BRC-20&#039;s Attraction 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>With a 450% rise since early May, this surge in big transactions might be related to the forthcoming release of LTC-20, a significant improvement to the Litecoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>Transactions on the Litecoin blockchain have <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-ltc.html#3m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached</a> all-time highs as the meme coin craze and consequent high fees on the Bitcoin network drive crypto consumers to seek alternatives.</p>



<p>According to BitInfoCharts blockchain statistics, Litecoin conducted more than 576,000 transactions in a single day on May 9, approaching Bitcoin&#8217;s 598,000 daily transactions. That is five times the average amount of transactions on the Litecoin blockchain compared to earlier this year, and it is more than twice the previous all-time high around the bull market&#8217;s top in January 2018.</p>

<p>The LTC-20 standard, which has a total supply of 84 million, is being created on top of the Litecoin Ordinals Protocols. The BRC-20 token, an experimental fungible token produced using Ordinals and inscriptions and kept on the Bitcoin base chain, is the goal of this new standard. BRC-20 is a token standard that allows users to generate and transfer tokens over the Bitcoin network using the Ordinals Protocol.</p>



<p>The news comes as the Bitcoin network, which is home to Bitcoin (BTC), the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, is facing high congestion as a result of a flurry of new Bitcoin-based BRC-20 tokens.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-367.png"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-367.png" alt="Litecoin Transactions Surge Over 450% Thanks To BRC-20&#039;s Attraction" class="wp-image-186372" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-367.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-367-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-367-768x384.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-367-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-367-750x375.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Litecoin Transactions Surge Over 450% Thanks To BRC-20&#039;s Attraction 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The creation of LTC-20 and the BRC-20 tokens is intended to bring considerable innovation and growth to the Litecoin ecosystem, perhaps increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors.</p>



<p>Because of Bitcoin&#8217;s congestion, consumers are looking for cheaper alternatives to transferring value through blockchain, such as stablecoins and the Lightning network.</p>



<p>Litecoin has also seen a surge in activity. According to Glassnode statistics, in addition to a record number of transactions, the number of active wallet addresses reached a new high of 718,000 on Monday. Recently, crypto users produced around 500,000 new addresses in a single day, according to the Litecoin Foundation, citing Glassnode.</p>



<p>The current uptick in Litecoin whale transactions might be attributed to investors awaiting the release of the LTC-20 standard and positioning themselves to profit from any possible price increase after the upgrade. Since the cryptocurrency market often sees price variations as a result of news and events, this spike in whale activity may indicate increased market interest in the imminent LTC-20 release.</p>

<p>Sweeney, the billionaire creator of Unreal Engine and Fortnite, took to Twitter on May 9th to poke fun at the PR firm CEO Ed Zitron&#8217;s piece titled “RIP Metaverse, we hardly knew ye.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The metaverse is dead! Let&#39;s organize an online wake so that we 600,000,000 monthly active users in Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, PUBG Mobile, Sandbox, and VRChat can mourn its passing together in real-time 3D.<a href="https://t.co/tRpFHsdZLw" target="_blank">https://t.co/tRpFHsdZLw</a></p>&mdash; Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1655995809270202392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The article claimed that the &#8220;once-buzzy technology&#8221; had &#8220;died after being abandoned by the business world.&#8221; It specifically mentions Meta&#8217;s virtual reality (VR) platform Horizon Worlds, which Zitron claims has failed to live up to its &#8220;grand promise&#8221; of becoming the future of the internet. The article also cites Decentraland and Yuga Labs’ Otherside as examples of Metaverses that have failed to live up to their hype and suggests that investors have turned their attention to the next big tech fad &#8211; generative AI.</p>



<p>However, Sweeney&#8217;s view on the matter differs greatly. He suggests that there are already 600 million users across virtual world platforms such as Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, The Sandbox, and VR Chat. To mock the article, he jokingly suggested that they organize an online wake so that the 600,000,000 monthly active users can mourn the passing of the Metaverse in real-time 3D.</p>



<p>In a recent move to accelerate the company&#8217;s plans for the Metaverse, Epic Games announced a $2 billion funding round. The investment included a $1 billion investment from Sony Group and KIRKBI, the holding company behind the LEGO Group. This came not long after LEGO Group and Epic Games announced a long-term partnership to build a &#8220;family-friendly&#8221; Metaverse. The details of the collaboration have not yet been revealed, but Lego Group&#8217;s CEO Niels Christiansen has hinted that more details will be announced soon.</p>

<p>He has pled guilty to multiple cybercrime offenses, including conducting a complex SIM swap attack to steal large amounts of cryptocurrency, hacking Twitter, conducting computer intrusions to take over social media accounts, and even cyberstalking two victims, including a minor victim. The U.S. Attorney’s Office Southern District of New York announced Tuesday the charges against O&#8217;Connor.</p>



<p>The 2020 Twitter hack was a major event that resulted in the takeover of multiple high-profile Twitter accounts and used to promote a bitcoin giveaway scam. The attackers managed to hide scam warning responses, including from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, and amassed approximately 11.3 BTC ($103,960) from the fraudulent activity. Despite multi-factor authentication being enabled on some of the accounts, the attackers still managed to take over the accounts and conduct their fraudulent activity.</p>



<p>Florida resident Graham Ivan Clark, an associate of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s who also participated in the attack, was arrested in March 2021 and tried as a young offender, as he was 17 at the time of the hack. O&#8217;Connor, 23, was also charged by the SDNY and pled guilty for his role in SIM-swapping attacks targeting high-profile executives in the cryptocurrency industry. These attacks resulted in the theft of $794,000 in digital assets.</p>



<p>The SDNY declined to name the company, only stating that it “provided wallet infrastructure and related software to cryptocurrency”, but there have been numerous cases of targeted crypto companies using this same technique. Telecoms such as AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have also been sued by victims over the lack of internal security measures that have allowed these attacks to take place.</p>



<p>It is clear that cybercrime is a major issue, and it is important for companies to take steps to protect themselves and their customers. Cybersecurity measures such as multi-factor authentication and internal security protocols can go a long way in preventing attacks like the 2020 Twitter hack. It is also important for law enforcement agencies to work together to bring cybercriminals to justice.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>US President Joe Biden called for an end to the tax loophole in favor of crypto investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Such cuts are expected to save $18 billion, he said.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the comments expressed displeasure because Biden has not indicated any remaining tax loopholes.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US President <a href="https://news.coincu.com/144584-joe-biden-calls-stricter-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Biden</a> has called for an end to unspecified crypto tax regulations that can be used to circumvent the law by wealthy crypto investors. On Twitter, Biden posted an infographic that reads: &#8220;We think Congress should cut tax loopholes to make crypto investors rich.&#8221;</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We don’t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value.

</div></figure>



<p>According to the infographic, such cuts are expected to save $18 billion. However, Joe Biden did not specify which tax loopholes exist where the reforms would generate those savings. It was this that led to comments that disagreed with his opinion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;what loopholes ser? i gave y&#8217;all more money than i made off this stuff, while taking all the risk. You also realize most american crypto users aren&#8217;t rich, but are using crypto cuz they don&#8217;t feel like they have enough to make ends meet &#8211; because of you guys?&#8221;</p>
<cite>Dogecoin co-founder Bill Markus tweeted about the hype.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Biden also considers opponents of his plan to be Republican supporters.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They&#8217;re telling us.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Initial accounts of Joe Biden&#8217;s tax plan, released in March, suggest that the government could raise $24 billion through crypto tax regulations focused on wash trading.</p>



<p>The Biden administration also proposed a 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining, which was raised again on May 2. However, it remains to be seen how much money this tax could generate. This funding and regulation seem to target miners rather than investors. He wants the government to research ways to make crypto innovation more &#8220;responsible,&#8221; minimizing any negative impacts on the climate.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="614" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1024x614.png" alt="US President Calls To Eliminate Tax Loopholes For Wealthy Crypto Investors" class="wp-image-186347" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1024x614.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-750x450.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1140x684.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US President Calls To Eliminate Tax Loopholes For Wealthy Crypto Investors 25"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>That has set off alarm bells for policymakers worldwide, with China even banning cryptocurrency mining last year. That move led to an exodus of cryptocurrency miners from the country to the United States and other countries, such as Kazakhstan.</p>



<p>Before that, in early March, Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday calling on the government to consider the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. It is a long-awaited directive that has plagued the crypto industry, primarily due to growing regulatory concerns around the world surrounding the nascent digital asset market. The measures focus on six key areas: consumer protection, financial stability, illicit activity, US competitiveness, financial inclusion, and responsible innovation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:16px">The forthcoming <a href="https://fintechfestival.asia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FinTech Festival (FTF) Asia 2023</a> is poised to be a momentous occasion that will delve into the dynamic fintech landscape. This event is scheduled for the 27th and 28th of September, 2023, at the esteemed Royal Paragon Hall in Bangkok, Thailand. The event aims to showcase the latest industry trends, innovations, and technologies while exploring how these subjects change the fintech industry and their impact on the ecosystem. AI has the potential to revolutionise the financial sector by making it more efficient, personalised, and secure. As AI technology advances, we will likely see even more innovative uses of AI in fintech, from risk management, customer service, and investment management to compliance.</h2>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Market makers Jane Street and Jump Trading are leaving the US crypto exchange market.</em></li>



<li><em>The move comes as US regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry has intensified.</em></li>



<li><em>Reportedly, the two companies still provide market-making services and have yet to abandon the crypto industry completely.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, as regulators crack down on the crypto industry, market makers Jane Street and Jump Trading are pulling out of the cryptocurrency exchange market in the United States.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Jane Street, a global trading company known for its cutting-edge approach. Similarly, Jump Trading is said to have stopped creating markets for physically settled crypto derivatives in the United States. This decision is in line with their risk management strategy. It aims to avoid potential legal challenges that may arise in the future.</p>



<p>According to reports, the two businesses still offer market-making services and are still involved in cryptocurrency. While Jump Trading&#8217;s division for trading digital assets, Jump Crypto, is quitting the US market despite its aspirations to grow abroad, Jane Street is reducing the scope of its global crypto operations.</p>



<p>Following the FTX crash, US policymakers and regulators stepped up scrutiny of the crypto industry. Some observers have even called it the &#8220;crypto war.&#8221; Industry giants such as Coinbase, a16z, or the Blockchain Association <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186110-a16z-blockchain-association-criticizes-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have responded</a> and criticized the US SEC&#8217;s tightening proposals.</p>

<p>The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has sued cryptocurrency exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, accusing the company of knowingly providing unregistered crypto derivatives products in the United States.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s just say that US lawmakers and authorities have intensified their regulatory assault on the cryptocurrency industry in the wake of the stunning collapse of the centralized exchange FTX, which has made investors and company owners wary about all business decisions.</p>



<p>Former FTX SBF CEO worked at Jane Street before entering the crypto industry and has hired several former Jane Street employees to join FTX, including former FTX US President Brett Harrison.</p>

<p>A Delaware statutory trust structure called Grayscale Funds Trust, which will improve our skills as a global asset manager, was also created, according to the business.</p>

<p>A registration statement regarding the Grayscale Funds Trust has been filed with the SEC but has yet to enter into force. Ethereum Futures Funds and Bitcoin Composite ETFs will not invest directly in digital assets. These securities are neither sold nor accepted for purchase before the registration statement&#8217;s effective date.</p>



<p>Refers to an Ethereum Futures fund that will seek to purchase a number of Ether Futures Contracts so that the total nominal value (i.e., the full value of an underlying asset) of the ether underlying the Ether Futures Contracts held by the Fund has approximately 100% of the Fund&#8217;s net assets.</p>



<p>This message is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase, nor is it a sale of these securities in any state where such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be permissible without first registering with or meeting the requirements of that state&#8217;s securities laws.</p>



<p>Investment objectives, risks, fees, costs, and other important information about the Fund are included in the prospectus.</p>
