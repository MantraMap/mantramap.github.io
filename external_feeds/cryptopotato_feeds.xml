            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">ADA failed to remain above 40 cents, and bears took over in the last few days.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.38, $0.35</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.40, $0.44</strong></p>
<p>With buying momentum lost, ADA fell back to the key support at 38 cents, and bulls will have a difficult time trying to defend this key level due to low interest from market participants.</p>
<p>The resistance is at 40 cents and has rejected ADA&#8217;s attempt at a breakout last week. The price has also formed a head and shoulders top pattern, which is bearish.</p>

<p><strong>Trading Volume: </strong>The volume has been declining steadily over the past few days. This has to change if ADA is to hold at the key support.</p>
<p><strong>RSI</strong>: The daily RSI fell under 50 points and, in the process made a lower high.</p>
<p><strong>MACD</strong>: The daily MACD is bearish, and its histogram is making lower lows. The MACD moving averages are also expanding downwards, which shows that momentum favors sellers right now.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for ADA is bearish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for ADA Price</h2>
<p>It is critical for buyers to defend the support at 38 cents. Failing to do so could mean ADA might go to 35 cents next in search of support.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The crypto market has turned red once again, with another $20 billion gone from the total market cap. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price took another turn for the worse in the past 24 hours by dropping below $28,000.</p>
<p>The altcoins are in no better shape, as even yesterday&#8217;s notable gainer &#8211; BNB &#8211; has turned red today.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Slips Ahead of FOMC Meeting</h2>
<p>Bitcoin experienced massive volatility last week that drove it from $27,000 to a multi-day high of $30,000 in hours. However, the leg-up was followed by immediate and similarly violent rejection that brought it back down to the starting price.</p>
<p>The worsening troubles of First Republic, though, seemed to have pushed the cryptocurrency north again, and BTC came up knocking on $30,000&#8217;s door once more. Yet, after another rejection, bitcoin entered the weekend at around $29,000, and it wasn&#8217;t until late Sunday that it finally initiated another price jump.</p>
<p>As $30,000 was once again in sight, the bears came back to play. Their efforts<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/market-watch-bitcoin-crashes-by-1k-overnight-crypto-markets-lose-30b/" data-wpel-link="internal"> had a bigger impact</a> this time, as BTC dumped to $28,000 in minutes. After standing there for a while, bitcoin nosedived once more hours ago and dropped to a 6-day low of $27,650 (on Bitstamp).</p>
<p>Despite recovering some ground since then, bitcoin still trades in the red on a daily scale, just <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/here-are-the-dates-for-the-2023-cpi-releases-and-fomc-meetings/" data-wpel-link="internal">ahead of the next FOMC meeting</a>, in which the Federal Reserve is expected to raise the interest rates once again. As such, more volatility is likely to occur tomorrow.</p>
<figure id="attachment_248867" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-248867" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSD-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-248867" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSD-1.png" alt="BTCUSD.

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Alts See Red Again</h2>
<p>The altcoins suffered yesterday, and today&#8217;s picture is not that different. Ethereum stood above $1,900 until Sunday evening but now struggles to remain north of $1,800 after another minor daily decline.</p>
<p>Binance Coin was among the very few altcoins in the green yesterday. However, a 3% decrease has pushed BNB back down to under $325.</p>
<p>Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, Polygon, Solana, Polkadot, Tron, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche are also slightly in the red from the larger-cap alts.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has seen another $20 billion gone in a day, and more than $50 evaporated in two days, and is down to $1.160 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase has been walking a regulatory tightrope as US watchdogs issued a host of lawsuits and settlements, prompting fears in the industry.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fresh trouble brews in for Coinbase as a lawsuit alleges that top leadership of the crypto exchange sold stock using inside information and dodged massive losses.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong, board member Marc Andreessen, and other officers are being accused of avoiding losses of over $1 billion with the help of inside information to sell stock within days of the platform&#8217;s public listing in 2021.</p>
<ul>
<li>The investor Adam Grabski, who filed the lawsuit, alleged that the firm&#8217;s management offloaded their stock before &#8220;material, negative information that destroyed market optimism from the company’s first quarterly earnings release forward&#8221; prompted a decline in the share price.</li>
<li>The complaint was unsealed Monday in Delaware Chancery Court, which stated that Coinbase&#8217;s board launched a direct listing instead of a more typical initial public offering and rapidly sold off $2.9 billion in stock.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Within five weeks, those shares declined in value by over $1 billion, and Coinbase&#8217;s market capitalization plummeted by more than $37 billion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As part of the direct listing, Armstrong is said to have sold more than $291 million of Coinbase stock.</li>
<li>Andreessen’s venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, on the other hand, dumped over $118 million worth of the stock during the same period, according to the complaint.</li>
<li>In an emailed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/coinbase-insiders-avoided-1-billion-in-stock-losses-suit-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a> to Bloomberg, Coinbase said the lawsuit is an example of &#8220;meritless claims.&#8221;</li>
<li>The lawsuit emerges a month after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-issues-wells-notice-against-coinbase-for-listing-unregistered-securities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">sent</a> a Wells Notice to Coinbase for listing unregistered securities.</li>
<li>Tensions have been escalating with the regulator for quite some time.</li>
<li>The NASDAQ-listed firm <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-issues-wells-notice-against-coinbase-for-listing-unregistered-securities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">retaliated</a> with its own lawsuit against the SEC, asking a federal court to compel the SEC to provide clearer guidance on the rules governing the crypto market.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Bhutanese government has supposedly been secretly producing bitcoin for at least three years.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Kingdom of Bhutan &#8211; a landlocked country situated in the Eastern Himalayas &#8211; has reportedly used its renewable sources of energy to run a bitcoin mining operation for years. A government representative said the process started when BTC was worth around $5,000. It is worth noting that the primary cryptocurrency reached that level for the first time in October 2017.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another country that has done so is El Salvador. The Latin American nation, which became the first to make bitcoin legal tender inside its borders, has started mining BTC with power harnessed from volcanoes. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bhutan&#8217;s Secret BTC Forays</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2023/04/30/bhutan-bitcoin-mining-crypto/?sh=63fbd2391f1b" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">coverage</a> by Forbes, the Himalayan country has been using its vast hydroelectricity resources to establish a state-owned bitcoin mine without revealing it to the public. However, a government representative supposedly said the nation had started mining BTC &#8220;a few years ago as one of the early entrants when the price of bitcoin was around $5,000.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite not revealing the exact timeline of when the nation hopped on the bandwagon, one could give certain suggestions. The price of the leading digital asset reached $5K for the first time in October 2017 and remained above it until November 2018, when it dropped below $4,000. BTC reclaimed that level in April 2019 and only briefly slipped below that level during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As such, it&#8217;s safe to assume that the Bhutanese government has been involved with BTC mining for at least three years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It remains unclear why the lawmakers have not disclosed the forays to broad society, where the mine is located, or whether it has turned a profit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report further revealed that the Bhutanese government has partnered with the Nasdaq-listed mining company Bitdeer. An investor at the company shed more light on the collaboration:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We expect to generate 100 MW out of the 550 MW power supply from Bhutan, where the construction of the mining data center is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2023 and complete in the third quarter of 2024.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another factor showing that the Asian nation has launched such a BTC project is its massive purchase of computer chips. Forbes claimed it imported such items worth $193 million in the past few years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some believe it is high time the Bhutanese government discloses its effort to locals. Others, like a former international advisor, whose name was not identified, think the country should be utterly cautious due to the risky nature of cryptocurrencies, and more specifically, bitcoin:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;It&#8217;s concerning that Bhutan&#8217;s resources have been invested in a secretive manner in a highly volatile and risky investment which has a big environmental burden.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why Mining BTC?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One main reason behind the BTC mining project could be the vast resources that the country has and the hydropower capacity generated from the numerous local rivers. Jaran Mellerud &#8211; analyst at Luxor &#8211; supports that thesis:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;It&#8217;s no surprise that entities are mining Bitcoin in Bhutan. The mountainous country has a massive hydropower capacity compared to its small population and produces a similar amount of electricity per capita as the United States &#8211; a much wealthier country. This cheap, stranded hydropower is undoubtedly alluring for miners whose sole job is turning undervalued electricity into bitcoin.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In fact, Bhutan produces so much electricity that it exports around 75% of its annually generated amount to its western neighbor &#8211; India &#8211; during the rainy season when the rivers are overflooding.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mining BTC might turn profitable for the country if the asset&#8217;s price surges in years and benefit the region. The move could also give Bhutan an upper hand in the case of global adoption of the cryptocurrency and its eventual development on the trade scene.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">El Salvador is Another Example</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When speaking about the correlation between bitcoin and countries, one should mention El Salvador. The Central American nation, led by President Nayib Bukele, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/three-months-later-bitcoin-now-officially-a-legal-tender-in-el-salvador/" data-wpel-link="internal">embraced</a> the asset as legal tender in 2021 and announced plans to mine BTC using energy harnessed from local volcanoes.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It also designed a high-tech town called &#8220;Bitcoin City,&#8221; which will employ the primary digital asset as official currency. It will be located close to Conchagua and Tecapa volcanoes and use their geothermal energy to power itself.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The futuristic urban project recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/el-salvadors-bitcoin-city-wins-an-international-design-award-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">won</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> an international award for its architecture and interior design.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The $25 million MEV bot attack and the $22 million Bitrue exploit were some of the major incidents in the world of crypto last month.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the blockchain and smart contract security firm Certified Kernel Tech (better known as CertiK), crypto-related exploits, hacks, and scams in April resulted in losses worth $103 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The figures for last month are a lot less than the $211 million worth of digital assets which wrongdoers siphoned throughout March 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Summarizing the Incidents in April</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CertiK </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1652625412948729861" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the total amount hackers managed to drain last month from crypto projects was approximately $103.6 million worth of digital assets. Exit scams resulted in 9.3 million, while flash loan attacks accounted for almost $20 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some of the major incidents in April </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-mev-bots-lost-a-whopping-20m-in-a-sandwich-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">include</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the $25 million stolen from a large Ethereum Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot that became a victim of a so-called &#8220;sandwich attack.&#8221; The event occurs when a perpetrator exploits liquidity cracks to execute profitable trades at the expense of vulnerable users. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The hack on the Bitrue exchange is also worth mentioning. The company </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/23-million-worth-of-crypto-compromised-as-bitrue-exchange-gets-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">suffered</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a &#8220;brief exploit&#8221; in one of its hot wallets at the beginning of last month, resulting in losses of $23 million worth of ETH, QNT, GALA, SHIB, HOT, and MATIC. Bitrue paused withdrawals until April 18 &#8220;to conduct additional security checks&#8221; and assured that the remaining wallets were unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another crypto exchange that faced the same issue was the South Korean GDAC. Attackers </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-exchange-gdac-halts-deposits-and-withdawals-following-13-million-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">compromised</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the Gdac Hot Wallet on April 10 and pocketed over 60 BTC, 350.5 ETH, 10,000,000 WEMIX, and 220,000 USDT (collectively valued at $13 million at that time). The stolen amount accounted for around 23% of the platform&#8217;s total assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GDAC took emergency measures and halted deposits and withdrawals shortly after identifying the hack. It also collaborated with Korean agencies and rival companies to detect the criminals and resume operations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other incidents that happened last month include the $10.2 million Yearn Finance exploit, the $7.5 million Hundred Finance attack, the $3.3 million SushiSwap hack, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The March Figures Were Even Worse</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While last month&#8217;s data regarding hacks and exploits in the world of crypto might look grim, it is actually much better than March. Back then, wrongdoers </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/211-million-worth-of-crypto-drained-in-march-in-26-hacks-peckshield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">stole</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> $211.5 million worth of digital currencies via 26 attacks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Euler Finance exploit that resulted in almost $200 million in losses comprised 93% of the total amount. Hackers breached the security of the DeFi protocol in mid-March and drained the tokens in a flash loan attack.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nonetheless, the perpetrator, going by the name &#8220;Jacob,&#8221; started sending back some of the assets by the end of the month and even </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/euler-finance-hacker-apologizes-returns-stolen-177-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">apologized</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for the crime.

			            <description><![CDATA[DCG owes Genesis and Gemini $639 million by next week. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gemini Earn – the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange’s digital asset lending arm – announced on Sunday that it had agreed with Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group (DCG) on a mediation process to bring their bankruptcy dispute to a close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The company said that it expects an order from Bankruptcy Judge Lane directing the mediation to arrive as early as Monday. </span></p>
<h2>Gemini’s Final Resolution</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Per the company’s latest </span><a href="https://www.gemini.com/earn" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the plan arranges for two meetings to take place before Monday, May 8. The date is important since DCG owes the bankruptcy estate $630 million by May 9 to 11. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Gemini, should DCG fail to repay its debt by that time, the crypto industry giant risks “defaulting on its obligations.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The mediation will be narrowly focused on DCG’s economic contribution to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of all creditors, including Earn users, and is designed to bring resolution to the Genesis bankruptcy plan,” stated Gemini.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">DCG is the parent company of Genesis Trading – the institutional crypto-lending firm that filed for bankruptcy after suffering immense losses to both Three Arrows Capital in June, and FTX in November. Gemini was forced to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gemini-is-working-with-genesis-to-find-solution-for-earn-users/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">halt withdrawals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from its Earn product in response since Gemini used Genesis as its trading partner for earning yield for its retail clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the agreement is scheduled for 30 days, Gemini said both parties are expected to “work expeditiously towards agreement in the immediate window.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have also expressed our frustration on the record before Judge Lane on the pace of progress among the parties and the need for urgency,” the company continued. “The next status conference with the Court will be on May 4th.”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>Recovering From the Crash</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last week, DCG </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/genesis-creditors-allegedly-walk-away-from-previously-agreed-bankruptcy-restructuring-plan/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">alleged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that a group of Genesis creditors had walked away from a previous </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-lender-genesis-reaches-principle-agreement-with-dcg-and-creditors/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">restructuring deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> formed two months prior, designed to “maximize value” for all of Genesis’s stakeholders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The terms would have DCG exchange its $1.1 billion note due to Genesis in 2022 with convertible preferred stock issued by DCG. Cameron Winklevoss </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-the-removal-of-dcg-ceo-barry-silbert/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">blasted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the issuance of the prior note in January as grossly misvalued and later threatened to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cameron-winklevoss-ready-to-take-legal-action-against-dcgs-barry-silbert/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">sue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Silbert. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Winklevoss twins </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/winklevoss-twins-inject-100-million-worth-of-funds-into-gemini/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">agreed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in April to commit $100 million of their own money into Gemini, which has suffered cash flow problems since its debacle with Genesis began. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The DeFi industry is quietly kept building and innovating despite last year's bloodshed. But what's in store for the sector in 2023?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) players have been left unscathed as the unmonitored control of off-chain capital of centralized crypto entities led to misdeeds and bad trades, and subsequent collapses.</p>
<p>Be it multi-billion dollar bankruptcies, fraud allegations, rampant scandals, or plunging crypto-asset prices, 2022 was characterized by tragic events, culminating mostly from CeFis, which, in turn, enhanced the value proposition of DeFi.</p>
<p>The decentralization-first purist approach is yet to take hold in the industry whose inception itself was inspired by the distrust in centralized financial pillars. But as the broader industry climbs out of the harshest crypto winter, DeFi is, slowly but steadily, shedding its repute as an unsustainable idealism. Let&#8217;s dive in to assess the opportunities, bottlenecks, and compliance in this sector this year.</p>
<h2>Real World Using DeFi</h2>
<p>A push towards real-world assets marks a unification of traditional finance and DeFi, which has paved the way for a multi-trillion dollar credit market to the decentralized finance ecosystem. Such an integration leans into the strengths of both sectors.</p>
<p>Recently, a private-equity firm Hamilton Lane <a href="https://www.hamiltonlane.com/en-us/news/direct-equity-fund-now-available-on-securitize" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">teamed up</a> with digital asset issuance firm Securitize in a bid to tokenize a portion of its $2.1 billion flagship equity fund on the Polygon network. In yet another case, Singapore&#8217;s central bank, MAS, unveiled Project Guardian, a pilot program to tokenize bonds and deposits that can be used in numerous DeFi strategies.</p>
<p>Similarly, a Philadelphia-based Huntingdon Valley Bank <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1562045125768921090" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">partnered</a> with MakerDAO, following which the protocol connected its native stablecoin DAI to traditional finance. This marked the first commercial loan participation between a US-regulated financial institution and a decentralized asset.</p>
<p>The inclusion of real-world assets in the DeFi industry ramps up the liquidity available while offering a novel asset class for DeFi participants to leverage for investment yield. One of the major catalysts fueling this trend is less exposure of the investment yield to crypto volatility and serving businesses and customers who are not crypto native. Other benefits include lower investment minimums, enhanced transparency and security of blockchain, increased access through fractional ownership, etc.</p>
<p>According to Matt Henderson, the Chief Strategy Officer of Aurora Labs, there seems to be no limit to the areas in which tokenizable RWAs can foray into. While speaking with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the exec also touched on fractional ownership, which he believes to be a key proposition for driving real-world assets.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fractional ownership is the key proposition for driving Real-World Assets. As of now, there seems to be no limit to the areas in which tokenizable RWAs can foray into. The two markets which have gained attention lately are real estate (property), and financial products, including United States Treasury Notes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Deal With DAOs</h2>
<p>Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are on the rise as well, as the world gears up for Web3. The main aim is to democratize the management structure by eliminating centralized hierarchies. As such, these organizations endorse the idea of collective governance through on-chain voting. The focus remains on increasing investor flexibility and diversity of funded ideas.</p>
<p>But DAOs are not flawless either. Be it privacy issues, or power inequalities, these organizations have their own share of limitations. Treasury management is yet another sticky subject.</p>
<p>On that note, Henderson said that &#8220;real-world businesses have searched for the ideal ways to organize and govern themselves, and none have settled on rule by mob.&#8221; The closest attempt, according to the exec, has been &#8220;holacracy,&#8221; which is a flat management structure that distributes authority among self-organizing groups instead of the top-down authority. However, Henderson said none of them have &#8220;really worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believes there&#8217;s a &#8220;long way to go&#8221; when it comes to making DAOs work effectively. The best approach that he has seen so far &#8220;would map analogously to a corporate Board of Directors, where the token holders vote periodically on a governance council (the &#8220;Board&#8221;), who then select and oversee the people who run the daily business operations of the project.&#8221;</p>
<h2>DeFi Insurance Protocols</h2>
<p>Despite the immense evolution in DeFi, calls for regulation and compliance are growing louder than ever.  This is because the fledgling sector has become a very attractive venue for illicit activities and illegal scams.</p>
<p>DeFi services were reported to have been leveraged by threat actors for criminal activity linked to North Korea. Over $3 billion was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/north-korean-hackers-stole-1-7b-worth-crypto-in-2022-chainalysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">lost</a> to DeFi exploits last year alone. It is safe to say that security is a fundamental bottleneck to the adoption and expansion of the space.</p>
<p>But Aurora&#8217;s Henderson does not believe there&#8217;s a &#8220;tight coupling between DeFi hacks and regulations.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Much of the regulation news we’ve seen in the past year has been around the protection of consumers from TradFi firms who operate in the crypto space.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The exec said DeFi protocol security will always be a challenge and a game of cat and mouse. With more capital infusion, Henderson added that the DeFi protocols will continue to become more susceptible to targets. This is where DeFi insurance protocols come into the picture that helps in shielding victims from losses and help them recover lost funds.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Protocols such as InsurAce are providing safer Web3 insurance solutions on Aurora, safeguarding users from catastrophic events. It has paid over $11.8 million in insurance claims across 20 chains safeguarding over 140+ protocols.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A recent <a href="https://opencover.com/state-of-crypto-and-defi-insurance-alternatives-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> by the decentralized finance analytics platform OpenCover found that DeFi insurance companies have compensated more than $34 million in claims in 2022 alone. Data revealed that $22.5 million was paid out during the Terra collapse followed by $4.7 million post-FTX&#8217;s fall.</p>
<h2>Compliance in DeFi with ZK</h2>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs were recently cited in the 40-page report by the United States Treasury Department. Such an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/can-zk-proofs-untange-the-defi-compliance-labyrinthine-experts-weigh-in/" data-wpel-link="internal">acknowledgment</a> has been welcomed by the crypto community, because the tech has proved its viability across areas such as unencrypted messaging, data storage and security, next-gen file control systems, integrating with private blockchains, and more.</p>
<p>ZK tech is useful for privacy-sensitive applications such as cryptocurrency transactions by enabling users to conduct trades without revealing their identities or details. This is done by creating a cryptographic proof.</p>
<p>Aurora Labs, for one, is closely monitoring ways to leverage this tech for the Rainbow Bridge. But the main bone of contention is its lack of adoption. To top that, there are very few people in the industry who can address certain issues associated with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The major problem was observed during an exploit that affected the whole industry, and relatively, there were only a few people with the mathematical background and capability to address the problem. So this is one of the areas I&#8217;m selectively cautious about, although it has rewarding use cases, including privacy-preserving features, security, cost-effectiveness, and more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But it is equally important to understand that ZK technology isn&#8217;t a new concept and has been around for decades, beyond finance. The adoption of this mathematical technique was event proposed to aid the Danish Red Cross’s humanitarian efforts in Somalia last year.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, DeFi protocols need to implement a rigorous approach to compliance because experts believe ZK-proofs allow for security against evolving threat actors. On the other hand, regulators should refrain from overreaching. Or else, a lot could go wrong.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a phase of consolidation and correction, Ethereum&#8217;s price has recently arrived at the crucial support level of the 50-day moving average. However, it is currently going through a tight price range between the 50-day MA and the significant resistance level of $2K.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Analyzing the daily chart, the price previously formed a higher-high pattern before experiencing a significant decline. The 50-day moving average acted as a support level at $1.8K, leading to substantial volatility in lower timeframes and a significant shadow in the daily chart.</p>
<p>At present, ETH is confined within a narrow dynamic range between the 50-day moving average, which is currently at $1847, and the significant resistance region of $2K.</p>
<p>If the price manages to surpass the resistance of $2K and its prior swing at $2.1K, it could potentially trigger an extended rally. Conversely, if it falls below the 50-day MA, the 100-day moving average at $1.7K will become the primary support level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_248784" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-248784" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-248784 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_0105231" width="2560" height="1386" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-768x416.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-1536x832.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-2048x1109.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETH-Daily-5-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-248784" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Analyzing the 4-hour chart, the price was rejected by the ascending channel&#8217;s upper threshold, leading to a downward trend toward the channel&#8217;s mid-trendline. Despite experiencing enormous volatility after reaching the trendline, the buying pressure in this critical region remains evident.</p>
<p>If the price falls below this essential level, the next stop for Ethereum would be at $1.7K. However, if ETH finds support in this region, the bulls may potentially attempt another run toward the $2.1K mark.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<p>ETH&#8217;s price has plunged recently, following the uptrend over the recent months. Looking at the futures market sentiment metrics, it seems that the long liquidation cascade is the culprit.</p>
<p>This chart displays Ethereum&#8217;s Open Interest, which measures the number of open futures contracts. Open interest usually increases when the market sentiment is bullish and higher values lead to more volatility in the short term.</p>
<p>Considering the latest price action and the Open Interest chart, it is evident that this metric has been increasing towards the end of the recent rally but has also dropped significantly as the price has declined. This sudden decrease in price is likely due to the long positions being liquidated and adding to the selling pressure, further aggravating the decline.</p>
<p>This event is called a liquidation cascade and usually occurs when open interest rises rapidly. Yet, this metric is now showing lower values as a result of the massive liquidations, and lower volatility could be expected in the short term.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[PEPE is now among the top 100 coins, according to CoinGecko's data.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PEPE&#8217;s journey over the last two weeks has been quite intriguing. Most newbie coins with outlandish backgrounds see rapid surges and equally rapid dumps, mostly due to their perceived lack of seriousness. This is not the case with PEPE, whose creation was inspired by the popular internet meme of Pepe the Frog. In fact, this memecoin has only strengthened its rally since its launch in mid-April.</p>
<p>PEPE gained another 90% in the last 24 hours and was now trading near its recently established all-time high. Market players have turned to this token in hopes of striking it rich, and many have been successful so far. Investors who bought in early have made remarkable returns.</p>
<h2>PEPE Millionaires</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1653009380420489216" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> compiled by crypto analytics provider &#8216;Lookonchain,&#8217; three smart traders have sold part of their PEPE investment amidst skyrocketing prices and pocketed more than $1 million in profits in a span of two weeks.</p>
<p>One of the traders bought 5.42 trillion PEPE with 1 ETH (worth $2,100), then sold 3.42 trillion PEPE for 929 ETH (worth more than $1.77 million). They still hold 2 trillion PEPE (worth $2.37 million), offloading the entire stash will yield a profit of around 4.14 million.</p>
<p>The second trader purchased 4.22 trillion PEPE with 2.3 ETH (worth $4,822), then sold 3.22 trillion PEPE for 670 ETH (worth $1.3 million) and still holds 1 trillion PEPE (worth nearly $1.2 million). If this trader wishes to dump all of the PEPE holdings, they will rake in a profit of $2.47 million at the current price.</p>
<p>The third one, &#8216;dimethyltryptamine.eth,&#8217; purchased 5.9 trillion PEPE with 0.125 ETH (worth around $251), then sold 2 trillion PEPE for 560 ETH (worth $1.06 million). This trader still holds 3.9 trillion PEPE (worth $2.37 million), selling all of which yield a profit of nearly 5.67 million, thereby making them the richest of the trio.</p>
<p>Realizing those <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-someone-turned-27-into-1-million-in-days-with-pepe-but-theres-a-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">profits</a> would not be an easy affair because it put tremendous pressure on the crypto-asset. But modest investments of adventurous traders infusing relatively small amounts into <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-pepe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">PEPE</a>, which instantly transformed them into millionaires, has triggered FOMO in the space, which is reminiscent of the epic rally of the OG memecoin &#8211; DOGE.</p>
<h2>Exchange Listings</h2>
<p>A major factor actor that has stirred up action in PEPE&#8217;s price this week is its listing on several cryptocurrency exchanges. So far, top centralized platforms such as Huobi, Gate.io, and MEXC have announced support for the token.</p>
<p>More recently, Seychelles-based crypto exchange OKX also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-soars-90-following-listing-on-okx-enters-top-100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> the listing of PEPE on its spot trading markets with PEPE/USDT trading pairs. The disclosure has managed to fuel its upward trajectory.</p>
