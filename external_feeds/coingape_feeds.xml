FIL tokens are used as payment for these services as well as a financial incentive to guarantee that files are consistently stored over time.</p>
<p>As a<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/"> proof-of-work</a> token, FIL allows the Filecoin community to mine and receive additional coins as payment. Additionally, FIL can be used on the Filecoin network, where users can pay miners to store or retrieve their data. In the event that there are no or insufficient proofs, the token may also be used as collateral.</p>
<h3><b>Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis</b></h3>
<p>Filecoin’s price today is $2.93, with a market capitalization of $1B and a 24-hour trading volume down by 4.62%. Now it stands at $127 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 344,966,605 FIL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132396" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21105612/FIL_1D_graph_coinmarketcap1.jpg" alt="Source: coinmarketcap" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Despite the negative market trends, the technical analysis of the Filecoin price shows a significant surge fueled by FIL growth. The Filecoin (FIL) price has increased significantly in comparison to counterparts such as Stellar and <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<h2><b>How Much Money Would You Make If FIL Reaches $10?</b></h2>
<p>According to <strong><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/filecoin/" rel="nofollow">Cryptopredictions.com</a></strong>, FIL can go as high as $10.9 by December 2025. Let’s assume that you invest a modest $100 in Filecoin today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132397" style="width: 1491px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-132397" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21105732/Screenshot-2022-12-21-at-10-17-09-Filecoin-FIL-Price-Prediction-2023-2024-2026.png" alt="Filecoin Prediction chart" width="1491" height="847" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132397" class="wp-caption-text">Filecoin Prediction chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to today’s price, which is $2.92, you will have approximately 34.26 FIL. If Filecoin’s price hits $10 in the next few years, your $100 will become approximately $342.6. Let’s say you bought $100 worth of FIL coins today. With the current rate, you will have approximately 34.26 coins. However, you can potentially make $342 when it reaches the $100 mark.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Core Scientific is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Texas on Wednesday, December 21.

It is one of the largest publicly listed crypto mining companies in the U.S. Core Scientific has decided to file for bankruptcy due to falling crypto prices and rising energy prices that deteriorated its finances.</p>
<p>Despite the $72 million in financing from its lender B. Riley last week to avoid bankruptcy, the crypto miner was unable to work efficiently and will work on restructuring, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/KenzieSigalos/status/1605420482005704705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> CNBC. Core Scientific plans to keep mining until it restructures its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Core Scientific’s market cap dropped to $78 million on Tuesday, down from a $4.3 billion valuation in July 2021 when it went public. The CORZ stock price has fallen more than 98% in the last year. On Tuesday, the stock price ended at $0.21, up 3.07%.</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the company’s situation, the company is still generating positive cash flow. However, cash is insufficient to repay the financing debt owed on mining equipment it was leasing. Core Scientific will not liquidate and operate normally until reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, which hold the majority of the company’s debt.</p>

<p>Core Scientific joins the list of other crypto miners who have succumbed to the crash in the crypto space and the soaring energy prices. A month ago, the Bitcoin miner had already hinted about <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme pain in its operations</a> and cash crunch owing to the market conditions.</p>
<p>Core Scientific was mining some proof-of-work digital assets such as Bitcoin. As we know, this requires high-end machinery and hardware while also consuming massive electricity in the process. Over the last year, the price of Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) stock has tanked by 99% losing more than $4 billion in valuations.</p>
<p>Last year in July 2021, the Bitcoin miner had gone for a public listing via a special purpose acquisition vehicle or SPAC. Although the company still generates a positive cash flow, it&#8217;s not enough to repay the financial debt on equipment, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-filing-for-bankruptcy-will-keep-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said sources</a> familiar with the matter.</p>
<h3>Core Scientific&#8217;s Further Action Plan</h3>
<p>The sources also added that core Scientific is not willing to liquidate, however, it would continue to operate normally while reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, who hold a majority of the company&#8217;s debt.</p>
<p>In their filing earlier in October, Core Scientific said that holders of their common stock might suffer a total loss on their investment. However, the Bitcoin miner&#8217;s deal with its convertible note holders is such that if the market conditions for Bitcoin improve, common equity holders might not get totally wiped out.</p>
<p>Core Scientific has operations currently in North Dakota, North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky. It is also one of the largest providers of blockchain infrastructure and hosting.</p>
<p>Core Scientific is not the only Bitcoin miner to face bankruptcy. Compute North, the hosting infrastructure for crypto mining also filed for bankruptcy in September.</p>

As per the latest report from ABC News, SBF who&#8217;s currently in the Fox Hill jail of The Bahamas has agreed to his extradition to the US on multiple charges.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that SBF has signed his extradition paper and a hearing for the same will happen on Wednesday in Nassau. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-21/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-signs-extradition-papers/101796332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development</a> has been confirmed by Bahamas Acting Commissioner of Corrections Doan Cleare.</p>
<p>After signing his surrender documents on Tuesday, the Bahamas Commissioner said that SBF will sign a separate set of papers and finalize his waiver of rights to fight extradition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Federal authorities are looking to fly back SBF to the U.S. soon after Wednesday&#8217;s hearing. The Bloomberg <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sam-bankman-fried-to-fly-to-us-wednesday-escorted-by-fbi-agents-1.1861932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> notes that the disgraced FTX founder will be accompanied to the US by FBI agents in a non-commercial aircraft. Another source familiar with the matter said that the plane will leave from a private airport in The Bahamas.</p>
<h3>Not A Good Christmas for SBF</h3>
<p>Sam Bankman Fried has been facing severe charges over the misuse of customers&#8217; funds at FTX which led to a dramatic collapse of a $32 billion company. Some previous <a href="https://coingape.com/how-much-jail-time-sbf-is-looking-at-if-convicted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> suggest that SBF might face 115 years of prison which is equivalent to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>After getting earlier this month, the Bahamian court also denied bail to SBF last week. Since then, he&#8217;s been placed in one of the most notorious jail facilities of the island nation i.e. Fox Hill.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Bahamian authorities will escort Sam Bankman-Fried from the prison to the court. Although initially hesitant, SBF has agreed to the extradition to the U.S. This change in attitude might be partly due to the expectation that SBF could get bail in the US. So far, it isn&#8217;t clear where SBF is planning to land on Wednesday.</p>

This facility is now available to 160 countries across the world.</p>
<p>Currently, Uniswap supports Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. It means over the DEX, users can purchase their respective cryptocurrencies such as DAI, ETH, MATIC, USDC, USDT, WBTC and WETH.</p>
<p>Amid the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, trust from <a href="https://coingape.com/uniswap-unveils-new-feature-to-rival-crypto-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centralized exchanges</a> has dropped as many investors are moving their crypto into self-custody. As a result, the demand and trading volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have also shot up.</p>
<p>DEX&#8217;s offers greater user protection since they have self-custodial wallets, and are permissionless and immutable protocols. But when compared to centralized exchanges, DEXs don&#8217;t offer a very sound onboarding experience. With the latest move, the Uniswap DEX is planning to solve this exactly.</p>
<h3>Uniswap Partners With MoonPay</h3>
<p>In partnership with MoonPay, Uniswap will now allow users to transact in DeFi via the Uniswap Web App and buy crypto using any card and bank transfers. Users just need to connect their wallet to the Uniswap Web app and can buy crypto instantly. The DEX platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://uniswap.org/blog/web-fiat-on-ramp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bringing you the best fiat on-ramp experience &#8211; no spread fees on USDC, the lowest processing fees in the market, and instant access!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Uniswap has also made it clear that they would not collect any financial information of their users such as credit card, debit card, and bank information. Besides, they also don&#8217;t collect any personally identifiable information for their users. Uniswap has also placed minimum and maximum caps for the purchase of different crypto and stablecoins.</p>
<p>After the purchase, users can see their digital assets in their wallets within minutes. So far, the off-ramp facility of moving crypto to a bank account isn&#8217;t available. But the DEX added that they are working on it.</p>
<p>Also, users cannot purchase NFTs directly using cards or bank accounts. They first need to purchase ETH and buy NFTs through it.</p>

Earlier, reports suggested that the billionaire was already in the hunt for his replacement. It may be recalled that Musk had fired former CEO Parag Aggarwal among others as his first official act since taking over as the company head. It remains to be seen how his favorite cryptocurrency <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> will perform if someone replaces Musk.</p>

<h2>Software And Servers</h2>
<p>In a reaction to the Twitter poll on his leadership, Musk said he will still have some oversight on the company even if someone takes charge as new CEO. In line with his aggressive approach in leading the social media company, Musk said he would like to lead the software and servers teams. This is regardless of if he continues to be the CEO or not. Also, it will be interesting to see how soon would Musk be able to find his replacement. It may be recalled that he said his role as Twitter CEO would be temporary.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Thus, losing the $12.75 support may intensify the ongoing selling pressure and push the prices back to the last swing low of $11.35. But will this support replenish the bullish momentum or encourage prolonged downfall?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $12.75 breakdown sets Solana coin price for a 7.5% downfall.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An evident bullish divergence in the daily-RSI slope indicates a potential bullish reversal from $11.35</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $192 Million, indicating a 0.3% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/DaNmqCfB.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly a month, the Solana price wobbled in a fixed range from $15 to $12.75. This long consolidation was supposed to bolster the coin price for higher recovery once it breached the overhead resistance of $15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the recent sell-off in the crypto market triggered by <a href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/">FUD surrounding Binance</a> and hearsay for US Fed to tighten interest rate hikes caused significant outflow in Solana coin. As a result, the coin price ended the range setup in the seller&#8217;s favor with a breakdown of $12.75 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 16th, the Solana price breached the $12.75 support with increasing volume, indicating the sellers are aiming to visit lower levels. However, with the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, this altcoin is stuck in a retest phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the SOL price trades at $12.25 with an intraday gain of 2.35% Furthermore, the higher price rejection candle attached to this daily candle indicates the intense selling pressure from above.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this selling pressure persists, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> should eventually drop 7.5% lower to pierce the $11.35 support. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the recent selling pressure was solely due to panic selling in the market, the Solana price should rebound from the $11.35 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> Despite the sideways price action, the higher high movement in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> indicates growth in underlying bullishness and a higher possibility for price reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s:</strong> the large gap between the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the overall trend is bearish.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $12.7 and $15</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $11.35 and $10</span></li>

The genesis blockchain was then split in two, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, similar to how <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash back in 2017.</p>
<h2>What Sets ETC Apart</h2>
<p>Ethereum Classic describes itself as an open-source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality.</p>
<p>The fundamental functioning of Ethereum (ETH) and <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://br.coingape.com/tag/ethereum-classic/">Ethereum Classic (ETC)</a> is quite similar. On Ethereum Classic, the majority of Ethereum&#8217;s key functionalities are also available. However, there are a few significant distinctions between the two. The most crucial being the fact that, upgrades to the Ethereum <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> are predominantly incompatible with Ethereum Classic.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-expert-predicts-ethereum-eth-price-range-time-to-buy/">Crypto Expert Predicts Ethereum (ETH) Price; Time To Buy?</a></em></p>
<p>This became particularly notable in September 2022, when<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ethereum-merge/"> The Merge</a> took place, where the Ethereum blockchain finished transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus method. As, Ethereum Classic still remained a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/">proof-of-work chain</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of last year, when the bull run was ready to commence, the token took off and rallied along with other major cryptocurrencies. And, despite having reached record highs, ETC&#8217;s price recently had a significant fall as a result of recent pullbacks and ongoing turmoil in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a>.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Prediction For Long Term</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the price of ETC is $15.77, up by 1% over the previous day, according to the market monitoring portal <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>. The price of the cryptocurrency was almost double the last year with ETC trading at around $34 in December of 2021.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132375" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21002903/Capture10.png" alt="" width="918" height="539" /></p>
<p>But according to projections made by the website <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/ethereum-classic/">cryptopredictions.com</a>, the price of ETC might increase again in the coming years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Solana (SOL) Price: Biggest Hurdle For Recovery Amid FTX Effect" href="https://coingape.com/solana-sol-price-biggest-hurdle-for-recovery-amid-ftx-effect/" rel="bookmark">Solana (SOL) Price: Biggest Hurdle For Recovery</a></em></p>
<p>The data further predicts a steady growth rate for the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> in case there are no more black-swan events.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132374" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21002813/image4.png" alt="" width="1579" height="903" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, according to today’s price, if you invested $1,000 into Ethereum Classic, you would receive 63.33 ETC coins.</p>
<p>And in case the price hits $100 in the next few years, this $1,000 investment of yours would become $6,333, which is an increase of 533%.</p>

However, XRP Holders’ lawyer has claimed that the SEC is filing cases against crypto firms as it wants to kill the market.</p>
<h2>XRP lawyer slams watchdogs approach</h2>
<p>Gabriel Shapiro, General Counsel at Delphi Labs mentioned that SEC is aggressively expanding <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1605231668012408833" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the notion of &#8220;disgorgement&#8221;</a> in the <a href="https://coingape.com/lbry-faces-defeat-in-sec-vs-lbry-case-tweets-wont-give-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit against LBRY</a>. It is trying to treat all distributions of LBC tokens as sales.</p>
<p>It added that the SEC is equating the resulting benefits of distribution to profit generated on the current LBC spot price.</p>
<p>John Deaton, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amicus Curiae</a> in the XRP lawsuit or XRP holders’ lawyer slammed the SEC over its approach towards the crypto market. He highlighted the commission&#8217;s alleged in its objection that all money raised by the crypto firms went into operation.</p>
<h2>SEC making abrupt claims</h2>
<p>Deaton added that after these claims the SEC brings up disgorgement. As per the XRP lawyer, under Liu, it is meant to be offset by legitimate business expenses. However, the watchdog pled that everything raised by the LBRY went into operations.</p>
<p>XRP lawyer is being abusive in the non-fraud case against LBRY. He mentioned this directly reflecting the SEC’s approach to crypto which is to kill it. Deaton brought up the SEC vs KiK summary judgment the commission wasn’t able to get disgorgement.</p>
<p>He added that this is a dangerous message that SEC is sending to the crypto market in general.</p>

Previously this support has initiated some strong rallies, validating it as a high accumulation zone.  Thus, the coin price is currently hovering above this support in order to replenish lost bullish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short-term trend in polygon coins is sideways.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily EMAs accumulated near the $0.87 mark create a tough hurdle to overcome.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $382.5 Million, indicating a 33% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/vvIdPYEO.png" alt="Polygon Coin Price" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market triggered by <a href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/">FUD surrounding Binance</a> and the possible tightening of interest rate hikes by the US Fed, the polygon coin price witnessed significant outflow in last since last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the top of $0.94, the altcoin is 18% down and evaporates the entire gains from the November end rally. By the press time, the coin currently trades at $0.79 and wavers above the multi-month support of $0.763.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the accumulation zone has well supported the polygon coin price over the past two months, maintaining an overall sideways trend. While the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-ethereum-price-prediction-is-this-a-temporary-recovery-in-crypto-market/">crypto market turned bullish today</a>, the MATIC price rebounded 2.71% higher from the mentioned support. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buying pressure persists, a daily candle closing above the $0.82 resistance will increase the chances for a bullish reversal.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, considering the overall market sentiment is still negative, the Polygon coin price will likely breach the $0.763 support. This possible breakdown may hint at a deeper correction which could plummet the prices 13.5% down to the $0.69 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the flattish EMAs(100 and 200) accentuate an overall range-bound movement. However, these EMAs offer additional selling pressure with a potential bearish crossover between the 50-and-100-day EMA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> dives below the last swing slow for the support level, indicating weakness in the bullish momentum and a higher possibility for downtrend resumption.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.79</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.82 and $0.87</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.76 and $0.6</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied today after the U.S. Dollar Index fell sharply in response to the Bank of Japan&#8217;s raising their upper band limit for 10-year yields to 50 basis points. The BTC price rebounded after hitting a low of $16,398 on Monday and extended gains on Tuesday to hit almost $17,000.

The BTC price rebounded after hitting a low of $16,398 on Monday and extended gains on Tuesday to hit almost $17,000.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price soars nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $16,933. The 24-hour low and high for Bitcoin are $16,398 and $17,028. The resistance near $17,150 remains crucial for the BTC price. Bitcoin will be bullish in 2023 if the BTC monthly close breaks above the resistance level.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin On-Chain Data Indicates Selloff</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a> rally supported by the weak U.S. dollar amid Bank of Japan monetary policy changes pushes Bitcoin price upwards, the upcoming rally will likely be weak.</p>
<p>On-chain data indicates short-term Bitcoin holders, especially 3-6 months, are selling their Bitcoin holdings continuously. In fact, the decline in BTC price observed on Monday was due to a selloff by 3-6 month Bitcoin holders.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132366" style="width: 714px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132366" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20212101/Bitcoin-Spent-Output-3-6-Months.webp" alt="Bitcoin Spent Output (3-6 Months)" width="714" height="354" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132366" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Spent Output (3-6 Months). Source: CryptoQuant</figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, the Spent Output Age Bands rise for 3-6 months holders is followed by massive downward movements. In fact, a sharp move occurred just before the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> crisis. Therefore, traders must keep an eye on the Spent Output of 3-6 month Bitcoin holders to help predict an upcoming Bitcoin price fall.</p>

<h2>Crypto Analysts&#8217; Bitcoin Predictions</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-close-to-this-level-for-next-support-range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael van de Poppe predicts that BTC</a> could have a strong continuation if it breaks the $16,900 level. Moreover, Bitcoin holding the $16.5K support level remains key for the price rally toward $18K.</p>
<p>Rekt Capital earlier suggested that <a href="https://coingape.com/popular-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-btc-eth-ada-link-price-for-new-year-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price holding the $17,150 level</a> will be crucial for Bitcoin and altcoins. If Bitcoin closed the month below the support level, a move toward $13,900 can be seen. Moreover, Bitcoin has strong resistance at $18K and a strong rally is possible only if BTC price breaks the $18K-$19K level.</p>

The blockchain lost value quite rapidly with the news of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>&#8216;s crypto empire facing liquidity issues. Although the cryptocurrency recovered significantly since then, there is still long way to recovery to the all time high level. Compared to the price range it maintained in first week of November 2022, the SOL token is still under 50% of the value.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, crypto analysts are predicting that Solana (SOL) price could potentially never return to the all time high of $258. In July 2021, at the peak of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/">bull run</a>, the cryptocurrency had a total market size of $78.20 billion. Whereas the current market size is $4.60 billion. The recent bloodbath came due to the stake the SBF related companies had in the blockchain network. The links to FTX collapse had a huge effect on the SOL price.</p>
<h2>Threats To Solana Network</h2>
<p>Despite the underlying contagion effects, crypto analysts say it could be difficult for SOL to recover to the all time high. Jordi Alexander, a crypto market insider, predicted that Solana&#8217;s fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $100 billion was not justified.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Solana never comes close to its ATH again. The main threat to Solana is a new L1 that also uses the same approach but does it in a better designed way. There is quite a strong community, the builders love it.. But I don&#8217;t think that can explain the $100b FDV that it had.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Thus, from the top of the $0.11 resistance, the price has tumbled 35.4% down to reach its current price of $0.074. The memecoin breached multiple supports during this downfall and most recently plunged below the $0.074 level. How far may this bearish breakdown tumble the Dogecoin?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The  $0.074 support breakdown sets the Dogecoin price for a 12% drop</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RSI indicator wavering low in the bearish territory indicates negative sentiment among market participants.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $467.5 Billion, indicating a 30% loss.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 19th, the coin price witnessed a nearly 10% intraday loss and pierced monthly support of $0.074. Moreover, a recent Twitter poll on whether Elon Musk should step down from Twitter&#8217;s head must be attributed to this aggressive downfall. Among 17,502,391 votes, 57.5% of the people chose ‘YES’ that Musk shows step down, while 42.5% voters said ‘NO.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the famous American rapper Snoop Dogg posted a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1604656918844256257?s=20&amp;t=_twRJ5EmNFKK01VXAtag6Q" rel="nofollow">similar tweet</a> saying whether he should run Twitter, and out of a total of 3,398,119 votes, 81% of people said ‘YES.’ However, this tweet is mostly like a joke that just needs to be laughed out.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to analysis, today, the Dogecoin price is 3%, and retest the breached $0.074 mark as a potential resistance. The long-wick rejection attached to this daily indicates the sellers are defending the newly obtained barrier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the post-retest downfall may tumble the coin price another 10% down to revisit the $0.065 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily candle closing above $0.074 may weaken the bearish thesis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the EMA slope offers two bear signals, with the negative crossover between the 20-and-200-day EMA and a potential death crossover between the 50-and-200-day EMA.</span></p>

This comes after Musk posted a Twitter poll on Sunday afternoon, asking people if they thought he should continue leading the firm or resign from his position.</p>
<h2>Elon Abides By Twitter Verdict</h2>
<p>With over 17 million people casting their votes in the viral Twitter poll, the end results came in with a whopping 57.6% of voters agreeing that Musk should resign.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Musk, who bought the company in October of this year for a jaw-dropping $44 billion, has previously declared that his role as CEO would be temporary. Musk had stated, &#8220;I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time.&#8221; in a court in November.</p>
<h2>Hunt For CEO Had Already Started</h2>
<p>However, Musk later said in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604628761395138561" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> that he found no potential successor at the social media giant.</p>
<p>The 51-years-old billionaire businessman was further quoted as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive</p></blockquote>
<p>Although, many have raised questions about the legitimacy of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> polls which are often plagued with malicious bots and unauthentic accounts casting multiple shares of votes, Elon seems to be headfast on finding a new CEO.</p>
<p>Reports have also emerged that, Elon and his team were already on the hunt for a new CEO, even before the Twitter poll was posted.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk&#8217;s Rocky Start At Twitter</h2>
<p>Musk&#8217;s takeover of Twitter has been tumultuous; under his direction, there have been significant <a href="https://coingape.com/whats-going-on-at-twitter-layoffs-twitter-outage-doge-down/">employee layoffs</a>, an alleged increase in <a href="https://coingape.com/elon-musk-deletes-kanye-wests-twitter-account-heres-why/">racist hate speech</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/gm-pauses-twitter-advertising-others-boycott-musk/">advertisers boycotting Twitter</a> or trimming down their ad budgets significantly, and also the infamous gamble of reinstating previously banned accounts.</p>

<p>And even more recently, women who lost their jobs at Twitter are suing billionaire Elon Musk in federal court alleging that the mass layoffs specifically targeted female employees.</p>
<p>Carolina Bernal Strifling and Willow Wren Turkal, both of whom had previously worked for the social media giant, brought the class action lawsuit on behalf of other female employees who were in a comparable position.</p>

This also led to steady growth in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/polygon-matic/">Polygon (MATIC)</a> price, so much so that it is now one of the favorite cryptocurrencies of popular faces in the industry. The token really picked up at the beginning of last year, when the bull run was just about starting. Although it rose manifold at all time highs, the recent pullbacks due to crypto crash incidents led to huge price correction for MATIC.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC) Price Prediction For Long Term</h2>
<p>As of writing, MATIC price stands at $0.8021, up 1.27% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. At the peak of last year&#8217;s bull run, the cryptocurrency shot up to about six times its current value. Almost an year ago in December 2021, MATIC price was $2.72. Meanwhile, it is estimated that the top 10 ranked cryptocurrency could reach as much as $1.710 in a few years time, as per the estimates of <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/polygon/?year=2023" rel="nofollow">cryptopredictions.com</a>.</p>
<p>However, the website also estimates that the cryptocurrency could take a huge price jump going into 2023.</p>

<p>The Polygon network also has few the metrics going its way currently. Recently, with the launch of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s NFT Trading Cards, Polygon NFT market saw increased traction. Also, the company tied up with major companies like Reddit platform, increasing scope for further expansion. The Polygon blockchain saw huge volumes of NFT trading volumes, raising speculation of MATIC price rise.</p>

He is currently facing charges in Manhattan federal court for eight counts of fraud. But things went haywire when SBF demanded to see a copy of his federal indictment before agreeing to return to the U.S. Due to the denial of such a request, Bankman-Fried was consequently sent back to the Fox Hill Prison in Nassau.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Bail Plea</h2>
<p>However, as per the latest reports the former <a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-resigns-john-ray-iii-joins-as-new-ftx-ceo/">FTX CEO</a> might finally be released on bail in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>. And, according to FOX business journalist, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett" rel="nofollow">Eleanor Terrett</a>, SBF might step on the U.S. soil by &#8220;tonight or tomorrow&#8221;.</p>

<p>She continued by saying that thee bail could be granted to Bankman-Fried after preliminary agreements between his attorneys and Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutors.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Adding detail here: Bankman-Fried will be arraigned at a federal court in Manhattan where he’ll have a new bail hearing. While multiple sources say he’s expected to be released on bail, it will ultimately be up to the judge to decide.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The development comes moments after <a href="https://coingape.com/the-bahamas-judge-denies-bail-to-disgraced-ftx-founder/">Bankman-Fried’s bail request got denied</a> in the Bahamas court. Since SBF was detained on December 13 on suspicion of fraud and money laundering, his attorneys have stepped up efforts to secure his release on bail.</p>
<h2>Higher Chances Of Bail In US?</h2>
<p>Sources who are closely related to this matter have stated that, SBF has a higher chance of getting bail in the United States after his request is put up in the Manhattan court.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/manhattan-court-finds-ftx-founder-sbf-guilty-to-wire-fraud/">Manhattan Court Finds FTX Founder SBF Guilty To Wire Fraud</a></em></p>
<p>Accordingly, defense attorney Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma noted that SBF will be asked to submit a plea during his initial court appearance in Manhattan and the judge will then determine his bail.</p>
<p>He further stated that, a hearing like this must take place within 48 hours of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s arrival in the US, even though it would undoubtedly occur sooner.</p>

<p>In the event that the founder of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> is extradited to the United States, he will be brought before the court to face charges of wire fraud, money laundering, and improper financing of political campaigns.</p>

However,<a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-news-1-3-trillion-shib-moved-amid-this-binance-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recent updates from the SHIB</a> ecosystem have kept SHIBarmy morales high amid the recent crypto downturn.</p>
<h2>Whale behind Shiba Inu coin price drop?</h2>
<p>As per the LookonChain, a whale address moved around 200 billion Shiba Inu coin (approx worth $1.67 million) to Crypto.com on Monday. However, just after 5 hours of this mega transfer, <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-shib-tokens-price-skyrockets-over-this-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu price</a> dropped by big 7%.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1605078805831303169" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Data depicts</a> that Shiba Inu coin whales a good amount of money over this transaction. Tracker reported that the crypto whale bought around 15.29 Trillion SHIB tokens with 10 Ethereum (approx worth $3,795). This whale acquisition was recorded on August 7, 2020.</p>
<p>It added that the whale then made 1967 Ethereum (approx worth $7 million) by trading on SHIB on the Uniswap platform. The crypto whales went on trading Shiba Inu on Centralised exchanges after SHIB got listed on Binance, Crypto.com, and more.</p>
<p>LookonChain mentioned that the whale might have made a profit of more than $85 million. It highlighted that if the whale buys the Shiba Inu coin when it received the tokens and went to sell at the price when transferring out the same out amount of tokens.</p>
<h2>Will SHIB price drop more ahead?</h2>
<p>However, the whale is reportedly an expert in buying Shiba Inu at a lower price and selling them at a price surge. Meanwhile, the Crypto whale is still holding 3.33 trillion Shiba Inu Coin (approx worth $28 million).</p>
<p>On the market side, Shiba Inu price is down by 11% in the last 7 days. SHIB is trading at an average price of $0.000008, at the press time. Meanwhile, its 24 hour trading volume is up by 52% to stand at $196.7 million. However, Shiba Inu Coin is still the second largest meme token with a market cap of around $4.7 billion.</p>
