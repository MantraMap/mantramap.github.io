<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), the significant meme token, has been making waves in the market since its launch, with its market cap going from $1M to $1B in only 279 days. However, as this rapid growth subsequently fell, one project currently in Stage 2 of its presale - Tradecurve (TCRV) could replicate this movement as it brings innovation, long-term growth potential and solves many problems the current online trading industry faces. Today, we will look at both of these projects and see how they compare.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) - incredible $1B market cap journey</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) was first released in August 2020. Within a year of its introduction, Shiba Inu had a market valuation of $1B. Amazingly, Shiba Inu grew from a market valuation of $1B in just 279 days. Shiba Inu became a well-known topic of conversation during this time as many notable celebrities, such as Ice-T and Antonio Brown, started backing this project. Notably, Shiba Inu outperformed Dogecoin (DOGE) in popularity and received wide acclaim in the second half of 2021.</p>
<p>As a result, the Shiba Inu community is still strong to this day. Currently, Shiba Inu has a value of $0.000008442 with a market cap of $4.9B, which is a decrease of 2.18% in the last day alone. Shiba Inu looks to have a bright future as many experts predict that its community will soon be the key to Shiba Inu jumping to $0.00001.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) - what&rsquo;s in store for its market cap growth?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve has become a crypto sensation in the last few weeks as its presale has attracted countless individuals in hopes of long-term gains. This project could transform into a fan-favorite trading platform for millions of traders worldwide. It will introduce the first-ever private trading environment offering all derivatives on a single account with no KYC checks or FIAT payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, Tradecurve will stand out as one of the few trading platforms that allows cryptocurrency to be used as collateral and for deposits. Users can create an account using their email, connect a crypto wallet to the account, and make one deposit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve will also offer high leverage starting at 500:1, automated trading &amp; artificial intelligence (AI) bots, the possibility to enroll in a metaverse trading academy, and more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the core of this platform and its expansive ecosystem will lie its utility token, TCRV, which will give holders access to various VIP statuses, discounts on subscription fees, passive income via staking, and governance voting rights. In Stage 2 of its presale, one TCRV currently has a value of only $0.012.</p>
<p>According to an IMARC impactful insights report, the value of the world foreign currency market was $753.2B in 2022. If Tradecurve taps into just 1% of this rising market, it could generate millions causing its market cap to grow. Currently, the Tradecurve market cap sits at $21.6M as there is a 1.8B TCRV token supply. This market cap could reach $1B fast as experts are bullish about this project, with some claiming it could see a value rise of 50x during its presale and 100x after its launch and subsequent Tier-1 CEX listing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the market cap is so low, Tradecurve has all the potential to skyrocket after its launch and replicate the movement of Shiba Inu, with its market cap growing to $1B within one year or even sooner.&nbsp;</p>
