										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout 2022, there were many trends surrounding crypto crime. Many <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a> popped up, clearly proving it was a popular method amongst cyberthieves of getting money that wasn’t theirs. We also saw examples of exchange fraud like with FTX. Now, billionaire investor and crypto bull Mark Cuban says <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency/billionaire-mark-cuban-warns-of-potential-new-crypto-scandal-fraud" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a new crime trend will</a> occur in 2023, though he freely admits he’s suggesting this based purely on his own thoughts, and he has no evidence to suggest it will truly occur.</p>
<h2>Mark Cuban: A New Danger Is Coming</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Cuban says that wash trades are likely to become very prominent in the year 2023, though he says this idea stems from instinct, not from fact-based data. He stated that the problem will occur mostly on centralized exchanges, such as what we’ve seen with FTX, and he thinks the problem will expand from there.</p>
<p>Cuban said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the next possible implosion is the discovery and removal of wash trades on central exchanges. There are supposedly tens of millions of dollars in trades and liquidity for tokens that have very little utilization. I don&#8217;t see how they can be that liquid… I don&#8217;t have any specifics to offer to support my guess.</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) describes wash trading as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wash Trading (is) entering into, or purporting to enter into, transactions to give the appearance that purchases and [even] sales have been made, without incurring market risk or changing the trader&#8217;s market position.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, a wash trade occurs when artificial interest is stirred in a financial product (i.e., a new crypto token) to make way for what’s called a pump and dump. The hype surrounding the coin is pumped up so much that everyone buys it, thus inflating the price. From there, the executives that created the token make off with the money they’ve made and the asset crashes and burns, leaving all investors in the dust.</p>
<p>As it turns out, bitcoin is not immune to wash trades. A 2022 study conducted by <em>Forbes</em> says that about half the exchange volumes reported by bitcoin and crypto trading platforms are fake. The study read:</p>
<blockquote><p>More than half of all reported trading volume is likely to be fake or non-economic… The global daily bitcoin volume for the industry was $128 billion on June 14. That is 51 percent less than the $262 billion one would get by taking the sum of self-reported volume from multiple sources.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Using Customers&#8217; Money</h2>
<p>If Cuban is correct, this would ultimately take the crypto crime of the last year in an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>Throughout 2022, we saw examples of companies in FTX (and now allegedly <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-sues-crypto-lending-network-celsius-and-its-former-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">the Celsius Network</a>) using customer funds <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/former-ftx-exec-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">for their own personal gains</a>. With FTX, their money was used to reportedly buy Bahamian real estate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of New York and its attorney general Leticia James <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-york-state-sues-former-celsius-ceo-over-alleged-cryptocurrency-fraud/ar-AA160HiC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">are suing former crypto</a> lending network Celsius for allegedly engaging in fraud and misusing customer funds.</p>
<h2>New York Comes Down Hard on Celsius</h2>
<p>The sentiment is that FTX wasn’t the only company to use traders’ money for personal gains this year. Celsius really rang a lot of negative bells last summer when it first announced it was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/another-mega-bitcoin-crash-is-in-the-books/" data-wpel-link="internal">going to be halting all withdrawals</a> given that speculation and the volatility of the market had become way too big for its executives to handle. The halts would be put in place indefinitely and customers had no idea regarding when they would be able to get their money back.</p>
<p>Things didn’t quite stop there, however. It was just a few weeks later when the company announced that it was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">entering bankruptcy proceedings</a>. Celsius said it was going to seek other ways of retaining capital and staying afloat without having to worry about what angry lenders would do to retaliate against it for not making loan payments.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of hoopla around the company as it was announced that Celsius executives were working on a plan to give <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-is-planning-to-give-customer-funds-back/" data-wpel-link="internal">customers their money back</a>, though now, it looks like that may have just been for show, and when one puts the pieces together for Celsius, they cannot help but be reminded of FTX, which followed the same distinct patterns and pathways.</p>
<p>Think about it. Celsius files for bankruptcy and then the CEO, Alex Mashinsky, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-steps-down/" data-wpel-link="internal">resigns from his post</a>. In the case of FTX, the story is the same. The company filed <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">bankruptcy and then</a> the CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, resigned from his post. It’s now been alleged that FTX used customer funds to purchase luxury items for the company’s executives, so why wouldn’t Celsius’ tale conclude with the same measures?</p>
<p>The similarities are there, and for whatever reason, we couldn’t quite put them together until now. James and her state are taking a stance against Celsius and its top executive, claiming they boasted low-risk investments while repeatedly exposing customers to high risks. This allowed them to make off with user funds and keep the activity hidden from prying eyes.</p>
<h2>No More Business for You!</h2>
<p>James also says that Mashinksy made false claims about the safety and strategies of the firm. She is now looking to get him barred from doing business within New York’s borders forever. She is also seeking to impose financial penalties and establish a plan that would force him to compensate cheated or affected investors of Celsius.</p>
<p>New York has been coming down hard on crypto companies, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-to-pay-hefty-penalty-fees-to-new-york-lawmakers/" data-wpel-link="internal">a recent example being</a> Coinbase, which was forced to pay more than $100 million to settle with the state’s regulators for allegedly not complying with their anti-money laundering rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto fans everywhere are wishing bitcoin – the world’s number one digital currency by market cap – a happy birthday, as just a few weeks ago, the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-celebrates-birthday-7090803" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">beloved asset turned</a> 14.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is 14 Years Old</h2>
<p>Bitcoin’s whitepaper was officially introduced on Halloween of 2008, but it wasn’t until January of 2009 that the currency began getting mined and added to blockchain circulation. While the whitepaper may have been the asset’s first real introduction to the world, many see that first instance of mining as bitcoin’s true birthing moment, which is why so many choose to celebrate in January rather than in October.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has been declared dead hundreds of times since it first came to fruition. Its rise to the top has been long, hard, and tumultuous as we’re still seeing today. Look, for example, where bitcoin was when November of 2021 came about, and look at where the currency is now. In the former period, the asset was trading at a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit. Everyone felt that the asset was on top of the world and could never be removed from its position.</p>
<p>However, this clearly wasn’t the case as we’re now witnessing in full view. Once 2022 came into play, bitcoin was battered by bearish conditions that ultimately caused it to fall rapidly and lose more than 70 percent of its overall value. The currency ended the year trading in the mid-$16,000 range, a huge dip for what was once considered the most powerful investing tool of its time.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has also been hurt by a wide number of external factors, a big one being fraud and criminal activity which littered 2022. Examples include the fall of popular digital <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">currency exchange FTX</a>. At the time of the company’s collapse, bitcoin appeared to be trying to make a comeback. The currency was trading for just over $20K, but once the news sprung forward that FTX was crashing and burning, it dropped by several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>While it’s easy to assume bitcoin is done for and the crypto space has had its run, one can see that the currency is only battered – not beaten. BTC, for all it has been through, has surpassed some tough barriers and gotten through some rough tests, and it’s come out relatively strong on the other end.</p>
<h2>The Currency Is Still Here</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is down for the count after all the negative events of the previous 12 months, though it has retained some of its inner power. It’s not like the currency has disappeared altogether; it’s still here, which means it still has enough juice in its tank to put up a fight, and it’s not like bitcoin hasn’t made comebacks in the past.</p>
<p>Let’s all wish BTC a happy birthday and hope for the best in 2023!</p>

</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is rising above $1.00 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-gains-above-23k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. The price could resume its increase if it clears the $1.12 and $1.15 resistance levels.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This week, EOS price started a fresh increase from the $0.95 zone against the US Dollar. The price gained pace and was able to clear the $1.00 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price broke the $1.05 resistance zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-risk-of-more-losses-below-0-95/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1.10 level. However, the bears appeared near the $1.12 zone. A high is formed near $1.122 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>
<p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $1.11 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.12 level, above which the price could rise steadily.</p>
<p>In the stated case, it could rise towards the $1.15 level. Any more gains might send the price towards the $1.20 level. On the downside, an immediate support is near the $1.09. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.01 swing low to $1.122 high.</p>
<p>The next key support is near the $1.065. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1.065 on the 4-hours chart of the EOS/USD pair.</p>
<p>The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.01 swing low to $1.122 high. If there is a downside break below the $1.065 support, the price could revisit the $1.02 support.</p>

<p><em>Litecoin price is rising steadily above $85 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-gains-above-23k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. LTC price could continue to move up if it remains well supported above the $85 level.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, there was a decent increase in bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-bulls-aim-1800-or-higher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-bulls-in-control-above-0-38/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ripple</a>, and litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC formed a base above the $82 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $85 and $88 resistance levels. The price even climbed above the $90 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). However, the bears were active near the $95 zone. A high was formed near $93.16 and the price started a downside correction.</p>
<p>There was a move below the $90 level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $81.67 swing low to $93.16 high.</p>
<p>The price is now trading above $85 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $88.00 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair. The pair is also supported above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $81.67 swing low to $93.16 high.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $88 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break below the $88 support, the price could accelerate lower towards the $85 level in the near term.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $92 and $93 levels. A clear move above the $93 level could pump the price towards the $100 level. The next major resistance sits near the $108 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, <em>Live Bitcoin News</em> published an article <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/solana-continues-to-crash-due-to-ftx-ties/" data-wpel-link="internal">talking about how poorly</a> the Solana cryptocurrency was doing. The asset was crashing and burning likely due to its ties to the now fallen crypto exchange FTX and its disgraced head executive Sam Bankman-Fried, and while things aren’t fully looking up for the currency just yet, it’s garnering a heavy load of support <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2023/01/02/ethereum-founder-suddenly-powers-a-shock-ftx-crypto-price-rally-as-bitcoin-struggles/?sh=5a31ee5a22bb" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">from crypto developers</a> such as Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of popular crypto network Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Solana Has Recorded a Price Jump</h2>
<p>In the previous article, it was discussed that Solana has deep ties to the fallen exchange and has since crashed by more than 96 percent since reaching an all-time high during the month of November 2021. During that time, it was trading for just shy of $260 per unit. At the time of the FTX bankruptcy, the currency had fallen to less than ten dollars.</p>
<p>Solana’s ties to FTX are so thick that it’s often dubbed “Sam Coin” in <em>honor</em> of Sam Bankman-Fried (not such a big honor anymore). The asset has links to an on-chain crypto exchange known as Serum, which was also created by Bankman-Fried. Solana is issued by the Solana blockchain, which presently engages in decentralized finance (defi) protocols and offers monetary products such as loans and mortgages.</p>
<p>Things do appear to be changing for the currency, however. At least on a temporary basis. At the time of writing, the altcoin has recorded a surge of approximately ten percent thanks to some positive words delivered on its behalf by Vitalik Buterin. In a recent tweet, the Ethereum front man said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future. Hard for me to tell from [the] outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive.</p></blockquote>
<p>During its peak, Solana had a market capitalization of about $80 billion, and while this is not comparable to bitcoin or even Ethereum, the number is considered relatively impressive for a secondary altcoin.</p>
<p>Sadly, given the bear market conditions the crypto world is facing and the sudden problems surrounding FTX, that market cap has since fallen to about $4 billion. This is a dip of more than 90 percent at press time. Overall, the crypto space has lost more than $2 trillion in valuation in the last several months.</p>
<h2>Additional Support</h2>
<p>Solana has also gotten support from the likes of tech and crypto moguls Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks. On a recent podcast episode, Palihapitiya said of Solana:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was able to see a little bit under the hood of Solana Pay, and that&#8217;s really exciting. [Solana and blockchain] is like a swarm of activity to dismantle these payments businesses.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members of a local police force in the state of Connecticut <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/ct-state-police-recover-23k-181600011.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">have helped a theft victim</a> recover roughly $23,000 in stolen crypto funds.</p>
<h2>Police Are on the Case!</h2>
<p>The money was deposited under false pretenses to several nearby bitcoin ATMs after a complaint was filed in September of last year. The victim had allegedly been scammed into depositing the money into various machines around the state, and the case was noted by the Milford Police Department. It was stated that more than $41,000 had been taken from the victim.</p>
<p>In a statement, the police agency explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>The funds were traced to two major cryptocurrency exchanges located in both the United States and the Cayman Islands. During the month of September, SOCITF investigators were able to recover a portion of the bitcoin from the two exchanges. Investigators learned that the suspects reside outside of the United States and no arrest is anticipated at this time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Situations like these have become increasingly common in the crypto space, and it looks like bitcoin and crypto-based ATMs are now widely used for fraudulent purposes. Typically, situations like these arise when a scammer contacts a potential victim – usually by phone (a huge red flag because crypto companies often don’t call their customers) – and says that there is a problem with their bank account or with some other financial tool they’ve been utilizing, and that their money is in danger.</p>
<p>From there, the crypto scammer tells the victim that to make sure their accounts are not vulnerable, they should download a bitcoin app and purchase the asset. From there, they need to make deposits into various machines so that the money can be monitored while being transferred. What the victim likely doesn’t know is that their digital money is going to an address that the scammer controls. When they give them the money, it’s likely they’ll never see it again, as it’s now in the hands of the cyberthief and crypto funds can be notoriously difficult to take back.</p>
<p>Other incidents involve <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a>, in which those looking for love online are tricked into making deposits into thief-controlled crypto platforms.</p>
<h2>Much of the Money Has Been Returned</h2>
<p>In this case, the victim was lucky in that police were able to seize back roughly $23,000 of the stolen money on December 30 and have it transferred back to the person. While not all the funds have been recovered, the move is considered a win for the scammed individual and a potential step forward in the world’s fight against crypto.</p>
<p>Police in the area are warning residents that these kinds of incidents are becoming increasingly common, and that all traders need to be on the lookout. If anything smells or looks fishy, they should report it to local law enforcement right away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase – one of the largest and most popular digital currency exchanges in the world – has announced it will <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/coinbase-to-pay-regulators-7091279" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">pay roughly $50 million in settlement</a> fees to New York regulators for allegedly failing to comply with the Empire State’s anti-money laundering laws.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Allegedly Did Not Comply with Anti-Money Laundering Laws</h2>
<p>Regulators say that Coinbase has several older accounts that it hasn’t bothered to apply anti-money laundering laws to. There have been several thousand transactions with these accounts over the past four years that raised several red flags that Coinbase has allegedly done nothing about. The company must provide $50 million in penalties to New York as well as an additional $50 million to boost its compliance efforts.</p>
<p>The chief legal officer of the exchange, Paul Grewal, said in an email that Coinbase is now working hard to ensure it always remains in compliance with the state. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase has taken substantial measures to address these historical shortcomings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase obtained a BitLicense back in 2017. New York is the only region in the United States to impose such a will on crypto firms, and it’s rare when a company is willing to go as far as it does to please customers and legislators alike within the state’s borders, though a few – such as the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/gemini/" data-wpel-link="internal">Gemini exchange</a> – have had the initiative to do so.</p>
<p>Adrienne A. Harris – the state superintendent of financial services – says Coinbase’s issues go back as far as 2018. She said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We found failures that really warranted putting in place an independent monitor rather than wait for a settlement. We have been very outspoken about illicit financing concerns in the space. It is why our framework holds crypto companies to the same standard as for banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s been a rough several months for the Coinbase exchange. 2022 was initially going to be a year when the company expanded its staff by as many as 5,000 people, though the subsequent bear market that struck the crypto space put these <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-freezing-all-2022-hiring-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal">plans largely out of commission</a>. Things eventually got so bad that Coinbase – like many other crypto companies – was forced to let go of several employees, and as many as 18 percent of the individuals it had <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-laying-off-several-employees/" data-wpel-link="internal">hired were forced</a> to step away.</p>
<h2>Everyone&#8217;s on Edge Because of FTX</h2>
<p>Regulators have been coming down hard on crypto exchanges for the past few months, likely in response <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">to the collapse of FTX</a>, which at one time, was one of the world’s top five crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>The company came to fruition in 2019 and quickly rose through the ranks, but it eventually collapsed into a heap of bankruptcy filings and fraud charges when it was alleged that its founder and chief executive – Sam Bankman-Fried – had misused customer funds for his own personal gain and to purchase Bahamian real estate.</p>

<p><em>TRON price started a downside correction below the $0.0620 against the US Dollar, similar <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-gains-above-23k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. TRX price could accelerate lower if there is a move below $0.0585.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, tron price started a steady increase above the $0.0600 resistance level against the US Dollar. TRX price struggled to gain pace for more gains and formed a top near $0.0640.</p>
<p>The price started a fresh decline below the $0.0620 level. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0589 swing low to $0.0636 high. Besides, there was also a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.0620 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>The price is now trading below $0.0620 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-bulls-in-control-above-0-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.0620 level.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.0635 level. A close above $0.0635 and $0.0640 is a must for a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could rise towards the $0.0680 resistance in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.0600 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0589 swing low to $0.0636 high. The next major support is now forming near $0.0585. If there is a downside break below the $0.0585 support, the price might revisit the $0.0550 support. Any more losses might call for a move towards the $0.0520 zone in the near term.</p>
<div id="attachment_76667" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/01/TRON-TRX-3.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-76667" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-76667" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/01/TRON-TRX-3.png" alt="Tron (TRX) Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-76667" class="wp-caption-text">Tron (TRX) Price</p></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TRXUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a> indicates that TRX price is now trading below $0.0620 and near the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Overall, the price could continue to move down if it breaks the $0.0585 support zone.</p>
<h2>Technical Indicators</h2>
<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD for TRX/USD is slowly gaining momentum in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4 hours RSI &#8211; The RSI for TRX/USD is below the 50 level.</p>
