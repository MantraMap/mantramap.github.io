<ul><li>Google has rolled out native support for tokenized digital assets in apps and games on the play store.&nbsp;</li><li>The tech giant will allow developers to offer games and apps enabled with trading of NFTs.&nbsp;</li><li>Experts saw the latest policy change as a positive step for the crypto space.&nbsp;</li><li>Reddit partnered with Google to help update the play store’s policy for digital assets.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Google has rolled out native support for tokenized digital assets like non-fungible tokens for apps and games on its play store. In a major policy overhaul, the tech giant will allow developers to offer games and apps that would allow users to buy and sell or earn tokenized assets. Google’s change in stance towards <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-nfts-added-to-binance-marketplace/">NFTs</a> came as a positive sign for investors, artists, and other stakeholders in the space. </p>



<h2><strong>Reddit Helped Google Update Its NFT Policy</strong></h2>



<p>Google stated in a recent <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/new-blockchain-based-content-opportunities-google-play.html" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> that the decision to update the policy on tokenized digital assets was taken in order to support developers that wanted to offer a creative and immersive in-app experience to users. Google Play’s policy was accordingly updated to allow the transaction of blockchain-based assets within the applications and games. The move is expected to boost user loyalty via NFT rewards and reimagine traditional games with unique user-owned content. </p>



<p>Interestingly, social networking giant Reddit and game developer Mythical Games lent a helping hand to Google to overhaul the policy on NFTs in order to offer transparent and responsible engagement with blockchain-based digital content. The companies collaborated to set clear guidelines to promote the safe usage of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We think these new policies are steps forward for both players and developers alike and will positively impact the adoption of new technology while also protecting consumers.&#8221; </p><cite>John Linden, CEO, Mythical Games</cite></blockquote>



<p>Joseph Mills, a product manager at Google Play, stated that developers who decide to incorporate tokenized digital assets like NFTs on their apps and games would be required to declare the blockchain elements. Furthermore, Google Play will not allow NFT-enabled apps and games that include trading or gambling activities.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Circle has decided to lay off some of its employees to improve its financial health.&nbsp;</li><li>The stablecoin giant plans to focus on core activities and hire for related roles globally.&nbsp;</li><li>The reduction in the workforce came months after the company revealed its intention to increase the workforce by 25%.&nbsp;</li><li>The USDC issuer joined the likes of Coinbase and Gemini, who laid off employees earlier this year.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Circle Internet Financial, the crypto giant behind the second-largest stablecoin in the world, has announced layoffs. The USDC issuer reduced its workforce and pulled investments from non-core activities in a bid to strengthen its balance. The layoffs came just five months after the firm stated that it would increase its workforce by 25% amid a reduction of workforce at fellow crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Circle Will Continue To Hire Globally In Key Areas Of Focus </strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-firm-circle-cut-workforce-focus-core-activities-2023-07-12/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, Circle’s decision to cut its workforce was part of a broader shift in priorities. The USDC issuer stated that it would focus on core business activities and execution. Layoffs were announced in order to reduce operational headcount and help maintain a strong balance sheet. However, the stablecoin giant stated that it had identified new areas for investment and would continue to hire in key areas of focus globally. </p>



<p>With the decision to cut the workforce, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fdic-circle-sequoia-svb-top-depositors/">Circle</a> joined fellow crypto firms like Coinbase, Gemini, and Chainalysis, who announced layoffs earlier this year due to a high-interest rate environment and the prolonged crypto winter. Interestingly, Circle’s Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Fox-Green revealed earlier this year that the company was looking to hire more than 200 workers in 2023. </p>



<p>“We are growing and investing and we are fortunate to be in a financial position to be able to sustain our investments,” Fox-Green told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-company-circle-focuses-on-growth-after-canceled-spac-merger-e446f779" rel="noopener">WSJ</a> at the time. The decision to increase the workforce by 25% represented a lower growth rate as compared to 2022 when the firm doubled its headcount from the previous year. </p>

<p>Canadian crypto <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-el-salvador-1-billion-btc-mining/">mining</a> firm HIVE Blockchain has rebranded as HIVE Digital Technologies in a major pivot to artificial intelligence and web3. The Vancouver-based firm dumped blockchain from its name in a bid to reflect it&#8217;s evolving focus on its mission to drive advancements in artificial intelligence applications such as ChatGPT in order to support the new web3 ecosystem. </p>



<h2><strong>HIVE To Use Its Nvidia Graphics Cards For Cloud Computing</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://hivedigitaltechnologies.com/news/hive-digital-technologies-debuts-new-name-and-strategic-expansion-to-power-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-with-our-nvidia-gpu-cards/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from HIVE Digital Technologies, the pivot represented the former crypto miner’s evolving focus on revenue opportunities with its Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) cards in the field of cloud computing. The firm plans to employ its fleet of 38,000 graphics cards for computational tasks on a large scale. The strategic shift in priorities will also include a focus on machine learning, and advanced data analysis in order to increase revenue. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As we expand our GPU Cloud business, we require a strategy that better reflects both sides of our business. We build infrastructure for emerging digital tech, not just blockchain, and we intend to utilize our large fleet of GPUs to grow a cloud hosting business. We believe AI and machine learning are going to drive significant demand for GPU compute going forward.” </p><cite>Aydin Kilic, President, and Chief Executive Officer</cite></blockquote>



<p>HIVE Digital Technologies also plans to launch a new service called HIVE Cloud, which will be used to rent out the company’s GPU server clusters. This business model aims to compete with major cloud service providers that cater to small and medium business owners. The company’s stock lost more than 4% throughout the day and closed at $5.66. Trading was halted in light of the latest development.</p>

<p>Stablecoin GHO is set to debut on the Ethereum mainnet following Aave DAO&#8217;s <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268" data-type="URL" data-id="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">support</a> of a plan to introduce the token via two facilitators. The proposal reached quorum after a key project delegate voted &#8220;Yae&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We voted YAE on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GHO&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">$GHO</a> AIP, allowing the proposal to reach quorum.<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GHO&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">$GHO</a> should be available on July 15th at ~5:30pm CEST (Paris). <a href="https://t.co/7xR6AgcCE7" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/7xR6AgcCE7</a></p>&mdash; Aave-Chan Initiative (@AaveChan) <a href="https://twitter.com/AaveChan/status/1679034230385287173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">July 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Aave companies floated the proposal in the protocol&#8217;s DAO on Tuesday, arguing that launching GHO on Ethereum would make stablecoin borrowing on the platform more competitive and increase revenue for the $5 billion DeFi lending titan. </p>



<p>The proposal plans to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-dao-stablecoin-gho-on-ethereum/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-dao-stablecoin-gho-on-ethereum/" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduce</a> GHO to Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet via two facilitators. Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator will allow users to borrow GHO tokens against collateral deposited in V3 Ethereum Mainnet Pool.</p>



<p>Users can also mint GHO without any collateral by using the FlashMinter Facilitator, provided that the loan is repaid in a single transaction after flash minting Aave&#8217;s stablecoin. The proposal said this method could help to maintain GHO&#8217;s peg and offer arbitrage opportunities for high-level users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As a result of this TEMP CHECK, it is agreed by the community that the FlashMinter Facilitators initial bucket capacity will be 2,000,000 GHO and that there will be no fee paid to the Facilitator. In the early stages, GHO&#8217;s ability to maintain its peg will be enhanced by low fees, which further incentivizes arbitrage</p></blockquote>



<h2>Aave DAO Eyes Friday For GHO Launch On Ethereum</h2>



<p>Although voting is still on at press time, over 698,000 votes in support of deploying GHO on Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet suggest that the proposal would be approved by 14:21 UTC +01:00 on Friday when voting closes. </p>



<p>Proponents expect that GHO will then officially launch on Ethereum by July 15 after nearly six months of testing on Goerli by developers. </p>

<h2>Prosecutors Set Sights On FTX Execs</h2>



<p>While Salame was not charged in the case against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried for stealing billion in exchange customer funds and defrauding investors, the former company executive is reportedly an unnamed co-conspirator in SBF&#8217;s indictment. </p>

<p>Arkham Intel Exchange will not support trading off-chain info, the blockchain intelligence provider said on Tuesday amid speculation that its new platform supports doxxing wallet owners. The company also has a public token sale on Binance and an airdrop for users.</p>



<h2>&#8220;Intel-To-Earn&#8221; Vision Draws Criticism To Arkham&#8217;s Exchange</h2>



<p>Arkham <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-allow-users-buy-sell-intel-wallets/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-allow-users-buy-sell-intel-wallets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its Intel Exchange for monetizing blockchain information and allowing &#8220;talented on-chain sleuths&#8221; to earn for their work. The platform functions in a quid-pro-quo manner where information seeks post requests for data as bounties and sleuths can claim these bounties for a fee. </p>



<p>Conversely, sleuths or users with in-demand blockchain data can offer their intel for a buy-now price or in auctions. </p>



<p>The announcement was met with controversy and concerns from the crypto community, with many voices agreeing that the tool could be used to dox wallet owners and sell private information. Skeptics also noticed that referral links generated by users revealed their email addresses. </p>

<p>The Aave DAO community will soon vote on a proposal aimed at <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">launching</a> the GHO stablecoin on Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet after months of testing on Goerli, a popular testnet on Ethereum.</p>



<p>If approved, users would be able to mint GHO tokens against their collateral directly on Ethereum&#8217;s main chain. GHO&#8217;s interest rate will be changeable through Aave DAO governance votes. </p>



<p>Proposed by Aave Companies, an active contributor to the DeFi lender, the plan hopes to generate additional revenue for the project&#8217;s DAO. The proposal also would bootstrap competition among stablecoin borrowers on the lender&#8217;s platform, per the AIP. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If approved, the introduction of GHO would make stablecoin borrowing on the Aave Protocol more competitive and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by providing to the DAO treasury 100% of the interest payments made on GHO borrows.</p></blockquote>



<p>Voting on the proposal opens later today at 22:02 UTC +01:00 and ends 14 Jul 2023, 14:02 UTC +01:00. </p>



<h2>GHO Minting Via Aave Facilitators, Aave DAO Plans</h2>



<p>The proposal plans to introduce GHO minting on Ethereum through facilitators &#8211; protocols or entities that are able to burn and mint GHO coins. &#8220;This proposal combined two previously approved Facilitators (the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool and the FlashMinter)&#8221;, the proposal reads. </p>



<p>This means that users have two options for minting GHO tokens. They can either deposit collateral in the V3 Ethereum Mainnet Pool and borrow GHO through Aave V3 Ethereum Pool or lash mint GHO tokens without any collateral using the FlashMinter Facilitator. The latter option requires that users repay the loan in a single transaction. </p>



<p>This AIP also proposes slashing the cost of borrowing GHO by using a mechanism built on Staked Aave (stkAAVE).</p>

Silva, who previously served as outside counsel to crypto investors and entrepreneurs at Cooley LLP, stated that his company’s filing was to show the rejection of the SEC’s “unsupported attempt” to expand its jurisdiction over crypto secondary markets. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The SEC’s lawsuit against Bittrex is the first of three cases that the SEC has brought in rapid succession against crypto exchanges. Through these actions, the SEC is wrongfully attempting to lay claim over crypto secondary markets.” </p><cite>Rodrigo Silva, Special Counsel for Paradigm</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Paradigm lawyer also cited a Congressional testimony by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-coinbase-violated-securities-laws/">SEC</a> Chair Gary Gensler, wherein he acknowledged the lack of his agency’s authority to regulate the secondary markets in question. “The exchanges trading in these crypto-assets do not have a regulatory framework,” Gensler stated during his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on May 6, 2021. </p>



<p>Silva added that the law hadn’t changed since the SEC Chair’s 2021 testimony and called out the securities regulator for somehow discovering the same authority that it previously acknowledged it did not have. Paradigm believes that the regulator doesn’t have jurisdiction over secondary markets for crypto assets because they do not involve investment contracts and are, therefore, not securities transactions under the agency’s remit.</p>

<ul><li>The share price of software firm Microstrategy increased by 7% following a recent projection by Berenberg.&nbsp;</li><li>The investment bank believes that next year’s Bitcoin halving could trigger a rally in Microstategy’s stock (MSTR).&nbsp;</li><li>Berenburg’s current MSTR price target is $430, which would be an 18-month high.</li></ul>



<p>Hamburg-based Berenberg Capital Markets recently circulated a research note which presented the upcoming <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-pro-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> halving as a potential trigger event for the share price of the United States-based software firm Microstrategy. Berenberg believes that the fourth Bitcoin halving could lead to a considerable rally in the share price of Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor’s company. </p>



<h2><strong>Berenberg Shares Bullish Price Target For Microstrategy</strong></h2>



<p>According to a research note shared with <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/238784/bitcoin-halving-underpins-bull-case-for-microstrategy-berenberg-says" rel="nofollow noopener">The Block</a>, Berenberg Capital Markets placed most of Microstrategy’s value on the massive Bitcoin holding on its balance sheet, which exceeded a whopping 150,000. The investment bank is counting on the previously seen rally in BTC’s price following the halving event, to trigger a bullish scenario for the share price of Saylor’s company as well. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;If the fourth bitcoin halving features he kind of strong rally in the price of bitcoin that occurred prior to and following the first three halvings, then we believe it is likely that MSTR’s stock would rally along with it; the correlation between the company’s share price and the price of bitcoin is ~0.90.&#8221;</p><cite>Berenberg Capital Markets</cite></blockquote>



<p>Berenberg currently has a rather bullish price target for Microstrategy’s stock, $430 to be precise. The investment bank believes that the software firm’s share price will reach an 18-month high and deliver numbers that were previously witnessed in January 2022. At the time of writing, the stock was trading at $407.7, up more than 7% over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously witnessed trends suggest that Microstrategy’s stock reacts to the price action of Bitcoin. A drop in BTC is usually mirrored by the software company’s share price. A research report released by Standard Chartered on Monday reinforced MSTR’s bull case. The British banking giant increased its BTC price target and stated that the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $130,000 by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
