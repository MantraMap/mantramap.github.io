<h2>HSBC&#8217;s Trademark Applications for Crypto-Related Products and Services</h2>
<p>HSBC has filed two crypto-related trademark applications for its name and logo with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Mike Kondoudis, a USPTO-licensed trademark attorney, noted in a tweet Friday that HSBC&#8217;s trademark applications indicate the bank&#8217;s plans for a number of digital products and services, including those related to the exchange and transfer of virtual currencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hsbc-trademark-apps.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20221226%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20221226T180024Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=26ee7a7e0926fe649e684fb3185a0b59f2ad71f9f1bed6be0e70988f8a838b9c"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-566002 aligncenter" title="Banking Giant HSBC Files Trademarks for a Wide Range of Digital Currency and Metaverse Products" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hsbc-trademark-apps.jpg" alt="Banking Giant HSBC Files Trademarks for a Wide Range of Digital Currency and Metaverse Products" width="590" height="723" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hsbc-trademark-apps-245x300.jpg 245w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hsbc-trademark-apps.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a></p>
<p>HSBC&#8217;s crypto-related trademark applications were filed on Dec. 15; their serial numbers are 97718803 and 97718583. The bank described a wide range of products and services in its applications, including sending, receiving, converting, and storing digital currencies.</p>

<p>The trademark applications also detail several metaverse-related products and services, such as &#8220;facilitating secure payment transactions by electronic means in the metaverse,&#8221; &#8220;providing banking services in the metaverse,&#8221; and &#8220;providing processing of virtual credit card, virtual debit card, virtual prepaid card, and virtual payment card transactions in the metaverse.&#8221; HSBC also included a number of NFT services, such as &#8220;downloadable digital files authenticated by non-fungible tokens (NFTs).&#8221;</p>
<p>HSBC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/british-investment-bank-hsbc-joins-metaverse-via-sandbox-animoca-brands-partnership/">joined the metaverse</a> by partnering with blockchain virtual gaming platform The Sandbox in March. However, HSBC Group&#8217;s CEO, Noel Quinn, said in September that crypto is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hsbcs-ceo-explains-why-crypto-is-not-in-the-banking-giants-future/">not in the bank&#8217;s future</a>.</p>
<p>An increasing number of major corporations and financial services institutions have filed trademark applications covering a wide range of digital currency and metaverse products and services. For example, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/visa-files-trademark-applications-covering-a-range-of-cryptocurrency-products-including-crypto-wallet/">Visa</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-and-western-union-file-trademarks-for-wide-range-of-crypto-services/">Paypal, and Western Union</a> filed crypto-related trademark applications in October. Last month, JPMorgan Chase was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-granted-wallet-trademark-covering-various-virtual-currency-and-crypto-payment-services/">granted</a> a wallet trademark covering various virtual currency and payment services.</p>

<h2>Degods Says NFT Project Will Move to Ethereum, Y00ts Details NFT Venture Is Transitioning to Polygon</h2>
<p>The crypto community has been discussing two crypto projects that have said the teams plan to transition their ventures from the Solana blockchain network to an alternative blockchain. Degods is one NFT project that revealed on Twitter it was moving from Solana to the Ethereum network. Launched in October 2021, Degods is an NFT venture that created 10,000 deflationary PFP (profile picture) NFTs. On Twitter the Degods team said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Degods will officially bridge to Ethereum in Q1 of 2023. The bridge is not the destination. It is on the path to get there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the team behind the Y00ts NFT collection said it plans to transition over to the Polygon network. “Y00ts will officially bridge to [Polygon] in Q1 2023,” the official Twitter account tweeted on Dec. 25, 2022. The decisions to transition the two NFT projects from one chain to another come at a time where the Solana project itself has been hurt by its former relationships with FTX.</p>

<p>Solana’s native crypto asset solana (SOL) is down 94.2% year-to-date and over the last 30 days SOL has lost 19.7% against the U.S. dollar. Last year, SOL was a top ten crypto asset but the digital currency has been struggling to hold the 18th largest market cap position in more recent times. Seven-day stats show that Solana’s NFT sales are still the second largest out of 19 different blockchain networks, according to cryptoslam.io data.</p>
<p>While Ethereum dominated the last seven days of sales with $129.12 million out of the $154 million in sales, Solana took the second position with its $14.65 million in NFT sales recorded this past week. Meanwhile, Polygon holds the fourth-largest position in terms of NFT sales with $2.38 million.</p>

<p>Defillama metrics shows that there’s $39.42 billion total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (defi) today and Solana commands the 12th largest TVL in defi. Solana’s TVL on Dec. 26, 2022 is $216.39 million which equates to 0.55% of the entire TVL locked in defi. Interestingly, the tweets from Degods and Y00ts say the same thing as both teams mention transitioning &#8220;has never been done before at this scale.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Gold Dropped a Hair During the Last Year, While Silver Rose a Touch &#x2014; Precious Metal Assets Managed to Hold Value All Year Long Despite the Macroeconomic Calamity and Energy Crisis</h2>
<p>While precious metals like gold and silver fluctuated in U.S. dollar value during the last year, gold and silver year-to-date price statistics show prices are pretty much the same as last year. Gold is down a touch during the last 12 months as it was trading for $1,810 per ounce and today it&#x2019;s trading 0.71% lower at $1,797 per ounce. Silver was $23.04 per ounce and today it&#x2019;s 2.95% higher in value at $23.72 an ounce.</p>

<p>2022 was an interesting year for gold as the precious metal reached a lifetime price high on March 8, 2022, as one ounce of gold reached $2,070 per unit. While silver tapped a high on the same day, the metal still has a long way to go before catching up to the $40 an ounce range reached in 2011. Silver came awfully close to surpassing the $27 per unit range on March 8, 2022.</p>

<p>Both precious metals did a lot better than the top two cryptocurrencies bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>). Metrics show <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is down 66% since this time last year, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> has lost a touch more than 70% since last year. Like cryptocurrency fans, precious metals advocates think 2023 will see a bullish revival in terms of silver and gold rising in value. Kitco News contributor Phillip Streible <a href="https://www.kitco.com/commentaries/2022-12-23/Gold-Silver-2023-outrageous-precious-metals-predictions.html">shared his predictions</a> for the two precious metals on Dec. 23.</p>
<p>&#x201C;By year-end [2023], inflation should decline to 3-3.5%, leading to gold prices averaging $1,950/oz with extensions up over $2,000 at different periods,&#x201D; Streible said. &#x201C;We should see the 2&#x2019;s vs. 10&#x2019;s yield curve flatten while Silver could easily see &#x2018;green shoots&#x2019; up into the mid-high $ &#x2019;30s, settling back to $28 by year-end.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Like cryptocurrencies and equity markets, gold and silver have been affected by the macroeconomic storm and events like Covid-19, the Ukraine/Russia war, and the result of expanding the world&#x2019;s money supply like no other time in history. The U.S. Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds rate six times so far in order to combat America&#x2019;s highest inflation rates in over 40 years.</p>

<p>The gold bug and economist <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-advises-selling-bitcoin-today-says-its-the-smart-move/">Peter Schiff</a> believes gold and silver will do well in 2023 as well but he&#x2019;s not as optimistic about the inflation rate as Streible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gMKq4WeG6Us">Speaking</a> with Kitco News anchor David Lin, Schiff said there&#x2019;s a chance it could drop but he expects the U.S. inflation rate to jump above 10%.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not getting anywhere near 2 percent [inflation],&#x201D; Schiff remarked. &#x201C;Maybe we&#x2019;ll go below 7 percent before we go above 10 percent, but I think we&#x2019;re going to take out the highs from 2022 before the end of 2023 on a year-over-year basis,&#x201D; the economist added.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about gold&#x2019;s and silver&#x2019;s market performances in 2022? What do you think about Phillip Streible&#x2019;s and Peter Schiff&#x2019;s opinions about inflation and precious metal prices? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The token extended recent gains to start the week, and neared a key resistance point in the process. Xrp was also higher, as it also collided with a price ceiling.</strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>) was one of the notable gainers on Monday, as the token raced to a ten-day high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD rose to a high of $70.83 to start the week, which comes less than a day after hitting a low of $65.54.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s surge has taken litecoin to its highest point since December 16, and closer to a key resistance level of $72.00.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, Monday&#x2019;s move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose above its own ceiling at 45.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking at 51.79, with the next visible point of support at the 54.00 level.</p>
<p>Should the RSI reach this point, it is highly likely that prices will also collide with a ceiling of $72.00.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, also moved higher to start the week, as the token collided with a key resistance point.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.3447, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD hit a high of $0.356 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which is also a recent price ceiling.</p>
<p>Monday&#x2019;s gain is the highest point that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> has hit since December 18, and comes as traders returned from the Christmas holiday weekend.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this move accompanied a recent move beyond a ceiling on the RSI of 42.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at 43.45, which is its strongest point since December 15.</p>
<p>Ultimately, should this trend continue, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> could continue to move towards the $0.4000 mark.</p>

For instance, last month, there was roughly $534 million in NFT sales compared to the $2.77 billion in NFT sales sold in Dec. 2021.</strong></p>
<h2>The NFT Industry Takes a Hit in 2022 &#x2014; Sales and Google Searches Down Significantly</h2>
<p>2022 hasn&#x2019;t been kind to non-fungible token (NFT) holders, and statistics show that interest in the subject has dropped a great deal this year. Google Trends (GT) <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=nft">data</a> shows that the search term &#x201C;NFT&#x201D; had a score of around 52 during the week of Dec. 26, 2021 &#x2013; Jan. 1, 2022. The term also skyrocketed to the highest score of 100 on Jan. 16 &#x2013; Jan. 22, 2022.</p>

<p>Today, however, for the week of Dec. 18 &#x2013; Dec. 24, 2022, the search term &#x201C;NFT&#x201D; has a score of around 16. There&#x2019;s been a slight rebound in interest recently in NFTs according to GT data, which started around Dec. 4, 2022. GT data shows the most interested region in NFTs today is China, followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, Nigeria, and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Statistics also show that NFT sales volume has dropped a great deal since last year. Cryptoslam.io <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/nftglobal">data</a> indicates that there was $2.77 billion in NFT sales sold in Dec. 2021, and last month only $534 million in NFT sales were recorded. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211227032141/https://cryptoslam.io/">Metrics</a> saved to archive.org indicate that during the week of Dec. 27, 2021, $414.84 million in sales were recorded.</p>

<p>Sales during the week of Dec. 27, 2021 were also down 32.05% lower as the previous seven days saw $610.53 million in sales. In terms of NFT sales by blockchain at the time, Ethereum saw $334.83 million out of the $414.84 million in total sales that week. The week of Dec. 27, 2021, Ronin had roughly $45.65 million in sales and Solana had just over $16 million in sales during the seven day period.</p>

<p>The top five projects or collections in terms of seven day sales during the last week of Dec. 2021, included Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Cryptopunks, Axie Infinity, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and The Sandbox. This month, roughly a year later, NFT sales pale in comparison to the purchases made last year. As of Dec. 25, 2022, NFT sales dipped by 12.22% this week as $154.02 million in sales were recorded during the past seven days.</p>

<p>Over the trailing seven days, there were 295,338 NFT buyers and just over one million NFT transactions. This week, the top blockchain in terms of NFT sales is still Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) and over the last seven days, there&#x2019;s been $129.23 million in NFT sales that derive from the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> chain.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> is followed by Solana, Polygon, Immutable X, and Cardano in terms of the largest sales last week by blockchain. Last year, on Dec. 27, 2021, an NFT called &#x201C;Mega&#x201D; sold for 888 ether which was worth $3.6 million at the time. Furthermore, on the same day, Cryptopunk #9137 sold for 310 ether or $1.21 million at the time of sale.</p>

<p>Dappradar <a href="https://dappradar.com/hub/assets/eth/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb/9137">stats</a> indicate that Cryptopunk #9137 is now worth anywhere between 63.95 ether or $77,995 (Cryptopunks&#x2019; current floor), or 377.24 ether or $460K (Dappradar estimates). Last year&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211217065656/https://nftpricefloor.com/">archived data</a> from nftpricefloor.com indicates that the floor value of a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT was around 87.5 ether. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> was also trading for $4K per unit at that time, which means 87.5 ether was around $350,000 at the time.</p>

<p>A Cryptopunk could be purchased for 65 ether on Dec. 19, 2021, and its value at that time measured in U.S. dollars was around $260K. Sales recorded on Dec. 25, 2022 are a completely different story, as current <a href="https://nftpricefloor.com/">statistics</a> from nftpricefloor.com show a BAYC can be purchased for 69.88, which is worth roughly $85,159 using today&#x2019;s ether exchange rates.</p>

<p>A cryptopunk NFT purchased at the current floor value on Dec. 25, 2022, will cost 63.95 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> or around $77K in USD value. GT data also shows that interest in the term &#x201C;Bored Ape Yacht Club,&#x201D; has declined a great deal as well since last year. Last year, during the week of Dec. 26, 2021 &#x2013; Jan. 1, 2022, the search term &#x201C;Bored Ape Yacht Club,&#x201D; had a score of around 50, and by the week of Jan. 16 &#x2013; Jan. 22, 2022, the search term hit 100.</p>

<p>Today, the BAYC-related search term is down to a score of 10, which is a considerable drop in overall interest since last year. Similarly, this week China dominates in terms of BAYC interest and the country is followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, and Australia. GT data related to other blue chip NFTs like Cryptopunks, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and others have also seen GT search interest drop a great deal.</p>

Bitcoin remained marginally above a key support point at $16,800, whilst ethereum remained near a ceiling at the $1,230 mark. Overall, the global crypto market is up 0.20% as of writing.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) remained slightly above a ceiling at the $16,800 level to start the week, as markets remained mostly unchanged following the Christmas weekend.</p>
<p>Trading volume typically slows down during the holiday period, with most financial markets shutting down.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets however remained open, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD moving closer to recapturing the $17,000 level.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, Bitcoin hit a high of $16,908.86 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which is marginally above Sunday&#x2019;s low of $16,755.25.</p>
<p>The move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved closer to a key ceiling at 49.00.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at the 47.55 mark, with bulls likely to continue to push towards the aforementioned resistance level.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) mostly consolidated on Monday, with prices continuing to trade below the $1,230 point.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,203.72 on Christmas Day, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to a peak of $1,222.61 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, ethereum continued to trade below its key resistance level of $1,230 for a sixth straight day.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the failure to break out of this point comes as the RSI continued to hover near a resistance of its own at 48.00</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 47.33, which comes after two weeks of residing under the 48.00 mark.</p>
<p>Despite this, the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) has begun to move closer to its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could mean an upward cross is pending in the coming days.</p>

The man says he donated the digital cash stolen from the illicit website to an organization delivering humanitarian aid across his war-torn homeland.</strong></p>
<h2>Wisconsin Resident With Ukrainian Roots Hacks Russian Dark Web Market Solaris</h2>
<p>Ukrainian-born cyber intelligence expert Alex Holden, who left Kyiv as a teenager in the 1980s and now lives in Mequon, Wisconsin, claims he has hacked into Solaris, one of Russia&#x2019;s largest online drug markets, Forbes informs in a report.</p>
<p>Supported by his team at Hold Security, he was able to get hold of some of the bitcoin sent to dealers and the darknet site&#x2019;s owners. The cryptocurrency, worth over $25,000, was later transferred to Enjoying Life, a charitable foundation based in the Ukrainian capital.</p>
<p>Without revealing exactly how he did it, Holden explained he took control of much of the internet infrastructure behind Solaris, including some administrator accounts, obtained the website&#x2019;s source code and a database of its users and drop off locations for drug deliveries.</p>
<p>For a while, the Ukrainian and his colleagues also gained access to the &#x201C;master wallet&#x201D; of the marketplace. It was used by buyers and dealers to deposit and withdraw funds and operated as the platform&#x2019;s crypto exchange, the article details.</p>
<p>Given the rapid turnover, the wallet rarely had more than 3 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at a time. Holden managed to appropriate 1.6 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and send it to Enjoying Life. Hold Security donated another $8,000 to the charity, which provides assistance to people affected by the war in Ukraine.</p>

<h2>Solaris Linked to &#x2018;Patriotic&#x2019; Russian Hacking Collective Killnet</h2>
<p>The darknet market Solaris is suspected of having connections to the hacking crew Killnet, which after Moscow launched its invasion in late February became one of Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;patriotic&#x201D; hacker groups vowing to target Ukrainians and their supporters.</p>
<p>Killnet has also conducted a number of attacks in the U.S., including on airport and state government websites as well as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. It reportedly hit the Eurovision song contest, the Estonian government and Italy&#x2019;s National Health Institute.</p>
<p>The group was also blamed for attacking Rutor, the main rival of Solaris, which became Russia&#x2019;s leading underground drugs market after Hydra was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/germany-shuts-down-hydra-market-seizes-servers-and-bitcoin/">shut down</a> this past spring. According to U.S. cybersecurity firm Zerofox, Solaris was paying Killnet for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DDoS</a> services.</p>
<p>Besides the battlefield, Russia and Ukraine have also clashed in the online space, with the government in Kyiv recruiting experts for its own cyberforce. The special unit was tasked to identify and prevent Russian attacks but also hack back.</p>
<p>Hits such as those on Russia&#x2019;s largest bank, Sber, and the Moscow Stock Exchange have been attributed to the Ukrainian IT army. Social media accounts associated with the hacktivist collective Anonymous took responsibility for many other <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/anonymous-claims-it-has-released-28gb-of-bank-of-russia-documents/">attacks</a>.</p>

Seychelles, December 26, 2022</strong> &#x2013; Leading global cryptocurrency exchange, Bitget launches &#x201C;<a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603775836">MegaSwap</a>&#x201C;, a new feature on its platform that enable the platform&#x2019;s users to trade or swap their digital assets for over 10,000 cryptocurrencies on a DeFi environment. With a MegaSwap account, users can gain access to trade through eight influential chains and 10 important DEXs while staying on Bitget&#x2019;s platform. The feature bridges the freedom and variety of DeFi with the security and convenience of CeFi, enabling users to enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>While CEX users enjoy secured trading experiences with diversified products and services, DEXs are also gaining increasing traction amongst investors who want to get a hold of a more variety of tokens fast. However, trading on DEXs is not for everyone. Due to the knowledge barrier and the lack of protection with assets stored on DeFi wallets, many users are deterred from getting involved with DEXs. In light of this, MegaSwap is designed to satisfy users with the demand for trading in convenience and safety, while enjoying asset variety and high liquidity at the same time, allowing users to integrate a centralized trading experience in DeFi marketplaces.</p>
<p>Users only have to activate the MegaSwap account with a few clicks to unlock the function of trading over 10,000 cryptocurrencies on 10 leading DEXs, such as Uniswap, Pancake, Curve, Sushiswap, and more. Empowered by the variety of DEXs, MegaSwap is equipped with the best options for liquidity pools out there. The feature currently supports transactions on eight different chains, including <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, BSC, Polygon, OP, Fantom, Klay, HECO and OEC. With the assistance of MegaSwap, users can complete cross-chain swaps effortlessly and straightforwardly in one place.</p>
<p>Aside from combining the advantages of CEX and DEX, MegaSwap even further smoothens the trading experience by streamlining payment of gas fees. Compared to normal DeFi trading, where traders have to prepare different chain-native tokens to pay for gas fees incurred from the transactions, MegaSwap automatically converts gas fees from stablecoin balances in the user&#x2019;s accounts, allowing users to trade with minimum effort.</p>
<p><strong>Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, says,</strong> &#x201C;MegaSwap is an important step taken by Bitget in building a safe, dynamic and robust one-stop trading experience to reach the critical mass. Facing fluctuation and uncertainty in recent trading markets, we observe that users and investors long for the protection of assets without sacrificing convenience and performance. And MegaSwap provides the right solution to connect the dots, which enables users to enjoy the upsides of DEX and the heightened protection covered by Bitget&#x2019;s platform. We value offering users a variety of options and liquidity, and at the same time, pair with our top-notch security measures and risk management, including hot and cold wallet separation, multi-signature wallet, Zero Trust security architecture and a lot more to protect users&#x2019; assets. &#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Gracy adds, </strong>&#x201C;DeFi has become a crucial element of this ever-evolving crypto space, and is also playing a part in enriching asset variety and diversifying the crypto ecosystem with CeFi. We aim to be the portal that seamlessly connects CeFi and DeFi with MegaSwap, as we actively listen to our community and users to cater to changing market needs and keep ourselves on top of market trends.&#x201D;</p>

The institution issued a new set of rules that allows financial investment funds to invest in cryptocurrency tokens with the equivalent protections offered to other investment assets such as stocks and bonds, opening new markets for these companies.</strong></p>
<h2>Brazilian Securities Commission CVM Regulates Cryptocurrency Investment for Funds</h2>
<p>Brazil has given one more step for the regularization and adoption of cryptocurrencies as investment instruments. The Brazilian Securities Commission has <a href="https://valor.globo.com/financas/noticia/2022/12/23/cvm-abre-possibilidade-de-fundos-investirem-em-criptoativos.ghtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> a new set of rules that now allow established funds to invest in cryptocurrency, opening a new market for these institutions.</p>
<p>The norms, which were passed after President Jair Bolsonaro <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/president-of-brazil-sanctions-cryptocurrency-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sanctioned</a> a cryptocurrency law last week, regulate crypto investments in a way in which these companies will be able to enjoy the same protections available for other investment assets such as stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>The approved framework explicitly requires that operations with cryptocurrency must be conducted on exchanges approved by the Central Bank of Brazil or by the CVM in the country. If these are made offshore, the investments will have to be overseen by a local supervisor.</p>
<p>In any way, these institutions &#8220;will have legal competence to supervise and inspect the operations carried out, including with regard to curbing abusive practices in the market, as well as money laundering and financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, not every asset will be allowed to enter the portfolio of these funds, as these will have to fall into the categories outlined in the newly approved crypto law.</p>

<h2>Adoption and Regulation Evolves</h2>
<p>The issuance of this new framework just days after the sanction of the cryptocurrency law in the country shows that institutions in Brazil are eager to regularize the status of these assets in several areas. The Brazilian Securities Commission itself executed a pivot, having denied the opportunity for funds to invest in cryptocurrencies back in 2018.</p>
<p>However, the commission changed this law months later to allow funds to invest in crypto offshore, although indirectly. Brazil has shown a significant level of adoption of crypto both by citizens and companies. According to numbers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazilian-companies-break-crypto-purchasing-records-again-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> by the Brazilian tax authority (RFB), almost 42,000 companies purchased cryptocurrency during October, breaking purchasing records.</p>
<p>The same purchasing record, but for individuals, was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazilian-tax-authority-rfb-registers-new-record-of-almost-1-5-million-brazilians-investing-in-crypto-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> during September when almost 1.5 million people purchased crypto. Due to this popularity, several traditional and digital institutions have started or will be offering cryptocurrency services in the country, including Nubank, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazilian-bank-itau-unibanco-to-offer-cryptocurrency-custody-services-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Itau</a>, and Santander, and even a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-could-launch-its-defi-integrated-digital-real-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital</a> version of the real, the fiat currency of Brazil, is also in the works.</p>

The reasons for this fall, besides the abundance of pesos due to holiday-related payments, and the battle between President Alberto Fernandez and Argentine courts.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentine Peso Falls Sharply Against the US Dollar</h2>
<p>The Argentine peso is facing a sudden downturn that has taken the value of the currency to historic lows. On Dec. 23, local media <a href="https://www.clarin.com/economia/economia-de-no-ficcion/dolar-blue-pega-nuevo-salto-impulsado-turbulencias-politicas_0_8M7jNJ40FC.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">informed</a> one of the informal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-introduces-new-exchange-rates-to-the-mix-qatar-and-coldplay-dollars-go-against-imfs-warnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exchange rates</a> of the currency vs the U.S. dollar, denominated &#8220;blue dollar,&#8221; had reached the 340 pesos mark. This marks a 5-month low after a period in which the peso maintained its value relatively steady.</p>
<p>The last time that the peso plunged in this way was in July when the country was also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-runs-to-stablecoins-amidst-political-and-economic-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submerged</a> in a period of political instability with the resignation of Finance Minister Martin Guzman. The historical minimum exchange rate is 350 pesos per U.S. dollar, reached in June.</p>
<p>Analysts have proposed several explanations for this situation, including the occurrence of the holiday seasons when more pesos are in the street and Argentines run to hedge their savings in foreign currency. However, other political factors are also present at this time.</p>

<h2>Political and Financial Instability</h2>
<p>President Alberto Fernandez decided to ignore a decision taken by the maximum justice tribunal of the country, that would give a bigger percentage to the city of Buenos Aires from taxes collected at a provincial level. The tribunal ordered the national government to deliver 2.95% of these taxes to the city on Dec. 21.</p>
<p>This has spurred a climate of legal uncertainty that, according to some analysts, is affecting the value of the Argentine peso, and will continue to affect it in the future. This decision lifts worries on other flanks too, former Finance secretary Miguel Kiguel explains. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is logical that questions arise about the fulfillment of the contracts. If the Government does not comply with the ruling of the Supreme Court, the question of what is fulfilled and what is not opens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This battle affects the credibility and investors in the country must also hedge their savings in U.S. dollars, which in turn causes these sudden disruptions in the exchange rate. Venezuela is another country that is also facing severe <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-currency-plunges-almost-40-against-the-us-dollar-analysts-cite-crypto-drought-as-part-of-the-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difficulties</a> with its fiat currency, which has reached an exchange rate of almost 18 bolivares per U.S. dollar, one of the highest in its history.</p>
