<p class="s6">The cryptocurrency market continues to experience significant volatility, with two of the top 100 cryptos, &nbsp;Mask Network (MASK) and ApeCoin (APE), declining. These tokens&rsquo; price fluctuations persist in a negative direction, leaving investors hoping for a potential rebound soon.</p>
<p class="s6">In contrast, the Uwerx presale generates increasing excitement as it maintains an upward trend. This cryptocurrency project aims to make a remarkable contribution to the freelance economy, attracting bullish sentiment from investors. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in these crypto projects recently.</p>
ApeCoin (APE) Is Fueling the Next Metaverse Evolution
<p class="s6">Launched by Yuga Labs in March 2022, ApeCoin (APE) is the backbone for incentivizing and powering activities within the ApeCoin network. Notably, ApeCoin (APE) has emerged as the leading metaverse token in terms of market capitalization.</p>
<p class="s6">A key milestone for ApeCoin (APE) has been the introduction of staking, enabling users to lock a portion of their ApeCoin (APE) holdings and participate in transaction validation.</p>
<p class="s6">With its attractive features, ApeCoin (APE) has garnered significant popularity. Users benefit from low transaction fees, ensuring cost-effective transactions. The network also offers instant transaction processing, enhancing the overall user experience. Moreover, ApeCoin (APE) seamlessly integrates with popular gaming platforms, further driving its appeal in the metaverse space.</p>
<p class="s6">As the metaverse continues to evolve and gain traction, ApeCoin (APE) stands out as a prominent player, fueling the virtual ecosystem and offering a range of benefits to its users. However, ApeCoin (APE) has steadily declined over the last 30 days. As of writing, ApeCoin(APE) is up by 1.5%. However, it is down by 14% in the last 30 days, with its 24-hour trading volume decreasing by 16.86%.</p>
MASK Network (MASK): Powering The Revolution of Social Apps
<p class="s6">MASK Network (MASK) is an encrypted social messaging platform enabling secure crypto transactions and file-sharing. Its native token, $MASK, facilitates crypto transfers, grants access to platform features, and allows participation in community voting. </p>
<p class="s6">Recently, MASK Network (MASK) has been in the news. MASK Network (MASK) recently revealed its 3rd Web3 Social Grant round, collaborating with Gitcoin and offering a $50k matching pool. They have also sponsored Decentralized Social Afternoons to foster a vibrant community. </p>
<p class="s6">In addition, MASK Network (MASK) invested in Telegram's TON, aiming to provide innovative solutions to a broad user base. Furthermore, they received 257,540 ARB tokens from Arbitrum, distributing them to incentivize active community members and support the Mask DAO treasury.</p>
<p class="s6">However, MASK Network&rsquo;s (MASK) price has recently declined. The token is down by 2% as of writing. Its 24-hour trading volume has also slumped by 14.83%.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale Continues to Surge
<p class="s6">Uwerx, an innovative cryptocurrency platform for freelancers and clients, is gaining traction with its exciting services and 1% flat fee. </p>
<p class="s6">Having already secured audit approval from SolidProof and InterFi, Uwerx is currently in its stage 5 presale, moving past stage 1 to 4 within a few weeks while selling millions of WERX tokens. As a result of the rapid success of Uwerx's presale, the Uwerx team adjusted its token allocation, with the presale getting a boosted 57% (427.5 million WERX tokens) of the 700 million total token supply. The team has also announced that the stage 5 presale is set to go live soon. </p>
<p class="s6">Furthermore, the native token, WERX, is currently priced at $0.041, experiencing significant growth from its starting price of $0.005. Industry experts are highly optimistic about the future of the Uwerx token, predicting it to surpass $3 by Q1 2024. </p>
<p class="s6">However, Uwerx is achieving more success in other areas of the project. Excitingly, the anticipated Alpha Version of the platform has been launched, featuring the landing page and sign-in/sign-up pages. Additional features such as login, user dashboard, job posting, job search, and more will continue to be rolled out weekly/bi-weekly. Transition to the Beta version will follow soon, allowing users to test the new platform. Users can provide valuable feedback by emailing feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx has also introduced a new feature called the Uwerx Vault, enabling users to stake their tokens for a preferred duration and earn rewards. As of writing, Uwerx has obtained 5,546 sign-ups and 1,627 and 1,456 followers on Twitter and Telegram, respectively.</p>
<p class="s6">Initially planned to be locked for 25 years after the presale, the developer's liquidity tokens will be locked sooner after 82.8% of the Uwerx community votes in its favor. Details regarding the lock date will be announced shortly. Additionally, 92.8% of the Uwerx community has approved a test airdrop to validate user wallet addresses.</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx team also plans to renounce ownership of smart contracts upon listing on centralized exchanges, highlighting their commitment to decentralization. With the recent price increase, Uwerx is nearing its proposed $0.095 to $0.115 launch price as the presale is set to close on July 31, 2023.
