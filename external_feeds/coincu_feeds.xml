<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Since the Shanghai upgrade, it seems that investors are still interested in staking Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>The number of addresses holding more than 1 ETH hit a one-month high</em>.</li>



<li><em>The rise in active deposits seems to be linked to the introduction of a new memecoin named PEPE.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following Shanghai&#8217;s execution last month, the network has shown that the majority of Ethereum aficionados are still keen to begin staking. The proof is that the number of addresses holding over 1 ETH has hit a new 30-day high.</strong></h5>

<p>Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding more than 1 Ethereum reached 1,750,726, a new one-month high.</p>

<p>ETH&#8217;s price is currently trading at $1,890. However, a day earlier, the $2000 level was tested again.</p>

<p>When the dust has cleared from Ethereum&#8217;s historic Shanghai upgrade, it&#8217;s time to examine some of the main staking lessons. With the Shanghai update, Ethereum investors may finally withdraw their assets from the mainnet. Some have been expecting to do so since December 2020, when the staking option was first offered.</p>



<p>For over a year, Ethereum pricing has struggled to close above a critical resistance level, and it is now trying to do so again after failing to do so earlier this month. This important psychological threshold is also linked to approximately 24% of the total circulating quantity of ETH, making a breach much more significant.</p>



<p>PEPE, a new memecoin, has resulted in an increase in Ethereum active deposits, with traders transferring their winnings into ETH, possibly pushing the price past $2,000 if the wave continues.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/R2c7gez4__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santiment</a> chart, an intriguing trend has occurred. The data revealed a significant increase in active deposits inside the network, revealing a pattern that began on 3 May. Nonetheless, it peaked on the 4th and 5th of May, reaching heights not seen since November 2021.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="347" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205-1024x347.png" alt="The Number Of Ethereum Wallets Holding More Than 1 Coin Hits A New 30-Day High" class="wp-image-185722" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205-1024x347.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205-300x102.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205-768x260.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205-1536x520.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205-2048x694.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205-750x254.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-205-1140x386.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The Number Of Ethereum Wallets Holding More Than 1 Coin Hits A New 30-Day High 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Source: Santiment</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Such optimism is crucial for recovery and may have been a driving factor in the ETH price approaching $2,000. Nonetheless, some selling by 100,000 to 1 million ETH holders has been detected in the recent week. Retail holders, on the other hand, have only begun selling after ETH collapsed last month.</p>



<p>Yet, since $2,000 is a major psychological support level, it would almost definitely generate enough bullishness to start investors moving.</p>

<li><em>Asheesh Birla, a Ripple Board Member, has remarked on Coinbase&#8217;s recent moves.</em></li>



<li><em>He claimed that the exchange is evolving from a cryptocurrency exchange to a cryptocurrency-enabled banking business.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinbase, on the other hand, indicated that it is committed to improving the financial system.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Former RippleNet general manager Asheesh Birla said that Coinbase is evolving from a cryptocurrency exchange to a banking institution that accepts cryptocurrencies.</strong></h5>

<p>Birla said that Coinbase&#8217;s purpose had been changed in order to develop a crypto economy that would be a more fair, efficient, accessible, and transparent financial system for digital assets. Coinbase, on the other hand, indicated in a blog that it is committed to collaborating with high-level authorities in both US and non-US nations to upgrade the financial system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">7/ With trust in traditional banking eroding, is the timing right for institutions and consumers to turn to alternatives? <a href="https://t.co/yOjIXcnJP8" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/yOjIXcnJP8</a></p>&mdash; Asheesh Birla (@ashgoblue) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashgoblue/status/1654570027486674946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 5, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Coinbase&#8217;s most recent objective is to create the crypto economy, which is a more equitable, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system driven by cryptocurrency. The exchange, on the other hand, indicated that it is committed to working with high-level authorities in both US and non-US nations to upgrade the banking system.</p>



<p>According to Coinbase&#8217;s first-quarter 2023 financial report, deposit income from interest, blockchain incentives, and custody fees now make up the majority of the company&#8217;s revenue. Birla said that the interest earned on USDC deposits alone generates $199 million, accounting for 18% of its total earnings.</p>



<p>According to Arkhamâ€™s recent report, Circle <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1654801359714041861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minted</a> 140 million USDC and transferred it to the exchange on behalf of a large buyer.</p>



<p>The compnay&#8217;s income is gradually migrating from consumers to high-margin institutional customers, with institutional trading revenue increasing 67% year on year. Coinbase also profits from bank-like revenue that is less reliant on the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has won the first court round against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in order to get regulatory clarity surrounding digital asset trading. In the midst of this victory, it also announced the creation of an international exchange trading Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) perpetual futures, confusing consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle&#8217;s USDC is still showing less attractiveness after being affected by the collapse of SVB.</em></li>



<li><em>The circulation of the stablecoin continues to drop $400 million in the past week.</em></li>



<li><em>Its rival, USDT, is still dominating the market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle has enough reserves in its treasury to support its stablecoin USDC. Notwithstanding the belief in its stablecoin, USDC underperformed.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-1024x640.png" alt="Circle USDC Continues Circulation Fall After March Crisis" class="wp-image-185710" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-1024x640.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-300x188.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-768x480.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-1536x961.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-2048x1281.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-750x469.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-1140x713.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Circle USDC Continues Circulation Fall After March Crisis 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to official data, in the past 7 days, Circle issued a total of $600 million in USDC and redeemed $1 billion in USDC, and the circulation decreased by about $400 million. As of May 4, the total circulation of USDC was $30.1 billion, and the reserve was $30.2 billion, including $4.8 billion in cash and $25.4 billion in short-term US treasury bonds.</p>



<p>USDC&#8217;s substantial reserves, which include a large amount in short-term US Treasury bonds, may help reassure consumers that their holdings are backed by dependable and safe assets.</p>



<p>Circle generated 140 million USDC yesterday and transferred it to Coinbase on behalf of a significant buyer, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">gm<br><br>Some big moves last night!<br><br>Circle minted $140M USDC, transferring it to Coinbase on behalf of a big buyer.<br><br>Also, the Ethereum Foundation transferred 15K ETH, or about $30M, to Kraken.<br><br>They still hold over 320K ETH. <a href="https://t.co/KEkPpQYsRZ" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/KEkPpQYsRZ</a></p>&mdash; Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1654801359714041861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>USDC Coin was the most troubled stablecoin when its Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) holdings failed. Notwithstanding the challenges that USDC has experienced, Circle, the stablecoin&#8217;s issuer, has continued to profit from its development.</p>



<p>Despite demonstrating reserves, USDC&#8217;s market worth continued to fall. At the time of publication, USDT was eroding the former&#8217;s market share. Currently, the circulating supply of USDT is still leading the stablecoin market with over $82.2 billion. Compared to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDT</a>, USDC is quite modest with more than 30 billion dollars but it is still the 2nd stablecoin.</p>



<p>If the US government acts quickly and offers more clarification on the stablecoin area, the market may improve.</p>



<p>Yet, as of press time, interest in USDC has continued to fall. Fresh addresses lost interest in the stablecoin as well. This was shown by the stablecoin&#8217;s decreased network expansion over the previous month.</p>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cryptocurrencies have been included in the White House&#8217;s newest list of emerging technologies.

<p>In a statement issued Thursday, the White House said that the plan intends to boost technology for consumer protection as well as U.S. leadership and competitiveness in worldwide standard-setting. According to the statement, universal standards guarantee that technology stays consistent in terms of security.</p>



<p>According to the paper, the federal government would prioritize digital identity infrastructure and distributed ledger technologies, which are having an expanding influence on a variety of vital economic sectors. Biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors are also on the list.</p>



<p>The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185181-white-house-taxing-crypto-mining-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a Digital Asset Mining Excise (DAME) on cryptocurrency mining companies on Tuesday. The CEA said that if enacted, it would levy a 30% tax on miners&#8217; power expenses to cover economic and environmental consequences. The idea has riled the sector.</p>



<p>Although other energy-intensive enterprises would not be subject to the new levy, the CEA claims that crypto mining does not produce the same local and national economic advantages as firms that use comparable quantities of power.</p>



<p>Apart from environmental issues, the government claims that digital asset mining has a disproportionate effect on communities of color due to pollution and pushes up renewable energy prices.</p>



<p>Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, Cipher Mining, Greenidge Generation, BitDeer, and CleanSpark are among the major mining companies in the United States. According to Bitcoin mining outfit Riot, the tax would relegate the United States to leader place in the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Wu reported that upon analyzing the holding addresses of many PEPE tokens, it had been discovered that many early purchasers possessed Milady NFT. One multisig wallet, in particular, manages 6.9% of the total PEPE supply, with its earliest ETH transaction originating from an address that holds a significant amount of Milady&#8217;s sister project, Remilio. </p>



<p>During the early stages of PEPE&#8217;s growth, the NFT community and Chinese investors in Dubai joined forces to purchase PEPE, ultimately becoming the primary driving force behind its early success.</p>

<p>On May 7, DeFi protocol DEUS tweeted an update on the progress of the DEI stablecoin security breach. All contracts are currently suspended, and on-chain DEI tokens are destroyed to prevent further disruption.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today:<br>We are currently in the process of comprehending the actual backing of DEI tokens. To achieve this, snapshots of all DEI balances are taken before the tokens are burnt.<br>After evaluating all balances, we will formulate a comprehensive recovery and redemption plan.</p>&mdash; DEUS (@DeusDao) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeusDao/status/1654808613934989312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The team is currently learning about DEI&#8217;s solid support. To achieve this, a snapshot of all DEI balances is taken before tokens are burned. After assessing all balances, a comprehensive collection and redemption plan will be developed. For users having trouble trying to arbitrage after the hack, there will be an assessment, and they may be allowed to reverse those trades as soon as possible.</p>



<p>This action will involve recording the DEI in circulation and adding support from all other users. DEUS advises users to be patient and only interact with an existing DEI contract once a specific redemption plan is in place.</p>



<p>In addition, DEUS states that it will not take any legal action if the funds are returned. This event will be considered a white hat rescue, and 20% of the money will be awarded as a bug bounty. The team also confirmed that the multi-signature on the BSC chain is controlled by the DEUS team. The team will publicly confirm the receipt of the funds.</p>



<p>DEI stablecoin token<a href="https://news.coincu.com/185587-deus-finances-stablecoin-dei-was-hacked-token-price-drop-more-than-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was hacked </a>and lost $1. The token was recently pegged at $0.30 and lost that peg during the attack. The cause of the attack was discovered to be a fundamental technical problem in the token contract, and this also led to a drop in the protocol&#8217;s DEUS token by more than 30%.</p>



<p>Before that, in May of last year, the ecosystem <a href="https://news.coincu.com/89239-deus-stablecoin-loses-its-dollar-peg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hit</a> by two flash loan attacks in the past two months, resulting in a loss of more than $30 million.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Six of the top ten memecoin PEPE holding addresses are cryptocurrency exchange hot wallet addresses.</em></li>



<li><em>Exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Huobi, MEXC, KuCoin, and Gate are said to have whales holding large amounts of this memecoin.</em></li>



<li><em>It has created a fever for investors with the return of the memecoin wave, causing its trading volume to skyrocket.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PEPE&#8217;s market valuation surpassed $1 billion after its launch in Binance&#8217;s Innovation Zone and saw trading volume skyrocket. However, the majority of coins <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6982508145454Ce325dDbE47a25d4ec3d2311933#balances" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held</a> by the top 10 wallet addresses come mainly from whales on exchanges.</strong></h5>

<p>Etherscan data shows that among the top 10 holding addresses of memecoin PEPE, 6 are hot wallet addresses of cryptocurrency exchanges. Among them, Binance, OKX, Huobi, MEXC, KuCoin, and Gate ranked 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, and 9th, respectively, and the memecoin held by these addresses accounted for about 17.23% of the total issuance.</p>



<p>Pepecoin is a new coin meme created on the Ethereum network, inspired by the famous internet green frog meme of the same name. The memecoin also specifically states on its website that PEPE is a memecoin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no official team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and is for entertainment purposes only.</p>



<p>Yet after just four days, Pepecoin has increased more than 500 times, with over 25,000 transactions taking place for this unit. This memecoin was also highlighted as a top Twitter search term. From there, we can plainly understand the market&#8217;s FOMO with not just PEPE but also memecoin.</p>



<p>It is well known that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185623-pepecoin-memecoin-market-warning-rings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pepecoin</a> not only provides fresh wind to the market but has also generated record-high profits for certain early investors.</p>



<p>As of this writing, the memecoin exchanged hands at $0.00000257, with an over 30% decrease in trading volume within the last 24 hours. Increased trading following its addition to Binanceâ€™s Innovation Zone pushed its daily trading volume to an all-time high of $2.76 billion, per data from <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/sZjBCGjN__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santiment</a>.</p>

<p>The popularity of PEPE has made its profits skyrocket. Its market cap soared past $1 billion in just a few weeks of its launch, leaving investors strongly intrigued despite <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185623-pepecoin-memecoin-market-warning-rings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warnings</a> of an impending crash.</p>



<p>Besides, with the recent popularity of Memecoin, several honeypot tokens with the same name as Memecoin have appeared. 0xBcâ€¦8Faa has issued many popular Tokens of the same name, such as PEPE, POGAI, TURBO, etc, on Arbitrum for profit.</p>



<p>The basic method is to push these Tokens of the same name to the top position in custodian platforms like Dex Screener and DexTools through swiping trading volume and adding more liquidity, attracting users to buy and then sell a large number of Reserved Tokens when the price rises to a certain extent break the market to make a profit.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Evening Standard newspaper has collaborated with artist Trevor Jones to create a commemorative NFT for King Charles&#8217; coronation.</em></li>



<li><em>This artwork depicts St. Edward&#8217;s Crown, the centerpiece of the United Kingdom&#8217;s Royal Jewels.</em></li>



<li><em>The non-fungible token is currently accessible for free on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Evening Standard <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/evening-standard-trevor-jones-nft-king-charles-coronation-b1078759.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> on May 5 that it would be issuing a series of free non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to honor King Charles&#8217; coronation.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187.png"><img decoding="async" width="429" height="1024" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-429x1024.png" alt="The Evening Standard To Issue The Free Coronation NFT Of King Charles" class="wp-image-185664" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-429x1024.png 429w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-126x300.png 126w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-768x1832.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-644x1536.png 644w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-858x2048.png 858w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-750x1789.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" title="The Evening Standard To Issue The Free Coronation NFT Of King Charles 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>The collectible NFT features an animated version of Trevor Jones&#8217; &#8220;The Oath.&#8221; The centerpiece of the UK&#8217;s Crown Jewels, St. Edward&#8217;s Crown, is seen in this picture.</p>



<p>In the Nifty Gateway marketplace, the non-fungible token is now accessible for free. Users simply need to enter an email address to register and collect the item, however it is unclear if a transaction charge is required to obtain the item.</p>



<p>The NFT is &#8220;open edition,&#8221; which means there is no restriction to how many NFTs may be issued. As of 11:30 p.m. UTC on May 5, users have minted 9,200 copies of the NFT.</p>



<p>Since there is no restriction to the number of NFTs that may be issued, there is a time constraint. The token may only be minted between Thursday, May 4, and Sunday, May 7.</p>



<p>Jones started The Oath NFT as a physical artwork at his Edinburgh studio. The artwork portrays Queen Elizabeth II wearing Saint Edward&#8217;s Crown during her coronation in 1953.</p>



<p>The Oath is not the first NFT coin to honor the British royal family. After the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September, an NFT collection, QueenE, by Web3 builders Fabio SevÃ¡, Vincius Rodrigues, Everton Matumoto, and the pseudonymous mladen.eth, was published to commemorate the life of England&#8217;s longest reigning queen (1952-2022).</p>



<p>The event marks a major UK company&#8217;s entry into the crypto space. The Evening Standard was the fourth biggest daily publication in the United Kingdom by circulation in 2020, after only The Metro, The Sun, and The Daily Mail. In January 2023, it distributed about 314,000 papers every day.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Oath,&#8221; created in partnership with Apollo NFT, may be claimed immediately via Nifty Gateway or by a QR code printed in the newspaper. The QR codes are also shown on billboards along Oxford Street for individuals who want to attend the festivities in person. Nevertheless, before you get too excited, keep in mind that the NFTs will not be minted and handed to collectors&#8217; wallets until May 7.</p>

<p>The bill, known as <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/HB04903I.pdf#navpanes=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HB4903</a>, was presented on March 10 by Representative Mark Dorazio and had 42 sponsors. It is now being considered by the House State Affairs Committee before being voted on by the House.</p>



<p>If passed, the state government would establish an electronic infrastructure enabling users to trade and pay with the digital currency, as well as conduct redemptions for the gold or tokens that support it.</p>



<p>According to the law, the state comptroller would create a digital currency that is backed by gold such that each unit of digital currency produced reflects a certain fraction of a troy ounce of gold held in trust. Similarly, the government will need to develop an electronic system that would enable people to freely deal with this money in order to make payments.</p>



<p>Currency redemptions will be conducted in physical or monetary form in gold, with the State Comptroller or a contracted third party handling the administration. The bill&#8217;s implementation is expected to cost the state $25 million in the case of a restricted system and up to $100 million in the case of a full transactional system.</p>



<p>Yet, the bill has gained grassroots support, as indicated by a 78-page document submitted on April 26 and signed by numerous Texas in favor of this tough money legislation.</p>



<p>In its current form, the bill establishes that the Texas state comptroller will provide custody of the gold backing the digital currency or that it can be assigned to a third party, who must maintain the same amount of gold as the digital currency&#8217;s issuance, making it a 100% backed digital currency.</p>
