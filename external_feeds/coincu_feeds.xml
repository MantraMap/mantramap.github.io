<p>Coinbase is adding new USDC-related and staking services for Singapore customers. The move comes as Coinbase is taking steps to strengthen its international presence in direct<a href="https://news.coincu.com/187671-sec-response-coinbase-petition-clear-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> response</a> to a crackdown by regulators in the United States, where the company is headquartered.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The message here is the world is sort of moving on with or without the US, and we are very committed as a global company to keep moving forward on international expansion,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Hassan Ahmed, country director for Singapore at Coinbase said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase received approval in principle as a major payment institution from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) last October. The company recently received a license to operate an international exchange in Bermuda, where it plans to offer derivatives trading.</p>

<p>Coinbase has announced that it will introduce free USDC purchases to customers using SGD, allow users to earn rewards for holding USDC on the platform, and roll out a USDC order book for experienced traders — allowing them to trade over 200 different assets. The company also provides ETH, SOL, ADA, ATOM, and XTZ staking services to clients in Singapore.</p>



<p>Ahead of the news on May 13, Coinbase established a global advisory committee to strengthen relationships with international strategic stakeholders.</p>

<p>At the end of last year, the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Ravi Menon said that the lion island nation wants to become a global hub for digital assets rather than just a place to trade and cryptocurrency speculation.</p>



<p>Accordingly, MAS has introduced many &#8220;strict regulations&#8221; to ensure businesses meet the right requirements and solve many possible risks in cryptocurrency transactions. This approach has helped Singapore attract many crypto firms, such as Binance Holdings and Gemini, to locate here.</p>



<p>According to experts, Singapore has many opportunities for the cryptocurrency market, as the island nation is known as one of the global financial centers.</p>

<p>Litecoin has seen significant growth over the past 30 days. Although currently on a downtrend, the project has gained almost 20% in the monthly rankings. This cryptocurrency strongly correlates with Bitcoin, which explains its recent growth.</p>



<p>Litecoin will soon have a few upgrades to the network. According to an official post, LTC upgrades include Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT), P2P support for Light Client, Viewing Key, Payment Proof, and Descriptor Wallet.</p>



<p>While the upcoming upgrades are all critical, the vital development around LTC is the halving that will occur on August 3, 2023. The halving is a networking event that happens every four years.</p>



<p>Most investors expect the Litecoin price to increase after the halving event, as the number of rewards will decrease, thus increasing demand. LTC price has recorded a gain of more than 6% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $93.0.</p>

<p>Litecoin $LTCUSD has surged above LMACD 1 million, while BTC and ETH are lagging behind. This is indicative of a more extensive timeframe momentum shift. Notice specifically when the histogram turns from red to green and vice versa.</p>

<p>Although Litecoin has recovered before Halving, to confirm the next bull run, many other factors need to be evaluated.</p>



<p>Historically, halvings have resulted in prices skyrocketing as supply decreases, leading to deflation. Since its introduction in October 2011, Litecoin&#8217;s supply has been cut in half twice. Its block reward was cut from 50 LTC to 25 LTC during the first halving, which took place in August 2015. In the second case, which occurred in August 2019, the 25 LTC reward was reduced to 12.5 LTC.</p>



<p>Each LTC price halving is usually very chaotic. This includes a significant price pump, a corresponding correction, a price low, and a local rally to the top.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The European Council has agreed on new regulations that expand tax reporting obligations to encompass crypto asset trades.</em></li>



<li><em>This ensures that funds are open on crypto exchanges with digital assets and offers a robust framework for the EU.</em></li>



<li><em>According to the report, tax authorities in the EU presently lack the information needed to monitor revenues from crypto assets, which are freely exchanged across borders.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Authorities throughout the globe are becoming concerned about the digital currency sector&#8217;s lack of regulation, although the European Union has already made efforts to safeguard investors.</strong></h5>

<p>The laws&#8217; scope was broadened to encompass crypto asset transfers on May 16 after the Council concluded it was time for an update to the rules controlling the information that must accompany currency transactions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We welcome the political agreement reached by EU Finance Ministers today on new tax transparency rules on the crypto-asset sector.<br><br>The Directive will improve EU countries&#39; ability to detect and counter tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance.<br><br>More info ↓</p>&mdash; European Commission (@EU_Commission) <a href="https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1658445756410331136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The European Council has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a> on new regulations that expand tax reporting obligations to encompass crypto asset trades. The Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) is the seventh iteration of a set of rules for automated information exchange between European governments for tax reasons.</p>



<p>This ensures that funds are available for crypto exchanges with digital assets and provides the EU with a solid framework that complies with the most stringent worldwide regulations for the exchange of digital currencies, ensuring that they are not used illegally. Sweden&#8217;s Finance Minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Today’s decision is bad news for those who have misused crypto-assets for their illegal activities, to circumvent EU sanctions, or to finance terrorism and war. Doing so will no longer be possible in Europe without exposure – it is an important step forward in the fight against money laundering.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since it is dependent on definitions specified in that law, DAC8 was suggested in December and authorized on May 16 after the passing of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). The new DAC follows the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and revisions to reporting criteria announced in October by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) under a G20 mandate.</p>



<p>The parliament of the 27-member EU passed the world&#8217;s first complete laws governing crypto assets, which include cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as tradable tokens whose value is safeguarded using blockchain technology, such as NFTs, last month.</p>



<p>Regardless of the overall amount of the cryptocurrency assets being exchanged, crypto asset service providers must now comply with new requirements that compel them to collect and make accessible particular information on the sender and receiver of all cryptocurrency asset transactions that they assist.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, EU economics and finance ministers agreed on regulations to pursue people who hide their money in places where tax authorities have no monitoring.</p>



<p>According to Svantesson, the laws would tighten loopholes that enable individuals to avoid paying taxes on their income by utilizing crypto assets.</p>



<p>This implies that crypto transfers may be traced, increasing the ability to detect potentially questionable transactions and preventing them from happening.</p>



<p>On July 20, 2021, the European Commission proposed this rule as part of a broader legislative package aimed at tightening anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) policies in the European Union.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to Justin Sun, Li Wei, the younger brother of Huobi founder Li Lin, should never have gotten millions of HT tokens for free, much alone profiting from them.</em></li>



<li><em>Sun went on to say that Wei has made no contributions to the HT community.</em></li>



<li><em>The value of HT tokens has plummeted in the last month.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Justin Sun, the inventor of Tron (TRX) and a Huobi shareholder, has <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1658413236360998913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a series of allegations against Li Wei, the brother of Huobi founder Li Lin, stating that he obtained Huobi&#8217;s native token (HT) abnormally at no cost and sold it for large sums of cash.</strong></h5>

<p>Sun stated today that Wei got the token when it was first released and that he has been consistently selling off and cashing out since April.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Li Wei has been consistently selling off these HT tokens and cashing out. Now, the HT DAO committee is stepping in to rectify this issue,&#8221; Sun said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sun indicates that Huobi intends to work with Wei to negotiate a reimbursement and arrange for the destruction of his remaining HT tokens. Not only will this move be a question of justice, but it will also serve the best interests of everyone in the HT DAO community, according to him.</p>



<p>Sun added that Wei should refund the USDT and that he should never have been awarded any HT. He went on to say that Wei has made no contributions to the HT community and that he is willing to reward individuals who have really contributed to the growth and development of the HT DAO.</p>



<p>Sun said that Wei began selling HT tokens last month and has sold 2.37 million HT for 7.45 million USDT, citing Huobi exchange statistics. When asked how many tokens Wei owns in total, Sun answered he didn&#8217;t know since it was a long time ago, but it was probably a few million HT.</p>



<p>Coincidentally, Huobi recently announced its stake sale, stating that the company&#8217;s controlling shareholder has decided to sell its stock to the M&amp;A fund of Hong Kong-based investment firm About Capital Management.</p>



<p>Although Huobi did not identify the controlling shareholder, the announcement came amid rumors that Lin was looking for a buyer for his over 60% ownership in the firm and was asking for at least $1 billion. The parameters of the arrangement with About Capital Management were not disclosed by Huobi.</p>



<p>The HT token has lost more than 40% of its value in the last seven days, but has rebounded by 1.23% as a result of Sun&#8217;s tweets.</p>

<p>The Dune Analytics dashboard <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2475283/4071939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> 130 withdrawal requests totaling 441,887 stETH. This sum is projected to rise dramatically, particularly after major organizations invested in Lido begin processing withdrawals.</p>



<p>According to a separate <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2478659/4077881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune Analytics</a> dashboard, the protocols successfully handled 19 withdrawals totaling 339 ETH.</p>



<p>Celsius has also begun removing ETH worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Lido Finance.</p>



<p>The revelations occurred only hours after the insolvent company transferred approximately $800 million in stETH and after the platform upgraded to facilitate such transfers. Celsius will get the underlying ETH in return for the stETH tokens once the funds are withdrawn.</p>



<p>According to blockchain statistics, Celsius has <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x4A87EcDfb459eb36d25226D9CCd7Ec4f684AB3Fc#tokentxns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> withdrawal requests for 240,000 stETH. Nevertheless, the corporation has not made any significant withdrawal demands from Lido.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/187577-lido-finance-v2-allowing-withdrawal-ether/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido</a> is mainly a platform for Ethereum liquid staking. It allows users to pool their assets to become Ethereum validators, avoiding the network&#8217;s requirement of depositing at least 32 ETH.</p>



<p>In April, Ethereum launched Shapella, a network improvement that allows for reward withdrawals from its staking contract. As a consequence, the PoS contract saw days when ETH withdrawals outpaced deposits.</p>



<p>The Ethereum PoS contract has over 20 million ETH as of May 16, highlighting the rising need for liquid staking service providers like Lido. The story most certainly boosted the price of its governance token, LDO.</p>



<p>In the days running up to the Lido v2 launch, its whales have also backed LDO&#8217;s upward trend. According to the data site Lookonchain, this might imply that the &#8220;buy the rumor&#8221; scenario led to the LDO price surge.</p>



<p>With redemptions now open, numerous experts believe the lender will be able to swap its stETH for ETH and utilize it to fund its restructuring strategy.</p>

<p>Cetus Protocol is a decentralized exchange (AMM DEX) using the Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) mechanism built on the Sui and Aptos ecosystems. Cetus is a permissionless DEX that allows any user to have access, create liquidity, and trade.</p>



<p>Users can experience the project by connecting e-wallets through Sui Chain or Aptos Chain.</p>



<p>Suia is a social network dApp that aims to build a distinct community based on openness, empowerment, and user interaction. Those with the same assets may engage with one another, participate in events, acquire artists&#8217; artwork, and explore the Suia ecosystem together, reinforcing the feeling of community.</p>



<p>Suia&#8217;s NFT Recommendations function, which uses wallet data to recommend NFTs to users based on their unique interests, is one of its most notable features. It works in the same way as TikTok&#8217;s algorithm, so if you like dancing, for example, you&#8217;ll be shown an increasing number of dance-related stuff. This will assist you in identifying NFTs that are more likely to pique your interest than others.</p>



<p>Suia&#8217;s main utility token is SUIA. SUIA tokens are primarily used for governance, allowing holders to vote on ideas on the project&#8217;s future and development, as well as giving them a say in airdrop prizes, the number of grants to distribute to development and strategic alliances, and adjusting the ecosystem&#8217;s parameters.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 26,000 Bitcoins (BTC) with a total value of around $800 million were removed from Coinbase, as indicated by data provided by Glassnode. This is the largest BTC withdrawal from an exchange so far this year, and it is also the greatest since December of 2022. An earlier investigation by Santiment found that the quantity of Bitcoin stored on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since December 2017, when it was 5.84%. This was the case.</p>



<p>It is possible that the failure of FTX, which at the time was one of the most successful exchanges on the market, played a significant role in this phenomenon. As a result, many users have lost faith in exchanges. In the event that the US defaults on its obligations, this blue-chip token might very well be among the top three assets.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187632-bitcoin-faces-major-obstacle-in-the-us/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) climbed to $27,500 after hitting a two-month bottom of $25,800; however, BTC witnessed a modest pullback earlier in the day. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been volatile over the past several days. Today. According to statistics provided by Binance, the price of one BTC is currently $27080 and has decreased by 1% over the course of the previous twenty-four hours.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that such large-scale movements of Bitcoin are not uncommon, and they often occur without causing much of a ripple in the market. However, the sheer size of this particular withdrawal has led to much discussion in the cryptocurrency community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding the identity and motives of the whale, the incident serves as a reminder of the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. As always, investors are advised to exercise caution and to be prepared for sudden swings in value that can have significant consequences for their portfolios.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Auradine, a blockchain-focused on privacy, has acquired $81 million in Series A investment backed by venture capital companies Celesta Capital and Mayfield.</em></li>



<li><em>According to the company, it is working on groundbreaking scalability, sustainability, and security solutions.</em></li>



<li><em>The sum raised is significant amid a protracted weak market that has slowed investment.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Auradine, a tech startup co-founded by a serial entrepreneur with a track record of developing billion-dollar companies, secured $81 million in its inaugural fundraising round to create next-generation online infrastructure.</strong></h5>

<p>Celesta Capital and Mayfield co-led the Series A financing, with Sriram Viswanathan, Celesta&#8217;s founding managing partner, and Navin Chaddha, Mayfield&#8217;s managing director, joining the Auradine board. Auradine reported Tuesday that other investors included Marathon Digital Holdings, Cota Capital, DCVC, and Stanford University.</p>



<p>The sum raised is significant amid a lengthy bear market, which has slowed investment in even crypto-adjacent enterprises.</p>



<p>Auradine, which was founded in 2022, is working on a wide spectrum of infrastructure, including energy-efficient silicon, zero-knowledge proofs, and artificial intelligence solutions for decentralized apps.</p>



<p>Auradine has also formed a board of strategic advisors and investors, which comprises top industry executives like Palo Alto Networks and Cavium co-founders. Moreover, the company has formed a technological advisory board comprised of experts from UC Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who are at the forefront of security and privacy research.</p>



<p>Auradine Co-Founder and CEO Rajiv Khemani <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/16/2670109/0/en/Auradine-Raises-81-Million-in-Series-A-Financing-for-Next-Generation-Web-Infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;With this funding, we will accelerate our development and go-to-market efforts to deliver breakthrough solutions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Auradine is Khemani&#8217;s fourth infrastructure-focused tech business. According to Khemani, his first company, NetBoost, was bought by Intel for $$225 million in 1999. Cavium, where he served as chief operations officer, was bought by Nasdaq-listed Marvell for $6 billion in 2018. Innovium, his third company, was likewise bought by Marvell in 2021 for more than 1.2 billion dollars.</p>



<p>Auradine plans to launch its first product this summer and will target customers in the financial and healthcare sectors, among others.</p>

<p>River is on a mission to promote an honest and resilient financial system by using Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s only incorruptible digital currency. River is a one-stop shop for everybody or any company interested in Bitcoin. </p>



<p>They provide a variety of Bitcoin services such as Bitcoin brokerage with no-fee recurring orders, full-reserve custody, mining, and a Bitcoin wallet that supports both on-chain and Lightning Network transactions &#8211; a Bitcoin scaling solution that settles transactions off-chain for faster speeds and lower fees.</p>



<p>River CEO Alex Leishman stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;It&#8217;s not fueled by hype. This year&#8217;s bank failures and bailouts have been a wake-up call, revealing the cracks of the traditional financial system and reminding us why Bitcoin is so important—it&#8217;s a secure path to a stronger and more transparent global economy. Adopting Bitcoin with a trusted partner is no longer the speculative choice, but rather the prudent one.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>River Lightning, an application programming interface (API) that makes it simpler for businesses to link their apps to the Lightning Network, was unveiled last October.</p>



<p>Companies may simply interface with the Lightning Network using the River Lightning API. The company has already taken over one of the most important participants in the Bitcoin payments environment; El Salvador&#8217;s Chivo wallet utilizes River for near-instant and near-free Bitcoin payments. The startup situated in San Francisco maintains one of the major Bitcoin lightning nodes, allowing payments and maintaining liquidity for the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p>



<p>Lightning transaction demand has increased dramatically in the previous year, reaching new highs in recent weeks as on-chain rates have risen. River aspires to act as the Bitcoin payments back-end for the sector, in addition to directly servicing consumers and companies.</p>



<p>According to the company, a portion of this round of money will be utilized to expand the B2B River Lightning sector.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Several crypto investors expressed their dismay on social media after Ledger released a recovery tool for their hardware crypto wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>According to the crypto wallet, the gadget only distributes encrypted shards of customers&#8217; seed phrases to multiple organizations if they want to utilize the recovery service.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The cryptocurrency hardware wallet Ledger has launched a very contentious manufacturer update, prompting some users to flee the platform. The upgrade, which purportedly exposes seed words to the internet, has sparked concern and discontent in the crypto industry.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-745.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-745-1024x768.png" alt="Ledger Receives Strong Criticism From Community With New Function" class="wp-image-187875" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-745-1024x768.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-745-300x225.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-745-768x576.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-745-750x563.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-745-1140x855.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-745.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ledger Receives Strong Criticism From Community With New Function 34"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Ledger Recover function lets users who opt-in and subscribe utilize it as a backup for their private keys. The service encrypts the user&#8217;s seed phrase and delivers it to third-party firms in three shards. When this data is merged and decrypted, it may be used to reconstitute the seed phrase.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exciting update, Ledger has a new product, Ledger Recover, that’s launching soon: <a href="https://t.co/nT1VHnnSYz" target="_blank">https://t.co/nT1VHnnSYz</a> <br><br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Here’s what Ledger Recover is and what it isn’t, explained by <a href="https://twitter.com/P3b7_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@P3b7_</a> &amp; in the thread below. <a href="https://t.co/RW1w07H6pK" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/RW1w07H6pK</a></p>&mdash; Ledger (@Ledger) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1658458714771169282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Yet, the plan has provoked outrage among security experts and many Ledger owners. Mudit Gupta, Chief Information Security Officer at Polygon Labs, <a href="https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta/status/1658368265687556097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Twitter.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It&#8217;s a horrendous idea, DON&#8217;T enable this feature.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>People have voiced their dissatisfaction and frustration with the upgrade on internet forums such as Reddit. Others have expressed similar sentiments, with some planning to acquire new wallets and move their crypto holdings.</p>



<p>In response to criticism, Ledger has said that the gadget only distributes encrypted shards of users&#8217; seed phrases to other parties if they want to utilize the recovery service. Users may still opt to back up their own seed phrases.</p>



<p>The important distinction here is that the user may choose their guardians and avoid the possible security risk of supplying their passport and identification card.</p>



<p>This explanation, however, has done nothing to assuage the fears of those who think that the gadget should not have been able to leak data to the internet in the first place.</p>
