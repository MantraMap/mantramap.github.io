<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Amid the tight regulatory landscape of Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the new successor, Richard Teng, has been found.</em></li>



<li><em>According to people familiar with the matter, he would be a popular candidate to take over as chief executive.</em></li>



<li><em>CZ is facing a lawsuit from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) for alleged trading and derivatives rules violations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-05/binance-s-richard-teng-emerges-as-cz-s-heir-apparent-as-regulators-circle#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg News</a>, Richard Teng, the new head of Binance Middle East and North Africa, is seen as a potential successor to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-251.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="579" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-251.png" alt="Richard Teng May Take Over As CEO Of Binance If CZ Resigns: Bloomberg" class="wp-image-192158" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-251.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-251-300x170.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-251-768x434.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-251-750x424.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Richard Teng May Take Over As CEO Of Binance If CZ Resigns: Bloomberg 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Should Changpeng Zhao step down, Richard Teng would be a popular candidate to take the position of chief executive, according to people familiar with the matter. Binance did not respond to a request for succession comment.</p>



<p>The issue of succession has become more pressing as US regulators have increased scrutiny of Binance in recent months. Previously, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance and Changpeng Zhao for allegedly violating derivatives regulations in late March and accusing them of &#8220;artificial&#8221; compliance.</p>



<p>According to the report, Richard Teng&#8217;s senior position at the central bank of Singapore and the Abu Dhabi International Free Trade Zone makes him an ideal candidate to help guide Binance through regulatory difficulties.</p>



<p>According to Richard Teng&#8217;s LinkedIn profile, he worked for the Monetary Authority of Singapore for 13 years until 2007. After that, he worked for six years at Abu Dhabi Global Markets. His resume shows a master&#8217;s degree in applied finance from the University of Western Australia.</p>



<p>Binance still processes more transactions than all the other top centralized crypto exchanges combined, but its position has always been challenging. At least four US federal agencies are investigating or bringing enforcement action against it, and regulators in Canada and Australia are reviewing its business. Even Dubai, Zhao&#8217;s adopted home and widely regarded as a freelance crypto hub, has tightened scrutiny of license applicants, including Binance.</p>



<p>On March 27, the CFTC <a href="https://news.coincu.com/181150-cftc-binance-willfully-violates-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a series of complaints against Binance and Changpeng Zhao in a lawsuit accusing him of insider trading and evading KYC (know your customer) controls.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-252.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="931" height="523" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-252.png" alt="Richard Teng May Take Over As CEO Of Binance If CZ Resigns: Bloomberg" class="wp-image-192159" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-252.png 931w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-252-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-252-768x431.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-252-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px" title="Richard Teng May Take Over As CEO Of Binance If CZ Resigns: Bloomberg 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The agency said Binance and CZ knowingly ignored registration and compliance requirements under US federal law, despite exploiting significant US commercial relationships to earn a substantial revenue. Among the allegations was that Binance was trading on its platform. Furthermore, the CFTC states that &#8220;approximately 300&#8242; banker accounts&#8217; all owned directly or indirectly by Zhao.&#8221; </p>



<p>In addition, the US Department of Justice is investigating whether its platform was illegally used to allow Russians to evade US sanctions and transfer money. Last week, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange was also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191587-binance-asks-canada-recall-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">locked</a> in a dispute with the Securities Commission of Ontario, Canada, even though it announced its exit from this tight market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Starknet Layer 2 Ethereum network announced on Twitter that the new Starknet mainnet would be launched within a few weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>The upcoming Starknet v0.12.0 is focused on increasing network throughput to improve transaction scalability and latency.</em></li>



<li><em>Voting for the upgrade is coming up, and it is expected to be integrated and deployed in mid-June.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Starknet Layer-2 Ethereum network has announced that the new Starknet mainnet will be launched within a few weeks. Additionally, the Starknet <a href="https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/starknet_versions/version_notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation</a> states that the upcoming Starknet v0.12.0 release is focused on increasing network throughput to improve transaction scalability and latency.</strong></h5>

<p>To achieve this, a new Rust implementation of Sequencer will be introduced. The sequencer includes more efficient local storage and critical path logic designed to significantly reduce transaction confirmation wait times and resolve network congestion issues.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191794-vitalik-buterin-backs-kakarot-zkevm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starknet</a> admin page, the upgrade vote for Starknet v0.12.0 is coming. Starknet Alpha v0.12.0 is expected to be integrated and deployed in mid-June so that the community can deploy and drop its vote for Goerli at the end of June.</p>



<p>The proposal suggests that the framework for the upgrade schedule is as follows:</p>



<ol>
<li>Integration time: the first 7 days to integrate the stable version,</li>



<li>Test period: first 3 days of deployment on Goerli testnet, then 5 days of voting, and then 1 day wait (Freeze time)</li>



<li>Deploy the mainnet the next day, a total of 17 days.</li>
</ol>



<p>According to the previous roadmap update, in 2023, with the full focus on developing features, 2024 will be the year of network decentralization. This will also be the time when this layer-2 will launch its $STRK token because it will require a project&#8217;s own token to implement decentralized governance.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-248.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="758" height="437" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-248.png" alt="Starknet v0.12.0 Will Increase Network Throughput And Reduce Latency" class="wp-image-192144" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-248.png 758w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-248-300x173.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-248-750x432.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" title="Starknet v0.12.0 Will Increase Network Throughput And Reduce Latency 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The move is similar to the zkSync Era when that Layer 2 solution also announced the date for network decentralization as 2024.</p>



<p>Around the end of last year, StarkNet released information about the StarkNet token to the community, including the token&#8217;s implementation on the Ethereum network and tokenomics announcement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The discussion about restricting the operation of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens by Bitcoin developers is ongoing.</em></li>



<li><em>Most developers predicted the prospect of a BTC crash, seeing little demand from the meme craze.</em></li>



<li><em>Billions of dollars of transactions flooded the Bitcoin network in May, causing transaction fees to skyrocket and the network to become highly congested.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin developers are discussing whether to regulate the code to prevent the operations of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.</strong></h5>

<p>WhaleWire tweeted that a code discussion of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens by Bitcoin developers is ahead of fears of a BTC crash as the May meme craze gets too intense.</p>



<p>Bitcoin community members are still divided on whether Ordinals fit into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Advocates like Dan Held suggest that it offers more financial use cases on Bitcoin. In contrast, others say it is moving away from Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s vision of Bitcoin as a payment system, peer-to-peer cash. However, for now, we are seeing more risks than benefits from the explosion of this trend.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://news.coincu.com/190655-brc-20-tokens-have-application-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> BRC-20 </a>(Bitcoin Request for Comment 20) token is a token created on the Bitcoin blockchain thanks to the Inscription mechanism and Ordinals protocol. This technique was created by an anonymous Twitter analyst named @domodata on 8/3/2023. He combined the Ordinals mechanism with the JSON data format text to make this BRC-20 token standard.</p>



<p>They jammed the Bitcoin network and pushed it to its operational limits, testing how the world&#8217;s first and largest blockchain can cope with the rapidly expanding demand. The cost to deposit funds is soaring, transactions are waiting longer, and some users and exchanges have begun to look at other options. That includes the Lightning network, a &#8220;layer 2&#8221; scaling solution designed to make Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper.</p>



<p>Many Bitcoiners became frustrated when gas fees on the Bitcoin network skyrocketed amid a spike in transaction activity. The normal fee, which is set dynamically under a competitive bidding process, rose to a staggering $30.19 for a simple Bitcoin transaction on May 10, after hovering around $2 for almost two years from July 2021. Sometimes, the bidding fee can go up to 500 USD.</p>

Let&#8217;s learn more about the Pudgy Penguins project with Coincu and the interesting things it brings through the article below.</strong></h5>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Pudgy Penguins?</h2>



<p>After the great success of Bored Ape Yacht Club, another animal-themed PFP project immediately shook the NFT ecosystem in the fight for the NFT market in 2021, Pudgy Penguins is a group of overweight penguin avatars.</p>



<p>Pudgy Penguins is a collection of NFT PFPs that was released in July 2021. Like many other collections at the time, the project gained a lot of attention from the community almost away. The collection comprises 8,888 individually created penguin NFTs, each with over 150 hand-drawn characteristics.</p>



<p>This collection is based on cute penguins found in Antarctica. The diversity of this collection contributes to its attractiveness and distinctiveness, whether it&#8217;s penguins wearing Viking caps or Tropical flower necklaces.</p>



<p>Pudgy Penguins has gone beyond appearances by offering owners special access to experiences, events, and IP licensing options, among other things. This brand has a large following and is utilized to create content, items, toys, and so on.</p>



<p>It might be due to the market as a whole collapsing, or it could be because the creators of a specific initiative fled with the community&#8217;s support. Even the smallest suspicion from a project&#8217;s community that the founders are capable of doing something similar might cause them to lose trust.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s precisely what occurred in the Pudgy Penguins community in late 2021 when they realized that the project&#8217;s finances had been cleared by the original crew.</p>



<p>However, Pudgy Penguins has suddenly captured the attention of all NFT users, from announcing a successful $9 million crowdfunding campaign to releasing Pudgy Toys and collecting $500,000 in sales in only two days.</p>



<p>The rise comes only a few months after a multimillion-dollar purchase was handed over to new management as faith in the company&#8217;s original team dwindled. These have shown Pudgy Penguins&#8217; dominance in the huge NFT industry.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Forgotten past</h2>



<p>Pudgy Penguins will be available for purchase in July 2021, right in the middle of the bullrun&#8217;s peak enthusiasm. Pudgy rapidly attracted the attention of the community and was thought to be likely to have a resounding success like the BAYC department due to the general market&#8217;s backing as well as the assured popularity of the NFT PFP kits at the time.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the joy did not last long, as a series of claims from project supporters against the founding team surfaced on Twitter, alleging that ColeThereum (creator of Pudgy Penguins) had engaged in fraud previously and at that time.</p>



<p>According to allegations, ColeThereum misappropriated all of the money in the fund and has no plans to continue developing the idea. Instead, the creator offered to repurchase the project for 888 ETH for 100% of the shares.</p>



<p>Luca Schnetzler purchased the project rights in April 2022 for 750 ETH (equal to $2.5 million at the time). Luca is one of the project&#8217;s most ardent supporters; he recognizes the collection&#8217;s potential and is certain that the abilities and expertise he has gained over the years can aid Pudgy Penguins&#8217; comeback.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Ecosystem overview</h2>



<p>Pudgys has developed significantly after being bought by Luca Netz, with particular efforts such as developing Pudgy Word and selling Pudgy Toys on Amazon. The initiatives produced in the Pudgy Penguins environment are listed below.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lil Pudgys</strong></h3>



<p>Little Pudgys is a collection of 22,222 hand-drawn Pudgys created on the blockchain using LayerZero technology. Users may transfer their Lil Pudgys to other blockchains using Pudgys Bridge. For example, Lil Pudgys was born on Ethereum but can now be transferred to Polygon, BNB Chain, or Arbitrum.</p>



<p>Little Pudgys is an expansion of Pudgy Penguins that allows you to access the universe revolving around the Pudgy Penguins ecology at a lower cost. Pudgy Penguins may claim 8,888 Little Pudgys for free, with a total of 13,334 available for purchase in December 2021. Owners of Little Pudgys will have the same rights as Pudgy Penguins. Both have access to experiences, events, and prospects for intellectual property licensing, among other things.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pudgy Rods</strong></h3>



<p>Pudgy Rods, originally &#8220;Pudgy Gifts,&#8221; has been offered as a free NFT, and any NFT Pudgy Penguins holder may claim mint before August 30th, 2021.</p>



<p>Initially, each NFT took the shape of eggs wrapped in red ribbon, with the contents kept a mystery from the community. The presents were first revealed to be a bridge until Christmas Eve. While the debut was received with mixed reviews, it seems that people now regard Pudgy Rods as part of the larger Pudgy Penguins ecology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pudgy Toys &amp; Pudgy Word</strong></h3>



<p>On May 18, 2023, the project announced the launching of Pudgy Toys, a tangible stuffed toy offered on Amazon that quickly generated a stir in the market after reaching $500,000 in sales in only 48 hours. The development team also sees the physical toy as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; for the web3 and NFT ecosystems, as well as a means of exposing Pudgy Penguins to a large number of real-world consumers.</p>



<p>One feature that distinguishes Pudgy Toys is that each toy comes with a digital experience called Pudgy World. Each participant in Pudgy World must create an account and provide an email address. NFT soulbound is the user account, which is equivalent to the NFT wallet. Customers who buy a toy will get a birth certificate with a QR code. The user receives a digital object on Pudgy World after scanning a QR code. This digital object is available for trading on the Pudgy World Marketplace.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the introduction of Pudgy Toys and Pudgy World brought Pudgy Penguins closer to consumers. Moreover, collecting income from sales contributes to the development of a long-term NFT empire.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Investors and Partners</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investor</strong></h3>



<p>Pudgy Penguins raised $9 million in a seed round headed by 1kx investment fund on May 9, 2023. Pudgy Penguins intends to use this funding to expand its intellectual property and team.</p>



<p>Pudgy Penguins has never raised funding from investment funds prior to the financing. The team&#8217;s operational finances are derived from the sale of Pudgy Penguins during the first mint, as well as a royalty fee from the sale.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partners</strong></h3>



<p>Pudgy Penguins announces cooperation with PMI, a worldwide toy brand, on September 4, 2022. Over the last 25 years, PMI has been a pioneer in the children&#8217;s toy sector, collaborating with well-known brands such as Fortnight and Harry Potter. PMI is also collaborating with multinational firms such as Kellogg to enter the Web 2.0 sector.</p>



<p>The project had an auction with Sotheby&#8217;s in October 2022. This is a key step in establishing its status in the art world.</p>



<p>Pudgys teamed with LayerZero in January 2023, enabling customers to transport NFT Little Pudgys across several chains. Pudgy Penguins is also the first Web3 brand to expose people to Soulbound Token.</p>



<p>Pudgy Penguins has a strong emphasis on tangible toys, ensuring that the charming penguins&#8217; IP is visible to daily customers. The collaboration with Retail Monster helps to promote Pudgy Toys and introduce them to a broader audience throughout the globe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Pudgy Penguins seems to be the strongest example of a resurgence in the NFT market. With unique strategies that go beyond the Web3 domain, this project still has a great potential in the future. As the project continues to stay at the top of OpenSea&#8217;s volume charts, fans of currently struggling NFT projects may have new reason to hope for their return.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Atomic Wallet is a sleek, user-friendly tool for managing all of your crypto assets. It accepts hundreds of cryptocurrencies and allows you to earn rewards on more than a dozen of them through crypto staking. There is also an exchange and crypto purchasing option built in.</strong></h5>

<p>In addition to a number of Web3 wallet programs such as Metamask or other digital wallets, a multi-purpose wallet such as Atomic Wallet will assist users in easing the process of maintaining, syncing, and utilizing their digital assets in a highly flexible manner. Wallet Trust is a mobile wallet.</p>



<p>Of course, an e-wallet will not offer better security features like a Ledger cold wallet, but does Atomic Wallet&#8217;s adaptability and flexibility make it worthwhile to use? Let&#8217;s take a look at Coincu&#8217;s review.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Atomic Wallet?</h2>



<p>Atomic Wallet is a non-custodial blockchain wallet that stores all passwords and data on the user&#8217;s device. It is well-known for its user-friendly UI and for providing a number of services, such as crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) storage, crypto staking, and in-wallet crypto purchasing.</p>



<p>Atomic Wallet is a decentralized crypto storage wallet solution, according to the development team. The development team concentrated on the user interface and security elements to create a positive user experience.</p>



<p>Users of Atomic Wallet may engage in activities such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Have cryptocurrency assets been sent to their wallet?</li>



<li>Import a Private Key to add Crypto assets.</li>



<li>Private keys should be kept safely and separately.</li>



<li>Transfer cryptocurrency to other addresses.</li>



<li>Choose which cryptocurrency nodes to utilize.</li>



<li>To use, choose Blockchain Explorer.</li>
</ul>



<p>The user&#8217;s keys are encrypted and kept on terminals, sometimes known as hardware wallets. With each form of Crypto, these keys may be entirely backed up using passwords.</p>



<p>Atomic bills itself as a non-custodial decentralized wallet that allows users to manage, swap, and trade over 500 coins via a single interface. The wallet creates AWC tokens. AWC token holders benefit from staking, savings on exchange services, enhanced trading capabilities, affiliate awards and bonuses, and personalized assistance as a group. It claims to be the first wallet to use Cross-Chain Atomic Swap.</p>



<p>Atomic Wallet has been designed to perform flawlessly on a variety of platforms, including desktops, mobile devices, and Linux. Its adaptability will enable asset transfer and receipt to be quicker and more flexible.</p>



<p>If you use a macOS computer, but your mobile device is Android. A standard wallet will have limited flexibility or support applications on Android but not certainly on Apple&#8217;s App Store. For Atomic, it is different, the operating systems that Atomic Wallet supports include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Windows</li>



<li>MacOS</li>



<li>Ubuntu</li>



<li>Debian</li>



<li>Fedora</li>



<li>Android</li>



<li>iOS</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Free cold storage</strong></h3>



<p>The majority of free blockchain wallets are hot wallets, which means they are linked to the internet. Cold storage is often regarded as the safest alternative because of its offline nature, although most cold wallets require hardware that must be purchased. Atomic Wallet is an exception since it is a cold wallet that is also free to use.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s vital to note that Atomic Wallet stores your passwords and data on your smartphone. Thus, if that gadget is linked to the internet, your wallet is as well. Hardware wallets are a preferable option if you wish to keep your wallet offline.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Offers crypto staking</strong></h3>



<p>Staking is a common method of increasing your crypto holdings. When you stake cryptocurrency, you are utilizing it as collateral and assisting in the validation of transactions and the security of a blockchain network. In exchange, you will be rewarded according to the amount you have staked. All of this is simple and fast using Atomic Wallet, which allows staking with over a dozen cryptocurrencies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In-wallet crypto purchases</strong></h3>



<p>Atomic Wallet&#8217;s partner Simplex allows you to purchase cryptocurrency using your debit card. Although this is handy, there is a 2% transaction fee in addition to any costs charged by your bank. If you plan on investing in cryptocurrency often and making regular purchases, check into crypto applications with reduced costs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Pros and Cons</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros</strong></h3>



<p>The Atomic Wallet&#8217;s strongest advantages are its low cost and compatibility with coins and tokens. Together with security and the option to buy cryptocurrencies straight from the wallet with your bank card. Apart from network transaction fees, the wallet is free to use. It supports over 500 coins and tokens, as well as other exchanges than Atomic Swap, in order to cover as many crypto assets as possible.</p>



<p>Since the exchange is decentralized, all of your assets are saved on the blockchain, while all of your private keys are encrypted and stored on your device with a 12-word recovery phrase as a backup in the event that your device is lost or stolen. With the ability to acquire cryptocurrencies straight via the wallet using just a bank card, even a crypto newbie may start trading crypto coins and tokens nearly immediately after installing it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cons</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Vulnerabilities that may exist</strong></p>



<p>Atomic Wallet was subjected to a thorough security examination by Least Authority, which released its conclusions in February 2022. The research claims that Atomic Wallet has flaws that put users in danger, and it advises against using the wallet. The answer from Atomic Wallet was that it is working on remedies and that the vulnerabilities revealed do not represent a danger to using funds.</p>



<p>Recently, Atomic Wallet was alleged to have been hacked, with users claiming total losses of their cryptocurrency holdings. Numerous people have commented on the page, stating that their monies were deleted from the digital wallet app.</p>



<p>Since security is the most crucial feature in a crypto wallet, any claims of weaknesses are closely scrutinized. Based on Atomic Wallet&#8217;s reaction, it does not seem that the flaws are substantial, but it is worth investigating before using it.</p>



<p><strong>A limited number of cryptocurrencies are available for purchase</strong></p>



<p>Atomic Wallet does not support a large number of coins. You&#8217;ll be restricted to a few market leaders, so if you want to invest in a variety of crypto tokens, you&#8217;ll have to go elsewhere.</p>



<p><strong>Not open source</strong></p>



<p>Atomic Wallet, like many other cryptocurrency wallets, does not make its source code accessible for public inspection. Although we don&#8217;t consider this a deal breaker, some cryptocurrency investors think that holding their cash in open-source wallets is safer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exchange</strong></h3>



<p>When you utilize Exchange options, you are interacting with ShapeShift and Changelly services. We connect their API to our wallet, and the providers handle all operations. Blockexplorers manage your balance and transaction history. As a result, a reliable internet connection is essential. If certain blockexplers are prohibited in your region or your IP is blacklisted by CloudFlare, you may have connectivity issues and the balance may be shown wrongly in Atomic Sign: (-). In these instances, consider using a VPN.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that all of your transactions are routed over the blockchain, and Atomic Wallet runs in a custody and decentralized way. You are solely concerned with blockchains and official nodes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Atomic Swap</strong></h3>



<p>The blockchain cross-exchange capability is supported by Atomic Wallet. There are currently just three pairs available. In the future, we plan to provide Atomic Swap implementations for a variety of additional assets.</p>



<p>Atomic Swap is a smart contract-based technology that permits the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without the need for a third party.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Settings</strong></h3>



<p>You may update your password, import your private keys, or access all of your Private Keys to export them to other services on the Settings tab. This means you may switch from Atomic to another wallet that supports 12 recovery words (seeds).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wallet</strong></h3>



<p>The Wallet page displays your asset balance and allows you to send payments to other addresses by selecting &#8220;Send.&#8221;</p>



<p>The balance information obtained from blockexplorers and your USD balance is computed using the most recent market data. It is refreshed every 5 minutes.</p>



<p>This page also allows you to add bespoke ERC20 coins that are not yet supported by Atomic Wallet. All you have to do is enter the token&#8217;s contract address, which you can locate at https://etherscan.io/.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Fees</h2>



<p>Atomic Wallet is free to use for crypto storage and does not charge any transaction fees. The blockchain charges network fees when you transmit crypot to pay its validators. The blockchain calculates this charge at the moment of the transaction.</p>



<p>Atomic Wallet charges fees for acquiring and trading bitcoins. Here is how the fees work:</p>



<ul>
<li>For fiat-to-crypto purchases made with a bank card, Atomic Wallet charges a 2% fee ($10 minimum). The issuing bank of your card may also impose a fee.</li>



<li>Atomic Wallet charges a 0.5% fee on exchanges plus the commission of its exchange partner.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">AWC Token</h2>



<p>AWC with Utility Token function is used in the Atomic Wallet ecosystem for the following purposes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduce service costs on Atomic&#8217;s exchange by using AWC Token.=</li>



<li>While purchasing Crypto using a bank card on Atomic&#8217;s platform, AWC Token holders will pay a lower fee.</li>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The proposed EIP-6963 is intended to resolve conflict issues that arise when users attempt to use multiple wallet providers in a single web browser.</em></li>



<li><em>EIP-6963 fixes the issue for users who have installed multiple browser extensions according to the EIP-1193 standard.</em></li>



<li><em>This solution reduces the entry barrier for new wallet providers and improves the user experience on the Ethereum network.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The newly proposed EIP-6963 intends to address conflict concerns that happen when users attempt to utilize different wallet providers in the same web browser. These conflicts may damage the user experience, interfere with control over the Ethereum wallet interface, and complicate interactions with the dApp in this situation.</strong></h5>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Current issues</h2>



<p>An alternative discovery approach for EIP-1193 providers to window.ethereum enables finding multiple injected wallet providers on a web page using Javascript&#8217;s window events.</p>



<p>Today, wallet providers who provide browser extensions must inject their Ethereum providers (EIP-1193) into the same window object window.ethereum; however, this causes conflicts for consumers who may install many browser extensions.</p>



<p>Browser extensions are loaded in an unexpected and unstable sequence on the web page, resulting in a race scenario in which the user has no influence over which wallet provider is chosen to expose the Ethereum interface under the window.ethereum object. In most cases, the last wallet to load wins.</p>



<p>This not only degrades the user experience but also raises the barrier to entry for new browser extensions since users are only allowed to install one browser extension at a time.</p>



<p>Several browser extensions try to mitigate this issue by waiting for their injection to overwrite the same window.ethereum object, resulting in unfair competition and a lack of interoperability for wallet providers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-234.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="361" height="500" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-234.png" alt="EIP-6963: Possible Solutions To Multi-wallet Conflicts" class="wp-image-192090" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-234.png 361w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-234-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" title="EIP-6963: Possible Solutions To Multi-wallet Conflicts 30"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is the EIP-6963 solution?</h2>



<p>The proposal specifies a standardized vendor information interface (EIP 6963 ProviderInfo), which is required for wallet selection pop-ups to be populated. The standard also underlines the significance of disclosing the provider interface (EIP 6963 Provider Detail), although the EIP-1193 provider interface remains unchanged for compatibility.</p>



<p>The following are key characteristics of the vendor information interface:</p>



<ul>
<li>walletId: The wallet provider&#8217;s globally unique identification (e.g. io.dopewallet.extension or awesomewallet).</li>



<li>uuid: A locally unique identifier for a wallet provider that supports UUID v 4.0.</li>



<li>name: The wallet provider&#8217;s human-readable name (e.g. DopeWalletExtension or Awesome).</li>



<li>icon: A URI to an image that must be square and have a minimum resolution of 96 × 96 px. PNG and WebP image formats, as well as vector image formats such as SVG, are suggested. The suggested team strongly advises against using lossy formats like JPG/JPEG.</li>
</ul>



<p>Both the Ethereum library and the wallet provider employ the window.dispatchEvent method to emit events and the window.addEventListener function to watch events when it comes to trigger events. When the Ethereum library is initialized, it broadcasts the &#8220;eip6963:requestProvider&#8221; event, and the wallet provider emits the &#8220;eip6963:announceProvider&#8221; event, along with interface and provider information.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How effective is EIP-6963?</h2>



<p>Adoption and implementation of EIP-6963 might take three to six months, according to reliable estimations. This breakthrough may result in a new wallet narrative later this year, possibly shattering the stranglehold of top wallet providers like Metamask and establishing a more competitive environment among providers.</p>



<p>This feature is intended to aid wallets such as Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Taho, Rabby, Frame, XDEFI, Rainbow, Zerion, Spot, Coin 98 Wallet, Frontier, MEW, Dawn Wallet, Blockwallet, Bitski, SafePal, BitKeep, and MathWallet. Readers may join the EIP-6963 debate with Ethereum developers <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-6963-multi-injected-provider-discovery/14076/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Pros and Cons</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros</strong></h3>



<p>There is no single point of failure since developers enable various wallet providers. This is advantageous in terms of security since it implies that if a wallet provider is hacked or fails, consumers have other options.</p>



<p>Decreased reliance on a single vendor: At the moment, the Ethereum community is highly reliant on one wallet provider, MetaMask. This is dangerous because if MetaMask is hacked, the majority of Ethereum users will be impacted. The EIP-6963 mitigates risk by enabling numerous wallets.</p>



<p>Additional User Controls: The option to choose several wallet providers provides consumers with more security control. Users may choose a wallet provider according to their particular security requirements and trust level.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cons</strong></h3>



<p>Expanded Attack Surface: Deploying EIP-6963 broadens the attack surface. This is because the number of wallet providers that may be hacked by hostile actors is growing. To reduce this danger, every wallet provider must follow to strict security requirements.</p>



<p>Risks of SVG image mining: EIP-6963 advises utilizing SVG pictures as wallet provider icons. SVG pictures, on the other hand, may include JavaScript code, which might constitute a cross-site scripting (XSS) danger. Although the EIP recommends that SVG pictures be presented using tags to avoid JavaScript execution, this recommendation can only be confirmed by third parties or implementation inspectors.</p>



<p>Effect of changing window.ethereum: Although replacing window.ethereum does not immediately damage current apps, it does advocate doing so after a user picks a wallet. This proposal can only be confirmed by a third party or an auditor in each implementation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>EIP-6963 seeks to promote interoperability across wallet providers, decrease the barrier to entry for new providers, and enhance user experience on the Ethereum network. At the same time, the implications for security are complicated.</p>



<p>Ethereum users, wallet providers, and developers must follow best practices at all times to keep the Ethereum ecosystem safe.</p>



<p>By putting this suggestion into action, the Ethereum ecosystem may grow into a more competitive and user-friendly environment, which would benefit both wallet providers and their users.</p>

<p>When a person uses the device to verify their identity, they are given a World ID that may be used to access websites, applications, and other services without disclosing any personal information, like as emails or names.</p>



<p>Leading investors, including as Blockchain Capital, Bain Capital Crypto, and others, contributed $115 million to the Series C fundraising round. This comes at a time when the globe is experiencing a lack of investment owing to economic uncertainty, which is an excellent outcome for the Worldcoin team. So is Worldcoin worth our bet or not? Let&#8217;s find the answer with Coincu through this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">New effects from Proof of Personhood</h2>



<p>Worldcoin is likely one of the most ambitious and genuine endeavors, with the objective of introducing cryptocurrencies to over a billion people.</p>



<p>Worldcoin has the potential to become the biggest crypto entry, accompanied by the most commonly used crypto wallet, and, most significantly, it will introduce a new idea for the Internet &#8211; Proof of Personhood &#8211; by adopting an innovative distribution technique.</p>



<p>Personal identification is particularly valuable for differentiating people from bots on the Internet, given recent improvements in artificial intelligence. More on it in a moment.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it&#8217;s working: despite having a very small presence and little promotion in early testing, Worldcoin managed to enroll approximately 2 million individuals. And that&#8217;s only the beginning: co-founders Sam Altman and Alex Blania are working hard to expand it to the whole world&#8217;s population.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>In the past, protocol contributors did a bad job of disseminating their stories. Our immediate response to Worldcoin, like most people&#8217;s, was negative. At first appearance, it seems to be an Orwellian blend of hardware, biometrics, and encryption &#8211; not for the faint of heart.</p>



<p>Worldcoin scans each user&#8217;s iris to register and authenticate them (the colored part that surrounds the pupil). This scan confirms that the person is a genuine, alive, and distinct individual. Scanning is carried out using a unique hardware device known as an &#8220;orb.&#8221;</p>



<p>When it comes to biometrics, there are many reasons to be wary and sensitive, particularly when encryption is involved. Several science fiction films and books even contain the notion of &#8220;eyeball harvesting.&#8221; As a result, a dystopian viewpoint swiftly emerged.</p>



<p>Internally, however, the orb captures a photo of the iris, and the gadget then produces a unique code for the randomness of the iris code. By default, raw biometric data is quickly deleted, leaving just the iris code in the orb.</p>



<p>Verified users are assigned a World ID in TFH&#8217;s World App, the first wallet in the Worldcoin ecosystem, enabling them to discreetly verify to whomever they want that they are truly unique individuals. These on-chain identification assurances are completely safe cryptographically. Even if iris codes were reversible, there would be no way to trace individual users or know how they utilized World ID.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-230.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-230.png" alt="Is Worldcoin An Attractive Investment Bet?" class="wp-image-192083" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-230.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-230-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-230-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-230-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Is Worldcoin An Attractive Investment Bet? 35"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Values are not clearly defined</h2>



<p>Yet, it is unclear how the Worldcoin token can be supposed to have any value for receivers after it circulates, which is only one of several lacking premises around Worldcoin.</p>



<p>In other words, World ID is a privacy-preserving identification technology that does not collect or retain biometric information from anybody.</p>



<p>As part of the process, users may also establish their own crypto wallets inside the World App. Considering World ID&#8217;s Sybil resilience, World App is the world&#8217;s first self-hosted wallet with a known user base &#8211; all other wallets depend on guessing for metrics like DAU/MAU at best.</p>



<p>At first look, it may be difficult to see the usefulness of a proof-of-person protocol. This is a fundamental fact for &#8220;category creators&#8221;: as a novel primitive, quantifying the usefulness and worth of personal proof at an early stage is challenging.</p>



<p>As a result, it is simple to conclude that the project&#8217;s UBI component is only window dressing for its true goal: addressing the issue of digital identification. Yet, Worldcoin&#8217;s response to the issue is as dreadful, creating a dizzying variety of privacy dangers and moral entanglements.</p>



<p>At the highest level, it&#8217;s clear to see how, given recent developments in AI, distinguishing humans from bots on the internet will become more difficult and vital.</p>



<p>More particularly, we may identify applications that are clearly useful now. Airdrops are one such option in Web3: numerous token-based companies seek to reward each unique user with tokens (such as for signing up, making a transaction, or any other unique behavior that token-based projects want to incentivize).</p>



<p>Sadly, distinguishing between distinct users is challenging. As a sybil protection measure, certain projects may demand users to give government-issued IDs; nevertheless, this has the following drawbacks: </p>



<ul>
<li>Eliminates more than half of the world&#8217;s population due to a lack of appropriate IDs; </li>



<li>Significantly increases friction; </li>



<li>Given the facts Given a lengthy history of security breaches, many consumers are understandably hesitant to provide such information. As a consequence, awards meant for unique users were disproportionately allocated to persons who Sybil hacked the process and created dozens of wallets in order to receive enormous sums of free prizes.</li>
</ul>



<p>To reward distinct users, airdrop issuers might enhance their airdrop criteria using World ID as a proof-of-person technique. It&#8217;s difficult to see how what amounts to an Ethereum-based meme currency with no discernible tokenomic basis will be exchangeable for necessities like food and housing in the long run.</p>



<p>This paradox is only one example of Worldcoin&#8217;s deviously illogical motte-and-bailey language. The company&#8217;s message goes to considerable pains to portray both a philanthropic initiative and a lucrative opportunity.</p>



<p>Yet the use of personal identification extends well beyond cryptography. To identify people from &#8220;bots,&#8221; Internet businesses have created a considerable degree of friction, which we&#8217;ve all become so used to that we rarely notice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Should we bet on WLD?</h2>



<p>Although the emergence of AI has several potential advantages, current improvements (in AI) make it impossible to discern between AI and humans on the internet, and humans may soon find themselves at a significant disadvantage.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Worldcoin is an open-source protocol, supported by a global community of developers, individuals, economists and technologists committed to expanding participation in, and access to, the global economy”, the project website reads.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These are the statements of The Worldcoin Foundation, the organization behind the innovative iris biometric cryptocurrency Worldcoin (WLD).</p>



<p>A personal proof protocol like World ID may enhance user experience, maintain current online services economically viable, open up the design space for future web services, and give a mechanism to promote confidence in the digital community by giving the tools to clearly discern bots from people. A privacy-preserving identity-proof system, we think, will become an essential component of the Internet. World ID, in particular, enables people to validate their humanity online while staying anonymous thanks to zero-knowledge proofs. To sign a transaction, just click a button to verify it.</p>



<p>WLD will be supplied worldwide and freely to everyone for both utility and future governance, just for being a unique person.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the World App allows users to make worldwide payments, purchases, and transfers using WLD, other digital assets, and conventional currencies.</p>



<p>Anyone looking to purchase WLD must wait till the Worldcoin mainnet opens and be situated in a jurisdiction where the token is accessible (there are currently no plans to launch WLD in the US).</p>



<p>Although there are privacy issues regarding Worldcoin&#8217;s centralized biometric ID credentials, and rumors of a black market for ID credentials have already emerged, demand for decentralized forms of human verification is projected to expand in an increasingly AI-dominated society.</p>



<p>Moreover, given the strong support the Worldcoin initiative has gotten from venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the project is anticipated to succeed. That implies its WLD might blow up.</p>



<p>However, since WLD is not accessible for trade (it can only be obtained by signing up for the app and completing the humanness check), crypto investors could examine alternative tokens riding the AI wave.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Sam Altman, co-founder, and CEO of OpenAI, presents a unique viewpoint from the bleeding edge of AI. Maybe most crucially, Sam brought in proven expertise to assist them in accomplishing TFH&#8217;s lofty goals.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Worldcoin has faced criticism for a number of reasons, the most serious of which is that biometric scanning raises privacy threats. According to a part of its website devoted to answering questions about the orb, the business will not keep iris scans, and the gadget will not harm users&#8217; eyes.</p>



<p>Finally, with the appropriate technology, people, and timing, TFH has a unique chance to extend the Internet&#8217;s privacy-preserving identity principles — and in doing so, Worldcoin may become the largest entrance into the crypto market, and World App may become the most widely used crypto wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Beyond basic monetary transfers, Ordinals have established a new use case for the Bitcoin network.</em></li>



<li><em>Yet, the Ordinals protocol has sparked debate since it raises a fundamental problem within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</em></li>



<li><em>BRC-20, ORC-20, or SRC-20 are standards aimed at addressing those issues, however, the long-term development is still an undetermined thing.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In January 2023, Bitcoin Ordinals were launched to create Bitcoin NFTs by adding information to individual satoshis. This is accomplished via a procedure known as &#8220;inscribing.&#8221; The Bitcoin community sparked a new controversy over a newly implemented protocol called Ordinals. This protocol lets you put text, images, and videos inside the Bitcoin blockchain. Something that can only happen in blockchains with smart contracts can do.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-224.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-224.png" alt="Can Ordinals Thrive With BRC-20, ORC-20, or SRC-20?" class="wp-image-192073" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-224.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-224-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-224-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-224-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Can Ordinals Thrive With BRC-20, ORC-20, or SRC-20? 39"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Ordinals background</h2>



<p>NFTs were formerly produced and utilized largely on Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain blockchains. This changed when the Ordinals team realized that non-fungible tokens might also exist on the Bitcoin network. As a result, the Ordinals project has come to fruition.</p>



<p>Changing a section of Bitcoin&#8217;s code has proved to be incredibly difficult in the past. This problem is mostly caused by the decentralized network of nodes and developers who do not want to jeopardize network security. As a result, Bitcoin NFTs have not gained traction. Yet, the expansion of the crypto ecosystem has opened the doors to creative minds that see Bitcoin NFTs as a part of the future of Web3.</p>



<p>Ordinals have developed gradually since its beginning, as many people participate by posting various forms of material, such as photographs, music, and videos. Let&#8217;s look at how it works in more detail.</p>



<p>Domo then created the BRC-20 token standard based on the Ordinals protocol. BRC-20 is just a new approach for token creation and transfer by publishing a text on Satoshi. The standard gained momentum in April, with the quantity of BRC-20 tokens increasing, resulting in an increase in transaction fees on Bitcoin&#8217;s chain on May 8. The Bitcoin network was experiencing over 400,000 pending transactions, resulting in the amusing circumstance in which cryptocurrency exchange Binance stopped taking Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals.</p>



<p>As the BRC-20 tokens gained popularity, so did their values. ORDI, the first token in the BRC-20 standard, began at $0.1 and increased 310 times to $31 on May 8, with a market valuation of approximately $650 million. With a market value of this magnitude, it ranks in the 70s or thereabouts on Coingecko, even higher than Sui and Optimist.</p>



<p>Yet, this was a fad that was already beginning to fade. However, I must acknowledge that the development of the BRC-20 standard has reawakened interest in Bitcoin after a lengthy period of adverse market circumstances.</p>



<p>After that, two new token standards arose and took their place: ORC-20 and SRC-20. On May 13 to 15, transactions employing ORC-20 tokens accounted for 10% of all Bitcoin network transactions. Nevertheless, the SRC-20 cryptocurrency has lately begun to acquire traction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">BRC-20</h2>



<p>The BRC-20 token (Bitcoin Request for Comment 20) was produced on the Bitcoin blockchain using the Inscription mechanism and the Ordinals protocol. In March 2021, an anonymous Twitter analyst called @domodata developed this strategy. He deploys token contracts, creates tokens, and trades tokens using JSON.</p>



<p>Ordinals is a Bitcoin blockchain-based NFT initiative. It works by generating a numbering system for each satoshi mined when new blocks are formed, allowing material like photos, videos, and HTML to be incorporated into a Bitcoin transaction and allocated to an individual satoshi.</p>



<p><em>1 Satoshi is equivalent to one hundred million BTC (meaning 1 BTC will be equal to 100,000,000 Satoshi)</em></p>



<p>Satoshi is the lowest unit of Bitcoin measurement. Ordinals will assist in numbering (forming a serial) each Satoshi. If you&#8217;re still confused, assume that each banknote has a unique serial number.</p>



<p>The Ordinals protocol will utilize &#8220;inscriptions&#8221; &#8211; text or picture inscriptions &#8211; to add satoshi (sats), the smallest unit of Bitcoin. As a result, these &#8220;inscriptions&#8221; are the only &#8220;digital works&#8221; or NFTs. NFTs, like satoshis, may be kept or sold on the network since they exist in sats. Casey Rodarmor, a software engineer who contributed to Bitcoin Core, designed Ordinals.</p>



<p>And BRC-20 used this Ordinals &#8220;inscription&#8221; technique to establish an asset class, not simply NFTs, but users can: transform them into tokens, install token supply, Mint tokens, and Exchanges pandemic. Each BRC-20 token will, of course, have a unique &#8220;serial&#8221; number. For instance, the ORDI token&#8217;s Inscription: is #348020.</p>



<p>The BRC-20 standard, on the other hand, does not enable smart contracts, a feature that has made ERC-20 popular in the DeFi community by letting developers to create tokens and produce other sorts of finance. Despite this constraint, BRC-20 tokens like as ORDI, PEPE, and PUNK continue to get a lot of interest from the community.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">ORC-20</h2>



<p>ORC-20, like BRC-20, is the standard for tokens operating on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is encoded as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file and recorded on Satoshi with serial numbers.</p>



<p>ORC-20 is backward compatible with BRC-20, enhancing flexibility, scalability, and security while eliminating the danger of double-spending.</p>



<p>Simply, ORC-20 is a forked version of BRC-20.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, ORC-20 is currently in development, and there is no assurance that tokens issued in accordance with this standard will be valuable or useful. As a result, before taking ORC-20, consumers should exercise care and study.</p>



<p>In a migration event, for example, moving orc (inscription number #2504160) from BRC-20 to ORC-20:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
"p": "orc-20",
"tick": "orc",
"id": "2504160",
"op": "deploy",
"wp": "true"
}</code></pre>



<p>At completion, all tokens are converted to ORC-20 tokens, which solves some shortcomings of the BRC-20 standard:</p>



<ul>
<li>The ORC-20 standard significantly improves on the BRC-20 standard. One such enhancement is the addition of identifiers (IDs) that may be used to identify a specific token. If a token with the same name is deployed, the external indexer considers the first deployed token to be &#8220;legitimate&#8221; according to the BRC-20 standard. With the ORC-20 standard, on the other hand, even tokens with the same name may be identified since the inscription number contains &#8220;ID&#8221; when deployed, enabling identification.</li>



<li>Second, unlike the BRC-20 standard, which only allows for four-letter names, ORC-20 allows for names of any length. ORC, the first ORC-20 token to be distributed, has a three-letter name, for example.</li>



<li>Third, the ORC-20 standard adds the option to change the total supply as well as the maximum amount of tokens issued every mint. Although deployers may take advantage of this flexibility, it also provides chances for diverse tokenomics studies. These experiments might involve progressively decreasing the maximum amount of coins generated per mint and replicating the halving of Bitcoin.</li>



<li>Fourth, and most crucially, ORC-20 introduces the UTXO mechanism for token transfer. The benefit of this enhancement is that UTXOs can only be utilized once, eliminating double-spending. The most significant distinction between ORC-20 and BRC-20 is the addition of the notion of UTXO in token transfer.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-227-1024x538.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-227-1024x538.png" alt="Can Ordinals Thrive With BRC-20, ORC-20, or SRC-20?" class="wp-image-192076" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-227-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-227-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-227-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-227-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-227-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-227.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Can Ordinals Thrive With BRC-20, ORC-20, or SRC-20? 41"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">SRC-20</h2>



<p>Although the ORC-20 standard may be considered an improved version that corrects the shortcomings of BRC-20, the SRC-20 standard, unlike the previous two standards, employs Stamps to inscribe text.</p>



<p>BRC-20 and ORC-20 are based on ordinal number theory, and the concept is to create arbitrary files in Bitcoin transaction witness data. This operation, however, occupies the majority of the distributed ledger&#8217;s capacity, allowing nodes to prune or delete witness data. Additionally, not all nodes must maintain or disseminate this witness data.</p>



<p>Stamps, on the other hand, are more durable than ordinals since the information is saved in UTXOs, which every complete node must keep, making them doubly &#8220;blockchain-native.&#8221; Although this is an apparent benefit, storage space is restricted and only allows 24&#215;24 pixel photos or 8-color depth PNG, GIF.</p>



<p>The text used to deploy, mint, and transfer SRC-20 tokens is likewise in JSON format, as is the text used to deploy, mint, and transmit BRC-20 tokens.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-228.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-228.png" alt="Can Ordinals Thrive With BRC-20, ORC-20, or SRC-20?" class="wp-image-192077" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-228.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-228-300x225.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-228-768x576.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-228-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Can Ordinals Thrive With BRC-20, ORC-20, or SRC-20? 42"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The programming language&#8217;s nature restricts the execution of complicated smart contracts on the Bitcoin network, restricting its usefulness. Nonetheless, its greater degree of security motivates developers and consumers to test and use its features on a regular basis. Of course, with such strong security only for keeping and moving cash, it would be fantastic to be able to leverage that protection for a range of other use cases.</p>



<p>The text might excite the imagination and represent a wide variety of thoughts, as it did in the early days of the PC when many games were text-based. Sats Names, BRC-20, ORC-20, and SRC-20 tokens solely employ text to represent immaterial things and rely on external indexers to make them seem substantial. Although these standards are still in their infancy and have their own limits, there is little question that they will serve as the foundation for much future imaginative innovation.</p>



<p>Another unknown is how far these &#8220;X&#8221; RC-20 tokens can go. Since BRC-20 tokens are not physical like ERC-20 tokens and only signal their existence by recording inscriptions in Satoshi, their usefulness is limited. It&#8217;s difficult to see it being utilized for anything other than trading as a meme token. We may imagine basic governance activities in which people link their Bitcoin wallets and vote depending on the number of BRC-20 tokens they own, but enforcing governance outcomes, on-chain remains impossible.</p>

<p>ZKML is a research and development subject that has lately made waves in cryptography circles. But what exactly is it, and why is it helpful? Let&#8217;s learn about this topic with Coincu in this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is zero-knowledge?</h2>



<p>A zero-knowledge (ZK) proof is a cryptographic process in which one party, the prover, may demonstrate to another, the verifier, that a particular statement is true without exposing any extra information other than the fact that the statement is true. It is a field of study that has made significant development on a variety of fronts, from research to protocol implementations and applications.</p>



<p>The process by which one party (the prover) may prove to another party (the verifier) that it knows a value of x without giving any information about them knowing the value of x lies at its heart.</p>



<p>The primary goal of Zero-knowledge Proof technology is to maintain the secrecy of input information while still verifying its validity.</p>



<p>Creating zero-knowledge proofs is a computationally costly process that is several times more expensive than the initial calculation. This implies that there are certain calculations for which zero-knowledge proofs are impossible due to the time required to construct them on the greatest hardware available. Yet, recent improvements in cryptography, technology, and distributed systems have made zero-knowledge proofs achievable for ever more expensive calculations. These advances have enabled the development of protocols that may leverage proofs of heavy computations, hence broadening the design space for new applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Advantages of ZK</h2>



<p>The capacity to employ privacy-preserving datasets in transparent systems such as public blockchain networks is the major advantage of Zero-Knowledge Proof (e.g. Ethereum). While blockchains are intended to be highly transparent, with anyone running their own blockchain node able to view and download all data stored on the ledger, the addition of ZKP technology allows users and companies to leverage their private data sets in the execution of smart contracts without exposing the underlying data.</p>



<p>Maintaining privacy in blockchain networks is critical for conventional organizations like supply chain corporations, enterprises, and banks who wish to communicate and create smart contracts but must retain their trade secret to remain competitive. Furthermore, such organizations are frequently required by law to protect their customers&#8217; personally identifiable information (PII) and to adhere to regulations such as the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</p>



<p>Although permissioned blockchain networks have evolved to safeguard enterprises&#8217; transaction privacy from public observation, ZKP enables organizations to securely communicate with networks. Without giving up the management of sensitive and private data sets, public blockchain typically benefits from the vast network impact of users all over the globe. As a consequence, ZKP technology is effectively enabling a broad variety of institutional use cases for previously unavailable public blockchain networks, promoting innovation, and fostering global economic growth.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Machine learning</h2>



<p>Machine learning is an artificial intelligence discipline that includes the creation and deployment of algorithms that allow computers to learn and adapt to data independently, enhancing their performance via an iterative process that does not need programming. It identifies data using algorithms and models, then utilizes model parameters to generate predictions/decisions.</p>



<p>Large language models, such as GPT-4 and Bard, are cutting-edge natural language processing systems that use massive amounts of training data to produce human-like text, whereas text-to-image models, such as DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, convert textual descriptions into visual representations with remarkable fidelity.</p>



<p>Machine learning is now being used effectively in a variety of sectors. As these models develop, machine learning will be required to do an increasing number of jobs. ZK technology is necessary to achieve a high-accuracy model: employing public model verification of private data or validating private models using public data.</p>



<p>Thus far, the ZKML we&#8217;ve discussed is used to provide zero-knowledge proofs of ML model inference stages rather than ML model training.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The importance of ZKML</h2>



<p>As artificial intelligence technology progresses, distinguishing between artificial intelligence, human intelligence, and human generation becomes increasingly challenging. This is an issue that zero-knowledge proofs can address. It enables us to detect whether a certain piece of content is created by applying a specific model without giving any additional information about the model or the input.</p>



<p>In a future where AI-generated material increasingly mimics human-created information, the possible use of zero-knowledge cryptography might assist us in determining that a certain piece of content was produced by applying a specific model to a given input. If a zero-knowledge circuit representation is built for them, this might give a technique of checking outputs from huge language models like GPT4, text-to-image models like DALL-E 2, or any other models. The zero-knowledge quality of these proofs allows us to conceal sections of the input or the model if necessary. A excellent example of this would be using a machine learning model on sensitive data and allowing the user to know the outcome of model inference on their data without disclosing their input to any third party.</p>



<p>Older machine learning platforms often ask developers to submit their model architectures for performance verification to the host. This may lead to a number of issues, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intellectual Property Loss: Disclosing the whole model architecture may reveal important trade secrets or inventions that developers would like to keep hidden.</li>



<li>Lack of transparency: The assessment method may be opaque, and participants may be unable to check how their model compares to others.</li>



<li>Concerns with data privacy: Sharing models trained on sensitive data may unintentionally divulge information about the underlying data, infringing on privacy standards and legislation.</li>



<li>These difficulties have necessitated the development of methods to secure the privacy of machine learning models and their training data.</li>
</ul>



<p>ZK presents a potential way to addressing the issues that standard ML systems confront. ZKML, by using the power of ZK, delivers a privacy-preserving solution with the following benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Model Privacy: Developers may take part in validation without revealing the whole model architecture, preserving their intellectual property.</li>



<li>Transparent verification: ZK can evaluate model performance without disclosing the model&#8217;s internals, allowing for a transparent and trustless assessment procedure.</li>



<li>Data privacy: To guarantee that sensitive information is not disclosed, ZK may be used to validate private data using public models or private models using public data.</li>



<li>Incorporating ZK into the ML process creates a safe and privacy-preserving platform that tackles conventional ML&#8217;s shortcomings. This not only encourages the use of machine learning in the privacy company, but it also draws experienced Web2 developers to investigate the potential inside the Web3 ecosystem.</li>
</ul>



<p>Zkonduit&#8217;s ezkl library, which enables you to construct ZK proofs of ML models exported via ONNX, is another endeavor striving to improve the state of the art of ZKML systems. This allows any ML engineer to generate ZK proofs of their models&#8217; inference steps and prove the result to any verifier.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The ZKML community was founded in the second half of 2022 by a number of different teams and people working in the ZKML area (including Worldcoin).</p>



<p>Many organizations are striving to improve ZK technology by developing optimized hardware to accelerate ZK proof computation, especially for resource-intensive operations like the prover and verifier algorithms. Because of advancements in specialized hardware, proof system design (proof size, verification time, proof generation time, etc.) and more performant ZK protocol implementations, it will be able to prove larger models on less powerful computers in less time as ZK technology advances.</p>



<p>ZKML is still in its early stages of development, but it has started to provide significant benefits, and we can expect to see more inventive ZKML applications on the chain. We can imagine a future where privacy-preserving machine learning becomes the standard as ZKML evolves.</p>
