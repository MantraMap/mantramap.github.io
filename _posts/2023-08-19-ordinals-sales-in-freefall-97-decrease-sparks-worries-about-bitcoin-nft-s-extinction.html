This once-flourishing market has seen its sales volume dwindle to a mere $3 million in mid-August, marking a jaw-dropping 97% decline within a span of just three months.  The data paints a stark picture: June witnessed a 76.5% plunge, with sales volume hitting $100 million, while July followed suit with a 66.9% drop, settling at $35 million. As August unfolds, a bleak 91.4% drop to $3 million in sales volume underscores the challenges facing Bitcoin Ordinals.

Transactions have dwindled by a staggering 88.1% in August, sinking to a mere 20,571 compared to the robust 832,648 transactions witnessed just three months prior.  This sharp decline in transactions suggests that the interest in trading Bitcoin Ordinals is diminishing, casting a shadow of doubt on its long-term viability and relevance within the competitive NFT landscape.
