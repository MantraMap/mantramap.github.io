<p>After performing moderately well in April, albeit all the FOMO and regulatory scares, Bitcoin stepped into May with its head down, dropping over 5% during the first half Monday, May 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>



<p>Over the past six or so weeks, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has had difficulties pushing above the $30,000 resistance range despite showing a lot of strength in the first week of April as such price has been trapped in a tight squeeze.</p>



<p>Various market pundits have been trying to project Bitcoin’s behaviour this month, even as the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals <a href="https://zycrypto.com/data-highlights-massive-btc-accumulation-by-whales-as-extreme-fear-grips-bitcoin-price/">continue improving</a>. According to seasoned markets analyst Peter Brandt, Bitcoin currently sits on a &#8220;huge significance&#8221; level. On Saturday, Brandt noted that the price had reached the upper band of a range pattern, stating that a decisive break out of a particular range could significantly impact Bitcoin&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>According to Brandt, the current range pattern suggests that there is a certain price level that Bitcoin has struggled to surpass in the past two years. However, if Bitcoin breaks above this level, it could signal a major shift in the market.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The confining range has been in place for some time now, but a decisive breakout would have huge significance,</em> “he said, adding, <em>“My bias is that Bitcoin will bury all pretenders eventually. There will be only one &#8216;King of the Hill&#8217;, and it will be Bitcoin.”</em></p>



<p>And Brandt is not alone in his analysis. Caleb Franzen, a research analyst at Cubic Analytics, also noted that Bitcoin needs to break out decisively or get rejected at its current range before he can make any major decisions.</p>



<p>“<em>People are predicting that Bitcoin dominance will skyrocket. Here&#8217;s my take: I don&#8217;t know yet b/c we haven&#8217;t seen a decisive breakout or rejection on this range. Once we get clarity around this major resistance level, I&#8217;ll listen to what the market is telling me,”</em> Franzen tweeted Sunday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80395" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x575.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-300x168.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768x431.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Today, crypto pundit “Titan of Crypto” shared a Bitcoin % Dominance chart, forming a monthly “W bullish structure”. According to him, the structure suggests dominance could soon break out of the range. He further noted that if April’s monthly candle closes above the range (which it has), Bitcoin’s dominance could increase, tagging along with the price. He, however, warned that as Bitcoin’s season starts, “alts might suffer a bit.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the week starts, some analysts expect Bitcoin to falter further due to the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting Wednesday, which will likely raise interest rates by 25 basis points.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at  $28,110, down 4.45% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin’s weekly average transactions reached its highest point since Dec 2017, totalling about 396,000 this past week, according to IntoTheBlock.</li>



<li>This stat comes after Bitcoin Ordinals hit a daily mint record of 223,000 in April, with text-based inscriptions dominating the network.</li>



<li>Grayscale and several other firms have backed the Ordinals project to shape the bullish trend of Bitcoin in Q2 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-project-surpasses-11000-nft-mints-in-weeks-amid-criticisms-from-bitcoin-maxis/">Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals</a>, popularly referred to as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are steering a new pathway for the growth of the Bitcoin network despite the harsh criticism from a section of the community in its development phase.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s average weekly transactions have hit levels not recorded in six years, according to new data from crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock. On Sunday, the seven-day <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1652553421323399171?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">average</a> of BTC stood at 396,000, its highest mark since Dec 2017.</p>



<p>The surge in transaction volumes can be linked to the rising popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals, a project launched five months ago amid widespread criticisms. Daily inscriptions on Ordinals hit a new record on Saturday with over 223,000 NFTs, according to a Dune report.  </p>



<p>This daily figure above 200,000 was the first after showing string signs in April, breaking its record four times, including 72,000 daily inscriptions and 193,000 inscriptions on April 2 and April 23rd, respectively. </p>



<p>Text-based Ordinals inscriptions also dominated the ecosystem compared to image-based which differs from the popular Ethereum NFT model. On Saturday, out of the 233,000 inscriptions 99.,8% were text-based, while 273 inscriptions, 0.1, were image-based.</p>



<p>Within its first five months, the total number of Bitcoin Ordinals crossed 2 million on April 26 and further passed 2.5 million Ordinals 2 days later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-path-for-bitcoin">A new path for Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Despite criticisms from Bitcoin Maxis and other commentators on the development of NFTs on the Bitcoin network, the Ordinal project has proved doubters wrong, with many tipping marking it as ‘instrumental’ in the next bull run.</p>



<p>Digital asset investment firm Grayscale has marked increased miner fees and developer enthusiasm as two positive ways Ordinals could impact the network.</p>



<p>“<em>The advent of ordinals has led to an increase in total fees paid to miners, which could potentially establish a sustainable baseline level of transaction fees to incentivize miners,” </em>the firm wrote.</p>



<p>The total amount now paid to miners stands at $6.6 million at press time, giving miners the necessary boosts at survival. The firm also believes the project would be key to attracting a new user base to the network, just like NFTs in Ethereum.</p>



<p>“<em>We believe the emergence of ordinals is likely to promote a development-oriented community and culture in support of the Bitcoin network.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Digital asset exchanges have recorded a net inflow of 17,500 ETH worth about $375 million a few days after the Shanghai upgrade.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coinbase has recorded $28 million worth of ETH sales since allowing its users to apply for their staked assets following the upgrade.&nbsp;</li>



<li>ETH surged past $2,100 days after Shapella before falling below $2,000, leaving both bullish and bearish analysts at loggerheads. </li>
</ul>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) slipped from its 11-month high above $2,100, now struggling below $2,000 with more users accessing their staked assets on exchanges.</p>



<p>According to recent data from CryptoQuant, a total of 1,101,079 ETH were deposited into digital asset exchanges, while 921,579 ETH was withdrawn in four days post-Shanghai. The net inflow of 179,500 tokens between April 13 to 17 becomes the largest recorded in a four-day window.</p>



<p>Huge transfers of assets to exchanges are an indicator of investors&#8217; preparation to sell, which reduces the asset’s value, although this is not always the case.</p>



<p>The Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella, was implemented on the Ethereum network on April 12, giving validators access to their staked assets and rewards for the first time since the Merge event of last year, which transitioned it to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. </p>



<p>With over 18 million ETH worth approximately $36 billion staked on the network, several analysts expected a price drop as validators get access to their assets for the first time in months. The reverse happened after ETH hit an 11-month high above $2,100.</p>



<p>A price drop below $2,000 coupled with investors transferring assets to exchanges may have a bearish outlook to many. However, several others opine that in the long run, more assets will be staked following Shanghai.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-withdrawals-expected">More withdrawals expected&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Sequel to the price jump of ETH days after the upgrade, users sold their assets across several platforms. Coinbase, among the first exchanges to give users access to their staked assets following the upgrade, has recorded over $28 million in sell orders. </p>



<p>Due to the legal challenges, Kraken faced with the SEC leading to a $30 million settlement, including shutting down its staking service, Kraken now leads the de-staking queue. On-chain data shows that the exchange leads the pack with over 60% of withdrawal requests. </p>



<p>Digital asset market research platform Kaiko stated that as Binance now allows users to withdraw staked assets, it could “<em>result in more sale pressures.”</em> On April 19, Binance began processing user requests to withdraw staked ETH on its platform. </p>

<p>On April 27, Ripple released the <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/q1-2023-xrp-markets-report/">Q1 2023 XRP Markets Report</a>, highlighting several key developments in the crypto industry. Below are the key takeaways from the report.</p>



<p>XRP sales by Ripple saw a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/metrics-point-to-strong-bullish-cases-for-xrp-in-2023-as-landmark-ruling-in-ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-nears/">massive increase</a> in Q1 2023, with net sales reaching a whopping $361.06 million compared to the previous quarter&#8217;s $226.31 million. And that&#8217;s not all – XRP Ledger on-chain activity also experienced a surge, with decentralized exchange volumes increasing by 34% to $115 million in Q1 compared to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-on-demand-liquidity-soars-to-record-highs-as-xrp-army-eager-to-receive-verdict-on-sec-lawsuit/">Q4 2022</a>. Meanwhile, XRP&#8217;s average daily volume on centralized exchanges jumped 46% to $1 billion from $698 million.</p>



<p>But the excitement doesn&#8217;t stop there. The EU, UK, and UAE have proposed new regulatory frameworks for crypto that could change the game for the entire industry. The Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/industry-leaders-upbeat-as-eu-parliament-passes-much-anticipated-mica-regulation/">passed</a> in the EU, resulting in a brand new licensing regime in the 27 member states. The UK government has introduced comprehensive regulatory proposals for a new regulatory regime for crypto, building on prior proposals focusing on stablecoins and the financial promotion of tokens. And in the UAE, a new law governing virtual assets has been passed, setting up the country’s initial regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies at the federal level.</p>



<p>Despite the broader financial turmoil, XRP markets saw an impressive 46% increase in volumes in Q1, likely due to a combination of market recovery and large volatile events that tend to spike volumes. BTC and ETH spot volumes were up 12% and down 12%, respectively, QoQ, while derivatives volumes for BTC and ETH were up 14% and 20%, respectively, QoQ.</p>



<p>Regarding global regulation, several countries are moving forward with new legislation and licensing regimes to clarify crypto. Australia’s central bank and Treasury held private meetings with international crypto industry executives on the nation&#8217;s future of crypto and regulation. Hong Kong and Australia also opened public consultations on proposed requirements for virtual asset trading platform operators and token mapping.</p>



<p>The US&#8217;s approach to crypto regulation focused on regulation by enforcement instead of rulemaking, as Coinbase and Paxos received Wells notices from the SEC alleging various securities laws violations and lack of registration. SEC Chair Gensler issued a broad warning to yield-earning crypto platforms to comply after Kraken shuttered its staking service, to which Commissioner Peirce denounced her agency&#8217;s actions.</p>



<p>In Q1, Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature, and Credit Suisse faced critical blows, revealing the extent of the opacity and interconnectedness across global financial and crypto markets. The fall of SVB and the unexpected shutdown of Signature Bank meant that much of the crypto world was de-banked in the US overnight. USDC had a short-term liquidity-driven de-peg down to $0.85 on some exchanges, recovering to $1 within a few days, but market confidence in essential on-off ramps was shaken.</p>



<p>Despite the turmoil, those who build on a battle-tested foundation of prudent risk management and real-world utility will continue growing once the world emerges from the current climate. Macro uncertainty is set to continue in Q2, but many in the industry have lauded Europe&#8217;s efforts to regulate crypto responsibly.</p>



<p>And last but not least, developers have proposed a new interoperability standard (XLS-38d) for the XRP Ledger, enabling users to transfer digital assets and data between blockchains regardless of underlying protocol or programming language. The future is looking bright for XRP and the crypto industry as a whole!</p>

<p>Despite being off to a good start this month, Ethereum has witnessed a significant pullback.</p>



<p>Mid this month, the cryptocurrency surged to a ten-month high of $2,140 thanks to the hype around the Shapella upgrade before collapsing by roughly 17%. Nonetheless, whereas such pullbacks are historically appreciated, especially considering investors often “buy the rumour and sell the news”, some signs suggest it might be a temporary decline.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sharks-and-whales-splurge-on-ether"><strong>Sharks And Whales Splurge On Ether</strong></h2>



<p>According to crypto analytics firm Santiment, there has been significant growth in the number of whales and sharks in the past 12 months. In a Friday <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1651707112505090048">tweet</a>, the firm noted that there are now 380 more addresses holding 1,000 or more Ethereum (ETH) compared to last year, representing a 5.7% rise in large-volume investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="633" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-1024x633.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80350" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-1024x633.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-300x186.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-768x475.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-356x220.png 356w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-712x440.png 712w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the past, such high accumulation levels have often signalled significant price movements, typically in a favourable direction. Additionally, this surge in accumulation usually occurs at the same time as price bottoms.</p>



<p>The increase in ETH whales and sharks can be attributed to the current market conditions. Ethereum&#8217;s price is still 60% down since its all-time high in May 2021, creating a prime opportunity for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-staking-for-ethereum-soars-post-shanghai/">institutional investors</a> and high-net-worth individuals to accumulate more of the digital asset at a discounted price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquid Staking Soars</strong></h2>



<p>Moreover, the overall market volatility and the recent Shanghai upgrade have resulted in a noteworthy change in investor attitude towards Ethereum, recognizing the blockchain network&#8217;s potential for the future. On April 28, crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock shared the chart below showing that liquid staking derivatives have been on the rise post-Shanghai. This week, Lido and RocketPool saw significant gains in ETH staking market share, while several US-based CEXes experienced declines.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="925" height="654" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80349" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22.png 925w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22-300x212.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22-768x543.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22-100x70.png 100w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22-200x140.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></figure>



<p>Furthermore, data from Dune Analytics shows that investors have deposited over 571,000 ETH tokens worth over $1 billion into staking contracts. According to crypto analysts, most of these deposits were made through institutional staking service providers and also from investors reinvesting their rewards after withdrawing them.</p>



<p>With Shanghai behind, investors are even more stoked about what lies ahead for the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Apart from numerous upgrades aimed at improving the scalability, security, accessibility and efficiency of Ethereum, developers seem to be stopping at nothing to tackle one of the network&#8217;s biggest problems-gas fees.</p>



<p>Builders have been focusing on scaling solutions such as the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), which allows some data (particularly signatures) not to be included on-chain, saving on gas costs. In a recent <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/03/31/zkmulticlient.html">blog</a>, Vitalik Buterin noted that “the first steps of the transition may happen sooner than we expect” once we switch to Verkle trees and clients start gradually using ZK-EVMs.</p>



<p>At the time of reporting, Ether was trading at $1,906, up 0.43% in the past 24 hours. The price needs to surge and close above the $2,100 resistance for more upside. </p>

<p>The SEC may have played its cards wrong in its move against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-explains-reason-for-absence-of-xrp-in-the-liquidity-hub/">Ripple</a> about three years ago, J.W. Verret, associate professor of law at George Mason Law School, has said.</p>



<p>In an interview with Crypto Law founder and pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton, Verret expressed his admiration for Ripple’s defence team, particularly praising CEO Brad Garlinghouse for his determination to face the SEC head-on.</p>



<p><em>“I don’t think they saw that coming,</em> and I think they probably expected there would be a settlement,<em> and I think they underestimated the fight inside of Brad,”</em> Verret said on Thursday when asked about his opinion as to why the SEC picked the fight with Ripple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>I’ve learned there’s a lot of sand inside that fella, and I admire that. And he’s doing a service for everyone in crypto,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>And Verret might be right. In a July 2022 interview, Brad Garlinghouse recognized the financial burden that the company had faced due to its ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time, Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple&#8217;s legal expenses might exceed $100 million by the time the lawsuit concludes. He, however, expressed his commitment to carry on, noting that the expenses are worth it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-supreme-court-could-tame-sec-s-overreach-on-crypto"><strong>Supreme Court Could Tame SEC’s Overreach on Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, Verret further shared his thoughts on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">what lies ahead</a> as the high-stakes securities lawsuit continues. According to him, no matter how it resolves, there&#8217;s a good chance it&#8217;ll be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) by both parties.</p>



<p>The pundit, however, suggested that the crypto industry would stand to gain more if the matter is resolved by the highest court, noting that judges there would offer a remedy to all the regulatory uncertainty brought by regulators.</p>



<p><em>“I think it’s a perfect fit if you (ripple) are willing to go the distance to go SCOTUS. I think the supreme court will be willing to&nbsp; take a look at crypto and use the SEC&#8217;s overreach in this area as a vehicle to transform administrative law itself,” </em>he went on.</p>



<p>During a separate interview on the Unchained Podcast Friday, Verret noted he expects the lawsuit to conclude in the district court “relatively soon, in a matter of months or weeks.” According to him, Ripple could lose or win based on the fair notice defence, in which case it wouldn&#8217;t have a lot of implications for the rest of crypto” and the SEC lets it lie. However, if the firm wins on the Howey test, the SEC is “certainly going to appeal,” he said.</p>

<li>Venture Capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has stressed that the government’s stance toward cryptocurrency regulation in the country is stifling innovation in the industry.</li>



<li>The United States, home to 40% of digital asset developers in 2018, has seen that number slide below 30% in 2022. </li>



<li>The firm tips clearly defined regulations and an approach by regulatory agencies that protect users while encouraging innovation in the sector.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>As more digital asset firms become victims to the bottleneck approach of United States regulators, several industry experts have bemoaned the current reality, with some accusing regulators of ‘killing the sector.’</p>



<p>In its periodic State of Crypto report, a16z, the investment arm of Andreessen Horowitz, stated the recent string of enforcement actions by regulators is gradually taking digital asset innovation away from the United States. The report highlights how dwindling leadership leads to uncertainty in the space. </p>



<p>According to the report, the U.S. was the fore of crypto innovation in 2018, hosting 40% of developers. That figure has since dropped over the years and is under 30% in 2022 as more creators look elsewhere to protect their investments. </p>



<p>Attributing the decline to poor regulation, the report pointed out that innovators are now moving out of the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Banning new business models or technologies undermines American values and drives innovation and jobs elsewhere. Legal businesses and their customers deserve access to financial services and lawful protections, from banking relationships to data privacy,” </em>the report stated.</p>



<p>Furthermore, traffic from digital asset websites based in the US dropped for the third consecutive year. In 2022, websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko recorded only 15% of website visits from the US, dropping from 23% in 2019.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-solution-to-the-predicament">A solution to the predicament&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Regulators must protect investors and rid the market of scams and dubious players. However, the method by which this is done can lead to more problems. This is the current reality in the US as industry executives continue to accuse regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of ‘killing innovation’ in the sector. </p>



<p>An example of this is the SEC&#8217;s decision to go after digital asset staking, which led to the Commission slamming Coinbase with a Wells Notice and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-crackdown-on-krakens-staking-program-puts-other-players-on-notice/">placing</a> a $30 million fine on Kraken for its staking-as-service program. To solve these problems, the report calls for new regulations and agencies&#8217; guidance.</p>



<p>A dearth of wholesome regulations has led to both the SEC and executives being at loggerheads leading to unending litigations like the SEC and Ripple saga.</p>

<ul>
<li>Solana recorded a couple of huge wins this week alongside the Helium migration to start the second quarter on high.</li>



<li>NFTs on Solana remain a major driving force as daily transactions reach an all-time high, pushing its sales volume to 14% of the market share.</li>



<li>The price of SOL has soared over 125% this year, trading at $22.1, leaving pundits with many speculations regarding its run.</li>
</ul>



<p>Solana (SOL) bulls are in a frenzy following the launch of the first Web3-powered smartphone, which makes users acquire digital assets alongside minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) effortlessly.</p>



<p>After the Saga smartphone launch, the community celebrated the Grayscale Solana Trust Shares trading, with its price reacting positively. Powered by the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-smartphone-set-for-early-may-sales-here-are-its-exciting-features/">Solana blockchain, Saga</a> has received a lot of good reviews in its first week on the market, although there has been slight talk about its $1,000 price.</p>



<p>Daily trading volumes of SOL are up to a little over $500 million in addition to the recent Grayscale Trust, which stands at $2.9 million in digital assets under management (AUM). SOL rose 29% to hit a monthly high of $26 before a price correction. This year, it has gained a significant 125%, wiping away sharp losses of last year caused by network downtimes.</p>



<p>As SOL continues to grow alongside the broader market, its NFTs volumes continue to surge significantly and are billed for more growth following the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/helium-finally-migrates-to-the-solana-network-mints-nearly-1-million-nfts-to-mark-milestone/">migration</a> of Helium to its network with 991,000 NFT mints.</p>



<p>On the flip side, some pundits warn that the bullish outlook of SOL in price does not reflect in the derivatives market and may lead to further price correction in Q2 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nfts-to-the-rescue">NFTs to the rescue</h2>



<p>During last year’s turmoil, NFTs were a major driving force of SOL, described by many as ‘<em>fueling DeFi on the network.”</em> Daily NFT transactions of Solana have hit a record high this month, although other DeFi activities, including lending, staking, and decentralized exchange, continue to struggle.</p>



<p>Solana’s NFT market share has grown to 14% from 6% last year, trailing only Ethereum, according to a report from Delphi Digital. Its new NFT Compressor technology released this month makes it easier and cheaper to mint tokens creating more room for expansion. </p>



<p>The technology reduces the cost of minting a million NFTs to $110 and is undergoing tests with the Helium 991,000 NFT announcement. As NFT activities continue on an upward trajectory in Solana, it is still unlikely to see how it will push other DeFi metrics compared to similar networks.</p>

<p>Polygon (MATIC), the Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has recently witnessed a significant movement of tokens from one of the largest self-custody addresses. According to data from Santiment, a blockchain analytics platform, the whale address transferred 60 million MATIC tokens to an exchange, causing the network&#8217;s exchange supply to rise to a 5-week high of 7.92%.</p>



<p>While this may raise concerns, it is worth noting that the whale address still holds a colossal MATIC stash. This means that the movement of 60 million tokens represents only a small portion of the whale&#8217;s total holdings. Nevertheless, any significant movement of tokens by whales, known to hold large amounts of cryptocurrency, can considerably impact market prices.</p>



<p>Traders should be cautious when such <a href="https://zycrypto.com/massive-shiba-inu-whale-moves-over-180-billion-coins-to-exchanges-what-could-go-wrong-for-shib/">whale exchange inflows</a> happen, as they could signal a potential sell-off or a loss of confidence in the cryptocurrency. However, it is essential to remember that the movement of tokens by a single whale address does not necessarily reflect the sentiments of the entire market. Therefore, analysing the situation in the context of the overall market conditions is crucial before making any decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-does-this-mean-for-matic"><strong>So What Does This Mean for MATIC?</strong></h2>



<p>In related news, the price of MATIC had fallen below the $1 mark, prompting many investors to take a closer look at the on-chain activity. According to data from IntoTheBlock, a blockchain analytics firm, 32.56k addresses purchased MATIC at an average price of $0.918. This suggests that if prices were to return to those levels, investor interest might pick up once again.</p>



<p>The dip in price may be an opportunity for traders to enter the market at a lower cost, as the long-term outlook for Polygon remains <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sticking-to-core-fundamentals-saved-polygon-from-ftx-calamity-co-founder-sandeep-nailwal/">positive</a>. The project has seen significant growth in recent months, with many developers and users flocking to its scalable and efficient network. Moreover, Polygon has partnered with numerous <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygons-matic-maintains-upsurge-following-partnership-with-hamilton-lane/">high-profile </a>projects, including Aave, SushiSwap, and Curve, which further validate its potential as a top-tier cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The recent movement of tokens by a whale address and the dip in the price of MATIC should be viewed in the context of the broader market conditions. While caution is advised, investors should also consider the long-term potential of Polygon and the increasing interest from developers and users alike.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride this week. After tapping a ten-month high of $30,800 last week, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization embarked on a downward trajectory shedding around 9% in the past seven days. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $29,225 after a 2% drop in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>Similarly, Ether faced a drawdown, giving back just over 10% in the past seven days to trade at $1,913 at press time. Other cryptocurrencies also retreated, with XRP leading in the top 10 coins by market cap with an 11% slump.</p>



<p>Notably, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-army-anticipates-stellar-dogecoin-rally-to-the-moon-as-dogeday-approaches/">Dogecoin</a> also dropped sharply. At press time, the world’s most popular meme had shed over 8% in the past 24 hours despite posting sizeable gains Thursday as billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched a test rocket only for it to explode shortly after.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-could-drop-lower-pundit-warns"><strong>Bitcoin Could Drop Lower, Pundit Warns</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, as the market ends the week with its head down, various experts have cautioned that Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptos could slide lower.</p>



<p>According to Michael Michaël van de Poppe, founder of crypto trading firm Eight Global, Bitcoin “is currently showing weakness” and could drop to $26,200, where he sees the next support level. In a Friday tweet, the pundit warned that Bitcoin has lost &#8220;one crucial level&#8221; in its recent decline.</p>



<p><em>“Bitcoin is currently showing weakness. Broke back in the range, lost one of the crucial levels. The final crucial level is at $27,600. Could take liquidity beneath, but needs a fast recovery. If not, and no break of $28,800, then I suspect we&#8217;ll see $26,200,”</em> said Michael.</p>



<p>According to crypto analyst “Crazzyblockk” from Cryptoquant, Bitcoin risks dropping <a href="https://zycrypto.com/long-traders-feel-the-pain-as-bitcoins-dramatic-fall-to-29000-leads-to-241-million-liquidations/">even lower</a>. In a post today, the pundit highlighted Bitcoin’s UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution chart showing Bitcoin’s 1-week to 1-month age bands.</p>



<p>UTXO is a set of realized prices along with age bands. The metrics help us to overview each cohort&#8217;s holding behaviour by overlaying a set of different realized prices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="567" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-19.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80285" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-19.png 900w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-19-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-19-768x484.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>He noted that the $28.3k price level was a valuable zone for the bands, describing it as “a psychological level for a realized price.” According to him, the $28k level will determine the reaction of the traders in this price age and the need to take short-term profit from the asset’s recent rally.</p>



<p><em>“If Bitcoin receives a reaction from the short-term at these levels, it will be a sign of renewed interest in holding and entry by these people, and if this level breaking, these players will continue to sell,”</em> he said adding, <em>“If this level breaking, the oncoming valuable level is in the range of 25-23k.”</em></p>

<p>That said, despite the recent drop in price, many still believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, especially with the biting inflation and growing discontentment with global monetary systems.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, managed to end the week on a strong note, defying bearish pressure and a wave of negative regulatory news.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency started the week on a promising note but faced extreme volatility Wednesday before stabilizing as reports of the collapse of First Republic Bank shares sparked fresh <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-price-makes-slight-gains-in-the-wake-of-first-republic-banks-imminent-price-fall/">banking crisis fears</a> in the United States. Unfounded rumours of imminent bitcoin sales by the US government and Mt Gox creditors further compounded the negative sentiment.</p>



<p>Arkham Intelligence, the firm accused of sending the false Bitcoin sales alerts, however, came out denying any wrongdoing, noting that the mistake could have arisen from an alert sent by a third party. The incident coincided with a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price, which fell 6% in about one hour.</p>



<p>Besides interest rate concerns amid sky-high inflation, regulatory pressure has also been mounting on the crypto sector. Earlier this week, Binance CEO Changapeng Zhao <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/technology/binance-crypto-crackdown.html">reportedly</a> hired a team of defence lawyers to represent him personally as the exchange faces scrutiny from multiple US investigators.</p>



<p>On Thursday, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, stated that the exchange “will defend itself vigorously in litigation if it comes to that” referencing the wells notice it recently received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These moves could compel more crypto players in the US to fight back, with major financial regulators remaining adamant about engaging them through dialogue, according to some industry experts.</p>



<p>That said, despite Bitcoin remaining strong in the face of mounting regulatory concerns and FUD, some pundits have, however warned that it could still plunge lower. According to Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist at InTheMoneyStocks, crypto winter may still be far from over. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2INAcG5AB1M&amp;ab_channel=KitcoNEWS">interview</a> with Kitco, the pundit shared his predictions for Bitcoin, noting that $30,500 could be a very hard resistance to break. He warned investors against falling for Bitcoin’s recent resurgence, suggesting it&#8217;s a bull trap.</p>



<p><em>“Don&#8217;t be fooled. I&#8217;ve been through many bear markets and commodities in the stock market in crypto in my trading career and sometimes it turns out to be the lipstick on the pig here,</em> and it could still roll over and head lower. So, I still think there&#8217;s a chance for $12,000 to$13 000- maybe even nine thousand,<em>”</em> he said.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at about $29,215, up roughly 0.76% over the past 24 hours. In the past week, the cryptocurrency has gained about 4.55%, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, has taken to Twitter to refute the accuracy of his fortune, as reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>. CZ indicated that the numbers are wrong, and his net worth is nowhere near the figure reported by the mainstream media.</p>



<p>Although Binance does not disclose its annual revenues and CZ’s stake in the exchange, Bloomberg estimated that Zhao is worth $28.2 billion and ranked him 3rd in the top 25 finance billionaires worldwide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-rich-is-cz"><strong>How Rich Is CZ?</strong></h2>



<p>Binance&#8217;s CEO claims to be worth way less than what Bloomberg estimated.</p>



<p>In an April 27 <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1651467819400278016">tweet</a>, CZ pointed out that Bloomberg’s latest finance-rich list had inaccurate data about his crypto fortune. Per the publication’s list, the Binance boss’s net worth stands at a whopping $28.2 billion, ranking him the third richest finance billionaire in the world. Bloomberg also estimated Binance’s annual revenue at around $12 billion.</p>



<p>“Numbers all wrong. I don&#8217;t have anywhere near as much. Don&#8217;t know why they do this,” Zhao tweeted. The crypto billionaire also wrote “4”, suggesting his net worth should be somewhere around Dan Gilbert’s $19.4 billion and Uday Kotak’s $13 billion.</p>



<p>In a follow-up tweet, CZ said he is a “small potato in a small (but growing) industry” when a Twitter user suggested the Binance founder is richer than Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>Well-known within the cryptosphere, Zhao began receiving more news coverage last November during the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange FTX. Contrary to popular belief, CZ clarified in his latest tweet that he had never viewed the now-defunct FTX as a rival. “We welcome more (well-run) exchanges in the space,” he added.</p>



<p>Following the implosion of FTX, Zhao has become one the most prominent names left standing in the crypto world, and Binance’s business now considerably surpasses every other digital asset exchange by huge margins.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Zhao is spotlighting reporting inaccuracies by mainstream media. The CEO has previously described articles published by Forbes or Bloomberg as FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>Binance and CZ are currently facing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">lawsuit </a>from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on allegations of violating derivatives laws and helping users conceal their locations to evade trading restrictions.</p>

<ul>
<li>The bridging solution is enhanced with fast finality and improved user experience.</li>



<li>Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta went live in March as an open-source, permissionless, and public platform.</li>
</ul>



<p>Polygon, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has integrated a PoS bridge to its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), according to an April 26 statement.</p>



<p>Polygon Bridge for zkEVM has almost the same user experience as that of Polygon PoS but with some enhancements, including a visible progress bar, a transaction panel with colour-coded completion status, a time estimate for pending transactions, and a filter.</p>



<p>Also important to note is the improved finality of the zkEVM Polygon Bridge, reportedly allowing users to claim funds on the Ethereum mainnet in between 30-60 seconds. Per the developers, bridges using zero-knowledge technology are better than competing technologies because they are based entirely on smart contracts. Additionally, no mapping is required.</p>



<p><em>‘‘Once a user triggers the bridging transaction, the token being bridged will automatically be mapped. This is a major UX improvement compared to other chains, which require users to map tokens before bridging – a process that can take hours or even days,’’ Polygon <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/announcing-polygon-bridge-for-polygon-zkevm-2?utm_source=zkevm-bridge-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog">wrote</a>. </em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zkevm-enhancing-polygon-s-scalability-of-ethereum"><strong>zkEVM enhancing Polygon’s scalability of Ethereum</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon had its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) mainnet beta <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygons-zkevm-mainnet-beta-goes-live-unlocking-limitless-possibilities-for-ethereum-compatible-dapps/">launch</a> last month, a significant milestone in the network aimed at improving the scalability of the decentralized applications (dApps) built on Ethereum.</p>



<p>zkEVM is enabled with zero-knowledge proofs, a technology allowing data validation without revealing the data itself. Polygon developers tout the technology as key in enhancing the security and privacy of dApps cost-effectively and efficiently.</p>



<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin endorsed zkEVM, becoming the first to complete a successful transaction of 0.005 ETH sent to a random address. Some of the dApps using zkEVM include Lens and Balancer. Infrastructure providers like ANKR, The Graph, and Alchemy also use the platform.</p>



<p>Polygon is also making strides in other areas around zero-knowledge technology, recently introducing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-hits-it-big-with-new-web3-id-service-based-on-zero-knowledge-proofs/">decentralized identity solution</a> giving developers tools to create self-sovereign, decentralized, and private identity solutions based on zero-knowledge proofs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Circle launches USDC cross-chain transfer protocol across Ethereum and Avalanche, cutting off the use of third-party bridges. </li>



<li>The team behind the project says the move will ease the user experience, improve market liquidity, and aid capital efficiency.</li>



<li>The CEO of Circle expects a turnaround amid plunging market cap and regulatory concerns in the past few months.</li>
</ul>



<p>The race for interoperability among stablecoins has heightened in recent years as networks seek to make digital ecosystems less fragmented and exclusive.</p>



<p>Circle, the company behind the USD Coin (USDC), has released a mainnet protocol that allows users to transfer USDC between Avalanche and Ethereum networks seamlessly. The Cross Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) will work without third-party bridges meaning that users will no longer be required to deposit their assets with a Circle partner to transfer assets between networks.</p>



<p>According to the team, unlike traditional bridges, this transfer protocol burns all tokens and issues new ones on the receiving blockchain. Assets will not need to be stored on the sending chain before being claimed on the other network.</p>



<p>Joao Geginatto, the vice president of Circle, has expressed faith in the protocol stating that it will improve liquidity, ease user experience and help capital efficiency in DeFi.</p>



<p>“<em>With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience, and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe, and fungible asset in native USDC.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>According to Circle, several top cross-chain protocols, like MetaMask, Cela, LayerZero, Wormhole, etc, have pledged to integrate the new transfer protocol.</p>



<p>The CCTP solves the fragmentation and exclusive problems attributed to most chains. Furthermore, the issues linked with unofficial versions of USDC in several networks due to bridge issues will gradually become history with the CCTP as the official way of transferring the asset.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With developers churning out new upgrades and features, USDC has a chance to reclaim its over $50 billion market cap. USDC has been in the waters for months due to technical and regulatory issues. In March, the stablecoin lost its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/usdc-stablecoin-loses-dollar-peg-following-collapse-of-major-banking-partner/">peg</a> after the revelation that it had $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank in the wake of the bank’s saga.</p>



<p>To compound the stablecoin woes, it has consistently lost market share to its rival Tether in Q1 2023. Amidst the uptick in the digital asset market in the past three months leading to a market cap of $1.2 trillion, USDC recorded losses of 26.9% while Terra gained 20.9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire blamed the dwindling market share of USDC on the current state of crypto regulation in the US as the SEC crackdown continues.</p>
