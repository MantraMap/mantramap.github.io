            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to CoinGecko research, the residents of the United States seem the most interested in memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). India and the United Kingdom rank respectively second and third. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite being the first memecoin, DOGE has lost its leading position in numerous countries. Morocco is the only nation in the top 10 where Elon Musk&#8217;s favorite digital asset captured the most interest. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Trends This Year</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CoinGecko&#8217;s study </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/top-meme-coin-countries?utm_campaign=Data%2BVisualization&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that over 23% of the global interest towards memecoins comes from the USA. The most popular such asset for locals is Shiba Inu (60.7%), followed by Pepe Coin (11.8%), Bonk, and Volt Inu.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indians are close to the top, accounting for 20.3% of the overall craze. Shiba Inu is once again the token that generates the most interest, whereas Baby Doge Coin comes in second place. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The United Kingdom &#8211; the only representative from Europe on the top 10 list &#8211; ranks third, making up about 16% of the global interest in memecoins. However, CoinGecko did not outline which assets are most desirable for Britons.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Floki Inu (FLOKI), which has been up by over 300% YTD, is another coin that people find intriguing. In fact, it is the most interesting one in the Philippines and Nigeria. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-pepe/" data-wpel-link="internal">PEPE</a> &#8211; the recent sensation in the crypto sector &#8211; reaches the top in Canada, accounting for nearly 27% of the local interest. It saw the light of day in the middle of April and its market capitalization neared $1 trillion this week.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dogecoin &#8211; the cryptocurrency created as a joke in 2013 &#8211; seems to have lost steam this year. It receives 61.1% of the interest in Morocco, making the African nation the only one where Musk&#8217;s favorite token climbs up the leaderboard.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DOGE Rises Despite the Diminishing Interest</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While investors appear to have new favorite memecoins, DOGE remains a fundamental member of the pack. Its price has gone up by 11% YTD, and it still has a place among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Elon Musk has been a frequent player on the DOGE scene.

			            <description><![CDATA[One of the world's biggest accounting firms is integrating into the Polkadot ecosystem.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polkadot announced that Deloitte Switzerland is integrating the former&#8217;s parachain KILT blockchain technology for issuing reusable digital credentials to support KYC and KYB processes.</p>
<p>With this move, Deloitte has become the latest major enterprise partner to come to the Polkadot ecosystem. The digital credentials in question will have extensive use cases such as regulatory compliance for banking and decentralized finance (DeFi), age verification for e-commerce, private logins, and fundraising.</p>
<h2>Deloitte-KILT Integration</h2>
<p>The official <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/deloitte-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-7ea12c0e0806" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog post</a> explained that reusable KYB and KYC credentials, generated on KILT’s identity infrastructure, address the challenges associated with offering control and flexibility to the customer. As such, clients remain in control since credentials are stored in the wallet on their own devices, thereby granting them the power to choose with whom they share their credentials and which data points of the credential they make available.</p>
<p>As part of the integration, Deloitte will provide a wallet to the customer for the purpose of managing and sharing their credential. This new feature will be in the form of a browser extension, setting up, which would not require any prior knowledge of blockchain.</p>
<p>Following the development, Micha Bitterli, Head of Deloitte Managed Services, stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By offering reusable digital credentials anchored on the KILT blockchain, Deloitte is transforming verification processes for individuals and entities. Deloitte has the technology knowledge, reach and trust to issue credentials that are globally accepted.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The exec further highlighted the convenience, cost-effectiveness, and security aspects of using digital credentials and its potential to set the stage for new digital marketplaces, from e-commerce and DeFi to gaming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deloitte will be tasked with digitally signing the credentials, and the accounting firm can revoke them using blockchain technology if the conditions of the customer have altered after the credential was issued.</p>
<h2>Polkadot&#8217;s KILT</h2>
<p>Polkadot KILT&#8217;s tech is a blockchain-based decentralized identity solution that seeks to eliminate existing inefficiencies around KYC/KYB processes that can put consumer data privacy at risk. The latest integration follows yet another <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/axel-springer-and-kilt-introduce-service-for-login-based-on-web3-technology-db41c2c0ad66" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">collaboration</a> with Axel Springer, which happens to be one of Europe’s largest digital publishers, to introduce a service for login based on Web3 tech.</p>
<p>Last year, it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/kilt-launches-new-application-for-digital-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> the launch of an application called &#8211; web3name &#8211; for creating a custom name to represent users&#8217; digital identity. The goal was to ramp up the transparency of users&#8217; identities without sacrificing the privacy involved with personal data.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Armstrong said Coinbase would continue its global expansion plans as the US works towards creating a new and clear rule book for crypto.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and chief executive officer of major American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, revealed that the company is still 100% committed to the US market, despite the lack of regulatory clarity in the country.</p>
<p>The CEO’s disclosure came as a response to a question from shareholders, who were curious about Coinbase’s plans to move operations out of the US and the implications of such for customers, during an <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_downloads/2023/Coinbase-Q123-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">earnings call</a> for Q1 2023 on Thursday.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Will Not Leave the US</h2>
<p>Armstrong said he founded Coinbase in the US because he observed the prevalence of the rule of law in the country. He expressed his optimism about America eventually getting it right, as he had already noticed strong bipartisan support for Congress to create <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-launches-nationwide-pro-crypto-policy-campaign/" data-wpel-link="internal">clear legislation</a> for cryptocurrencies during his visits to Washington, DC.</p>
<blockquote><p>“So let me be clear, we’re 100% committed to the US. I founded this company in the United States because I saw that rule of law prevails here. That’s really important. And I’m actually really optimistic on the US getting this right,” the CEO said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Coinbase boss insisted that it was important for America to fix the regulatory issue because other countries, including financial hubs, were vying to take the top position in the crypto space. While supranational organizations like the European Union have passed comprehensive crypto regulation, regions like the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore have become more optimistic than the US.</p>
<p>Armstrong believes the EU’s Markets in Cryptoassets (<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/eu-lawmakers-give-final-approval-to-the-mica-crypto-legislation/" data-wpel-link="internal">MiCA</a>) regulation has placed the union and its member states in the lead.</p>
<h2>Coinbase to Go Global</h2>
<p>The Coinbase CEO further explained that as the US works towards getting its crypto regulation right, his company will continue its mandate of serving as many people as possible by exploring the global market. In line with its plans, the firm recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-officially-launches-platform-for-non-us-institutional-investors-in-bermuda-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> Coinbase International Exchange, a Bermuda-based crypto derivatives platform for non-US institutional clients.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Obviously, we have to make choices about where we’re going to allocate our capital every year. And so we do look at where we could think that can have the greatest ROI. But yes, the leading financial centers, they’re all working to create responsible crypto rules and clarity right now and the US is going to follow suit, I believe,” Armstrong added.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Wozniak believes Elon Musk's Tesla is an example of AI gone wrong, adding that the vehicle could kill.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Technology entrepreneur, philanthropist, and co-founder of multinational technology giant Apple, Steve Wozniak, has criticized Elon Musk, billionaire CEO of Tesla and also owner and CEO of Twitter, for failing to fulfill the promise to launch self-driving cars.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wozniak also said Tesla could kill, referring to the car model as an example of artificial intelligence (AI) &#8220;gone wrong.&#8221;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Wozniak Slams Musk on Failed Promise</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU9cKjWsvH0&amp;t=500s" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">recent interview with CNN</a>, Steve Wozniak was asked about his relationship with Elon Musk, with the former responding that he has neither met nor spoken to the Tesla and Twitter boss. The Apple co-founder also praised Musk&#8217;s efforts to encourage the use of electric vehicles but criticized the CEO&#8217;s failure to deliver self-driving cars.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wozniak noted that Musk first promised to introduce a self-driving car by 2016, leading Wozniak to upgrade to his model with $50,000. However, the car didn&#8217;t perform as promised. Another model with eight cameras was touted to self-drive at the end of 2017, which Wozniak also believed would happen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the tech mogul said none of the promises are even close to reality. Instead, the Apple co-founder said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If you want a study of AI gone wrong and taking a lot of claims and trying to kill you every chance it can 0 get a Tesla.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">When also asked about Musk&#8217;s management of the microblogging platform Twitter, Wozniak said he had no opinion on the matter, as he avoids social media.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Tesla chief bought and took over Twitter in 2022 after an initial termination of the deal and a lawsuit. Musk&#8217;s first action as the Twitter owner was to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-fires-top-twitter-execs-assumes-ownership/" data-wpel-link="internal">fire</a> CEO Parag Agrawal, along with some of the company&#8217;s top executives. There were also reports that hundreds of Twitter employees were looking to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hundreds-of-twitter-employees-want-to-resign-after-elon-musks-ultimatum-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">exit</a> the firm after the billionaire gave an ultimatum for workers to sign up for longer hours or leave.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Wozniak Says He&#8217;s Not Afraid of AI, Calls for Regulation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Wozniak clarified in the CNN interview that he was not worried or living in fear of AI but said that it was important to be careful about not allowing the technology to be used negatively. In March 2023, the tech entrepreneur, along with Musk and other heavyweights in the technology space, <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">signed an open letter</a> to halt the development of AI systems more advanced than GPT-4 for six months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wozniak added that powerful technology could be beneficial as well as harmful but said that something as powerful as AI can be used by bad people for &#8220;really evil purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Apple co-founder further called for regulation that could ensure that companies will have ethical concerns. However, the Apple co-founder acknowledged that global regulation was impossible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Wozniak has expressed concern about the emergence of more powerful technology tools, the philanthropist has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold/" data-wpel-link="internal">heaped praises</a> on bitcoin, calling it a &#8220;mathematical miracle&#8221; in 2021 and putting the asset above gold. In a later <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-cofounder-steve-wozniak-technology-investing-process-cryptos-nfts-predictions-2022-3?r=US&amp;IR=T" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">interview</a> in 2022, the engineer referred to bitcoin as the &#8220;only one that&#8217;s pure-gold mathematics.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[FTX's SUI token warrants may have been worth $1 billion if the crypto exchange did not sell them too early. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX missed the potential to own billions of dollars worth of SUI tokens after it sold its warrant rights to the native token of the nearly launched layer-1 blockchain too early.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the much-anticipated launch of the Sui mainnet, the price of the SUI token rose to over $3 before dropping in value. At SUI&#8217;s current price, FTX&#8217;s SUI tokens would have been worth around $1 billion.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">FTX Loses out on Gains on SUI After Selling its Token Warrants</h2>
<p dir="ltr">FTX&#8217;s management <a href="https://twitter.com/0x_tracy/status/1653758142876987393?t=pi4gxQGIrhkf1nVJ49VMFQ&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">lost</a> the opportunity for a potential $1 billion payday by selling 890 million SUI token warrants. A token warrant gives an investor the right to have assets that would be released in the future. In FTX&#8217;s case, the crypto exchange&#8217;s token warrants allowed the company to get 890,000,000 SUI upon launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2022, FTX Ventures, the venture capital arm of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, led Mysten Labs&#8217; Series B funding round. Mysten Labs, the developer of the Sui blockchain, raised $300 million at a valuation of $2 billion. Other well-known participants in the round included Binance, Coinbase, and Circle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of the investment from FTX saw the purchase of equity stakes in Mysten Labs worth $101 million and warrant rights to purchase over 800 million SUI tokens worth $1 million. However, in March 2023, FTX <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/cryptopotato.com/ftx-sells-back-stake-in-mysten-labs-report/%3famp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">announced intentions</a> to sell back its stake in Mysten Labs as well as SUI token warrant rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The repurchase deal was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230414005397/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">completed</a> in April for $96 million, slightly less than the amount FTX paid. The transaction was part of the crypto exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But FTX&#8217;s sale may have happened a little too early. On May 3, 2023, the Sui mainnet <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sui-faced-massive-volatility-minutes-after-mainnet-launch/" data-wpel-link="internal">went live</a>, with the SUI token trading at a peak of over $3.5 a few minutes after launch, according to CoinGecko. While the price of the token has fallen a lot to trade at $1.33 at the of writing, FTX&#8217;s 890 million SUI tokens would have been worth over $1 billion, which would have meant more money for the company.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Sui Blockchain&#8217;s Throughput Rate Peaks at Nearly 300,000 TPS</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Sui network is a layer-1 blockchain that utilizes the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism and boasts of increased speed and scalability.

			            <description><![CDATA[The two memecoins exploded once again after getting listed on the world's largest crypto exchange. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin initiated a leg up in the past 24 hours that brought it just inches away from the coveted $30,000 line. However, the asset is yet to breach it.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also on the rise, with ETH nearing $2,000, while SOL and UNI are up by 4% daily. However, the day belongs to PEPE and Floki Inu.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Stopped Ahead of $30K</h2>
<p>The working week, which was also the beginning of the new month, started on a bad note for bitcoin, which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-slipped-below-28k-ahead-of-fomc-meeting-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">slipped</a> by roughly two grand in hours to a multi-day low of $27,650 (on Bitstamp). However, the bulls managed to defend the asset&#8217;s position and pushed it to above $28,000 shortly after.</p>
<p>The FOMC meeting couldn&#8217;t rattle BTC&#8217;s cage either. The latest interest rate hike of 25bps, which could actually be the last one, had no immediate effect on bitcoin. Hours later, though, the asset started gaining value and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-reclaims-29k-after-feds-latest-interest-rate-hike-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">reclaimed</a> $29,000.</p>
<p>The past 24 hours saw yet another price jump from bitcoin that drove it to just under $30,000. Nevertheless, BTC has been unable to overcome that level as of now and stands around $500 below it.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization has neared $570 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins is at 47%.</p>

<h2>PEPE, FLOKI on the Run</h2>
<p>The past several days were all about one relatively new cryptocurrency &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-pepe/" data-wpel-link="internal">PEPE</a>. Launched in mid-April, it&#8217;s essentially a memecoin without real utilization. However, the crypto market is known for having such projects explode in popularity and price quickly, which has been the case with PEPE.</p>
<p>It has registered double and even triple-digit daily <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-coin-explodes-1200-weekly-while-crypto-markets-stagnate-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">surges</a> frequently, which resulted in entering the top 100 and even the top 50 digital assets by market cap as of yesterday. The latest push came when Binance <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepes-market-cap-soars-above-1-billion-following-another-60-daily-surge/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> listing PEPE, as well as Floki Inu, in its innovation zone.</p>
<p>Somewhat expectedly, FLOKI has skyrocketed as well &#8211; over 40% surge in the past 24 hours. This memecoin is now among the top 100 coins by market cap, too, as it trades close to $0.00005.</p>
<p>The top ten altcoins have seen significantly more modest price increases from the likes of Ethereum (3.6%) and Solana (4%). Uniswap has tapped $5.5 after a similar daily jump.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has reclaimed the $1.2 trillion line after gaining around $20 billion daily.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Clausi has already served most of his prison sentence.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Casablanca Court of Appeals ruled that the 21-year-old Frenchman &#8211; Thomas Clausi &#8211; will serve an 18-month prison sentence for orchestrating a crypto scheme. The defendant must compensate the victims of his scam and pay a fine of 3.4 million euros ($3.7 million) to customs authorities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto fraudsters have been quite inventive recently, draining significant sums from investors. Fortunately, law enforcement agencies have arrested and sent to jail some of them. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For example, Gilbert Armenta &#8211; the ex-lover of Ruja Ignatove (better known as the &#8220;Cryptoqueen&#8221;) &#8211; will go behind bars for five years after participating in the infamous OneCoin scam. Cooper Morgenthau &#8211; the former CFO of African Gold &#8211; was sentenced to three years after stealing $5 million from different SPACs to trade meme stocks.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jail Time for the Frenchman, but There Is a Catch</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <a href="https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2023/05/355308/frenchman-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-in-casablanca-for-crypto-scam" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by Morocco World News, the Casablanca magistrates confirmed the 18-month sentence of the youngster. Trial proceedings against the defendant started a few years back when a Frenchwoman residing in Morocco sold him a Ferrari car for $440,000 worth of bitcoin. Local law considers the use of digital assets to be an illicit payment method.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another individual claimed Clausi bought three luxury watches in exchange for a counterfeit check. The Casablanca Court ordered the man to refund the owner of the items for $4,000. It also ruled that the defendant must pay a penalty of $3.7 million to customs authorities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Clausi&#8217;s lawyer &#8211; Mohamed Aghanaj &#8211; said his client has almost served his jail sentence since he&#8217;s been in a correctional facility since December 2021:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;He has one month and a few days left in prison.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the hostile stance from the Moroccan lawmakers, cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular in the region. The country&#8217;s central bank &#8211; Al-Maghrib &#8211; has previously displayed intentions to design a pertinent regulatory framework for the asset class to ensure maximum security for users.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some of the Previous Sentences</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Southern District of New York (SDNY) Courthouse </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/cryptoqueens-ex-boyfriend-sent-to-prison-for-5-years-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sentenced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Gilbert Armenta &#8211; the former boyfriend of Ruja Ignatova &#8211; to serve five years in federal prison for laundering $300 million embezzled from OneCoin investors. Prosecutors claimed that Armenta used a portion of the funds to purchase a jet plane while gambling the remaining part.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <em>CryptoPotato</em> recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/ex-cfo-sentenced-3-years-in-prison-for-stealing-from-spacs-to-trade-meme-stocks-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Cooper Morgenthau &#8211; ex-boss of African Gold &#8211; will also see the prison cell from the inside. He supposedly drained more than $5 million from three SPACs and used the money to trade equities and options of &#8220;meme stocks&#8221; and cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Speaking of crypto scammers and eventual jail sentences, one should mention the notorious Do Kwon (co-founder of Terraform Labs) and Sam Bankman-Fried (the former CEO of FTX).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to numerous failed investors and agencies, both men have orchestrated multi-billion cryptocurrency frauds and deserve to go to prison. The authorities of Montenegro </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/terras-do-kwon-reportedly-arrested-in-montenegro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">arrested</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Kwon in March after he was allegedly on the run for several months. He could be extradited to either the USA or South Korea in the near future, where a trial will determine whether he is guilty and his possible punishment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bankman-Fried currently resides at his parent&#8217;s house in California after serving a brief time in a Bahamian jail. His </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-trial-date-set/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">trial</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> at the beginning of October will rule whether he had a hand in the gigantic FTX meltdown. Should he be proclaimed guilty, he could spend his life in prison.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Kenyan lawmakers could implement a 3% tax on crypto transfers and 15% levy on the monetization of digital content.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The government of Kenya plans to impose a 3% tax on cryptocurrency transfers to narrow the fiscal deficit of the country and boost its domestic revenues.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kenya is among the leaders on the African continent in terms of crypto adoption. Patrick Njoroge &#8211; Governor of the Central Bank &#8211; has previously suggested that bitcoin could solve the nation&#8217;s problems with its depreciating official currency.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto Included in the New Bill</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/kenya-s-government-plans-to-introduce-3-crypto-influencer-tax-as-cash-sources-dry-1.1916205" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Bloomberg, Kenya&#8217;s lawmakers might implement a 3% tax on the transfer or exchange of cryptocurrencies, whereas a 15% levy could affect creators of monetized online content. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposal is part of a newly-designed bill that could stabilize the financial condition of the African nation. President William Ruto aims to double tax collections to 5 trillion shillings (around $37 billion) in five years and use the funds to promote monetary growth.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The legislation will become official from the beginning of July should the Kenyan lawmakers give their nod. The country estimates revenue of approximately $21 billion during the first 365 days (14% more than the anticipated collections for the ongoing fiscal year). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kenya ranks as a lower-middle-income economy, with over 16% of its population living below the international poverty line. Economic inequality, health issues, and government corruption are the main factors for the negative trend. Despite its problems, it remains one of the most developed counties in eastern and central Africa. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kenya: the African Crypto Leader</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Contrary to the financial difficulties in the country, a substantial number of Kenyans have turned their focus toward the cryptocurrency industry in the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Research carried out by the United Nations (UN) in the summer of 2022 </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/kenya-is-the-african-leader-in-crypto-adoption-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that 8.5% of the population (more than 4 million individuals) were HODLers: the highest adoption rate in Africa. South Africans (7.1%) and Nigerians (6.3%) rounded up the top 3 list. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the UN could not determine the approximate value of digital assets held by Kenyans due to the lack of comprehensive regulations in the industry:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The returns from cryptocurrency trading and holding are, as with other speculative trades, highly individual. On balance, they are overshadowed by the risks and costs they pose in developing countries. The sector is not regulated in the country and remains largely unregulated even in the developed world.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that Kenya&#8217;s central bank has a somewhat positive stance on bitcoin (unlike many other centralized financial institutions across the globe). Governor Njoroge </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/kenya-central-bank-explores-using-bitcoin-to-fight-the-depreciating-shilling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">suggested</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in 2021 that adopting the primary cryptocurrency could ease the financial turmoil that hit the region shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Our decision to shift to Bitcoin is both tactical and logical. Our currency has always been the punching bag for the IMF, which always claims that the Kenya Shilling is overvalued. This has led to too much pressure on the Kenyan Shilling, and this has a negative effect on the economy,&#8221; he said.</span></p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Payment giant Stripe announced the launch of a fiat-to-crypto onramp to streamline process the for Web3 companies to enable US-based customers to purchase crypto.</p>
<p>The company will also be opening the onramp to all Web3 users, in addition to the ones who joined the waitlist over the last few months.</p>
<ul>
<li>The onramp, whether embedded on a company&#8217;s site or hosted by Stripe, focuses on optimizing conversion and authorization rates. Such a mechanism in place makes it more likely that legitimate purchases go through.</li>
<li>The new offering includes built-in fraud tools and identity verification to support companies in meeting KYC and compliance checks necessary to prevent manipulation and fraud.</li>
<li>Commenting on the latest development, James Mudgett, vice president of Web3 products at Brave, <a href="https://stripe.com/zh-cn-hk/newsroom/news/fiat-to-crypto-onramp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">stated</a>,</li>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to partner with Stripe as they expand their offerings in the crypto space. We&#8217;re excited to offer a fiat payment solution that will allow us to reach new Web3 users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The latest offering follows December&#8217;s release of a fiat-to-crypto widget that can be embedded in any crypto product allowing users to enter their card information and acquire crypto that can be used in another web3 product.</li>
<li>Earlier this year, Stripe <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/payment-giant-stripe-clinches-6-5b-funding-at-50b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> signing agreements to raise more than $6.5 billion at a valuation of $50 billion with existing shareholders Andreessen Horowitz, Baillie Gifford, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, MSD Partners, and Thrive Capital, as well as new investors GIC, Goldman Sachs Asset and Wealth Management and Temasek.</li>

<p>Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal took to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1653898889311948800" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">announce</a> that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued a text-only order directing the SEC to file a response to the crypto exchange&#8217;s mandamus petition within ten days. The court also granted Coinbase the right to file a reply within seven days of the SEC&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>The original petition dates back to July 2022, when Coinbase asked if the SEC would propose and adopt rules to govern the regulation of securities that are offered and traded via digitally native methods. The agency, however, refrained from offering specific public responses.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the SEC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-ceo-and-legal-officer-respond-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">issued</a> a Wells notice to Coinbase, signaling its intention to conduct enforcement actions against the exchange.</p>
<p>This prompted Coinbase to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-compels-sec-to-respond-to-rulemaking-petition-in-new-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">file</a> a narrow action in federal court to compel the securities regulator to respond yes or no. In a federal court filing dated April 24, the company said it is &#8220;unreasonable for the SEC &#8211; an agency with over 4,500 employees &#8211; to take nine months (and counting) to complete that simple task.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grewal had previously commented,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;From the SEC’s public statements and enforcement activity in the crypto industry, it seems like the SEC has already made up its mind to deny our petition. But they haven’t told the public yet. So the action Coinbase filed today simply asks the court to ask the SEC to share its decision.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Since January, the SEC has been aggressively targeting crypto platforms such as Bittrex, Gemini, and lender Genesis, as well as several individual actors accused of manipulating crypto assets, including Tron&#8217;s Justin Sun and disgraced Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon. As a result, many firms are now looking to move their operations to friendlier jurisdictions.</p>
<h2>Global Push</h2>
<p>Amid the ongoing tribulations with the SEC, Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-officially-launches-platform-for-non-us-institutional-investors-in-bermuda-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> a Bermuda-based marketplace for non-US institutional users. The San Francisco-based exchange will initially offer Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures, with trades settled in the USDC stablecoin.</p>
<p>The announcement of the new venture follows regulatory approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).</p>
