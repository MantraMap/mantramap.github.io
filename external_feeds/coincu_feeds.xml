<p>He said that until at least 2024, <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/156930-peter-schiff-says-bitcoin-will-drop/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/156930-peter-schiff-says-bitcoin-will-drop/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin </a>[BTC] and other cryptocurrencies would not be able to recover from the effects of &#8220;unscrupulous players'&#8221; conduct</strong>. On December 30, he posted a tweet with his ideas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few predictions for 2023: “Out with speculators, in with builders”. Spoiler alert, we’re going into another tough year, but there will be silver linings along the way <a href="https://t.co/6Vg0RwIfEh" target="_blank">https://t.co/6Vg0RwIfEh</a></p>&mdash; David Marcus <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@davidmarcus) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1608853293949923334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 30, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Marcus anticipated their spectre would continue to stalk the cryptocurrency sector until 2023. Only once did he name FTX, but even after that, he warned that <strong>&#8220;unscrupulous players&#8221; would continue to cause market underperformance well into the following year.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">We won’t exit this ‘crypto winter’ in 2023, and probably not in 2024 either.</p>

<p>The four-year halving cycles for Bitcoin, which led to growth in certain years, might run into problems. Many predicted that <strong>the rise would start a year early, in the second quarter of 2023</strong>, and that it would last until the year of the subsequent halving, 2024.</p>



<p>Besides, he believed that even<strong> if the recovery took longer than anticipated, a new and more robust industry would eventually appear</strong>. Marcus anticipated that Bitcoin Lightning Network will succeed in becoming the most widely used cryptocurrency in the world.</p>



<p>Another well-known figure in the cryptocurrency sector, Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, stated on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The Bitcoin blockchain didn’t skip a beat during the crisis caused by opaque centralized players. No wonder Sam Bankman Fried didn’t like Bitcoin: it’s transparent and decentralized. He couldn’t control it.</p>

<p>As 2022 came to an end, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around <strong>$16,527</strong> at the time of writing, which was down <strong>0,07%</strong> in the past 24 hours avoiding significant volatility.</p>

<p>The company that is responsible for the stablecoin known as USDC, Circle, has <strong>raised the circulation of the coin</strong> as of the final week of 2022. <strong>From the 22nd to the 29th of December</strong>, Circle issued a total of <strong>USD 4.2 billion USDC</strong>, <strong>redeemed USD 4 billion USDC</strong>, and increased circulation by <strong>USD 200 million</strong>, as stated by official Circle sources. As of the 29th of December, the total amount of USDC in circulation was <strong>44.3 billion dollars</strong>, and the reserve was <strong>44.6 billion dollars</strong>. <strong>The reserve</strong> consisted of <strong>10.4 billion dollars</strong> <strong>in cash </strong>and <strong>34.2 billion dollars in short-term US government bonds</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Stablecoins </strong>are a type of digital currency that are supposed to be<strong> less volatile</strong> than cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum. This is accomplished by linking its market value to <strong>an external asset such as the United States dollar</strong>. Because of this, they have the ability to act as bridge currencies between the volatile crypto assets and the more traditional assets that are more stable.</p>

<p>Over the course of the past year, Circle&#8217;s stablecoin, known as USDC, has seen <strong>a surge in both its reach and its level of popularity</strong>. For instance, <strong>Mastercard</strong> announced in the summer of 2017 that it is testing a scheme that will enable cryptocurrency payments between cardholders and retailers by <strong>utilizing USDC</strong> as the underlying currency.</p>



<p>However, in recent months, <strong>regulators in the United States </strong>have increased their scrutiny of stablecoins due to their potential to endanger the stability of the financial system. This is because stablecoins increase the degree to which the regulated financial system and the cryptocurrency markets are interconnected.</p>

<p>Users have been captivated by the CEO&#8217;s actions. Previously, <strong>on December 12</strong>, the CEO caused <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151545-justin-sun-panic-sell-1-3b-binance/">a massive panic sale on Binance</a> after withdrawing<strong> 34 million BUSD and 15.4 million USDT</strong> from the exchange 9 hours earlier. Binance&#8217;s withdrawal volume has surged considerably in the last <strong>24 hours</strong>, despite the FUD siege. Following this transaction, huge user withdrawals happened as <strong>Binance had been bombarded with FUD</strong> in recent days. In addition to being accused of deleting user accounts, the leading exchange in the market has been accused of money laundering by Reuters since 2018.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, several users observed that this action demonstrates that the CEO has a strong financial base and a significant store of resources. In addition, the community has the belief that Huobi&#8217;s CEO will assist the company in remaining robust despite the downward trend in the market.</p>

<p>Next week, the platform will release technical integration information on programmable NFTs with developers and marketplaces. Integrating with programmable NFTs and making a public commitment to upholding creator royalties on-chain will be prerequisites for inclusion in the default royalties rule set.</p>



<p>Additionally, it will make a few final changes to<strong> MIP-1</strong> the following week in order to reflect the excellent feedback it has had over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>Partnerships with <strong>Astar Network &#8211; NTT DOCOMO</strong>,<strong> Efinity &#8211; Square Enix</strong>, and<strong> Kilt Protocol &#8211; dena news</strong> were some of the significant ecosystem adoption triumphs this year, illustrating why <a href="https://news.coincu.com/139750-polkadot-developers-claim-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot</a> is the ideal home for the fast-developing Web3 potential.</p>



<p>The ecosystem teams, projects, and dapps on Polkadot continued to push the boundaries of what is possible with blockchains throughout the year, demonstrating Polkadot&#8217;s position as a leader in <strong>DeFi, NFTs, identification, gaming, privacy, robotics, IoT, supply chain,</strong> and many other use cases.</p>



<p>Additionally, on August 8, 2022, <strong>Manta Network</strong> launched the largest trusted setup in the world on the blockchain, encompassing <strong>177 countries</strong> and including more than <strong>13,000 participants.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Key</strong> <strong>Points</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Securities Commission of the Bahamas asserted that it owned $3.5 billion worth of assets belonging to the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, but FTX refuted this assertion.</em></li>



<li><em>The digital assets of the exchange were only worth $296 million when the Commission confiscated them in November, the company claimed in a statement.</em></li>



<li><em>Since mas, FTX Digital Markets is merely a &#8220;local service company&#8221; and does not hold the exchange or any of the cryptocurrencies seized, the company said it would seek the recovery of any assets that have been taken.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to <em>Reuters</em>, FTX refuted the statement that the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB) holds $3.5 billion worth of the exchange digital assets.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>FTX</strong> said in a statement that when <strong>SCB</strong> seized its digital assets in November of this year, <strong>they were worth only $296 million</strong>.</p>



<p>The exchange urged SCB to clarify its holdings and their value. In November, <strong>SCB</strong> began the liquidation of its Bahamian subsidiary, <strong>FTX Digital Markets Ltd.</strong></p>



<p>The company said it would seek to return all seized assets, as <strong>FTX DM is only a &#8220;local services company&#8221; and does not own the exchange or any seized cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>



<p><strong>SCB</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156720-securities-commission-of-the-bahamas-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Thursday that it had controlled more than<strong> $3.5 billion in digital assets of the exchange</strong>, which will be used to repay the customers and other creditors in the future. SCB did not specify the type of assets or their value.</p>

<p><strong>FTX</strong> and Bahamian authorities have been at odds since the company requested bankruptcy protection on November 11. In order to help with the liquidation of <strong>FTX DM,</strong> Bahamian officials have requested access to the exchange data, but the US bankruptcy team has stated that <strong>they do not trust Bahamian officials with that information.</strong></p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157068-bankman-fried-crypto-wallets-targeted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, federal authorities are looking into a number of cryptocurrency transactions that web analysts have connected to digital wallets linked to disgraced crypto tycoon<strong> Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>. If Bankman-Fried is doing the transactions, prosecutors from the <strong>Southern District of New York (SDNY)</strong> are investigating whether he is merely shifting his own assets or cashing them out without permission.</p>

<p>If <strong>Bankman-Fried</strong> is doing the transactions, prosecutors from the <strong>Southern District of New York (SDNY)</strong> are investigating whether he is merely shifting his own assets or cashing them out without permission, according to the article.</p>



<p>Blockchain experts have been monitoring the movement of funds over the past few days that appear to be tied to digital wallets connected to the former CEO of the FTX exchange and his shuttered hedge fund <strong>Alameda Research</strong>, with a total estimated value of more than <strong>$1 million</strong> by data tracker <strong>Arkham</strong> <strong>Intelligence</strong>. After being declared a billionaire earlier,<strong> Bankman-Fried claims he still has roughly $100,000 in his bank account.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bankman-Fried</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156982-sbf-tweets-for-the-first-time-since-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> he was not carrying out the transactions in a tweet on Friday.</p>

<p>Last week, Bankman-Fried was granted freedom on a <strong>$250 million</strong> bail. A <strong>$372 million </strong>worth of tokens was allegedly taken from the exchange just hours after FTX filed for bankruptcy on <strong>November 11</strong>, according to bankruptcy records.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156720-securities-commission-of-the-bahamas-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas has directed the transfer of all digital assets in<strong> FTX Digital Markets</strong>, the Bahamas unit of FTX, valued at more than <strong>$3.5 billion</strong>, to digital wallets controlled by the commission.</p>



<p>The <strong>Bahamas Securities Commission </strong>explained that based on information provided to the Commission by SBF about cyberattacks on the <strong>FTX Digital Markets Ltd (FTXDM) </strong>system, limited access by FTXDM employees to its AWS system name and other available information, the Commission has determined that <strong>digital assets under the custody or control of FTXDM already exist.</strong></p>
