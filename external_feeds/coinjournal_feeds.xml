<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin Cash price jumped to a 1-year high today when BCH hit $194, up 72% over the week.</li>
<li dir="ltr">BCH price broke higher as institutional-driven crypto sentiment pushed Bitcoin (BTC) above $31,000.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bullish sentiment for Bitcoin Cash also followed the listing on BCH on the Citadel-backed crypto exchange EDX Markets.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin-cash/">Bitcoin Cash</a> price has soared to its highest level in twelve months after spiking more than 40% in 24 hours to hit $194 on Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal highligted <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-cash-surges-as-bch-hits-3-month-high-heres-why/">here</a>, Bitcoin Cash price had jumped to a 3-month high on Wednesday.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why is Bitcoin Cash price up?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bch/">BCH</a> was up by 72% in the past seven days and traded at prices last seen in early June last year. This is when the crypto winter and market contagion pushed it from highs of $210 on June 1 to lows of $103 by the end of the month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Bitcoin fork cryptocurrency then slumped to lows of $89 in November as the FTX implosion catalysed massive crypto losses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A bullish start to 2023 however faded with BCH/USD trading around $154 in February. This week&rsquo;s breakout above a technical downtrend line coincided with the broader crypto market rally, buoyed by the news of BlackRock&rsquo;s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Today&rsquo;s gains came as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/btc-hits-31k-as-sec-approves-first-leveraged-futures-bitcoin-etf/">Bitcoin reached $31,450</a>, its highest price since June 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While BTC is up 85% year-to-date, Bitcoin Cash price is slightly higher at 90% YTD.</p>

<h2 class="fr-img-space-wrap2">BCH open interest up 79%</h2>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">BCH Futures open interest has since jumped, up 79% in the past 24 hours. It follows the bullish breakout above $135 after newly-launched EDX Marketslisted Bitcoin Cash as one of four coins on the exchange alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">EDX Markets, which <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/new-crypto-exchange-edx-markets-goes-live/">went live this week</a>, is backed by some of Wall Street&rsquo;s largest financial investment firms &ndash; Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments and Citadel.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest"><u>data</u></a> from Coinglass, open interest in BCH was over $200 million as of 3pm ET on Friday, June 23. It&rsquo;s the highest the metric has risen to since March 2022.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin rose to above $31,450 on Friday, its highest level since June 2022.</li>
<li dir="ltr">BTC price spiked to the year-high level after the SEC allowed the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, or BITX.</li>
<li dir="ltr">This is the first leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF in the US and comes after this week&rsquo;s BlackRock-fueled bullish sentiment for the crypto market.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> smashed past the $31,000 level on Friday afternoon as the market reacted to the latest news about the US market&rsquo;s first leveraged Futures Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The upside pushed BTC price to highs of $31,458 on crypto exchange Bitstamp, with the flagship cryptocurrency&rsquo;s price setting a new year-to-date high and its highest level since June 2022. BTC traded at $31,170 at the time of writing, about 4% higher in the past 24 hours but an impressive 87% up YTD.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SEC approves first leveraged Futures Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On Friday, June 23, the US market entered a new chapter in crypto investing when the first leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF became effective. The Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, or<a href="https://www.volatilityshares.com/bitx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>BITX</u></a>, will begin trading on Tuesday 27 June and will allow its investors an exposure to Bitcoin with daily returns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: &#127482;&#127480; SEC approves the first  Leveraged <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> Futures ETF to start trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&mdash; Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1672282287931633678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Instead of investing directly in Bitcoin, BITX will &ldquo;seek to benefit from increases in the price of Bitcoin Futures Contracts,&rdquo; per details of the Fund in the prospectus<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1884021/000138713123004119/btix-485apos_032323.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>filed</u></a> with the SEC. The 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF will align with the CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has led the market higher over the past week or so, riding on the bullish sentiment triggered by $9 trillion asset manager BlackRock&rsquo;s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock has a very high rate of success with ETF applications, the reason for the market&rsquo;s optimism.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Analytics platform IntoTheBlock pointed out what a spot ETF would mean for Bitcoin adoption and price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#128161; But why is this important? Unlike the Bitcoin futures ETF approved in 2021, a spot ETF would buy actual Bitcoin instead of derivative contracts. This could draw in traditional investors and fuel Bitcoin's price.</p>
<p>&mdash; IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1672208680878592000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, the asset manager&rsquo;s filing paved way for a frenzy of spot ETF applications from several other Wall Street giants and global financial institutions. With BTC price in bullish momentum, its likely the market could see many more mega moves by smart money.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies had a strong performance this week as Bitcoin surged to $30,000.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Most altcoins like Cardano, Pepe, and MATIC also jumped.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">More upside will depend on whether Bitcoin is able to clear $31,000.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies had a strong performance this week as investors focused on TradFi and the positive comment from Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman.&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> price jumped by more than 20% in the past 7 days while Ethereum soared by 14%. The near-term price action for cryptocurrencies will depend on whether BTC will soar above the year-to-date high of $31,000. So, what next for MATIC, Stellar, and Cardano?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cardano price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/"><u>Cardano</u></a> has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few months. It dropped to a low of $0.4592 on April 16th to a low of $0.2295. The lowest point was a notable one since it was the lowest level in December.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the recent rebound is welcome, buyers should be cautious considering that the coin has formed an inverted cup and handle pattern. The current rebound is part of the handle section. In price action analysis, the inverted C&amp;H pattern is usually a bearish sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Cardano price will resume the bearish trend in the near term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If this happens, the next level to watch will be at $0.2414. A break below this level will confirm the bearish thesis and signal that the ADA price could slip to the key support level at $0.20, which is about 30% below the current level.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Polygon MATIC price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/polygon/"><u>Polygon</u></a> MATIC price has been in a steep sell-off in the past few months. This decline happened as the layer-2 network faces significant competition from the likes of Optimism and Arbitrum. On the daily chart, the price dropped to $0.5079 in June and then resumed the bullish trend this week. It has now retested the important resistance point at $0.6905, the lowest point on September 20th last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MATIC remains below the 25-day and 50-day moving averages. Therefore, I believe that this recovery will not hold. If this happens, the coin will likely retest the month-to-date low of $0.50, which is about 26% below the current level.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the XLM price crashed to a low of $0.075 on June 15th. This was an important level since it coincided with the lowest level on March 11th of this year. Stellar has now moved slightly above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages. It has also formed what looks like a double-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $0.1145.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, there is a likelihood that the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/stellar-lumens/"><u>Stellar</u></a> coin will likely continue rising as buyers target the key resistance point at $0.10, which is about 11.31% above the current level.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">The US Supreme Court ruled that the district court must stay proceedings in a class action lawsuit when interlocutory appeal is ongoing.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Coinbase filed an appeal after its motion to compel arbitration was denied.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The ruling comes days after Coinbase was sued by the SEC over allegations of violating securities laws.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase has scored a notable victory after the US Supreme court&rsquo;s ruling on its appeal over arbitration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Friday, the apex US court ruled in favour of the crypto exchange&rsquo;s argument, stating that a federal court must stay proceedings in a lawsuit where a defendant&rsquo;s appeal for arbitration is ongoing.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">US Supreme Court sides with Coinbase</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Supreme Court&rsquo;s verdict comes after the exchange filed an appeal earlier this year after its &ldquo;<em>motion to compel arbitration</em>&rdquo; was denied the US District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> moved to file an interlocutory appeal and sought to have the District Court stay proceedings of a class action lawsuit pending the resolution of its appeal. That too had been denied at the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>When a federal district court denies a motion to compel arbitration, the losing party has a statutory right to an interlocutory appeal. The sole question here is whether the district court must stay its pre-trial and trial proceedings while the interlocutory appeal is ongoing. The answer is yes: The district court must stay its proceedings</em>,&rdquo; Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted in the Supreme Court&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-105_5536.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase is facing a class action lawsuit filed by Abraham Bielski at the US District Court for the Northern District of California, in which he alleges that the US-based cryptocurrency exchange &ldquo;<em>failed to replace funds fraudulently taken from the users&rsquo; accounts</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Supreme Court notes in its ruling that &ldquo;Coinbase&rsquo;s User Agreement provides for dispute resolution through binding arbitration.&rdquo; This is what informed the exchange&rsquo;s move to file for arbitration &ndash; which the lower courts denied.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We are grateful to the Supreme Court for its careful review. Another example of why I believe in the American court system. The rule of law is sometime slow, and at times disappointing. But it remains our last, best hope in an imperfect democracy</em>,&rdquo; Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal<a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1672252332292157441">&nbsp;<u>tweeted</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the majority was in favour of Coinbase, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, noting that &ldquo;<em>today&rsquo;s majority invents a new stay rule perpetually favoring one class of litigants&mdash;defendants seeking arbitration</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Justice Jackson, the move could have &ldquo;<em>significant implications for federal litigation</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase was recently sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of violating securities laws.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin mining stocks made a bullish breakout this week.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Marathon Digital share price soared to the highest level since November.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Future price action will depend on the Bitcoin price action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Marathon Digital stock price surged to the highest level since November 2022 as&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> and other cryptocurrencies roared back. MARA shares jumped to a high of $12.75, meaning it has soared by more than 319% from the lowest level in December. Other&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin-mining/"><u>bitcoin mining</u></a> companies in the industries like Riot Platform and Hut 8 Mining also surged.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin mining stocks jump</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The main reason why MARA stock price soared is that Bitcoin price neared the highest point this year. This rebound happened as the crypto fear and greed index soared to the greed area.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most analysts believe that the ongoing trend of TradFi is the main driving factor for Bitcoin prices. TradFi refers to a situation where traditional finance companies move to the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Friday, Blackrock, the biggest asset manager in the world, announced that it had applied for the iShares Bitcoin Trust with the SEC. This will be an ETF tracking the spot Bitcoin price and will be similar to the Vanguard Gold Trust.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other large companies in the industry also unveiled their Bitcoin ETF filings. They included companies like Invesco and WisdomTree. Analysts believe that the SEC will come under pressure and allow these funds this time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another TradFi news was that Deutsche Bank applied for a crypto custody license in Germany. Credit Agricole, a large French bank, also received its custody license. These banks hope to take care of wealthy Europeans seeking access to the industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, MARA stock price is soaring because its business thrives in a period when Bitcoin price is thriving. Its future price action will depend on whether Bitcoin moves above $31,000. This is an important level since it is the upper side of the double-top pattern. As such, if it rises, it means that the double-top pattern has been invalidated.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MARA stock price forecast</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/05/23/1687537831412-fc011497-94c1-4e69-9cad-b85a40252eb6.png" style="width: 596px;height: 290.053px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="596" height="290.053"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the Marathon Digital stock price has been in a slow bullish trend in the past few months. The shares consolidated at around $10 in the past few weeks. It then moved slightly above the key resistance point at $12.85, the highest level on April 18. The price was along the upper side of the ascending triangle pattern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MARA share price has jumped above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages. Therefore, while the outlook is neutral, the stock will likely have a bullish breakout as buyers target the next key resistance point at $15. A drop below the support at $10.90 will invalidate the bullish view.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Dash block reduction occurred at block height 1,892,161.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Unlike Bitcoin halving that cuts block rewards in half, Dash reduces its reward by 7.14% after every 210,240 blocks.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Currently, the reward is 2.3097 DASH and will reduce again in July 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The block reward on the Dash (DASH) blockchain network has reduced after its halving that took effect at block height 1,892,161.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like Bitcoin, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/dash/">Dash</a> cuts its block reward. However, instead of the halving that for instance sees Bitcoin&rsquo;s block reward cut in half every four years, Dash reduces the reward by 7.14% every 210,240 blocks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the network&rsquo;s block time of 2.5 minutes, DASH block reward reduction happens approximately every 365 days. The<a href="https://www.oklink.com/halving">&nbsp;<u>countdown</u></a> to the next halving is estimated to occur in the first week of July 2024, with the block reward set to reduce from 2.3097 DASH to 2.1448 DASH.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Dash block reward distribution</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Like in other mining coins, block reward reduction affects what miners earn for deploying their computational power to process transactions and secure the network. Reducing the reward therefore impacts their overall profitability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For instance, Dash&rsquo;s latest halving saw mining pool ViaBTC<a href="https://support.viabtc.com/hc/en-us/articles/19794409650201-Announcement-on-DASH-Block-Reward-Reduction">&nbsp;<u>inform</u></a> miners that the reward will reduce from 1.05 to 0.98 DASH.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Block rewards are split three-way: Miners and masternodes, which are key to the network&rsquo;s privacy feature (CoinJoin) and instant transactions (InstantSend), share 90% of the block reward, while 10% goes to the DASH Treasury DAO.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, the distribution between miners and masternodes is 42.3% and 57.7% respectively. The ratio is set to change in favour of the masternodes over time, with this reaching the 40:60 ratio by May 2025.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DASH &ldquo;halving&rdquo; happens approximately 40 days to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/">Litecoin</a>&rsquo;s halving expected in August this year. After that, the most anticipated block halving event will be Bitcoin&rsquo;s, which is scheduled to happen in April 2024 (the countdown is down to about 308 days).</p>

<li>Kaspa (KAS) price has surged 31% in the last 7 days and 4% in the last 24 hours.</li>
<li>Kaspa was on June 22 integrated on CoinPal.</li>
<li>CoinPal is a leading cryptocurrency payment service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>While yesterday&rsquo;s Kaspa integration with CoinPal is not the sole reason why <a href="https://coinjournal.net/kaspa/">Kaspa (KAS) price</a> is rising, the integration has added impetus to the KAS bullish momentum.</p>
<p>The integration comes at a time when the crypto market is seeing a rebound that has pushed <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC) price</a> above $30K for the first time in months. It is also ten days since Michael Sutton, Georges K&uuml;nzli, and Shai Wyborski presented a proposal referred to as KIP-4 that aims at refining the Kaspa protocol by translating its complex mechanisms into a language that everyday enthusiasts can easily grasp.</p>
<h2>Kaspa integration with CoinPal</h2>
<p>Kaspa is one of the fastest, open-source, decentralized, and fully scalable Layer-1 <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/blockchain/">blockchains</a> in the world. It is the world&rsquo;s first digital ledger enabling parallel blocks.</p>
<p>Kaspa and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin&nbsp;</a>share the fundamental principles of decentralization and peer-to-peer technology. Kaspa has, however, introduced upgrades like increased scalability, lower transaction fees, and faster transaction speeds. Therefore, by integrating Kaspa, CoinPal and its users will have access to more than 50 supported cryptocurrencies thus expanding their options.</p>
<p>By incorporating Kaspa into its platform, CoinPal.io has made significant progress toward broadening its scope. By consistently expanding the number of cryptocurrencies it supports and improving its services, CoinPal stays ahead of the curve in the rapidly changing world of digital currencies.</p>
<p>By incorporating Kaspa, CoinPal is advancing e-commerce and establishing itself as a major force in the adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The recent rally could spark interest in new web3 projects, including Chancer.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, reached an important milestone earlier this week. The cryptocurrency reached the $30k psychological level for the first time since April 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rally saw other altcoins also experience positive gains. With Bitcoin still trading around the $30k region, could this be a good time for investors to enter the cryptocurrency market?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin rallies on ETF hopes</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is up by more than 18% over the last seven days, allowing it to reach the $30k level for the first time in two months.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rally came after BlackRock, the world&rsquo;s largest asset management firm with nearly $10 trillion in assets under management, applied with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-touches-29k-for-the-first-time-since-may-why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today/"><u>launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund</u></a> (ETF).</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Bitcoin reaching the $30k mark, several other cryptocurrencies also recorded excellent gains over the last couple of days.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some investors are optimistic that the Bull cycle could be on this horizon. With investors currently optimistic about the market, there are some projects that could present an excellent opportunity for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://chancer.com/"><u>Chancer</u></a> is one of the projects that are exciting and could become a success in the cryptocurrency space. Let us look at Chancer and what the project is about.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">One of the projects investors could consider is Chancer, a unique Web3 peer-to-peer (P2P) custom betting platform that allows users to live stream betting events.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a web3-focused project,&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/"><u>Chancer</u></a> is decentralised, allowing users to bet on numerous events, beyond the sporting and popular ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project&rsquo;s token is currently in presale, and the developers will use the funds to build a P2P betting platform that allows users ti enjoy betting markets in real-time and based on user interests, social media connections, and expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In their whitepaper, Chancer said their platform would eliminate the difficulties put in place by bookmakers. Users can set their own custom P2P betting markets using its decentralised platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A major feature of Chancer is that it operates unlike the traditional betting platform in that supports betting far beyond the sporting and popular events users find on centralised betting platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Asides from betting on sporting activities, users can bet on any event they desire, whether mainstream or made-up. On Chancer, users can predict odd events such as the day man will walk on Mars or even personal bet amongst friends and colleagues to determine the first person to complete a task.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chancer raises over $300k in 10 days</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s first pre-sale event launched ten days ago, and the team has raised more than $300,000 so far. The team seeks to raise $1 million in the first pre-sale event and has so far raised $333k, accounting for 33% of the total amount needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer will use the funds to develop some of its products. The team will hold 11 more presale events after this with the expectation of raising $15 million un total.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CHANCER, the native token of the Chancer ecosystem, is going for $0.01 BUSD per token. The token is set to power various activities on the Chancer betting platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the CHANCER token, holders can create markets and invest in markets created by other users. Furthermore, the CHANCER utility token would enable users to create, participate in, and profit from their very own predictive markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">CHANCER is a BNBChain-based token, and the team would allow holders to stake their tokens and earn more money by providing liquidity to the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To purchase the CHANCER tokens, investors can connect a wide range of wallets to the Chancer presale. The supported wallets include Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Visit the Chancer website to get more information about the&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/"><u>presale</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been performing well over the last few days, and that has gotten investors excited again. With more investors entering the market, this might be a good time to invest in strong projects and unlock gems within the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer could be one of the projects investors should consider. The project is focusing on decentralising the betting ecosystem and could get a sizeable market share if it gains massive adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presale is still in its early stages, and CHANCER&rsquo;s price could soar once the token lists on numerous cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
