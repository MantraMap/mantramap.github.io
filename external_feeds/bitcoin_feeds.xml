The regulator warned that while the impact of the crypto market on the traditional financial system is still low, the risks posed by crypto to the country&#8217;s financial stability could increase sharply in the future.</strong></p>
<h2>Korean Regulator Developing Crypto Monitoring Tools</h2>
<p>South Korea&#8217;s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is planning to develop crypto monitoring tools and regularly inspect the risks associated with crypto assets, FSS Governor Lee Bok-hyun reportedly revealed Monday at a conference on the interconnectedness between the crypto market and the traditional financial market. He was quoted by local media as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Financial Supervisory Service is planning various initiatives for the risk management of the virtual asset market this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the crypto monitoring tools, Lee explained that the supervisory authority currently lacks data to identify potential risks from crypto even though the interconnection between the crypto market and the traditional financial market is expected to increase.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to preemptively respond to risks in the virtual asset market, securing data is more important than anything else,&#8221; the FSS chief stressed. In addition, Lee said the regulator plans to establish new crypto-related disclosure obligations.</p>

<h2>Crypto Market&#8217;s Impact on Traditional Financial Market</h2>
<p>The FSS governor noted that no domestic financial company directly provides crypto-related services, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the growth of the virtual asset market, the direct impact on the stability of the financial system is still low.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, should the size of the domestic crypto market expand significantly, its impact on financial stability could increase sharply, Lee cautioned.</p>
<p>Regulators worldwide have warned that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-chief-lagarde-crypto-and-defi-could-pose-real-risks-to-financial-stability/">interconnectedness</a> between the traditional financial market and the crypto market is increasing. The FSS chief pointed out that a number of countries are &#8220;introducing full-fledged regulatory measures for stablecoins&#8221; following the collapse of the Terra-luna ecosystem.</p>

A top official at the Financial Services Agency explained that the recent FTX implosion wasn&#8217;t brought on by crypto technology but by &#8220;loose governance, lax internal controls, and the absence of regulation and supervision.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Bank-Level Cryptocurrency Regulations</h2>
<p>Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country&#8217;s top financial regulator, has urged regulators globally to subject cryptocurrency exchanges to bank-level regulations, Bloomberg reported Monday. Mamoru Yanase, deputy director-general of the FSA&#8217;s Strategy Development and Management Bureau, was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you like to implement effective regulation, you have to do the same as you regulate and supervise traditional institutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FSA has called for stronger crypto regulation following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and subsequent fraud charges filed against its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The FTX meltdown has dealt a severe blow to the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting gaps and differences in regulations worldwide.</p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s tough regulatory framework for crypto assets has provided a measure of protection for local investors, as they are expected to be able to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-to-start-letting-customers-in-japan-withdraw-funds/">withdraw their funds</a> next month from two Japanese crypto exchanges linked to FTX.</p>
<p>Commenting on the failure of FTX, Yanase opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s brought about the latest scandal isn&#8217;t crypto technology itself … It is loose governance, lax internal controls and the absence of regulation and supervision.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Yanase, the FSA has &#8220;begun to urge&#8221; their counterparts in the U.S., Europe, and other regions to subject cryptocurrency exchanges to the same level of oversight traditional financial institutions, like banks and brokerages, are subject to.</p>
<p>Noting that countries may need to establish a multinational resolution mechanism to coordinate when large crypto firms fail, Yanase stressed the importance of achieving consistency in regulations worldwide.</p>
<p>The FSA official emphasized that countries &#8220;need to firmly demand&#8221; measures from crypto exchanges to ensure consumer protection, curb money laundering, and implement robust governance, internal controls, auditing, and disclosures. He added that regulators should also have the authority to take enforcement actions, such as onsite inspections, to ensure that crypto firms are adequately managing clients&#8217; assets.</p>

On the first day of 2023, the average fee to spend ether was around $2.93 per transfer, but today the average cost is 54% higher at $4.52 per transfer.</strong></p>
<h2>Rise in Ethereum Value Leads to Increased Onchain Transaction Costs</h2>
<p>Sending <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> is becoming more costly as the crypto asset&#x2019;s value has risen greatly over the last 14 days. At the time of writing, ether is trading at $1,542 per unit, after reaching a high of $1,606 per unit during the same 24-hour period on Jan. 18, 2023.</p>
<p>As ethereum&#x2019;s value in U.S. dollars has increased, the cost to move ether and the myriad of ERC20 tokens has also risen. <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3y">Data</a> from bitinfocharts.com indicates that on Jan. 1, 2023, the average ether gas fee was $2.93 per transfer. 18 days later, the average fee to send ethereum is 54% higher at $4.52 per transaction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-569456 size-full" title="Ethereum Gas Fees Spike as ETH Value Rises: Average Onchain Fees Jump by More Than 50%" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ether.jpg" alt="Ethereum Gas Fees Spike as ETH Value Rises: Average Onchain Fees Jump by More Than 50%" width="1280" height="400" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ether-300x94.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ether-1024x320.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ether-768x240.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ether.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Bitinfocharts.com&#x2019;s median-sized ethereum fee chart highlights a similar pattern. 18 days ago on the first day of 2023, bitinfocharts.com&#x2019;s <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-median_transaction_fee.html">median ether fee chart</a> showed the cost was around $1.06 per transfer to send ethereum.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the same chart showed the cost has risen to 0.0013 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> per transfer or roughly $1.96 using current ether exchange rates. That means the median-sized ethereum fee has jumped 84% since Jan. 1. Furthermore, while the gas measurement is usually estimated at a much lower rate, etherscan.io&#x2019;s &#x201C;Gas Tracker&#x201D; also shows an increase since the start of the year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-569455 size-full" title="Ethereum Gas Fees Spike as ETH Value Rises: Average Onchain Fees Jump by More Than 50%" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ethergas.jpg" alt="Ethereum Gas Fees Spike as ETH Value Rises: Average Onchain Fees Jump by More Than 50%" width="1280" height="500" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ethergas-300x117.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ethergas-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ethergas-768x300.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ethergas.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>On that day, the web portal&#x2019;s fee tracker indicates that the high-priority ether gas fee was around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230101123153/https://etherscan.io/gastracker">$0.30 per transfer</a> or 20 gwei. 18 days later, a high-priority fee is still 20 gwei or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230118193120/https://etherscan.io/gastracker">$1.14 per ETH transaction</a>, which is an increase of around 280%. On Jan. 1, the cost to transact with Opensea was an estimated $1.12 per transaction and today it&#x2019;s up to $3.99.</p>
<p>A swap on a decentralized exchange (dex) platform was $2.87 and now it&#x2019;s up to $10.28 to make a trade on a dex like Uniswap. Sending an ERC20 token like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC would cost a sender around $0.84 per transaction, and today it&#x2019;s around $3.02 to send an ERC20.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the cost of layer-two (L2) transactions has risen as well. Three days ago on Jan. 15, 2023, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/combined-transactions-on-arbitrum-and-optimism-l2-chains-outpace-ethereums-daily-transfer-count/">reported</a> on the rise of Arbitrum and Optimism transactions. On that day, an Arbitrum network transfer was around $0.101 per transfer, and today&#x2019;s fee is around $0.188 per transfer, according to <a href="https://dune.com/blockworks_research/l2-comparison-dashboard">data</a> from Dune Analytics.</p>

<p>Similarly, Optimism&#x2019;s network transaction costs were $0.1410 per transfer three days ago, and on Jan. 18, the cost to move coins on the L2 chain Optimism is $0.3039 per transaction. The rise in higher ether gas fees in recent times has broken the record of long months of low fees on the Ethereum network.</p>

The Russian owner of the platform has been arrested for his role in the alleged transmission of illicit money. Bitzlato claimed it was hacked.</strong></p>
<h2>US, France Hit Cryptocurrency Exchange Bitzlato, Russian Co-founder Detained in Miami</h2>
<p>U.S. authorities have apprehended Anatoly Legkodymov, a resident of China, on charges that his Hong Kong-registered crypto trading platform, Bitzlato, processed illicit funds worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Russian, a co-founder and majority owner of the exchange, was arrested by three e FBI in Miami on Tuesday, a high-ranking official from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed.</p>
<p>Speaking during a press conference, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said that Justice Department agents and prosecutors, working with the U.S. Treasury Department and French law enforcement, have &#x201C;disrupted Bitzlato, a China-based cryptocurrency exchange, notorious for laundering criminal proceeds from the darknet&#x201D; and ransomware attacks. She also stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, the Department of Justice has dealt a significant blow to the crypto crime ecosystem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Legkodymov is accused of operating the exchange as a &#x201C;high-tech financial hub that, in his own words, catered to &#x2018;known crooks&#x2019;,&#x201D; Monaco explained. She went on to allege that Bitzlato was a &#x201C;crucial financial resource&#x201D; for Hydra, the largest darknet market, with Russian roots, which was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/germany-shuts-down-hydra-market-seizes-servers-and-bitcoin/">shut down</a> in April, last year, by the German police with the support of U.S. agencies.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, Hydra buyers funded illicit purchases from crypto accounts hosted at Bitzlato while sellers of drugs, stolen financial information and hacking tools sent criminal proceeds to accounts at the exchange, collectively amounting to $700 million in direct and indirect transfers between 2018 and 2022.</p>
<p>The deputy attorney general also said that the participants in the operation have engaged in a &#x201C;coordinated campaign of disruption.&#x201D; This included law enforcement actions in a number of European countries and the seizure of Bitzlato&#x2019;s servers. By midday Wednesday, Bitzlato&#x2019;s website was replaced by a notice saying that the service had been seized by French authorities, Reuters reported.</p>

<h2>Crypto Exchange Bitzlato Claims It Was Hacked, Halts Withdrawals</h2>
<p>Also on Wednesday, the operators of Bitzlato announced on Telegram, that the exchange had suffered a hacking attack. They told users that withdrawals had been suspended indefinitely and asked them to refrain from sending coins to the platform until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our service was hacked, part of the funds was withdrawn from the service,&#x201D; the exchange said, noting that the attackers were able to steal a small portion of the funds without specifying the amount. It also sought to assure customers in a second message that their assets were not lost, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>For all victims, we guarantee a refund.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;As a security measure, we have disabled the service, we ask you not to replenish the wallets of our service until the work is restored,&#x201D; Bitzlato reiterated, adding that its team was working on the problem. At the time of writing, the platform is still offline.</p>
<p>The hack presumably took place after on Tuesday the exchange announced maintenance scheduled for Thursday, Jan. 19, &#x201C;aimed at improving the operation of the service and its security.&#x201D; The notice informed users it will halt transactions between 5 and 9 a.m. Moscow time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We strongly recommend that you organize your work activities taking into account the amendments in order to avoid unpleasant situations,&#x201D; the platform advised customers, informing them that it plans to disable deposits, withdrawals and trading.</p>
<p>Bitzlato launched in 2016 under the name Changebot and later became a cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-daily-tip-new-crypto-exchange-bizlato-offers-p2p-trading/">offering</a> peer-to-peer (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peertopeer-p2p-economy.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P2P</a>) trading services. It lists pairs of the Russian ruble with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, and other digital coins which can be bought and sold with a variety of payment methods.</p>
<p>Online crypto exchangers like Bitzlato are popular in Russia and the former Soviet space but as crypto assets are yet to be fully regulated in the region, they are often targeted by authorities across the Commonwealth of Independent States. A report recently revealed that the Belarusian judiciary has imposed a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/belarusian-fined-1-million-for-illegal-crypto-trading/">hefty fine</a> on the operator of one such platform.</p>

The surge in the sales of Egyptian treasury bills that mature in a year or less similarly is said to vindicate the central bank&#8217;s devaluation of the pound. </strong></p>
<h2>Surge in Treasury Bill Sales</h2>
<p>Foreign investors reportedly moved $925 million into Egypt’s foreign exchange market just days after the local currency’s exchange rate versus hard currencies sharply declined. In addition, the country’s forex market has also received inflows from the so-called local sources as well as from Egyptians working abroad.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/foreign-investors-pour-925-mln-into-egypt-since-wednesday-2023-01-16/">report</a> based on the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)’s Jan. 16 statement, just three days after the Egyptian pound&#8217;s devaluation on Jan. 11, Egyptian banks were able to fulfill importers’ requests for forex amounting to $2 billion. In its Arabic <a href="https://www.cbe.org.eg/_layouts/download.aspx?SourceUrl=%2FHighlights%2520Documents%2FPress%2520Release%2520dated%2520January%252016-%25202023.pdf">language statement</a>, the CBE reportedly said the return of foreign investors, which is also evidenced by the surge in the sale of Egyptian treasury bills, vindicates its decision to switch from a fixed to a flexible exchange rate regime.</p>
<p>As recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-egyptian-pound-reaches-new-low-against-us-dollar-despite-flexible-exchange-rate-regime/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the Egyptian pound briefly fell to an all-time low of 32.14 units of the local currency for every dollar. By allowing the pound to depreciate by more than 16% in just under a year, the CBE met a key International Monetary Fund demand. Satisfying this demand allowed the IMF to approve Egypt&#8217;s $3 billion loan package.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-16/egypt-hails-925-million-inflows-as-sign-devaluation-is-working">report</a> said Egypt&#8217;s net international reserves had risen despite the debt repayment of $2.5 billion that was made in late 2022. To help Egyptians counter the effects of rising inflation, local banks are now reportedly selling currency derivatives, the CBE said.</p>
<p>Since plunging to an all-time low of 32.14 per dollar, the Egyptian pound has marginally recovered and at the time of writing, it trades at around 29.57 per dollar on Jan. 17 (16:32 EST).</p>

This news follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging a subsidiary firm of DCG, Genesis Global Capital, with operating an &#8220;unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Digital Currency Group Takes Steps to Strengthen Balance Sheet by Suspending Dividends</h2>
<p>On Jan. 17, 2023, Coindesk reporter Ian Allison published an <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/17/crypto-conglomerate-dcg-suspends-dividends-amid-distress-at-genesis-unit/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=onecryptofeed&amp;utm_campaign=headlines">article</a> disclosing that the Digital Currency Group (DCG) is suspending dividend payments for the time being. It is worth noting that Coindesk, a financial crypto-focused news outlet, is an &#8220;independent operating subsidiary&#8221; of DCG. Allison&#8217;s report cites a shareholders&#8217; letter reviewed by the publication, which notes that the decision was made in response to the &#8220;current market environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>DCG added that the firm has “been focused on strengthening our balance sheet by reducing operating expenses and preserving liquidity — As such, we have made the decision to suspend DCG&#8217;s quarterly dividend distribution until further notice.”</p>
<p>The Coindesk article follows the problems the crypto lending subsidiary of DCG, Genesis Global Capital, has been dealing with over the past two months. On Nov. 16, 2022, Genesis&#8217;s lending unit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-global-tradings-lending-unit-suspends-withdrawals-and-new-loan-originations/">suspended</a> withdrawals and new loan originations. It was then <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-owes-gemini-customers-900-million-exchange-is-attempting-to-recoup-assets/">reported</a> that Genesis owes Gemini Earn customers $900 million, and as a result, Gemini also paused withdrawals and recently shut down the Earn program. Additionally, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-state-securities-regulators-probe-crypto-lender-genesis/">reports</a> detailed that Genesis was being probed by U.S. regulators, and Gemini <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-forms-creditors-committee-with-houlihan-lokey-to-resolve-genesis-liquidity-issues/">formed a committee</a> with Houlihan Lokey to resolve the Genesis liquidity issues.</p>

<p>Later, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss wrote a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/geminis-cameron-winklevoss-insists-digital-currency-group-needs-to-resolve-liquidity-issues-in-open-letter-to-ceo-barry-silbert/">critical open letter</a> about the subject, and then followed up with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-co-founder-accuses-digital-currency-group-of-misrepresentation-demands-ceo-resignation/">another open letter</a> insisting that the DCG board remove Barry Silbert from his role as DCG&#8217;s CEO. Silbert <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-currency-group-ceo-barry-silbert-responds-to-accusations-by-geminis-cameron-winklevoss-with-shareholders-letter/">responded</a> with a letter addressed to DCG shareholders, in which he dismisses many of the claims made by Winklevoss. The following day, both Gemini and Genesis were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">charged</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with conducting an unregistered offering.</p>
<p>DCG owns a vast portfolio of crypto companies, including Coindesk, Foundry USA, Grayscale Investments, and Genesis Global Capital. All of these companies are major players in the space; for example, Foundry USA is the <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">largest bitcoin mining pool</a> in terms of hashrate, and Grayscale manages the <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/#etfs">largest Bitcoin Trust</a> (GBTC) in the crypto industry.</p>

SBF stated that the presentation published by litigation firm Sullivan & Cromwell is &#x201C;extremely misleading&#x201D; and that FTX US is solvent and &#x201C;always has been.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>SBF Claims Misrepresentation by Litigation Firm, Twitter Critics Doubt Solvency</h2>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is providing additional information in response to the recent press release and 20-page presentation document issued by FTX debtors and current restructuring administrators. The press release reported that investigators found $5.5 billion in liquid assets. In response, SBF posted a <a href="https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-us-balance-update-2023-01-17">new blog</a> on his Substack newsletter and <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1615507065337958401?s=20&t=xZk7aqaE9cyQtPh7igRFVg">stated</a> on Twitter, &#x201C;FTX US is solvent, as it always has been.&#x201D; The blog post echoes this statement and asserts discrepancies between Sullivan & Cromwell&#x2019;s (S&C) reporting and SBF&#x2019;s spreadsheet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-569385 size-full" title="Sam Bankman-Fried Disputes FTX US 'Shortfall' Claims, Critics Skeptical of Excel Spreadsheet Defense" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ddspread.jpg" alt="Sam Bankman-Fried Disputes FTX US 'Shortfall' Claims, Critics Skeptical of Excel Spreadsheet Defense" width="1280" height="350" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ddspread-300x82.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ddspread-1024x280.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ddspread-768x210.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ddspread.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>He disputes the assertion in the presentation that FTX US has a &#x201C;shortfall&#x201D; and maintains that FTX US is not insolvent. &#x201C;S&C claims that FTX US has a shortfall,&#x201D; SBF said in his latest blog post. &#x201C;That claim is false. Based on S&C&#x2019;s own data provided in the same court presentation, FTX US had roughly $609 million of assets ($428 million in bank accounts, plus $181 million in tokens) backing roughly $199 million in customer balances. FTX US was solvent when it was turned over to S&C, and almost certainly remains solvent today.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Despite SBF&#x2019;s claims, several people on social media mocked the FTX co-founder and specifically criticized his Excel spreadsheet. &#x201C;Bro typed out a couple of numbers in 5 mins thinking it&#x2019;s gonna be his get out of jail free card,&#x201D; one person <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginProtocol/status/1615523471819243520?s=20&t=xZk7aqaE9cyQtPh7igRFVg">tweeted</a> in response to SBF&#x2019;s latest blog post. &#x201C;Nice Excel sheet that a 5-year-old could make &#x2014; LOL &#x2014; Means nothing. Somebody shut this dude up forever,&#x201D; another person <a href="https://twitter.com/BeardedLounge/status/1615511129761132544?s=20&t=xZk7aqaE9cyQtPh7igRFVg">wrote</a>. SBF&#x2019;s claims were met with skepticism and his declarations did not appear to be convincing to many.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-569387 size-full" title="Sam Bankman-Fried Disputes FTX US 'Shortfall' Claims, Critics Skeptical of Excel Spreadsheet Defense" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/convincinggs.jpg" alt="Sam Bankman-Fried Disputes FTX US 'Shortfall' Claims, Critics Skeptical of Excel Spreadsheet Defense" width="1280" height="650" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/convincinggs-300x152.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/convincinggs-1024x520.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/convincinggs-768x390.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/convincinggs.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<h2>Missing Funds, Lack of Auto-Liquidation Issues, and &#x2018;Questionable FTX US Redemption System&#x2019; Remain Unaddressed by Former FTX CEO</h2>
<p>A number of people <a href="https://twitter.com/frontrunjohn/status/1615524507145633795?s=20&t=xZk7aqaE9cyQtPh7igRFVg">questioned</a> why SBF did not comment on the $10 billion in missing funds and once again, his blog post did not address the accusations made in the presentation. For example, following SBF&#x2019;s last blog post, Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmex-co-founder-criticizes-former-ftx-ceo-for-not-liquidating-hedge-fund-alameda/">criticized</a> the FTX co-founder for not addressing the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/document-claims-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-ftx-margin-position-was-negative-1-3b-in-may-2022/">lack of auto-liquidation</a> associated with Alameda Research. The latest presentation from FTX debtors claims &#x201C;Alameda Research and a small group of individuals had the ability to remove assets from the exchange.&#x201D; Furthermore, the removal of funds was never recorded on the company&#x2019;s ledger, and the funds allegedly derived from FTX exchange customers.</p>
<p>SBF did not address that specific subject at all. It is absent from his argument against Sullivan & Cromwell&#x2019;s presentation. People on Twitter brought this up to SBF on other Twitter threads about the subject, as SBF&#x2019;s tweets are set to &#x201C;private&#x201D; mode and cannot be commented on. &#x201C;This does not explain the allegations of embezzlement to which your colleagues have pleaded guilty,&#x201D; one person on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BkindCarlos/status/1615513355837673472?s=20&t=vU4UB7PHHZ8vXXjjHMWxiA">tweeted</a> in response to SBF&#x2019;s latest claims. One person <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertJSalvador/status/1615534814337040384?s=20&t=xZk7aqaE9cyQtPh7igRFVg">told the media</a> that SBF&#x2019;s claims appear to be intentional &#x201C;misdirection&#x201D; and &#x201C;potentially for legal/defense purposes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is safe to say that Bankman-Fried&#x2019;s claims and recent blog posts are not being taken seriously, and his Excel spreadsheet method is not convincing the general public. Some people wondered if SBF was &#x201C;presumably tweeting against the advice of legal counsel.&#x201D; The latest blog post was not much different from the last post SBF wrote, as they both fail to explain a number of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/caroline-ellisons-testimony-claims-ftx-boss-sbf-directed-her-to-co-mingle-customer-funds-since-2019/">issues raised</a> by Bankman-Fried&#x2019;s co-workers &#x2014; former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang. Furthermore, evidence has emerged about how &#x201C;traders may have used a questionable FTX US redemption system&#x201D; for Solana-bridged assets.</p>

<p>Conor Rogan, a director at Coinbase who frequently tweets about onchain activities, said this redemption scheme could complicate the bankruptcy process. &#x201C;From November 9th until withdrawals were halted a few days later, traders may have used a questionable FTX US redemption system to funnel [tens of millions] out of the exchange,&#x201D; Rogan <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1615361405791633410?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">said</a>. &#x201C;This could complicate bankruptcy proceedings and further call into question FTX-FTXUS separation claims,&#x201D; he added. Rogan <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1615361412184039425?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">discussed</a> a synthetic Solana-based bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) token called &#x201C;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin-sollet">sollet (soBTC)</a>&#x201D; which broke its peg when FTX&#x2019;s troubles were engulfed in flames. Despite the financial issues, FTX US still processed sollet redemptions on a 1:1 basis.</p>

<p>The redemptions still occurred while sollet was <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin-sollet">trading</a> for much lower than <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s spot price, and Rogan believes the &#x201C;toxic redemptions&#x201D; or &#x201C;swapping unbacked <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x201D; led to the potential loss of over $40 million. &#x201C;FTX US would presumably have 1,700 real <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, instead of 1,700 soBTC worth near-zero on the open market today,&#x201D; Rogan <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1615361416856207366?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">tweeted</a>. The onchain researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1615363354750599168?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">noted</a>, however, that the evidence was his own &#x201C;speculative findings based on research into FTX US&#x2019;s Solana address and discussions with members of the Solana community.&#x201D; Notably, following Rogan&#x2019;s Twitter thread, SBF decided to reply to the claims made.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fairly confident that FTX US&#x2019;s excess cash on hand is much larger than the size of the wrapped asset issue to the extent there is one,&#x201D; SBF <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1615530215777914880?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">wrote in reply</a> to Rogan&#x2019;s Twitter statements.</p>
<p>Once again, SBF&#x2019;s comment about the sollet (soBTC) issue was met with <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1615530298199969792?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">skepticism</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bryptoplox/status/1615530542958518274?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">criticism</a> shortly after he published the tweet. &#x201C;You just said they were solvent. Now you&#x2019;re &#x2018;fairly confident?'&#x201D; one person <a href="https://twitter.com/huobi/status/1615530447064154114?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">asked</a> the FTX co-founder. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m fairly confident you will spend a long time in federal prison,&#x201D; another individual <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulsood/status/1615585673607794688?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">tweeted</a>. Rogan&#x2019;s Twitter thread and SBF&#x2019;s response further highlight that people do not seem to be accepting the former FTX CEO&#x2019;s statements. &#x201C;Nobody believes anything you say and they never will,&#x201D; one person <a href="https://twitter.com/RickDonnision/status/1615558680862138370?s=20&t=8f2TABQfWcJkPp-aghlsfg">replied</a> to SBF&#x2019;s sollet commentary on Twitter.</p>

For CoinEx, 2022 was also a special year &#8211; quite a few crypto platforms collapsed overnight, and the panic continued as the market went through disruptive changes in Q3 and Q4 of the year. As a global crypto exchange, CoinEx is keenly aware that an exchange cannot survive bulls and bears, or achieve any progress, without consistent improvement of products and services.</p>
<p>In 2022, CoinEx amassed 4.5 million registered users, providing services in 15 languages throughout 200+ countries and regions. Meanwhile, CoinEx set new records in terms of trading volume, the number of cryptos listed, product &amp; service improvement, brand promotion and upgrade, charity, and investment in the last year.</p>
<p><strong>New Milestones: Record-Breaking Trading Volume and New Listings </strong></p>
<p>CoinEx keeps exploring outstanding, innovative crypto projects, and has now supported 600+ cryptos in 1,000+ trading markets, reaching an industrial top level in crypto listing. In 2022, the cumulative Spot and Futures trading volume on CoinEx reached $243.3 billion, and the daily trading volume reached $2.3 billion. As for value-added services, the highest average daily APY in AMM market peaked at 96.08%. During the year, CoinEx has saved over $4.22 million in trading fees for all VIP users, via fee discounts and CET deductions.</p>
<p>This year, we have taken the application scenario and value of CET, the native token on CoinEx Exchange and CoinEx Smart Chain, to the next level: Adhering to the CET value agreement, CoinEx continues to implement the daily repurchase and monthly destruction policies, and has cumulatively repurchased and burnt more than 660 million CET, worthy of $30 million USD.</p>
<p><strong>100% Reserve: Proof of Reserve via “Merkle Tree” Audit Method</strong></p>
<p>In December 2022, as the crypto market encountered a series of turmoil and trust crises, CoinEx responded quickly and launched &#8220;Merkle Tree&#8221; audit method as Proof of Reserve, becoming one of the earliest crypto trading platforms to disclose proof of reserve. CoinEx has always adhered to the bottom line and practiced to maintain a 100% reserve ratio. CoinEx will never use users&#8217; assets for other purposes for any reason, and 100% guarantees withdrawals, adhering to the principles of security and transparency.</p>
<p>The support of &#8220;Proof of Reserve&#8221; not only reassures CoinEx users, but also adds a transparent, secure shield to user assets. In the last 5 years, CoinEx has maintained a zero-accident record and built an extremely stable system protected by comprehensive measures, safe-guarding all user assets.</p>
<p><strong>Serial Integration</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>: Continuous Product &amp; Service Perfection</strong></p>
<p>CoinEx has accumulated 100+ rounds of product optimization and service upgrades throughout the year, covering three major aspects: New services, New experiences, and New upgrades:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> New services</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2022, CoinEx launched exclusive features such as Swap Trading, Dock, Tradeboard, Voucher Center, etc., allowing users to swap cryptos with great flexibility, and offering users a versatile range of appealing giveaway events with a smooth user experience.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> New experiences</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2022, to provide all-new trading experiences, CoinEx restructured and upgraded a series of functions, including Spot trading, Financial service, AMM service, deposit and withdrawal services, asset management, VIP membership, CoinEx Ambassador, Help Center, etc. Via webpage upgrades and flexible adjustments of the account structure and tech framework, CoinEx also rolled out quite a few new features, including Ambassador Referrers, Withdrawal Multi-Approval, dynamic adjustment of Margin interest rates and more. With these new features, users can try out more crypto highlights and receive more incentives from CoinEx.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> New upgrades</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2022, CoinEx launched new upgrades in market overview, contract data, new listing, and Fiat services. In particular, market overview and contract data have helped users keep up with the real-time market changes on CoinEx, and make smarter investment decisions. As more and more fiat service providers join CoinEx, we have also hosted quite a few 0-fee promotions to improve the Fiat trading experience.</p>
<p><strong>New Slogan: Stepping up With Branding Promotion</strong></p>
<p>In April 2022, CoinEx rebranded and redefined our slogan to &#8220;Making Crypto Trading Easier&#8221;, aiming to break free from the traditional financial shackles and make the crypto market more accessible. Moreover, CoinEx would like to provide all users with easy-to-use crypto products and convenient services, and work as a major gateway for global crypto enthusiasts to the crypto world.</p>

Welcomed and invited by 27 blockchain events, CoinEx has spent nearly $1 million sponsoring 31 international competitions and events covering over 200 countries and regions, including the 2022 Rugby League World Cup.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, CoinEx was reported over 13,000 times by global media, influencing over 100 countries and regions, and was nominated in Top 7 Fastest Growing Brands in Financial Services by SimilarWeb.</p>
<p><strong>Charity and Capital: Humanitarian Assistance and First-rate Project Investment</strong></p>
<p>Under the guidance of &#8220;Via Blockchain, Making the World a Better Place&#8221;, CoinEx Charity, a non-profit organization, was founded by CoinEx Exchange in 2022. After the foundation of the Multi-Million-Dollar Charity Fund, CoinEx Charity focuses on helping the vulnerable and is actively involved in charitable activities of all fields, committed to humanitarian relief, development, education, poverty alleviation, emergency relief, free medical care, etc. Working with other charities and governments in 31 rural areas around the world, CoinEx has carried out 32 donations, helping 30,000+ people in need.</p>

As of December 2022, ViaBTC Capital has invested in funds including Pantera Capital, IOSG Ventures, and Shima Capital, built over 50 investment partnerships and networks, and attended more than 20 blockchain AMA sessions and conferences.</p>

Prices rose by as much as 17% in today’s session, as the global cryptocurrency market cap also trended higher. Polkadot was once again in the green, with the token hovering close to a two-month high of its own. </strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) rallied on Wednesday, as the meme coin surged to a two-month high, following declines on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.00001053, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.00001289 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>Today’s move saw shiba inu climb to its strongest point since early November, when prices last collided with a ceiling at the $0.00001290 level.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounded from a support point at 76.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 80.31, which is deep in overbought territory.</p>
<p>Earlier gains have also been wiped out, and the meme coin is currently trading at $0.0000124.</p>

<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) continued to trade near a two-month high, as the token remained near a key resistance level.</p>
<p>DOT/USD jumped to a high of $6.19 earlier in the day, before selling off following the release of U.S. retail sales figures.</p>
<p>Sales in the world’s largest economy fell by 1.1% in December, more than the decline of 0.8% many had expected.</p>

<p>As a result of the news, earlier gains have now been erased, with the price currently trading at $5.69.</p>
<p>The RSI has also given way, with price strength falling below a floor of 70.00, and currently tracking at 64.25.</p>
<p>Should this reversal worsen, DOT could be heading to a floor of $5.00.</p>

Top-level executives, including the new FTX CEO and chief restructuring officer, John J. Ray III, met with the bankruptcy case&#8217;s committee of unsecured creditors to share the news.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Uncovers $5.5 Billion in Liquid Assets Through ‘Herculean Investigative Effort’</h2>
<p>FTX has discovered $5.5 billion in liquid assets, according to a press statement released at 2:40 p.m. Eastern Time, Tuesday. The debtors, including FTX CEO John J. Ray III, announced that the team identified the funds through a &#8220;herculean investigative effort.&#8221; The company&#8217;s press release details that the team found $3.5 billion in cryptocurrency assets, $1.7 billion in cash deposits and roughly $3 million in securities.</p>

<p>The press release further noted that the FTX team discovered $323 million was lost to unauthorized third-party transfers before the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing was registered on Nov. 11, 2022. Furthermore, $426 million &#8220;was transferred to cold storage under the control of the Securities Commission of The Bahamas,&#8221; the debtors&#8217; statement details.</p>

<p>FTX debtors disclose that crypto assets currently held by FTX executives and the restructuring teams are also held in cold storage. &#8220;We are making important progress in our efforts to maximize recoveries, and it has taken a Herculean investigative effort from our team to uncover this preliminary information,&#8221; Ray explained in the update. &#8220;We ask our stakeholders to understand that this information is still preliminary and subject to change. We will provide additional information as soon as we are able to do so.&#8221;</p>

<h2>FTX Debtors Investigate Historical Transactions, Including Voyager and Blockfi Deals, and $93M in Political Donations</h2>
<p>The presentation shared with the committee of unsecured creditors is also attached to the FTX press release, and it notes that an investigation &#8220;confirmed shortfalls at both international and U.S. exchanges.&#8221; Furthermore, the investigation &#8220;uncovered the mechanics behind how Alameda Research had the ability to borrow without collateral effectively unlimited amounts from customers.&#8221; The debtors&#8217; report insists that a &#8220;small group of individuals&#8221; had the ability to remove assets from FTX without it ever being &#8220;recorded on the exchange ledger.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to the recovered $5.5 billion, FTX debtors are exploring multiple facets to maximize the recovery process through the &#8220;potential sale&#8221; of four subsidiaries. The team is exploring ways to monetize the hundreds of investments made that currently hold a book value of around &#8220;$4.6 billion.&#8221;</p>

<p>FTX debtors want to maximize recovery by &#8220;marketing real estate in the Bahamas,&#8221; and investigators aim to probe &#8220;all historical transactions&#8221; related to the business.</p>

<p>The real estate owned by the inner circle is worth around $205.5 million, stretched across 27 different properties located in The Bahamas. The historical transactions being investigated involve the Voyager and Blockfi deals, alongside $93 million worth of political donations FTX executives made between March 2020 and November 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hundreds of [mergers and acquisitions] M&amp;A and other transactions under review,&#8221; the presentation explains. The presentation also gives a detailed visual map of how the inner circle, mostly Alameda Research, could &#8220;withdraw assets without [a] record on the exchange ledger.&#8221;</p>
