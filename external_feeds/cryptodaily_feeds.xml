			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen some impressive gains recently, with two projects, in particular, standing out: Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) and Terra Classic (LUNC). ORBN, a decentralized crowdfunding and startup launchpad, has already exploded by 980% in its Presale. Analysts are predicting even more gains from ORBN in the near future. Meanwhile, LUNC rallied over 20%. As for Ripple (XRP), experts are divided on its future price performance. Some believe it has the potential to rise significantly, while others are more cautious. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Ripple (XRP)</p>
<p>Ripple operates on an open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer technology that enables seamless money transactions. Ripple's clientele includes a number of well-known banks and financial industry companies. Ripple (XRP) is utilized in its products to facilitate the rapid conversion of multiple currencies. Ripple, which was released in 2012, is one of the earliest cryptocurrency projects on the coin market.</p>
<p>The Ripple network utilizes a consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) process. The consensus process tries to strengthen the system's integrity by eliminating double-spending.</p>
<p>Ripple will have little trouble reaching the top of the coin market since it can securely execute transactions for nearly any type of cryptocurrency. The price of Ripple (XRP) is expected to rise after the cryptocurrency emerges from its legal battle with the SEC.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Terra Classic (LUNC)</p>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) is an algorithmically-governed, seigniorage-style stablecoin ecosystem that is native to a collection of fiat-pegged tokens and Luna.</p>
<p>Terra was founded in January 2018 to facilitate the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies by generating digitally native assets with stable prices relative to the world's major fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Investors in Terra Classic (LUNC) are extremely concerned about the future of their holdings. This is due to the fact that Terra Classic (LUNC) had a difficult year in 2022, as the Terra Classic (LUNC) price sank to almost zero after a major scandal resulting in the collapse of its network.</p>
<p>Although Terra Classic (LUNC) has seen some positive price movement recently, having days where the token rallies by double digits, Terra Classic (LUNC) is currently up 149% in the past 200 days. This renewed momentum has investors confident in Terra Classic (LUNC)&rsquo;s performance into 2023.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>In the current crypto winter, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has emerged as a standout performer, having gained nearly 980% in its ongoing Presale. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a DeFi platform that provides users with a secure and uncomplicated way to participate in early-stage investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) was created to assist entrepreneurs in raising funding without the obstacles of the venture capital industry. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) mints NFTs against company-issued equity, and individuals can become investors by purchasing these NFTs beginning at $1.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) places a strong emphasis on security. The "fill or kill" mechanism will repay investors if a funding round falls short, creating a safe environment for both sides.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast that ORBN will skyrocket over 6000% from its initial pre-sale price of $0.004, resulting in a 60x return. The presale of the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has been a tremendous success, as the price of ORBN has increased by 980% within a few months, in large part due to benefits of being an ORBN holder. These include staking rewards, governance rights and more.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX has released its proof of reserves and with that revealed that 90% of its user&rsquo;s assets are stored in Binance wallets. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange WazirX has released its proof of reserves and says that it is India&rsquo;s largest exchange in terms of both volume and reserve funds. Following the chaos that ensued after the fall of bankrupt exchange FTX, most major digital-asset service providers in the industry began publicizing their reserve funds, with Binance taking the lead. As distrust within the industry began to siphon through the industry, many firms had to release their reserves in order to maintain consumer confidence. The latest to join this trend is the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX. The exchange made its act of transparency public on January 11 and said:</p>

<p>We are not only India's largest crypto exchange by volume but also India&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange by reserves.</p>

<p>The exchange utilized CoinGabbar, a third-party crypto asset tracking forum, to make its proof of reserves public. Per the data, WazirX has about $285 million in total assets displayed in the Tether stablecoin. WazirX&rsquo;s further indicated that 90% of its user assets are held in Binance-based wallets, and the remaining 10% is stored in both hot and cold storage wallets. WazirX said that Binance was its chosen wallet due to its &ldquo;strict protocols and industry-leading technical measures&rdquo; used to safeguard user funds on its platform.</p>
<p>Another revelation to come from the proof of reserves is that over 19% of the exchange&rsquo;s holdings are in Shiba Inu, 9.37% in Ether, 8.28% in Bitcoin, and 8.18% in DogeCoin. The exchange also assured customers that its reserves-to-liabilities ratio was more than 1:1, meaning that it should not experience any liquidity issues should it undergo major customer withdrawals.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange FTX has recovered more than $5 billion, but the extent of customer losses in its collapse is still unknown.</p>
<p>The collapse of the company has left many investors and customers wondering about the extent of their losses, and the situation has only grown murkier as the company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been accused of orchestrating an "epic" fraud that may have cost investors, customers, and lenders billions of dollars.</p>
<p>According to an attorney for the bankrupt company, FTX has been able to recover more than $5 billion of cash, liquid cryptocurrency, and liquid investment securities. However, this is not enough to cover the potential customer losses, which are still unknown. The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission has estimated that the missing customer funds are more than $8 billion.</p>
<p>In an effort to recoup some of the lost funds, FTX plans to sell off non-strategic investments that are valued at around $4.6 billion. However, the work to obtain accurate internal records is still ongoing, and a full account of the funds that might be used to repay creditors is not known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recovered funds also do not include assets seized by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, where Bankman-Fried was located. The attorney estimated the seized assets were worth around $170 million while Bahamian authorities put the figure as high as $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>These seized assets are largely composed of FTX's proprietary and illiquid FTT token, which is likely to head towards zero in value, further complicating the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a report by The Globe and Mail, it was stated that FTX&rsquo;s legal team was in court on Wednesday to seek approval for procedures to sell affiliates LedgerX, Embed, FTX Japan, and FTX Europe. It said, however, that the U.S. Trustee is not in favour of selling the affiliates before the whole extent of the alleged FTX fraud has come to light.</p>
<p>The collapse of FTX will have impacted heavily on celebrities who were working with the platform, including American football star Tom Brady, Brady's former wife, supermodel Gisele B&uuml;ndchen, and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Fades After Testing 17510:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 12 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retraced some of its recent upward glide early in the Asian session as the pair backed away after testing the 17510.29 area, its strongest print since 15 December 2022.&nbsp; Selling pressure intensified around the 17510.29 area and knocked BTC/USD lower to the 17315 level, a test of the 23.6% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 16670.82 to 17510.29.&nbsp; Additional downside retracement levels in the appreciating range include the 17189, 17090, 16991, 16868, and 16850 levels.&nbsp; Another technically significant range that traders are monitoring is the appreciation from 16326.16 to 17510.29, and corresponding retracement levels include the 17230, 17057, 16918, 16778, 16605, and 16579 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, was off more than 3% in December, and is up approximately 5% month-to-date. Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Previous selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels may result in possible tests of the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16987.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17331.73.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>New York, United States, 11th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Reap, the global fintech company powering expense management through the industry first Reap Visa Corporate Card (&ldquo;Reap Card&rdquo;) platform, launches industry-leading innovation by including cryptocurrency repayments functionality for the Web3 industry. Together with the Reap Card, Reap is offering expense management software that will enable web3 companies to settle their fiat payments with cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daren Guo, Reap Co-Founder, said: &ldquo;We noticed a gap in the payments market involving web3 projects that face challenges for settling corporate expenses with non-fiat currencies like cryptocurrency. A seamless and scalable solution to convert crypto into fiat currently does not exist as traditional banks have not been able to settle on an industry standard for these web3 businesses. Reap is now able to bridge the gap between web3 businesses and the web2 fiat economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Security and stability are at the forefront of customers&rsquo; minds who leverage Web3 technologies. To build out a trusted ecosystem, Reap has integrated with Fireblocks, an easy-to-use platform to create new blockchain-based products and manage day-to-day digital asset operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen Richardson, SVP of Financial Markets at Fireblocks, added: &nbsp;&ldquo;The security of digital assets is of paramount importance when it comes to building customer trust, which is why we are delighted to be working with Reap to power secure, frictionless payments for web3 creators. Reap&rsquo;s solution stands to improve operational efficiency for web3 projects, allowing founders and project owners to focus on building innovative products with greater peace of mind. We&rsquo;re proud to work with innovative companies like Reap that will enable the next generation of digital assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Reap Card simplifies the process of settling global payments in fiat by using USDC, USDT, BTC, and ETH seamlessly to resolve the problem of costly handling fees that include multiple off-ramp parties. Digital provider Gnosis has already used this service to see firsthand how the Reap Card streamlines complicated currency conversion processes and billing issues, freeing up executive time to focus on core business operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an early adopter of Reap Card, we have been able to take advantage of their innovative product suite and seamlessly settle payments in fiat currencies,&rdquo; said Dosh, Communication and Marketing Team at Gnosis. &ldquo;Reap&rsquo;s solution has been particularly useful for bypassing the difficulties and hurdles that often come with trying to use cryptocurrency to navigate the traditional banking system.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Reap envisions a future where every business, regardless of size and industry, has the opportunity to operate at its full potential by building and applying innovative financial solutions. Reap is committed to orchestrating success with all types of business to capture global opportunities, in an ever-changing competitive global marketplace.</p>
<p>About Reap</p>
<p>Reap is a financial platform that enables access and financial connectivity through innovation for companies of all sizes.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York, United States, 11th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Reap, the global fintech company powering expense management through the industry first Reap Visa Corporate Card (&ldquo;Reap Card&rdquo;) platform, launches industry-leading innovation by including cryptocurrency repayments functionality for the Web3 industry. Together with the Reap Card, Reap is offering expense management software that will enable web3 companies to settle their fiat payments with cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daren Guo, Reap Co-Founder, said: &ldquo;We noticed a gap in the payments market involving web3 projects that face challenges for settling corporate expenses with non-fiat currencies like cryptocurrency. A seamless and scalable solution to convert crypto into fiat currently does not exist as traditional banks have not been able to settle on an industry standard for these web3 businesses. Reap is now able to bridge the gap between web3 businesses and the web2 fiat economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Security and stability are at the forefront of customers&rsquo; minds who leverage Web3 technologies. To build out a trusted ecosystem, Reap has integrated with Fireblocks, an easy-to-use platform to create new blockchain-based products and manage day-to-day digital asset operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen Richardson, SVP of Financial Markets at Fireblocks, added: &nbsp;&ldquo;The security of digital assets is of paramount importance when it comes to building customer trust, which is why we are delighted to be working with Reap to power secure, frictionless payments for web3 creators. Reap&rsquo;s solution stands to improve operational efficiency for web3 projects, allowing founders and project owners to focus on building innovative products with greater peace of mind. We&rsquo;re proud to work with innovative companies like Reap that will enable the next generation of digital assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Reap Card simplifies the process of settling global payments in fiat by using USDC, USDT, BTC, and ETH seamlessly to resolve the problem of costly handling fees that include multiple off-ramp parties. Digital provider Gnosis has already used this service to see firsthand how the Reap Card streamlines complicated currency conversion processes and billing issues, freeing up executive time to focus on core business operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an early adopter of Reap Card, we have been able to take advantage of their innovative product suite and seamlessly settle payments in fiat currencies,&rdquo; said Dosh, Communication and Marketing Team at Gnosis. &ldquo;Reap&rsquo;s solution has been particularly useful for bypassing the difficulties and hurdles that often come with trying to use cryptocurrency to navigate the traditional banking system.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Reap envisions a future where every business, regardless of size and industry, has the opportunity to operate at its full potential by building and applying innovative financial solutions. Reap is committed to orchestrating success with all types of business to capture global opportunities, in an ever-changing competitive global marketplace.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Account Abstraction will make Ethereum as easy to use as a traditional bank account.</p>
The Challenge of Human Error in Crypto
<p>Ethereum developers are working to make the Ethereum blockchain more user-friendly. One of the main challenges of crypto is the potential to lose access to one's crypto holdings due to a simple mistake such as losing access to one's private key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the face of this and other potential pitfalls, it&rsquo;s vastly easier to lose your money in crypto than in traditional banking. Blockchain developers are increasingly recognizing that human error is an inevitability, meaning it will be difficult to push crypto into the mainstream without fail-safes and better ease of use.</p>
<p>An article published today on CoinDesk breaks down the concept of Account Abstraction (AA). This concept aims to use smart contracts to execute crypto transactions by creating certain validity rules. With AA, users won't need to sign off on every transaction with one&rsquo;s private keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to make Ethereum as easy to use as a traditional bank account, so that users can make transactions more easily, program automatic bill payments and more.</p>
Understanding Ethereum Transactions: EOAs and CAs
<p>To understand how AA would change the nature of how one may use crypto, it's important to understand how Ethereum transactions operate today. On Ethereum, users have the ability to create two types of accounts: External Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts (CA). The two account types differ in terms of how they initiate transactions over Ethereum&rsquo;s network. EOAs are the typical account-type for Ethereum users and are the type of account one would use if they have used a wallet provider such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.</p>
The Problem with External Owned Accounts
<p>With an EOA, users are given a pair of keys: a public and a private key. Anyone can send funds to an EOA using its public key. But only the account&rsquo;s owner &ndash; whoever has access to the account&rsquo;s private key, which should be kept secret &ndash; can actually initiate transactions from the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with EOAs is that if a user loses their private key, there is no way to regain access to their funds. And even if a user doesn't lose their key, if someone gets their hands on a person&rsquo;s private key, they gain complete control over that person&rsquo;s funds.</p>
<p>CA, also known as "smart contracts," are like mini computer programs that live on the Ethereum network. These accounts are controlled by code, but they cannot initiate transactions themselves. An EOA needs to send a transaction to a CA in order for it to make transactions of its own.</p>
How Account Abstraction Addresses Shortcomings in Ethereum
<p>Account Abstraction addresses the shortcomings of EOAs by merging them with CAs. It allows people to create user accounts with built-in fail-safe mechanisms and other special features for verifying transactions. This move is seen as necessary to push crypto into mainstream use.&nbsp;</p>
A Step Towards Mainstream Adoption of Crypto
<p>As Kristof Gazso, a co-author for an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) on AA says "We're going to be at a point in the future where using an Ethereum account, it's going to be just as simple as using a bank." The goal is to make Ethereum more user-friendly and secure, preventing costly mistakes and increasing the chances of crypto being adopted by mainstream users.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Suppose the Art Basel exhibition floor and the Venice Biennale had anything in common in 2022, apart from hosting mesmerizing works of inspiring art. In that case, it&rsquo;s the presence of a new form of expressive medium that is making an even bigger impact as a bridge between mind and matter. The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) phenomenon is coming back stronger than ever, despite the recession on the overall market of decentralized digital assets. It seems art lovers speak the same language, as appreciation for expression has taken over the mercantile aspect of digitization, allowing visionary projects to make their statements at both world-leading art events.</p>
<p>The Venice Biennale of 2022, which took place from May to November, hosted &ldquo;Seven of Swords&rdquo; by Justin Aversano, displayed at the Decentral Art Pavilion &mdash; dedicated entirely to digital artworks. The work, part of the &ldquo;Smoke and Mirrors&rdquo; collection, consists of 78 photographs of visionary individuals from the mystical, astrological, tarot, and other metaphysical planes of thought. Designed as unique tarot cards themselves in NFT format, the portrait artworks highlight an otherworldly presence, making the viewer believe in the existence of magic, hauntingly conveyed through the characters&rsquo; zealous adherence to their powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; by Concept2048 is another project with NFT inclinations that made its loud statement at the Venice Biennale&rsquo;s contemporary art exhibition Personal Structures. Created by a duo of digital artists &ndash; Ekaterina Perekopskaya and Rostyslav Brenych &mdash; the works, set to be released as NFTs on January 24, 2023, represent various facets of art, stemming from concept and foresight. Indeed, considering that both artists involved in Concept2048 specialize in art fashion and conceptual production, their works leave more questions than answers in the mind of the viewer, tantalizing them with the quintessential one &mdash; is there such a thing as a final answer at all?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subtle games of light and shades of vibrant colors are the focal points in the collection, focusing the viewer&rsquo;s attention on the contrasts at play and the underlying concept of Universal light, one that dims in our world as it passes through challenges and development phases. The open-ended nature of their creative works sheds light on global issues, like sustainable development, urging and inspiring the viewer to act and take a stance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; collection made an equally resounding impact at the Venice Biennale, effectively blurring the line between concept and finality. Understandable, considering that it already wields the admiration of a 100,000 community, has experienced full sell-outs at presales, and a 350% price increase since launch. Those wishing to take advantage of early bird opportunities, may join the whitelist available on the project&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Social Sacrifice&rdquo; by Studio Drift at Ocean Space is an excellent example of NFT&rsquo;s merger with the physical. As a representative of the phygital medium, Drift set in motion remote-controlled drones, creating a staggering display of art through light and movement. Each of the 100+ live indoor performances was preserved in NFT format for further sale on the Aorist platform. The Artificial Intelligence involved in modeling the movements of a school of fish represented by the drones was accompanied in its graceful dynamic displays by the visceral orchestral audio design by artist and musician Don Diablo.</p>
<p>Such performances that imprint unforgettable live events as digital memorabilia continue to elevate the status of NFTs as true works of art and cement their perception as worthy additions to the many forms of human expression, and as feasts for the senses.</p>
<p>Another event blending the digital and the physical rocked the Art Basel venue as World of Women made its statement for a thriving community living the dream making inclusivity one of the founding pillars of Web3 space. The WoW collection by Yam Karkai is all about dissecting the stories of empowered and diverse women who were able to leave their mark on the world. The passion that Yam displayed with her vision gave WoW the necessary impetus to become one of the leading NFT brands in the world.</p>
<p>The 10,000 unique pieces of mesmerizing art in the collection, released on July 27th, 2021, sport randomly-generated digital collectibles hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. With their vivid colors, haunting gazes, and outright tribal art styles, the images inspire awe and admiration for the spirit of women who drive the world around them. The World of Women gala at the Art Basel event included a ceremony awarding attendees for digital fashion design, made all the more exciting by music from electronic duo Sofi Tukker. The importance of the collection resides in the fact that it recognizes women&rsquo;s digital identity through fashion and design, allowing them to leave a tangible footprint in Web3 space.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clothing brands taking on the NFT medium is not a new phenomenon, but one taken on a new spin around the digital block by ITERATION-02 &ndash; a collaboration between 9dcc and Snowfro. Art Blocks founder and creator of the Chromie Squiggle injects a new spin on wearables. The ITERATION-02 collection takes the process of releasing on-chain generative art to the next level by seamlessly converting each creation into an article of generative clothing.</p>
<p>The lineup is ideal for admirers of luxury and digital artworks alike, as the iconic Chromie Squiggle is remixed with the visuals of 9dcc in NFT format, giving each holder a unique T-shirt proudly bearing the resulting digital image. The ability to actually wear unique art forms may not be a new concept in NFT space, but ITERATION-02 certainly shifts it from the inaccessible to the mass market segment, giving a vastly broader audience of NFT admirers to dive headlong into the process of creating digital artworks.</p>
From figment to art
<p>The days of badly-rendered, pixelated NFTs are long gone, as artists are becoming more sophisticated and bolder in how they approach the new medium of art and expression. While collections like Metamorphoses highlight the versatility of NFTs in conceptual medium, others like Drift push the envelope of art&rsquo;s perception as a static phenomenon and transcend the boundaries of visual and audio performance.</p>
<p>It is precisely the audacity of such artists who challenge the established frameworks of creative concepts that elevates digital art&rsquo;s standing and status at events like the Venice Biennale and Art Basel. It will take more time, of course, before NFTs become fully mainstream and the stigma surrounding them blurs, but the foundation has been laid. If the pace of adoption persists and the artists continue to unleash their creativity, another bull run for NFT art is well in the making.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; by Concept2048 is another project with NFT inclinations that made its loud statement at the Venice Biennale&rsquo;s contemporary art exhibition Personal Structures. Created by a duo of digital artists &ndash; Ekaterina Perekopskaya and Rostyslav Brenych &mdash; the works, set to be released as NFTs on January 24, 2023, represent various facets of art, stemming from concept and foresight. Indeed, considering that both artists involved in Concept2048 specialize in art fashion and conceptual production, their works leave more questions than answers in the mind of the viewer, tantalizing them with the quintessential one &mdash; is there such a thing as a final answer at all?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subtle games of light and shades of vibrant colors are the focal points in the collection, focusing the viewer&rsquo;s attention on the contrasts at play and the underlying concept of Universal light, one that dims in our world as it passes through challenges and development phases. The open-ended nature of their creative works sheds light on global issues, like sustainable development, urging and inspiring the viewer to act and take a stance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; collection made an equally resounding impact at the Venice Biennale, effectively blurring the line between concept and finality. Understandable, considering that it already wields the admiration of a 100,000 community, has experienced full sell-outs at presales, and a 350% price increase since launch. Those wishing to take advantage of early bird opportunities, may join the whitelist available on the project&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Social Sacrifice&rdquo; by Studio Drift at Ocean Space is an excellent example of NFT&rsquo;s merger with the physical. As a representative of the phygital medium, Drift set in motion remote-controlled drones, creating a staggering display of art through light and movement. Each of the 100+ live indoor performances was preserved in NFT format for further sale on the Aorist platform. The Artificial Intelligence involved in modeling the movements of a school of fish represented by the drones was accompanied in its graceful dynamic displays by the visceral orchestral audio design by artist and musician Don Diablo.</p>
<p>Such performances that imprint unforgettable live events as digital memorabilia continue to elevate the status of NFTs as true works of art and cement their perception as worthy additions to the many forms of human expression, and as feasts for the senses.</p>
<p>Another event blending the digital and the physical rocked the Art Basel venue as World of Women made its statement for a thriving community living the dream making inclusivity one of the founding pillars of Web3 space. The WoW collection by Yam Karkai is all about dissecting the stories of empowered and diverse women who were able to leave their mark on the world. The passion that Yam displayed with her vision gave WoW the necessary impetus to become one of the leading NFT brands in the world.</p>
<p>The 10,000 unique pieces of mesmerizing art in the collection, released on July 27th, 2021, sport randomly-generated digital collectibles hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. With their vivid colors, haunting gazes, and outright tribal art styles, the images inspire awe and admiration for the spirit of women who drive the world around them. The World of Women gala at the Art Basel event included a ceremony awarding attendees for digital fashion design, made all the more exciting by music from electronic duo Sofi Tukker. The importance of the collection resides in the fact that it recognizes women&rsquo;s digital identity through fashion and design, allowing them to leave a tangible footprint in Web3 space.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clothing brands taking on the NFT medium is not a new phenomenon, but one taken on a new spin around the digital block by ITERATION-02 &ndash; a collaboration between 9dcc and Snowfro. Art Blocks founder and creator of the Chromie Squiggle injects a new spin on wearables. The ITERATION-02 collection takes the process of releasing on-chain generative art to the next level by seamlessly converting each creation into an article of generative clothing.</p>
<p>The lineup is ideal for admirers of luxury and digital artworks alike, as the iconic Chromie Squiggle is remixed with the visuals of 9dcc in NFT format, giving each holder a unique T-shirt proudly bearing the resulting digital image. The ability to actually wear unique art forms may not be a new concept in NFT space, but ITERATION-02 certainly shifts it from the inaccessible to the mass market segment, giving a vastly broader audience of NFT admirers to dive headlong into the process of creating digital artworks.</p>
From figment to art
<p>The days of badly-rendered, pixelated NFTs are long gone, as artists are becoming more sophisticated and bolder in how they approach the new medium of art and expression. While collections like Metamorphoses highlight the versatility of NFTs in conceptual medium, others like Drift push the envelope of art&rsquo;s perception as a static phenomenon and transcend the boundaries of visual and audio performance.</p>
<p>It is precisely the audacity of such artists who challenge the established frameworks of creative concepts that elevates digital art&rsquo;s standing and status at events like the Venice Biennale and Art Basel. It will take more time, of course, before NFTs become fully mainstream and the stigma surrounding them blurs, but the foundation has been laid. If the pace of adoption persists and the artists continue to unleash their creativity, another bull run for NFT art is well in the making.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>RINO, an enterprise-focused Monero Wallet, has recently launched a free Community Edition that allows everyone to benefit from some of RINO&rsquo;s unique features.</p>
<p>The lack of professional tools and custody options has been a major obstacle to the business adoption of Monero. Other digital assets and coins have long benefited from a range of highly secure custody services offered by companies such as Bitgo, Fireblocks, and Copper. The RINO team wanted to address this shortcoming and enable the next growth phase of the Monero ecosystem. RINO&rsquo;s first product is a feature-rich non-custodial wallet targeted at the enterprise. With the launch of the Community Edition, some of the core features of the RINO enterprise platform are now being offered to the wider Monero community for free.</p>
<p>All Monero users can now benefit from RINO&rsquo;s highly secured 2FA authentication. Unlike other wallets, RINO guarantees the safety of the funds even if the wallet password is compromised.</p>
<p>With the Community Edition, users can access their wallets from any device. Wallets are always instantly synchronized without any waiting time upon connection. Sync happens even when users are away from their phone or laptop - they can even disconnect from their wallets completely and still receive a notification for each incoming transaction. With RINO&rsquo;s integrated exchanges, one can also buy and sell XMR directly from the wallet (crypto-crypto is available now, and fiat is coming soon) at competitive rates.</p>
<p>RINO&rsquo;s self-custody wallet is powered by multi-signature cryptography, following a 2-out-of-3 setup. The owner of a RINO wallet controls two of the three keys; the RINO platform controls the last key. Two out of three keys are needed to access funds, so RINO can never steal or spend its customers&rsquo; money. In daily use, a wallet owner uses one of their two keys to initiate transactions, with RINO acting as a controlling authority to add additional levels of security (e.g., requiring 2FA) and only co-signing transactions according to pre-agreed constraints and security policies. The last key is the owner's &ldquo;recovery key&rdquo;, which should be kept in cold storage. Hence, should a wallet owner ever decide to discontinue their relationship with RINO, they can spend their funds without interacting with RINO at all.</p>
<p>The RINO team has been involved with Monero for many years and is excited to be an integral part of Monero&rsquo;s next growth phase.</p>
<p>About RINO</p>
<p>RINO was launched by serial crypto entrepreneurs whose hearts and minds have been with Monero since its inception. Having run Monero services themselves for many years, they recognised major shortcomings in the Monero ecosystem and decided to do something about it. RINO&rsquo;s mission is to bring world-class professional tools to the Monero ecosystem and enable the next phase of Monero&rsquo;s growth.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Playing bridge online has become much more accessible thanks to the Bridge Champ platform. The team leverages blockchain technology to connect players and now seeks to advance its solution through crypto rewards and NFT badges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Bridge Champ Takes The Next Step
<p>The concept of playing bridge online - either as a novice, expert, or club - has remained elusive for a very long time. Things began to change with the help of Bridge Champ and its blockchain-based solution. Built on Ignis, the first child chain of Jelurida's Ardor technology stack, the platform prides itself on thwarting cheating. In addition, the ledger secures all relevant game data.</p>
<p>So far, Bridge Champ has proven relatively successful. There is tremendous global interest in the online bridge platform. Global demand for online and competitive bridge play becomes more outspoken, and players make their way to the blockchain platform in droves. Continuing that momentum - and potentially accelerating it - is the next major objective.</p>
<p>Bridge Champ's new roadmap seeks to enhance the platform and align it to the team's initial vision. That includes organziing online tournaments, cryptocurrency rewards, token payments, and adding NFTs. For the latter, Bridge Champ will support NFT badges tied to in-game achievements on the platform. Based on player performance, they can unlock cryptocurrency rewards.</p>
<p>Other aspects of the roadmap include unifying the mobile and web experience, credit card payment support, and official leaderboards. Bridge is a very social game, as using NFT badges, achievements, rankings, and rewards makes the blockchain platform stand out among other online providers. In addition, the roadmap enhancements allow more people to get acquainted with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A Different Take On Play-to-Earn
<p>When people think about NFTs, they may consider the play-to-earn industry. However, P2E games traditionally require players to make an upfront NFT purchase before accessing the ecosystem. Bridge Champ takes the opposite route, as the blockchain-based platform is accessible to anyone at no cost. Their use of NFTs is more social-oriented rather than money-driven.</p>
<p>More importantly, the play-to-earn aspects will elevate Bridge Champ's social features. Those features allow for building a global network of bridge players, clubs, and federations. With native support for guided play and pre-made hands, anyone can pick up a bridge in hours. Using an NFT badge to show one's progress is a badge of honor and one that can lead to crypto rewards.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The government of Argentina has proposed a new bill that encourages its citizens to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings with the promise of discounted tax rates. </p>
<p>Argentines may soon be motivated to reveal their crypto holdings through tax incentives. Argentina&rsquo;s Ministry of Economy &ndash; the economic policy manager of the country - has introduced a new crypto bill aimed at addressing money laundering and encourages its citizens to reveal their crypto holdings by incentivizing them with lowered tax rates according to local news reports. The &ldquo;Externalization of Argentine Savings&rdquo; draft law is aimed at fighting money laundering and was introduced by economy minister Sergio Massa.</p>
<p>The bill includes a requirement that holders of cryptocurrencies produce an affidavit identifying the whereabouts of their holdings to the Argentine government. Those who declare their holdings would benefit from tax breaks.</p>
<p>According to the draft bill, those who voluntarily declare their holdings within 90 days of the law coming into effect would only be required to a 2.5% tax on capital gains of their holdings. The rate increases incrementally every 90 days until reaching 15%, which is Argentina&rsquo;s standard capital gains tax rate. According to reports by Cointelegraph, the draft bill would force domestic and foreign holdings to be deposited into banks approved in Argentina or into foreign banks that are regulated by the jurisdiction&rsquo;s central bank or securities commission.</p>
<p>The bill further encourages Argentines to declare any holdings of financial assets that are subject to capital gains including fiat currencies, stocks, shares, and real estate.</p>
Argentina Cracks Down on Crypto
<p>Recent reports by Bitcoin.com revealed that the Argentine senate is discussing a project that would regulate the way in which crypto is promoted by individuals and organizations. The project is aimed at educating consumers on the dangers of investing in crypto.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/01/opside-network-introduces-3-layer-architecture-for-blockchain-applications</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain scalability and proposed solutions have been at the forefront of social media chatter for half a decade. For example, the Israeli software company Starkware and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently talked about the idea of &ldquo;Layer 3&rdquo; as one of these solutions. Starkware says multiple Layer 3&rsquo;s will ride on top of Layer 2, and &ldquo;fractal layering&rdquo; solutions can be built on top of Layer 3&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Opside project recently released their plans for a three-layer architecture. This will allow developers to create blockchain applications that have access to faster speeds and cheaper transactions. This is made possible by the Opside chain, which is dubbed a Layer 2 solution because it sits on top of&nbsp; multiple Layer 1 platforms (Like Ethereum, Binance Chain, Bitcoin, etc) and uses them as a settlement layer. The &ldquo;Layer 3&rdquo; functionality takes this even further, allowing for developers to spin up a set of &ldquo;rollups as a service&rdquo;. This architecture gives Layer 2 a more comprehensive range of assets from bridges and the ability to grow indefinitely from rollups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to handle the contract calls between multiple chains, Opside developed a protocol to handle all the contract calls. Also in development is DAO voting that allows the Opside community to vote on which public chains to use for Layer 1 settlement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Layer 2 solutions depend on the decentralization of their Layer 1 counterpart to provide faster transaction times and lower gas fees. It seems to be acceptable to most blockchain communities to have a centralized layer on top of their platform so long as every transaction gets settled at the Layer 1 level. Efficiency is achieved by &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; a set of transactions and settling later. Layer 3 amplifies this model, allowing even greater cost efficiency while maintaining the speed of the Layer 2 network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Layer 3 holds the potential to offer such low costs, that projects built even on Layer 2 networks won&rsquo;t have to deploy their own Layer 1&rsquo;s to lower the settlement fees. These applications, such as Axie and dYdX Decentralized Exchange had to do this, simply because their model depended on the fastest transaction times and lowest fees. If deployed on a Layer 3 rollup, it could prevent the need for yet another blockchain.</p>
<p>Layer1: Multi-chain bridges</p>
<p>Opside supports a faster and cheaper decentralized Liquidity-Bridge to achieve asset interoperability in more chains. Liquidity-Bridge consists of permissionless nodes that reach consensus on cross-chain messages through MPC. The liquidity pool brings faster speed and supports more public chains and their on-chain assets.</p>
<p>Further, Opside will establish connections with various public chains of the asset layer through the trustless ZK-Bridge. Compared with other bridge schemes, the ZK-Rollup scheme involves more ZK-proof systems. In the cross-chain operation, it is necessary to generate ZK Proofs to ensure the correctness of the execution process in addition to a general &ldquo;execution.&rdquo; The deposit and withdrawal operations of ZK-Bridge are &ldquo;solidified&rdquo; as a circuit, and the circuit logic is completely exposed.</p>
<p>Layer2: A Rollup-friendly chain</p>
<p>The Opside chain, or Layer 2, is an EVM-compatible and rollup-friendly chain. The Opside chain will do some deep optimizations for rollups.</p>
<p>Native rollup is somewhat similar to the architecture of Polkadot. Once a rollup registers a slot, the rollup becomes a native rollup. In contrast, the Polkadot architecture has the disadvantage that the consensus of the parachain depends on the assigned set of validators. There is a correlation between security and the number of validators. If a few validators went offline, the parachains whose validator groups are too small to validate a block will skip those blocks, or even stop until the situation is resolved. Opside does not have this problem because layer 2 collects data from all native rollups in layer 3 and verifies all zk proofs. Opside Chain is more secure and decentralized with all rollups on it as a tighter whole, sharing the same consensus layer.</p>
<p>There are 64 pre-deployed contracts as &ldquo;rollup slots,&rdquo; which will be called directly by batch &amp; proof transactions from rollups. These slots will call a precompiled contract for proof verification and update local state roots if successful. The precompiled contract can accelerate the verification of zero-knowledge proofs with optimizations in binary codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Layer 2 and layer 3 of the Opside architecture share a consensus mechanism with a hybrid of PoS and PoW.</p>
<ul>
<li>PoS: On layer 2, anyone can become a validator by staking, then have the opportunity to produce blocks of the Opside Chain. PoS is provable and validators periodically submit PoS proof to layer 1. Validators can get the block reward and staking reward for this part of PoS.</li>
<li>PoW: The validators of layer 2 will not only produce Opside Chain blocks, but also generate zk proof for each native rollup of layer 3 according to the rules of PoVP. Validators will get the IDE reward for successful generating zk proof, which is somewhat similar to PoW. Validators can get an extra bonus for that part of the reward by staking more tokens in the system contract.</li>
</ul>
<p>More importantly, in Opside, after completing the registration of slots, native rollups share a world state tree with each other and the same global message queue. Therefore, native cross-rollup interoperability is possible in Opside. Imagine you want to lend USDC to a loan contract in Rollup A and then go to DEX in Rollup B to trade to buy BTC. On Opside, you no longer need to withdraw assets from Rollup A to L1 and then recharge them from L1 to Rollup B. Instead, you can call the contract method of Rollup B directly in Rollup A. This will make the whole process much faster, cheaper and safer.</p>
<p>Layer3: Decentralized ZK-Rollups</p>
<p>In the third layer, Opside supports developers to deploy their own rollups, while Opside also provides a decentralized rollup solution based on RaaS mentioned above. Developers can freely choose which one to adopt. This solution is trustless and permissionless. Anyone can submit L2 batches and proofs to L1.</p>
<p>To summarize, the "base layer &lt;- opside &lt;- rollup" architecture of Opside has the advantage of asset variety and infinite scalability. It could be another choice to solve the scalability problems of web3 applications. Compared to expensive rollup-based layer 2s, it is more suitable for high-throughput applications like games.</p>

Starkware says multiple Layer 3&rsquo;s will ride on top of Layer 2, and &ldquo;fractal layering&rdquo; solutions can be built on top of Layer 3&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Opside project recently released their plans for a three-layer architecture. This will allow developers to create blockchain applications that have access to faster speeds and cheaper transactions. This is made possible by the Opside chain, which is dubbed a Layer 2 solution because it sits on top of&nbsp; multiple Layer 1 platforms (Like Ethereum, Binance Chain, Bitcoin, etc) and uses them as a settlement layer. The &ldquo;Layer 3&rdquo; functionality takes this even further, allowing for developers to spin up a set of &ldquo;rollups as a service&rdquo;. This architecture gives Layer 2 a more comprehensive range of assets from bridges and the ability to grow indefinitely from rollups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to handle the contract calls between multiple chains, Opside developed a protocol to handle all the contract calls. Also in development is DAO voting that allows the Opside community to vote on which public chains to use for Layer 1 settlement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Layer 2 solutions depend on the decentralization of their Layer 1 counterpart to provide faster transaction times and lower gas fees. It seems to be acceptable to most blockchain communities to have a centralized layer on top of their platform so long as every transaction gets settled at the Layer 1 level. Efficiency is achieved by &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; a set of transactions and settling later. Layer 3 amplifies this model, allowing even greater cost efficiency while maintaining the speed of the Layer 2 network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Layer 3 holds the potential to offer such low costs, that projects built even on Layer 2 networks won&rsquo;t have to deploy their own Layer 1&rsquo;s to lower the settlement fees. These applications, such as Axie and dYdX Decentralized Exchange had to do this, simply because their model depended on the fastest transaction times and lowest fees. If deployed on a Layer 3 rollup, it could prevent the need for yet another blockchain.</p>
<p>Layer1: Multi-chain bridges</p>
<p>Opside supports a faster and cheaper decentralized Liquidity-Bridge to achieve asset interoperability in more chains. Liquidity-Bridge consists of permissionless nodes that reach consensus on cross-chain messages through MPC. The liquidity pool brings faster speed and supports more public chains and their on-chain assets.</p>
<p>Further, Opside will establish connections with various public chains of the asset layer through the trustless ZK-Bridge. Compared with other bridge schemes, the ZK-Rollup scheme involves more ZK-proof systems. In the cross-chain operation, it is necessary to generate ZK Proofs to ensure the correctness of the execution process in addition to a general &ldquo;execution.&rdquo; The deposit and withdrawal operations of ZK-Bridge are &ldquo;solidified&rdquo; as a circuit, and the circuit logic is completely exposed.</p>
<p>Layer2: A Rollup-friendly chain</p>
<p>The Opside chain, or Layer 2, is an EVM-compatible and rollup-friendly chain. The Opside chain will do some deep optimizations for rollups.</p>
<p>Native rollup is somewhat similar to the architecture of Polkadot. Once a rollup registers a slot, the rollup becomes a native rollup. In contrast, the Polkadot architecture has the disadvantage that the consensus of the parachain depends on the assigned set of validators. There is a correlation between security and the number of validators. If a few validators went offline, the parachains whose validator groups are too small to validate a block will skip those blocks, or even stop until the situation is resolved. Opside does not have this problem because layer 2 collects data from all native rollups in layer 3 and verifies all zk proofs. Opside Chain is more secure and decentralized with all rollups on it as a tighter whole, sharing the same consensus layer.</p>
<p>There are 64 pre-deployed contracts as &ldquo;rollup slots,&rdquo; which will be called directly by batch &amp; proof transactions from rollups. These slots will call a precompiled contract for proof verification and update local state roots if successful. The precompiled contract can accelerate the verification of zero-knowledge proofs with optimizations in binary codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Layer 2 and layer 3 of the Opside architecture share a consensus mechanism with a hybrid of PoS and PoW.</p>
<ul>
<li>PoS: On layer 2, anyone can become a validator by staking, then have the opportunity to produce blocks of the Opside Chain. PoS is provable and validators periodically submit PoS proof to layer 1. Validators can get the block reward and staking reward for this part of PoS.</li>
<li>PoW: The validators of layer 2 will not only produce Opside Chain blocks, but also generate zk proof for each native rollup of layer 3 according to the rules of PoVP. Validators will get the IDE reward for successful generating zk proof, which is somewhat similar to PoW. Validators can get an extra bonus for that part of the reward by staking more tokens in the system contract.</li>
</ul>
<p>More importantly, in Opside, after completing the registration of slots, native rollups share a world state tree with each other and the same global message queue. Therefore, native cross-rollup interoperability is possible in Opside. Imagine you want to lend USDC to a loan contract in Rollup A and then go to DEX in Rollup B to trade to buy BTC. On Opside, you no longer need to withdraw assets from Rollup A to L1 and then recharge them from L1 to Rollup B. Instead, you can call the contract method of Rollup B directly in Rollup A. This will make the whole process much faster, cheaper and safer.</p>
<p>Layer3: Decentralized ZK-Rollups</p>
<p>In the third layer, Opside supports developers to deploy their own rollups, while Opside also provides a decentralized rollup solution based on RaaS mentioned above. Developers can freely choose which one to adopt. This solution is trustless and permissionless. Anyone can submit L2 batches and proofs to L1.</p>
<p>To summarize, the "base layer &lt;- opside &lt;- rollup" architecture of Opside has the advantage of asset variety and infinite scalability. It could be another choice to solve the scalability problems of web3 applications. Compared to expensive rollup-based layer 2s, it is more suitable for high-throughput applications like games.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Voyager Digital, the bankrupt crypto lender, has received initial court approval for the proposed sale of its assets to Binance.US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nod comes amidst an ongoing national security probe regarding the deal between the crypto lender and Binance.US.&nbsp;</p>
Initial Approval Given&nbsp;
<p>Embattled crypto lender Voyager Digital was given initial approval for its proposal to sell its assets to Binance.US in a deal worth $1.02 billion. US District Judge Michael Wiles of the bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York approved disclosure statements that explained different aspects of the proposed plan to sell the assets on Tuesday afternoon. The judge allowed Voyager to enter the asset purchase agreement. However, the sale also requires approval from all Voyager creditors and will also be subject to another hearing, to be held in March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voyager had initially agreed to sell its assets to Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX. However, the dramatic collapse of FTX saw the bidding process reopened, with Voyager agreeing to a deal with Binance.US in December.&nbsp;</p>
Cooperating With Authorities&nbsp;
<p>Voyager has been looking to expedite a review of the proposal to sell its assets to Binance.US, which could lead to the deal being delayed or blocked. Joshua Sussberg, Voyager&rsquo;s attorney, noted during the court hearing that Voyager has been responding to all queries arising from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and will look to address any concerns that the body may have with the transaction. Sussberg stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are coordinating with Binance and their attorneys to not only deal with that inquiry but to voluntarily submit an application to move this process along.&rdquo;</p>

National Security Concerns?&nbsp;
<p>The CFIUS is an inter-agency body in charge of reviewing foreign investment and acquisitions of US-based companies, vetting them for any potential national security concerns. Suppose, according to the body, concerns around a transaction are justified. In that case, the body can block the transaction or tell the parties involved in the transaction to alter the parameters of the deal accordingly. CIFUS had, on the 30th of December, filed a court notice referring to the Voyager, indicating that one or more transactions by the company could be subject to a review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US Attorney&rsquo;s office is also probing Binance over allegations of money laundering. However, CEO Changpeng Zhao has stressed that Binance.US is a completely independent entity, with its headquarters in California. Zhao is a Chinese-born Canadian citizen, and CIFUS has the authority to review any transactions that could see a US business come under the control of a foreign entity.&nbsp;</p>
Creditors Back Transaction&nbsp;
<p>The Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, a body that represents creditors that have no security interest in Voyager, has come out in support of the transaction in its current form. The body noted that the deal would help in greater recoveries for creditors instead of Voyager liquidating its holdings itself. However, this remains an option if CIFUS blocks the transaction with Binance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not want to delay getting money getting crypto back into our customers&rsquo; hands. Importantly ... we also took a very hard look at a standalone self-liquidation ... the self-liquidation auction is not an option that is going to put the most money in our customers&rsquo; pockets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Voyager has rebuffed previous objections to the proposal from a host of entities, including Alameda Research, The Securities and Exchange Commission, four US States, and the US Trustee. Voyager has repeatedly stated that the transaction with Binance.US is in the best interest of its creditors, and any objection to the deal fails to &ldquo;put forward any factual or legal support&rdquo; for its arguments.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United Kingdom has made it clear that it remains dedicated to becoming a world leader in the cryptocurrency industry, and that stablecoins would receive immediate attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economic Secretary Andrew Griffith of the HM Treasury told a meeting of the UK Parliament Treasury Committee on January 10th that the sector is one "I have dedicated the most time to."</p>
<p>In order to further solidify this position, the introduction of a wholesale stablecoin and the Financial Markets Infrastructure (FMI) sandbox will be the next steps in the process. These elements are included in the Financial Services and Markets (FSM) bill, which had its second reading in the House of Lords, also on January 10th.</p>
<p>In an article in CoinTelegraph, it was reported that Griffith defended the work being done on the wholesale stablecoin, stating that stablecoins are already "here now" and therefore in need of immediate attention. He also noted that it is uncertain whether a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would displace private stablecoins on the market if one were to be introduced.</p>
<p>A retail British CBDC, if one were to be introduced, would be an anonymized and intermediated platform by design, Griffith said.</p>
<p>In addition, a consultative paper on CBDCs will be released "in weeks, not months," followed by another on crypto regulation more broadly. The government also plans to hold at least six roundtables with the crypto sector this year.</p>
<p>While Griffith stated that it is "not the government's position that this [crypto-based technology] is an inevitability," he acknowledged that current technology cannot solve issues in the financial sector such as settlement time "in a disruptive way" as blockchain technology can.</p>
<p>The FSM bill, which may be passed by Easter, will also enable the licensing of new payment apps in the FMI sandbox and their introduction onto the market. The use cases for crypto-based wholesale fintech may be in ledgers and registers "in the middle office" for now, Griffith said.</p>
<p>Despite the UK's push to become a crypto hub, full regulation of crypto asset markets will not be achieved in 2023, assured Griffith. Legislation will adhere to the principle of "same asset, same regulation."</p>
<p>In the meantime, oversight of crypto promotions is playing an important role in consumer protection. Consumers can look for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) logo on promotions to ensure they are dealing with a regulated organisation. Treasury Deputy Director of Payments and Fintech Laura Mountford told the committee.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only about 40% of consumers "understand or consider that they are buying crypto assets as a gamble," according to FCA monitoring, this highlights the importance of consumer protection and education.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is making it clear that it's serious about becoming a crypto hub and is moving forward with several initiatives to help make that happen. The introduction of a wholesale stablecoin, the FMI sandbox, and the FSM bill are all steps in the right direction, but there's still a long way to go before full regulation of crypto markets is achieved.</p>

Treasury Deputy Director of Payments and Fintech Laura Mountford told the committee.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only about 40% of consumers "understand or consider that they are buying crypto assets as a gamble," according to FCA monitoring, this highlights the importance of consumer protection and education.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is making it clear that it's serious about becoming a crypto hub and is moving forward with several initiatives to help make that happen. The introduction of a wholesale stablecoin, the FMI sandbox, and the FSM bill are all steps in the right direction, but there's still a long way to go before full regulation of crypto markets is achieved.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Thai SEC is reported to be probing Zipmex over alleged violations of rules.</p>
<p>Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly investigating the crypto exchange Zipmex on the grounds of a potential breach of rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exchange, which recently announced a buyout by the Singapore-based firm Stack, is being probed by the regulator for alleged violations related to its operations and business practices.</p>
<p>According to the Bangkok Post, the investigation is aimed at determining whether Zipmex had violated any securities laws and regulations during its operations in the country. The regulator is also looking into whether the exchange had misled investors about its business practices.</p>
<p>A letter seen by Bloomberg News was written by the SEC and sent to Akalarp Yimwilai, CEO of Zipmex, stating that some of the company&rsquo;s activities could have breached digital asset regulations.</p>
<p>The move by the Thai SEC comes amid growing scrutiny of the crypto industry by regulators globally. Zipmex's buyout by Stack is also currently under investigation, as there's still not much information provided about the details and terms of the deal.</p>
<p>The investigation could have serious implications for Zipmex, as the regulator has the power to impose penalties and fines if any violations are found. The exchange has not yet commented on the matter, and it remains unclear how the probe will affect the buyout.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto.com has announced that it will no longer facilitate transactions that feature USDT as it looks to comply with the latest regulations issued by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move to delist USDT comes after Canadian authorities outlined their commitment to more robust oversight of exchanges following the collapse of FTX.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto.com To Delist USDT&nbsp;
<p>One of the world&rsquo;s biggest exchanges by trading volume, Crypto.com, has announced that it would be delisting Tether&rsquo;s USDT stablecoin for users in Canada. The move means the exchange will no longer facilitate transactions using USDT in Canada and its associated regions. Crypto.com stated that it made the decision to comply with instructions from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) as part of its pre-registration undertaking of a restricted dealer license.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto.com has delisted USDT for users in Canada in accordance with instructions from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) as part of our pre-registration undertaking for a restricted dealer license.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exchange also told its customers that if they failed to withdraw or convert their USDT by the deadline, their USDT stablecoins would be converted to USDC. Canadian users of Crypto.com were notified of the new policy via email, even as images of the notice began circulating on Twitter and Reddit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may incur a retrieval fee if deposits of USDT are made from external wallets after this suspension period, and fund retrieval may not be possible in some cases.&rdquo;</p>

Complying With The OSC&nbsp;
<p>Crypto.com announced back in October that the Ontario Securities Commission had accepted its pre-registration undertaking to operate in Canada. However, to comply with regulatory requirements, exchanges operating in the province of Ontario cannot deal with assets banned by the regulatory authority. This list also includes USDT. Coinsquare, an exchange regulated by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), presently does not list USDT as one of its assets.&nbsp;</p>
Increasing Scrutiny&nbsp;
<p>Crypto.com&rsquo;s move comes as regulators worldwide have increased scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges following the unraveling of FTX and amidst growing competition among top stablecoins. Canada&rsquo;s top securities regulatory body, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), issued a statement last month, stating it would be strengthening its oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges by expanding the existing requirements for platforms operating in the country. In a press release, the CSA stated that it is actively monitoring and assessing the role of stablecoins in Canadian markets. The CSA is comprised of regulators from ten provinces and three territories.&nbsp;</p>
Tether&rsquo;s Controversial Collateralization&nbsp;
<p>According to Tether&rsquo;s website, the assets backing the USDT stablecoin are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, such as treasury bills. However, Tether has come under fire due to the contents and quality of reserves backing the USDT stablecoin. In a ruling by a US district judge for the Southern District of New York, Katherine Polk Failla, the company was ordered to produce financial documents related to the backing of the USDT stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order was passed thanks to a lawsuit filed by several crypto traders against Tether, alleging that the company had propped up the price of Bitcoin through trades consisting of unbacked Tether tokens. Tether has also fought against allegations that its reserves are primarily comprised of commercial paper from Chinese and Asian companies, calling them baseless and false. However, just months later, the company announced that it had eliminated all its commercial paper holdings and replaced them with US Treasury Bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, Bitfinex, an exchange owned by Tether&rsquo;s parent company, and Tether were ordered to shut down in New York and pay a fine of $18.5 million for making false and misleading statements related to Tether&rsquo;s backing. Letitia James, New York Attorney General, stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system. Tether&rsquo;s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by US dollars at all times was a lie.&rdquo;</p>
