            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawyers of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) цлаимед that three men drove their vehicle into a metal barricade outside his parents&#8217; house in California. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The family of FTX&#8217;s former CEO recently admitted becoming a target of &#8220;intense media scrutiny, harassment,&#8221; and even physical threats.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Security Incident</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The gigantic crash of </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> caused multi-billion investor losses and turned SBF into one of the most infamous figures in the cryptocurrency space. The US authorities </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-closer-look-at-what-sam-bankman-fried-is-accused-of-exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">accused</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the 30-year-old of being the main culprit behind the collapse, committing several crimes such as money laundering and fraud.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Somewhat expectedly, the wave of criticism spread across affected investors, many of whom also blamed him for the event.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His attorneys recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/car-drove-into-barricade-outside-bankman-frieds-home-lawyers-say-2023-01-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that three individuals crashed their car into the barricade of his current home and told a security officer:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to keep us out.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Then they got back in the vehicle and drove away without being recognized. The man guarding the home in Palo Alto could not record the car&#8217;s license plate.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The incident happened nearly a month after a New York federal judge </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-a-250m-bail-can-stay-at-parents-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allowed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> SBF to live at his parents&#8217; house on a record $250 million bond. Prior to that, he spent a week in the Bahamian Fox Hill Prison, while the trial on October 2, 2023, will rule whether he played a role in the FTX demise and determine his final sentence. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawyers </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bankman-frieds-parents-have-been-physically-threatened-his-lawyers-say-2023-01-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">disclosed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> earlier this month that his mother &#8211; Barbara Fried &#8211; and father &#8211; Joseph Bankman &#8211; have received &#8220;a steady stream of threatening correspondence, including communications expressing a desire that they suffer physical harm.&#8221; </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Who Allowed the Bond?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The $250 million bond that enabled SBF to await his trial at his parents&#8217; house sparked significant controversy in the crypto community. As such, leading media outlets, including Bloomberg, CNBC, The Financial Times, The Washington Post, and others, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/major-media-want-know-who-guaranteed-sam-bankman-frieds-250-million-bond-2023-01-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">urged</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the judge overseeing the case to reveal the names of the people who allowed it.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SBF&#8217;s lawyers declined to provide details on the request, explaining there was a high chance those sureties suffer similar harassment like Ms. Fried and Mr. Bankman should their profiles become publicly known: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Given the notoriety of this case and the extraordinary media attention it is receiving, it is reasonable to assume that the non-parent sureties will face significant privacy and safety concerns if their identities are disclosed.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prosecutors have not yet taken any steps to honor the appeal of the media outlets. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Genesis – a top crypto lending unit that filed for bankruptcy on Thursday – was listed as FTX’s top unsecured creditor within the exchange’s own bankruptcy documents.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The firm has an unliquidated claim against FTX worth $226 million. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Per FTX’s Thursday </span><a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the defunct exchange has ten customers to whom it owes over $100 million each. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">While an earlier version of the filing already showed claims from FTX’s top 50 creditors, the revised version has revealed the names of those appointed by the U.S. Trustee in the case to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. One of those appointed was Genesis – FTX’s top creditor. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the few other names that are no longer redacted include the Hong Kong-based crypto trading firm Pulsar Global, individual creditor Larry Qian, and crypto market maker </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-market-maker-wintermute-hackers-drain-160m-profanity-bug-suspected/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wintermute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

			            <description><![CDATA[The fraudsters are pretending to add liquidity to the FTX exchange while aiming to drain users' balances.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Scammers have created a fake FTX token, dubbed FTX 2.0, to impersonate the now-bankrupt crypto exchange less than 24 hours after the company&#8217;s new CEO announced that the platform could be revived.</p>
<p class="p2">According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the bad actors sent the tokens to the FTX exchange, pretending to add liquidity before airdropping them to other crypto exchanges. The aim is to lure users into clicking fraudulent links that drain or burn their account balances.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Fake FTX 2.0 Token</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The security firm <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1616390330105974785" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">noted</a> that the smart contract of FTX 2.0 has back door functions that allow the fraudsters to manipulate the users&#8217; account balances.</p>
<p class="p2">The bad actors have airdropped the fake tokens to the Tron network and crypto exchanges KuCoin and Binance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Scammers are sending FTX 2.0 to FTX exchange, pretending to be the FTX exchange to add liquidity, and then airdropping to @justinsuntron, Kucoin, and Binance. They are tricking people into thinking it is the official FTX airdrop. Be alert!,&#8221; PeckShield wrote.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p3"><b>John Ray: FTX Could Be Revived </b></h2>
<p class="p2">The scam airdrop move comes as FTX is still deep in bankruptcy proceedings. Recall that the exchange and its affiliated entities <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-and-alameda-file-for-bankruptcy-sbf-resigns-as-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">filed</span></a> for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2022 after suffering from a severe liquidity crunch.</p>
<p class="p2">Yesterday, FTX&#8217;s new CEO, John Ray, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/john-ray-says-reviving-ftx-is-on-the-table-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">told</span></a> The Wall Street Journal that FTX could be revived. He noted that &#8220;everything is on the table&#8221; and that if a path forward was discovered, his team would not just explore but follow it. As such, the scammers are trying to prey on users&#8217; sentiments as hope for a new FTX has sprung up.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Not The First</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Scammers are always looking for opportunities to exploit users in the crypto space, especially through fake airdrops and impersonation.</p>
<p class="p2">Last year, fraudsters pretending to be the developers of the DeFi protocol PancakeSwap <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/scam-alert-fraudsters-impersonate-pancakeswap-and-offer-aidrops-of-400-cake/" data-wpel-link="internal">sent</a> emails to crypto traders, offering airdrops worth more than $12,000, intending to lure unsuspecting users into clicking phishing links that would drain their wallet balances.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin is continuing its weekly rally with a push beyond $22,000, bringing the crypto market back to a market cap of over $1 trillion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pump has triggered another avalanche of liquidations across digital asset exchanges.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin traded for roughly $21,380 at 19:45 UST on Friday, before pumping by $1000 to $22,370 by 21:00. The pump has only continued since then, with the top asset going for $22,615 at writing time. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Ether has pumped from  $1590 to $1651 within that time frame. The last time either asset traded at these levels was prior to Ethereum’s </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-merge-turns-into-sell-the-news-event-as-eth-price-plummets-20-since/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">merge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and FTX’s collapse respectively, both of which sparked massive crypto market downturns when they arrived. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">According to </span><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinglass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the price pump has contributed to $250 million in crypto liquidations in the past 24 hours, including over 52,000 traders. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The largest liquidation happened over Bitmex on an XBTUSD trade for $3.15 million. Overall, OKX is the leading exchange by liquidation count. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin has been rallying since last week after the BLS published optimistic inflation data, signaling to markets that the Fed may be prepared to stop hiking interest rates. Former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes, however, </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-to-expect-after-bitcoins-latest-bounce-arthur-hayes/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">believes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a pivot is unlikely to happen so soon. </span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The exec said that he will review the financial data before making a decision.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Input Output Global, the firm behind the Cardano blockchain, is interested in purchasing the crypto news website CoinDesk.</p>
<p>The latter is exploring a potential sale as its sister firm slid into bankruptcy. CoinDesk&#8217;s Kevin Worth recently asserted that the publication was receiving &#8220;numerous inbound indications of interest.&#8221;</p>
<h2>On Potential CoinDesk Acquisition and Journalistic Integrity</h2>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVQuGQIAxoI" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">livestream</a>, Hoskinson said his media interest is broad and would like to &#8220;figure out how to get to journalistic integrity again.&#8221; The exec highlighted the need to find a way for a strong media outlet. He even suggested ways to have a financial incentive to be truthful instead of pushing specific agendas.</p>
<p>The IOHK supremo previously <a href="https://twitter.com/iohk_charles/status/1538645464144396288" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">criticized</a> the mainstream media for directing negativity toward the Cardano ecosystem. With the potential acquisition of the media arm of the struggling Digital Currency Group, Hoskinson seeks to restore journalistic integrity in terms of reporting on the crypto and blockchain industry.</p>
<p>Turning various news pieces into NFTs, thereby making it possible for the readers to interact with them, was another point made by Hoskinson.</p>
<p>The exec is yet to check CoinDesk&#8217;s books or financials, but he believes that the asking price of $200 million is a &#8220;bit overpriced.&#8221; DCG acquired the media company for roughly $500,000 in 2016.</p>
<h2>CoinDesk Exploring Options</h2>
<p>The publication reportedly hired advisors at Lazard as it explored ways to move away from Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group.</p>
<p>Launched in 2013, CoinDesk was the first to break the story about potential balance sheet improprieties at Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Alameda Research. It ultimately triggered a downward spiral at FTX, leading to the collapse of the crypto exchange and the subsequent arrest of Bankman-Fried, as well as multiple regulatory probes.</p>
<p>The contagion hit home when its sister company, Genesis, suspended withdrawals on its lending side because its derivatives business had $175 million exposure to FTX. Also, a DCG subsidiary, Genesis, had already suffered losses of several hundred million dollars due to its exposure to fallen crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).</p>
<p>After struggling to raise funds, Genesis became the latest casualty of the crypto meltdown, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dcgs-subsidiary-genesis-global-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">filing</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 19th.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Mayor Suarez thinks a lot of the panic surrounding FTX and crypto is “media driven.”]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miami’s Bitcoin-bullish Mayor, Francis Suarez, remains faithful to the asset after the collapse of one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges shook confidence in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mayor suggested that Bitcoin can still provide numerous benefits not offered by the fiat currency system. </span></p>
<h2>Could Bitcoin Replace the Dollar?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1616413912265629698" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with CNBC on Friday, Suarez was asked if he believed regulators were to blame for allowing the FTX catastrophe to develop and eventually explode. Certain industry leaders, such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/why-coinbase-wont-end-up-like-ftx-brian-armstrong/" data-wpel-link="internal">blamed</a> a lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. for driving the industry to unregulated markets overseas.</p>
<p>Suarez, however, chose not to point fingers. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When people lose money, and things don’t go the way that they expect, everyone wants to blame someone,” the mayor said. “We live in a capitalist country, where people risk capital. Sometimes it works out for them, sometimes it doesn’t.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Part of Suarez’s enthusiasm around Bitcoin from a belief in its potential to spread free market principles across the world. In December 2021, he </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/miamis-mayor-bitcoin-has-the-ability-to-peacefully-eradicate-communism/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bitcoin could “eradicate communism on the planet, liberate people and democratize their choices,” thanks to its immunity to monetary debasement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some have even cited this quality when theorizing about how Bitcoin could </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-will-replace-the-us-dollar-believes-jack-dorsey/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">replace the dollar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> – something Suarez’s interviewer called a “ridiculous notion.” Although Suarez hesitated to back that claim, he acknowledged Bitcoin for having advantages over the fiat currency system. Those include the blockchain’s ability to create “efficient transactions,” and aid in </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/strike-brings-lightning-based-remittance-payments-to-africa/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">cross-border remittances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suarez also pointed to the growing momentum in favor of digitizing the dollar through stablecoins – cryptocurrencies backed 1:1 with hard currency. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A lot of this is media driven,” said Suarez regarding recent panic around crypto and FTX. “Maybe in 6 months, bitcoin is at 30,000, or 40,000. Are you going to have me back on and say &#8216;Mr. Mayor, you&#8217;re super smart?&#8217;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>Miami’s Bitcoin Initiatives</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suarez found himself in competition with New York City mayor Eric Adams in 2021 to prove which politician was most devoted to Bitcoin. After Suarez promised to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/miamis-mayor-to-become-the-first-us-politician-to-take-his-salary-in-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">receive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> his next paycheck in BTC, Adams </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mayor-of-new-york-will-accept-his-first-three-paychecks-in-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that he’d receive his following three paychecks in the top two cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suarez later topped the then-newly elected mayor, promising to accept his </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/miamis-mayor-continues-to-receive-his-salary-in-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">entire salary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Miami’s Bitcoin conference in April of last year, Suarez voiced plans to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/miami-mayor-wants-to-integrate-bitcoin-into-every-aspect-of-society/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">integrate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bitcoin into “every aspect of society.”</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BTC' holds steady at the $21K level despite an overbought RSI and another crypto bankruptcy. But where it heads next is up in the air. There are; however, some bullish indicators forming.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency rally this month was so robust that traders are looking out for the price bottom. Is the market there yet, or will bears take the prices back down to key optical support at $20K?</p>
<p>Here are four new bullish indicators for the BTC price.</p>
<h2>Solid MA Crossover in New Bitcoin Addresses</h2>
<p>On-chain intelligence and insights firm Glassnode has spotted a bullish technical signal in Bitcoin addresses. The 30-day simple moving average (SMA) has charted above the 200-day SMA since the beginning of November. That&#8217;s a leading bullish indicator for the price of the underlying asset.</p>
<p>The SMA crossover event persisted through <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-lesson-in-alameda-ftx-about-government-regulation-and-crypto-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">the Alameda-FTX scandals</a>. It continues now amid the <a>bankruptcy of Digital Currency Group subsidiary Genesis</a>.</p>
<p>That signals increased demand for BTC and could be a tailwind for the Bitcoin price if the trend continues.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Whale Addresses Are Hodling</h2>
<p>Bitcoin whale addresses are also holding their BTC instead of scooping profits, which is another bullish indicator of the asset&#8217;s price. According to data from Glassnode, the amount of BTC addresses with 1,000 to 10,000 Bitcoins has held steady, slightly above 1,900, since the beginning of December.</p>
<p>One Bitcoin whale address <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/01/30446167/anonymous-bitcoin-whale-just-moved-58m-worth-of-btc-off-binance" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">even just moved</a> $58M worth of BTC off Binance. That usually signals intent to lock down the holdings for an extended period, limiting the crypto exchange supply and supporting the Bitcoin price.</p>
<p>If whale addresses continue to hold, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-battles-for-21k-following-us-doj-news-volatility-incoming-btc-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin may not be as overbought</a> as it looks in the recent RSI reading of 78.</p>
<h2>Mining Difficulty and Hashrate at ATH</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s the last thing you might expect with the BTC price as low and uncertain as it has been for a year. <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">What it means</a> is the industry&#8217;s MVPs are investing more in the network&#8217;s underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>They do this at great risk to their business model if the Bitcoin price is imperiled by market conditions. For that reason, miners who have been in business consistently hashing for years are considered some of the most intelligent participants in the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Four-Year Cycles</h2>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Notice the BTC was on the way down <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-is-now-half-way-from-its-next-halving-as-hashrate-marked-ath/" data-wpel-link="internal">halfway through the previous halving events</a> that reduce the new bitcoin supply and instigate market bubbles. The graph and previous cycles in this tweet aren&#8217;t the only ones. There were two price bubbles before the most recent two in 2013 and 2009.</p>
<p>These market cycles are actually planned into the Bitcoin price with its four-year halving events to drive demand for the crypto with diminishing new supply at each halving.</p>
<p>Every bubble is followed by a correction because of the rush of over-investment in each upcycle. If these bullish indicators give the right impression, we may be through this most recent Bitcoin business cycle in 2023.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Ben Zhao, the founder of crypto exchange Bybit, took it to Twitter to address concerns raised over the company&#8217;s exposure to the now-bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global Capital.</p>
<p class="p2">According to court filings, Genesis owes its top 50 creditors $3.4 billion, including Bybit&#8217;s investment unit Mirana. The filing shows that the crypto lender owes Mirana approximately $151 million.</p>
<h2>Zhao: Bybit&#8217;s Earn Product Does Not Use Mirana</h2>
<p class="p2">In <span class="s1">response</span> to a tweet mentioning Mirana&#8217;s exposure to Genesis, Zhao stated that the reported $151 million has around $120 million of collateralized positions, which Mirana had already liquidated.</p>
<p class="p2">He added that the investment firm only manages a portion of Bybit&#8217;s assets. Zhao also stated that client funds are separated, and Bybit&#8217;s earn product does not use Mirana.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Full disclosure:<br />
1. Mirana is the investment arm of bybit.<br />
2. Mirana only manage some bybit company asset. Client fund is separated snd bybit earn product doesn’t use mirana.<br />

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Crypto Community Reacts</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The tweet by the Bybit founder sparked several reactions on Crypto Twitter, with some users questioning the timing of the clarification given that Genesis&#8217; financial troubles were repeatedly reported before it eventually filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="p2">One Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/AlotLose/status/1616363674482114563?t=LkdmvJyrqvzL3aTG3avrxw&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">requested</span></a> that Bybit provide the full details of their products, including how they are being managed, where they are generated, and the third parties responsible for generating yield.</p>
<p class="p2">Another user <a href="https://twitter.com/AlvinAlvinX1/status/1616375077230055425?t=ua9sC5UszEFJgm-6qYIwcg&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">stated</span></a> that the tweet reminded him of Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, saying that the financial status of the former SBF-led empire was healthy before they filed for bankruptcy in November.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Genesis Files for Bankruptcy</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Genesis <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dcgs-subsidiary-genesis-global-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">filed</span></a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on January 19 after facing a severe liquidity crunch, which stemmed from extreme market conditions and exposure to several bankrupt firms, including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/john-ray-says-reviving-ftx-is-on-the-table-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">FTX</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2">According to court filings, the crypto lender has over 100,000 creditors, between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and liabilities worth the same amount.</p>
<p class="p2">Some of its largest creditors include crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/troubled-crypto-firm-genesis-owes-geminis-customers-900-million-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">Gemini</span></a>, Moonalpha Financial (Babel Finance), Coincident Capital International Ltd, Donut Inc, Altcoinomy SA, and VanEck New Finance Income Fund LP.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s price has been on the rise over the last couple of weeks following Bitcoin&#8217;s rally. However, there are still significant resistance levels that should be claimed before a bullish shift in the market structure takes shape.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>XRP/USDT Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily USDT chart, the price has been rallying following a rebound from the critical $0.3 level earlier in the month. Ripple is currently trapped between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, located around $0.37 and $0.39, respectively.</p>
<p>In case the 200-day moving average gets broken to the upside, the significant $0.43 level would be the next obstacle that should be taken out before the market structure could be considered bullish in the short term.</p>
<p>The RSI indicator should also be monitored closely as it is reaching the overbought zone and could form a potential bearish divergence signal in the coming days.</p>
<figure id="attachment_234198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234198" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-234198 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_2001231" width="2560" height="1465" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-768x440.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-2048x1172.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRPUSDT-Daily-Jan-20-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-234198" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>XRP/BTC Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>The market structure seems almost utterly opposite on the BTC paired chart, as the price has been falling rapidly lately, with Bitcoin outperforming XRP.</p>
<p>However, the decline has seemingly halted, as the 0.000018 SAT support level holds the price. Yet, considering the potential bearish crossover between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, with the former trending lower around the 0.000021 SAT level, the 0.000018 SAT support may be broken to the downside. This structure could drive Ripple&#8217;s price towards the lower boundary of the large bearish flag, and the critical 0.000015 SAT support zone.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price surge has seemingly halted after rallying over the past couple of weeks. With multiple key resistance levels broken, the market seems likely to enter a bullish phase. However, some warning signals are emerging.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By:<strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has broken past the $1300 resistance level, and the 200-day moving average is around the $1400 mark. Yet, bullish momentum has been fading recently, making a bearish pullback probable.</p>
<p>The RSI indicator, which has been showing an overbought signal for a while, is now decreasing. This decline indicates a potential pullback or even a reversal. In this case, the 200-day moving average and the $1300 level should be considered support levels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the $1800 level is the next significant resistance zone and target for a further rally in the daily timeframe.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the lack of bullish momentum can be seen more clearly. The price&#8217;s microstructure has seemingly turned bearish, but the $1650 resistance area has not been reached yet, and the cryptocurrency could still climb higher to test it.</p>
<p>The RSI indicator also flashes a significant warning signal, with a visible bearish divergence forming between the last few highs. While a bullish continuation toward the $1650 level still seems likely, a bearish pullback could be expected in the short term, either before testing the $1650 level or after.</p>

<h2>Onchain Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></p>
<p>The following chart demonstrates the Estimated Leverage Ratio metric alongside Ethereum&#8217;s price. The metric measures the exchange&#8217;s open interest divided by their coins reserve, indicating how much leverage participants use on average.</p>
<p>Higher values indicate more investors are taking high leverage risk in the derivatives market. Due to the recent significant uptrend in Ethereum&#8217;s price, the metric experienced a sudden drop indicating a considerable amount of short positions were liquidated.</p>
<p>This provides an excellent chance for the bulls to bring back the demand to the futures market by taking long positions and initiating a rally toward higher price levels.</p>
