<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler confirmed to institutional investors in 2018 that BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH are not securities.</em></li>



<li><em>The comments come at a time when the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a bull market and more than two years before Gensler was appointed SEC chair.</em></li>



<li><em>Cryptocurrency lawyers said that this statement by Gary Gensler was only at the time, so it did not affect the current legal actions of the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Forbes, a new video shows <a href="https://news.coincu.com/193985-sec-satoshi-nakamoto-to-court-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler</a>, Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), telling institutional investors in 2018 that BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH are not  securities and 75% of the overall crypto market at the time was outside that legal category.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-934.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-934-1024x576.png" alt="Gary Gensler Certified &quot;BTC, ETH, LTC And BCH Are Not Securities&quot; In 2018: Forbes" class="wp-image-194558" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-934-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-934-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-934-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-934-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-934-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-934.png 1153w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Gary Gensler Certified &quot;BTC, ETH, LTC And BCH Are Not Securities&quot; In 2018: Forbes 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The comments come at a time when the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a bull market and more than two years before Gensler was appointed SEC chair. The video, from a crypto-themed institutional investor event hosted by Bloomberg and Fidelity in 2018, shows Gensler expressing a view that seems to contradict his recent statements that he currently believes that Bitcoin All cryptocurrencies other than cryptocurrencies are securities.</p>



<p>The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any potential conflicts between Gensler&#8217;s 2018 comments and the agency&#8217;s current legal position.</p>



<p>Prior to that, other videos from Gensler&#8217;s time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) also appeared, showing him saying that Ethereum is not a security. The video is arguably more important as it shows the current SEC chairman providing guidance to hedge funds and other investors on the regulatory state of the crypto market.</p>



<p>The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any potential conflicts between Gensler&#8217;s 2018 comments and the agency&#8217;s current legal position.</p>

<p>However, these comments may anger the crypto industry and many crypto owners, who argue that Gensler did not provide guidance on the legality of specific tokens before embarked on what many describe as a &#8220;strategy of law enforcement.&#8221;</p>



<p>This could be a sensitive time for the SEC chairman as he is under fire from crypto fans due to strong legal actions against the two largest service providers in the market. are Binance and Coinbase. In addition, a pair of Republicans in the House of Representatives presented legislation to<a href="https://news.coincu.com/194473-house-republicans-to-fire-sec-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> remove</a> the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Republicans object to Gensler’s &#8220;long series of abuses that have been permitted under the current SEC structure.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC has put forward a proposal to modify the definition of exchanges, which would encompass platforms trading in both crypto asset securities and certain DeFi platforms. </em></li>



<li><em>In April, the SEC declared its intention to reopen the exchange&#8217;s definition comment period, following its decision to broaden the scope to include crypto and DeFi.</em></li>



<li><em>The agency has not received any favorable comments during the comment period. </em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The SEC polled on an offer to make bigger the definition of an alternate to DeFi companies in April however has now no longer obtained a positive reaction. The remark duration will quit on June 13.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-1024x682.jpg" alt="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal" class="wp-image-194561" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-750x500.jpg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The SEC first proposed an accelerated definition of what qualifies as an alternate again in January 2022. It claimed at the time that this changed into decorating transparency and oversight over Alternative Trading Systems (ATS). The SEC described ATS as entities that exchange Treasuries and different authorities&#8217; securities below the regulatory umbrella.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The reopening release reiterated the applicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto asset securities, including so-called ‘DeFi’ systems, and provides supplemental information and economic analysis for systems that would be included in the new, proposed exchange definition,” the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-77" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in a press launch.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The upshot of this technological reality is that holding DeFi protocols to the requirements of the regulatory regimes governing national securities exchanges and ATSs would result in their de facto expatriation from the United States. DeFi is rapidly gaining trading market share in crypto assets, especially after recent and high-profile fraud and compliance issues at leading centralized and intermediated non-U.S. crypto asset exchanges,” according to the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) <a href="https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaction letter</a>.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="982" height="220" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935.png" alt="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal" class="wp-image-194562" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935.png 982w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935-300x67.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935-768x172.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935-750x168.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" title="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>DEF said that the SEC’s thought fails to perceive opportunity regulatory techniques and does now no longer provide a complete, cogent, or defensible qualitative or quantitative cost-advantage evaluation. The agency has now no longer accurately considered DeFi’s function within the broader crypto marketplace.</p>



<p>On behalf of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, Tavonia Evans stated that not all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) involve the trading of cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. Some DEXs primarily focus on the trading of cryptocurrencies, which may include stablecoins. However, the proposed rule lacks clear guidelines on how it would apply to DEXs that do not facilitate crypto-to-fiat transactions. Therefore, she urged the SEC to provide explicit guidance on this issue to ensure that such DEXs can operate within the regulatory framework.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936.png" alt="image 936" class="wp-image-194563" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>Paradigm also <a href="https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized</a> the SEC&#8217;s proposal, arguing that the Commission would be presenting a &#8220;Hobson&#8217;s choice&#8221; similar to what it did with Coinbase if it proceeds to regulate DEXs. Additionally, Paradigm deemed the SEC&#8217;s approach to the proposal as &#8220;haphazard.&#8221;</p>



<p>The SEC representatives have contended that the suggested explanation would encompass multiple cryptocurrency enterprises.</p>



<p>SEC chair Gary Gensler stated that several digital currency trading platforms are already considered to be exchanges based on the current definition and must adhere to the regulations governing securities. It is essential that individuals investing in the digital currency market are afforded the same established protections offered by securities laws in other markets, according to him.</p>

<p>Polygon Labs has recently announced its vision to build the Value Layer of the internet through the proposed set of upgrades, Polygon 2.0. With the aim to democratize access to the global economy, Polygon 2.0 will enable decentralized finance, digital ownership, and new mechanisms for coordination. The upgrades are set to reimagine almost every aspect of Polygon, ranging from protocol architecture to tokenomics to governance.</p>

<p>The Polygon team plans to detail each component of Polygon 2.0 over the coming weeks through a series of informative blog posts, community meets, and AMAs with the founders and engineers. Polygon 2.0 will become the Value Layer of the internet, offering unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through ZK technology. The network will consist of ZK-powered L2 chains unified via a novel cross-chain coordination protocol, making the entire network feel like using a single chain. Furthermore, cross-chain interactions can happen safely and instantly without additional security or trust assumptions.</p>



<p>Polygon 2.0 aims to expand Ethereum to become what it was always intended to be, a Value Layer that looks and acts like the rest of the internet. This will be achieved by supporting a practically unlimited number of chains while maintaining unified liquidity. Individual blockchains are not infinitely scalable, and adding capacity by creating new chains fragments liquidity and reduces security and capital efficiency.</p>

<p>The team at Polygon Labs plans to delve into topics like the future of the Polygon PoS chain, the utility and evolution of the Polygon token, and the transition to greater community governance of the protocol and treasury over the coming weeks. This will provide the Polygon community with a clear roadmap for how Polygon will become the Value Layer of the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Novatti Group Ltd has added XRP Ledger support for its Australian dollar-backed stablecoin AUDD.</em></li>



<li><em>The stablecoin is intended to be used in applications such as remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and stablecoin-as-a-service.</em></li>



<li><em>Novatti has also recently taken part in a study effort aiming at investigating the applications and advantages of CBDC in Australia.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to an <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/the-next-evolution-in-global-payments-novatti-brings-stablecoins-to-the-australian-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, Novatti Group Ltd, an Australian payments fintech, has extended its Australian dollar-backed stablecoin AUDD to XRP Ledger.</strong></h5>

<p>The AUDD, which was originally published on the Stellar blockchain in November 2022, will be accessible for a direct 1:1 exchange of fiat Australian Dollars through the XRPL. Transactions on the XRPL are both quick (3-5 seconds per transaction) and cheap (fractions of a penny per transaction), making it perfect for the scalability of stablecoins and asset tokenization.</p>



<p>Users may now use AUDD to make payments and trade with other XRPL-based tokens as a result of the extension. Because of the AUDD&#8217;s capabilities on the XRPL, people all over the globe may use it to make payments and trade with other XRP-based tokens through the native decentralized exchange (DEX). According to the company, users will be able to access AUDD using any XRPL-enabled wallet.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Novatti is excited to continue the journey in bringing our stablecoin roadmap to life with the goal to provide faster, more secure payments with lower friction costs to consumers. By deploying AUDD on the XRP Ledger, we will be able to capture the growing demand for digital currencies and create new revenue streams for our business, while delivering on our promise to make our solution available to multiple networks,” Peter Cook, CEO of Novatti Group said in the statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Novatti is incorporating AUDD into its current payment suite. According to the company, the stablecoin is intended to fulfill use cases such as remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and stablecoin-as-a-service.</p>



<p>This latest deployment cements Novatti&#8217;s success in employing the XRPL&#8217;s native digital currency, XRP, for cross-border transactions.</p>

<p>Novatti used Ripple&#8217;s payments solution, which uses XRP as a bridge currency between two fiat currencies, for cross-border remittances between Australia and the Philippines in April 2021.</p>



<p>Novatti&#8217;s involvement in the RBA and Digital Finance CRC&#8217;s CBDC project, which investigates the use cases for a central bank digital currency in Australia, has contributed to the rising momentum of stablecoin adoption.</p>

<p>Novatti has been able to extend its company into 58 countries and handle billions of dollars in yearly transaction value after using <a href="https://news.coincu.com/137073-ripple-gives-fund-to-support-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>&#8216;s payments technology. AUDD is also being incorporated into Novatti&#8217;s current suite of payment products, where it will be used for remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and Stablecoin-as-a-Service.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/etoro-ending-us-customers-access-to-four-cryptocurrencies/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cryptoslate.com/etoro-ending-us-customers-access-to-four-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlate</a>, stock, and crypto trading platform eToro revealed that it would restrict access to specific cryptocurrencies for users in the United States. Effective from 6:00 a.m. ET on July 12, 2023, users in the U.S. will no longer be able to open new positions in Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Dash (DASH), and Polygon (MATIC), according to a report by CryptoSlate.</p>



<p>eToro clarified that while U.S. customers would be prohibited from initiating new positions in these assets, they would still be allowed to hold and sell any existing positions. This change in policy is solely applicable to U.S. users, with non-U.S. customers remaining unaffected by the decision.</p>



<p>The trading platform attributed its action to evolving regulatory conditions, stating that it had taken this step due to &#8220;recent developments&#8221; in the regulatory landscape. Although the email did not explicitly specify the regulatory concerns, the four affected cryptocurrencies were named in lawsuits filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Coinbase and Binance, starting on June 5.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that eToro, primarily recognized as a trading platform, facilitates the closure of open cryptocurrency positions and allows users to withdraw their balances in either cash or cryptocurrency. This differs from most traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, which focus on direct trading of digital assets.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>FTX&#8217;s creditors&#8217; committee said the Court refused to rescind the automatic asset freeze orders of Bahamas liquidators.</em></li>



<li><em>In its ruling, the Court emphasized that the most important considerations were to maximize capital recovery and return funds to creditors and customers.</em></li>



<li><em>The bankruptcy court also launched a joint motion by the debtor and creditor committee to seal customer data.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX&#8217;s official committee of unsecured creditors tweeted that from June 8 to 9, the bankruptcy court held hearings on two issues in the FTX bankruptcy case: proceedings in the Bahamas and petitions to preserve customer information.</strong></h5>

<p>On June 9, Delaware Judge John Dorsey dismissed the Bahamas Joint Temporary Liquidation Organization (JPL) petition to lift the automatic freeze order. Judge Delaware added that his primary concern is maximizing the value of recovery for FTX&#8217;s creditors and customers worldwide. Bahamian liquidators have received 46 million claims alone, and having similar matters litigated before him and Sir Ian in the Bahamas would inevitably involve increased costs, &#8220;confusion&#8221; and delays with all costs ultimately paid by Cryptocurrency exchange customers crashed.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On Friday, June 9, the Court denied the Bahamian joint provisional liquidators’ (JPLs) motion to lift the automatic stay to raise certain contested issues before the Bahamian court.</p>&mdash; Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of FTX (@FTX_Committee) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTX_Committee/status/1668381133795467264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For Bahamian liquidators concerned that freezing Chapter 11 would prevent them from performing their legal obligations before the Supreme Court. However, while the ruling appears to be a total loss for the Bahamian liquidation trio, Tribune Business understands they have been greatly encouraged and comforted by various aspects of Judge Dorsey&#8217;s ruling.</p>

<p>Judge Dorsey ruled that serious legal issues needed to be determined before the assets could be distributed and returned to FTX&#8217;s creditors. These include who are clients of FTX Trading and other entities controlled by Mr. Ray and who are clients of FTX Digital Markets in the Bahamas.</p>



<p>The Court also directs the parties to mediate on matters brought up by the joint liquidators. FTX Creditors Committee will participate in mediation and<a href="https://news.coincu.com/193586-ftx-protects-customer-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> protect </a>the interests of creditors and customers. The bankruptcy court also launched a joint motion by the debtor and creditor committee to seal customer data.</p>



<p>In the remaining bankruptcy cases, the names, email addresses, and physical addresses of the natural customers will be permanently deleted. This will protect customers from the risk of scams and other threats. Business customer names, email addresses, and addresses will be deleted within 90 days, possibly with extensions.</p>

<p>The crypto lender hopes to complete the work and tests needed to allow some customers to withdraw funds this summer.</p>



<p>In an email to customers on Monday, BlockFi said: &#8220;At that point, we will be able to begin allowing customers to withdraw digital assets held in non-preferred BlockFi wallet accounts potential funds. Any withdrawals must be made in batches, and eligible individuals will receive an email from the company. Users are advised to set up a third-party wallet for withdrawals.&#8221;</p>



<p>The company said that on June 9, the Supreme Court in Bermuda issued an order allowing the platform to reopen withdrawals for customers with BlockFi Wallet accounts. The platform has also updated the user interface to accurately reflect users&#8217; transactions and account balances as of the platform suspension date of November 10, 2022.</p>

<p>BlockFi has struggled to allow customers to return funds since halting customer withdrawals on November 10 and then filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two weeks later. The crypto lender was forced to suspend withdrawals last year following the collapse of the FTX exchange. It has about 100,000 creditors, assets, and liabilities in the tens of billions of dollars.</p>



<p>According to a BlockFi representative at the time, the company&#8217;s liquidity crisis was caused by loans related to Alameda, an investment fund with the same founder Sam Bankman-Fried as FTX. In addition, most of the platform&#8217;s assets were stuck on the floor when FTX declared bankruptcy, leaving users and partners unable to withdraw their money.</p>

<p>Binance.US, the global Binance exchange, and Changpeng Zhao are being sued by the SEC for securities violations. The suit filed on June 5 alleged &#8220;blatant disregard&#8221; for US securities laws, including mishandling customer funds and misleading regulators and investors. The agency then filed an emergency action application to freeze Binance.US&#8217;s assets to protect customer funds. Binance has disputed these allegations.</p>



<p>In response to the suit, Binance has hired four lawyers from Milbank LLP, including George Canellos, a former co-director of the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division. Canellos previously supervised approximately 1,300 attorneys at the SEC on investigations that included insider trading actions against Raj Rajaratnam and hedge fund managers associated with S.A.C. Capital. Three other attorneys from Milbank are also joining Binance.US&#8217;s defense team.</p>

<p>The former head of SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, John Reed Stark, highlighted the unique skill set of George Canellos, a lawyer hired by Binance.US for its legal defense against the SEC. Canellos has experience serving as both an SEC and DOJ prosecutor, making him a valuable asset to the team.</p>

<p>Binance.US has announced that its banking and payment partners have signaled an intent to pause support for its dollar channels on the platform as early as June 13. This means that it will not be able to process deposits and withdrawals in dollars on the US-focused platform, instead shifting to an all-crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The situation between Binance.US and the SEC is still developing, and it remains to be seen what the outcome of this legal battle will be. However, it is clear that Binance.US is taking this matter seriously and is working to mount a strong defense against the allegations.</p>

<p>The company argues that the move would cripple its business and hurt customers. &#8220;Operations would quickly grind to a halt” without the ability to pay employees, vendors, suppliers, professionals, or to maintain the trading platform, Binance.US attorneys said Monday in a court filing. &#8220;With a freeze of all corporate assets, banking partners would most likely cease to honor requests to transfer funds for any purpose, including customer redemptions.&#8221;</p>



<p>The SEC sought the asset freeze after suing Binance.US, Binance Holdings Ltd., and founder Changpeng Zhao last week, alleging &#8220;blatant disregard of US securities laws&#8221; and &#8220;years of violative conduct&#8221; that put customer funds at risk. Binance.US is also owned by Zhao.</p>

<p>According to the June 5 lawsuit, the violations included mishandling customer funds and misleading investors and regulators. The SEC filed an emergency action application for a temporary restraining order to freeze Binance.US’s assets in an attempt to protect customer funds, including through the repatriation of client investments held abroad. Binance has disputed the allegations.</p>



<p>The case is SEC v. Binance, 23-cv-01599, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington, DC).</p>



<p>The lawsuit has already had an impact on the exchange&#8217;s business, as one of its banking partners has informed Binance.US that it will no longer hold its assets starting on June 14, according to the filing. The same partner froze all activity on the company&#8217;s account until after the court rules on the SEC&#8217;s motion.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Litecoin along with other alts has been under pressure caused by the SEC recently.</em></li>



<li><em>With the much-anticipated halving in August, we will most likely see the $100 price zone.</em></li>



<li><em>LTC is currently still in the safe zone along with BTC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The price of Litecoin (LTC) has been under strong pressure in recent days as investors have focused on the latest SEC litigation against Coinbase and Binance.</strong></h5>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/189309-litecoin-achieves-impressive-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Litecoin</a> is a digital currency intended to facilitate immediate peer-to-peer value exchange at low prices. After Bitcoin, it was one of the first cryptocurrencies to be developed.</p>

<p>This decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, founded by Charlie Lee in 2011, has been a crypto industry stalwart, noted for its speedier block generation times and greater coin supply.</p>



<p>This possible price rise corresponds to the current pattern of greater activity in the Litecoin market. After a 64% price decrease in the first half of 2022, Litecoin has made a stunning rebound, kicking off 2023 strong. Because of its durability and potential for development, Litecoin is a cryptocurrency to keep an eye on in the coming months.</p>



<p>LTC is now trading at $76.4, down from its year-to-date high of $105.65. As of the time of writing, the total circulating supply of Litecoin was 73,130,439 LTC, and the market capitalization of LTC was $5,601,131,992.</p>

<p>While LTC began the month in the red, it quickly rebounded into the green by the end of the month.</p>



<p>Several crypto market observers have raised their price projections for the currency over the next few months, and June might be a month full of green for LTC.</p>



<p>Litecoin, like other cryptocurrencies, is experiencing a period of volatility as investors concentrate on the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit filed last week. According to the complaints, the businesses offered unregulated securities in the United States. The agency also filed a lawsuit against Binance&#8217;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao.</p>



<p>It is simply too early to tell what will happen next in these litigation. As we have seen in the current SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, the procedure may take years. The most probable consequence will be a settlement with the SEC by either Binance or Coinbase. Instead, the two businesses might lose the lawsuit, with serious consequences for the crypto sector.</p>

<p>Popular PoW coins, like as Bitcoin and Litecoin, will be secure since they are regarded as commodities. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate announcement on Wednesday will be the next major driver for the LTC price. Experts predict the bank will keep interest rates steady at 5% to 5.25%.</p>



<p>Litecoin has lately piqued the interest of investors as it prepares for a halving event in August. Historically, incidents that reduced the return for mining Litecoin by half have resulted in huge price gains. Some experts are even anticipating a parabolic increase for Litecoin this summer, which might result in a price explosion.</p>



<p>Also, as the LTC halving approaches, LTC is expected to trade above $100 more regularly. For the following two months, it might average more than $100.</p>
