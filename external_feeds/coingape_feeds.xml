While investors await for buying Ethereum from the bottom levels, crypto analysts believe $1,170 would be a good price to buy for the long term.</p>
<h2>Buy Ethereum Before You Miss the Bus</h2>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) price is currently trading above $1,200 and looks positive. Since November, the ETH price is bouncing off the $1,170 level, trying to rally over $1.3K. The most important thing to note here is that the ETH price is in upward momentum since November and holds above $1,200 mostly.</p>
<p>Crypto analyst <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1605480995590836224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael van de Poppe asserts</a> the markets are in a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a> for 19 months already. Especially, altcoins have been crashing since May 21 despite the Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) cycle. He predicts that a first higher-low on higher time frames will be an indication of a relief run.</p>

<p>Michael van de Poppe also <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1605305790557958145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes</a> that $1,190 would be a good level for longs on Ethereum. For confirmation, await for the Ethereum price to drop to near the $1,170 support level and rebound over $1,200 again. However, despite the positive signs from the markets, indices as well as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) show weakness.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;Still, pretty much waiting for a scenario like this on </span><span class="r-18u37iz">ETH</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">, in which we most likely retest before continue. Positive signs coming from the markets past few days, but no continuation as indices are showing weakness (while <span class="r-18u37iz">DXY</span> shows the same).&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>According to Michael van de Poppe, the ETH price can rally above $1,280 by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggests that investors can buy Ethereum near $1,170 for the long term. Bitcoin price holding above $17,150 will be key for confirmation of an upcoming rally.</p>

<h2>Month-End Scenario For Ethereum (ETH) Price</h2>
<p>Ethereum price currently trades at $1,216, up nearly 1% in the last 24 hours. Also, the 24-hour low and high are $1,206 and $1,224, respectively.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-crypto-on-chain-analysts-dismiss-santa-claus-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expectations of a Santa Claus rally</a> are less this time, Ethereum price may rally to $1,280 near Christmas or near the New Year 2023.</p>

However, the crypto community is hoping for a relief rally to provide respite in the ongoing bear market environment. Popular cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE), which rose in exponential growth in 2021, lost all the value in the last one year. The memecoin did have an encouraging sign with Elon Musk taking over as Twitter chief.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin DOGE Price Prediction 2023</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> made a lot of progress in 2022 to be considered a mainstream cryptocurrency but not a ‘meme’ token as the name suggests. In fact, DOGE, along with other cryptocurrencies, is all set to be rolled out as a payment option for Google Cloud users some time in 2023. However, it remains to be seen how far would the rise in adoption propels the token price. Technical indicators point to the possibility of a decent price rise for DOGE in the mid term.</p>
<p>Crypto analysts, however, believe that the $1 price target is not within reach in the coming future. But, if the memecoin does hold support for 25 weekly moving average, there is a possibility of DOGE reaching $0.65 in the next few years, as per prediction of Anbessa Twitter account. As of writing, DOGE price stands at $0.07342, down 0.92% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with the news of Elon Musk in the search for the new Twitter CEO, there could potentially be some price action for Dogecoin. In a latest clarification, Musk said he would still be leading the software and servers team even if he steps down. If Musk goes on to bring in a new CEO, it would be interesting to see how the new leadership plans to integrate crypto payments on the platform.</p>

The anticipation around <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-judge-grants-ripple-moneygrams-motion-partially-holds-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Ripple lawsuit</a> ruling has driven the crypto whales to go on a heavy XRP accumulation spree.</p>
<h2>XRP whales on aggressive accumulation</h2>
<p>As per the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1605308867297935360" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data provided by Santiment</a>, Crypto whales and sharks are aggressively accumulating XRP tokens in the month of December 2022. It highlighted that the whale addresses that hold 1 million to 10 million XRP have hit the all time high (ATH).</p>
<p>Data depicts that there were just 1440 such whale addresses on November 1, 2022. While these addresses numbers have increased to stand at 1,617.</p>
<p>The percentage of supply of XRP held by these whales was recorded to be 6.33% on November 1, 2022. However, data shows that the percentage of supply held has reached 7.23% which is a new ATH.</p>
<p>Coingape reported that the crypto whales moved more than 675 million XRP on Monday, September 19. While around 500 million XRP were transacted by the whales on the day when the court partly rejected the SEC’s motion in the XRP lawsuit. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read more XRP news here</strong></a></p>
<h2>Why whales are adding Ripple&#8217;s native token?</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-price-prediction-to-follow-ripple-to-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> is on a constant decline over the past weeks. Its price has dropped by 12% in the last 7 days. This price action has motivated whales to accumulate more XRPs.</p>
<p>However, crypto whales have managed to move 120 million XRP in the last 24 hours. WhaleAlert reported that a whale address bought $17.6 million worth of XRP from the Bitso crypto exchange. Meanwhile, whales have moved around 70 million XRP to crypto exchanges in order to dump them.</p>

<h2>ClassyCrypto Contributes Terra Classic (LUNC) Burn Effort</h2>
<p>Terra Classic influencer ClassyCrypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1605291349351321623" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on December 21 announced officially burning 100% of its LUNC validator commission. The burn included Classy&#8217;s Crypto Sphere validator commission of nearly 8 million LUNC tokens, <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">ad revenue from </span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNC</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> videos on YouTube, </span>and others.</p>
<p>ClassyCrypto said they have burned almost 13 million LUNC tokens after a 0.2% burn tax. He also shared the transaction details of sending LUNC to the burn address. It shows 12,787,487.63 LUNC tokens sent to the burn address, with 25,575 LUNC tokens as transaction fees.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;I also burnt all of the ad revenue our </span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNC</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> videos on YouTube have generated this month. Our LUNC focus is burning.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Other Terra Classic community members thanked ClassyCrypto for doing was he promised and contributing to the burn effort of the community.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, ClassyCrypto tweeted that Classy&#8217;s Crypto Sphere validator is moving to a 100% commission-burned model. It will be &#8220;moving toward a 100% non-profit, 100% for the community model.&#8221; He revealed the plan to burn billions of LUNC tokens in 2023.</p>
<p>The Terra Classic community has burned over 36.231 billion LUNC tokens until now. Most of the burn is contributed by crypto exchange Binance, with <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-burns-over-6-billion-terra-classic-lunc-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 20 billion LUNC tokens burned</a>. Also, the community has burned over 11 billion LUNC tokens through burn tax.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price Falls Amid Market-Wide Selloff</h2>
<p>LUNC price currently trades at $0.00013, down 3% in the last 24 hours. The LUNC price saw massive selling amid <a href="https://coingape.com/why-grayscale-may-be-next-after-ftx-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selloffs seen in the broader crypto market</a>. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001295 and $0.0001354, respectively.</p>

<p>The business tycoon has been charged with fraud, money laundering, presenting a fake financial picture of his organization, and using customers&#8217; money. He is facing extradition to the U.S.</p>
<h2>The companies reconsidering SBF grants</h2>
<p>ProPublica, a non-profit organization, on Tuesday, announced that they will be returning the 1.6 million USD that they got from SBF’s foundation, Building A Stronger Future. This money was supposed to be used for public health, biosecurity, and coronavirus. It was part of a 3-year grant of 5 million USD. The firm stated that it would find other ways for the fund. On the day, SBF stepped down as the head of FTX and filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Court, ProPublica suspended all its grants. However, it is still unclear where this money will go.</p>
<p>Vox Media was given 200,000 USD by SBF’s family foundation and the company has also decided to return all the money. The spokeswoman for Vox told that they have already spent 14,000 USD for issues like climate change, fighting global poverty, and other challenges of society, in the month of August, For Vox as well it remains unclear how they will find a new funding partner or return the spent money.</p>

<p>The news organization Intercept is reconsidering the grant of 500,000 USD that was given to them as a part of a 4 million USD grant. “At this time, we are still gathering the information we need to make a principled decision in accordance with our mission and values,” spokesman Rodrigo Brandao said on Tuesday. Earlier the company said that this has left a hole in their funding pocket.</p>
<p>The company Semafor accepted SBF’s grant in the month of May, this year with the hope that they would be able to carry independent journalism. However, they are reconsidering and waiting for the authorities to take a decision.</p>

<h2>When were these fundings made?</h2>
<p>The funding, investments, and generous gifts made by SBF to newsrooms were part of a larger pattern that included roughly $40 million in political donations this cycle. This was large to Democratic-aligned groups. Before fraud allegations were made public and FTX was largely regarded as one of the more responsible businesses in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

The virtual universe, also known as the metaverse, is a vast digital space that experts believe will eventually replace the internet. People can buy property in this world, make <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFT</a> exhibits, sell the digital content they create, or play games designed specifically for this virtual world while wearing VR glasses.</p>
<p>The popularity of the Metaverse is increasing, especially with the aid of numerous significant companies, such as Facebook. One of the most divisive investment topics in the future is expected to be <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/year-ender-top-metaverse-projects-to-invest-in-2023-heres-the-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaverse projects</a>.</p>
<h2>Top 3 Metaverse Trends To Watch In 2022</h2>
<h4>Augmented and Virtual Reality in Gaming</h4>
<p>Virtual gaming relies heavily on 3D technology, AR and VR assemblies, and sonic systems. These technologies have experienced exponential growth as this market has grown, increasing their value and market relevance. The market for AR and VR headsets increased by 60.8% in 2021. However, according to the International Data Corporation&#8217;s (IDC) Quarterly AR/VR Headset Tracker, the APAC region alone shipped 2.19 million units. The gaming industry undergoes new revolutions thanks to these technologies.</p>
<h4>Metaverse Events</h4>
<p>Fortnite concerts Online have drawn in 10.7M users. Live events and advertisements in the Metaverse could cost up to US$800 billion. In 2024, the global market for video game software and hardware could reach $400 billion, with the remaining opportunities coming from live entertainment and social media. Over 75,000 sales for a total of almost US$25 million have been made of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentraland</a> pieces of land, NFT tokens, and virtual land plots in the Decentraland Metaverse. Future concerts will be completely altered by this trend.</p>
<h4>The complexity of Metaverse Avatars</h4>
<p>Avatars are likely to become more advanced, according to metaverse trends. Avatars currently come in a wide variety of shapes. This includes photorealistic forms that almost exactly resemble people in the real world as well as 2D avatars.</p>
<p>The advanced, almost photorealistic avatars offered by Meta are well known. Over time, more and more of the company&#8217;s products will support these avatars. Microsoft, meanwhile, focuses on using AI technology to make avatars. However,  that blends in with a business setting thanks to responsive animation. It is simple to create avatars and export them into various metaverse implementations thanks to well-known apps like Zepeto and OSUVOX.</p>

Authorities have already implied a 30% tax on the capital gains earned from crypto trading in India. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/reserve-bank-of-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Central Bank</a> governor has issued a warning regarding the next financial crisis.</p>
<h2>RBI Chief warns of a financial crisis</h2>
<p>In the<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pDiWyN0IWQ&amp;ab_channel=ReserveBankofIndia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> BFSI insight Summit</a>, Shaktikanta Das, RBI Governor talked about the recent collapse and developments in the crypto industry.

Since Solana Foundation had close relationships with FTX and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sbf/">SBF</a>&#8216;s other companies, it took the fall for the crisis.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Solana prices slumped to a record low of $13 (on November 11), days after the news of the FTX liquidity crisis crippled the market. Since then, SOL has struggled to recover.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The price of Solana hit an all-time high of $260.06 during the bull run of 2021 (on Nov. 6). SOL prices have been declining ever since and are currently trading at $12.08.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132433" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21124626/SOLANA.jpg" alt="Solana" width="926" height="642" /></p>
<h4 style="color: #252525">SOL&#8217;s Future Prospects</h4>
<p style="color: #252525">According to several cryptocurrency analysts, it could be challenging for SOL to return to its all-time high ($260) because Solana&#8217;s fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $100 billion was never justified.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/solana/">cryptopredictions.com</a>, SOL can breach the $40 barrier by 2026.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Given that the value proposition offered by the Solana ecosystem remains more or less the same (despite market sentiments not being in favour of Solana, which is one of the main reasons behind its price crash), it is very likely that SOL will touch the $100 mark in the next bull run.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Since SOL is in a dip, if you can hold it for the long term, that is, until the next bull run hits and market sentiments are in favour of Solana, you can make decent money from this investment.</p>

<h4 style="color: #252525">How Much Money You Would Make if Solana (SOL) Reaches $100?</h4>
<p style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s say you invest a modest $100 in SOL tokens today. This will get you 8.28 SOL tokens at the current price of $12.08. In the event that SOL hits $100, your $100 investment will become worth $828, giving you an 8x  or 728% return on investment.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s assume that you buy $1000 worth of SOL tokens today. At the current rate, you will have approximately 82.78 tokens. Your $1000 investment will be worth $8278 if liquidated at the price of $100. If SOL hits the $100 mark in the next 3 years, you will get an annualised ROI of 102% on your investment.</p>
<p>It is important for anyone considering investing in Solana or any other cryptocurrency to carefully research the asset and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions.</p>

The original work is worth more than the postcard you purchased from the museum, much like the priceless nature of Matisse or Van Gogh, and the same logic applies to NFTs and their copyrights.</p>
<p>Influencers and celebrities aren&#8217;t far behind in the NFT race. The <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT collections</a> of well-known celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Eminem, Bella Hadid, etc. have been released for their fans. The way we think about ownership and digital marketing has changed as a result of NFTs. Unsurprisingly, the NFT industry has been growing faster than ever, and the non-fungible tokens craze hasn&#8217;t spared Indian celebrities.</p>
<h2><strong>Top 5 Bollywood celebrities who owned NFTs in 2022</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Amitabh Bachchan</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132411" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115021/Amitab-bachchan.jpg" alt="Amitab bachchan NFT" width="752" height="423" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renowned Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan joined the NFT movement in November 2021. In addition to autographed Sholay posters and other items related to the movie, he also launched Madhushala, his father&#8217;s celebrated poetry recital. Through an <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a>, the collection was auctioned off for Rs. 7.18 crores.</p>
<h3><strong>Salman Khan</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132412" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115116/Salman-khan.jpeg" alt="Salman Khan NFT" width="800" height="448" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wanted actor debuted his NFT line, which was inspired by his film Dabangg. A total of 200 NFTs, 42 of which were movie scenes, were part of the NFT series he started. Salman Khan announced his NFT series on Twitter on December 25, 2021, and the collection launched on December 30, 2021. Fans could use <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">ETH</a> or MATIC tokens to purchase NFTs.</p>
<h3><strong>Rajnikant</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132413" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115200/Rajnikant.jpg" alt="Rajnikant NFT" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Thalaiva of the south Indian film industry, Rajinikanth, is also involved with NFTs. He launched his collection in July 2021 in collaboration with the Singapore-based non-fungible token marketplace Diginoor.io. However, his 2007 film Sivaji: The Boss was featured in his non-fungible token collection. On Diginoor.io, customers could use a debit card or a cryptocurrency of their choice to buy their favorite movie moments.</p>
<h3><strong>Sunny Leone</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132415" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115244/Sunny-Leone.jpg" alt="Sunny Leone NFT" width="1200" height="900" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunny Leone debuts her own non-fungible token collection, Misfitz, making her the first Indian actress to do so. Unusual patterns, boisterous characters, and an eclectic atmosphere characterized the collection. However, in November 2021, the collection, which contained about 9600 non-fungible tokens, quickly ran out of stock.</p>
<h3><strong>Manish Malhotra</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132256" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20132601/jpg_20221220_132346_0000.jpg" alt="Manish Malhotra NFT" width="1200" height="800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manish Malhotra, a famous fashion designer in India, is the first in his profession to enter this market. He unveiled five exclusive sketches and runway GIFs of his clothing in October 2021. However, Lisa Ray, Deepika Padukone, Kareena Kapoor Khan, and Alia Bhatt wore.</p>
<p>However, when the auction went live on the WazirX, it was completely sold out. The Illuminous Showstopper, a famously worn outfit by Kareena Kapoor Khan, generated the highest payment of 3,000 WRX, or roughly USD $4,000. (almost Rs 2.8 lakh).</p>

FIL tokens are used as payment for these services as well as a financial incentive to guarantee that files are consistently stored over time.</p>
<p>As a<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/"> proof-of-work</a> token, FIL allows the Filecoin community to mine and receive additional coins as payment. Additionally, FIL can be used on the Filecoin network, where users can pay miners to store or retrieve their data. In the event that there are no or insufficient proofs, the token may also be used as collateral.</p>
<h3><b>Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis</b></h3>
<p>Filecoin’s price today is $2.93, with a market capitalization of $1B and a 24-hour trading volume down by 4.62%. Now it stands at $127 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 344,966,605 FIL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132396" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21105612/FIL_1D_graph_coinmarketcap1.jpg" alt="Source: coinmarketcap" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Despite the negative market trends, the technical analysis of the Filecoin price shows a significant surge fueled by FIL growth. The Filecoin (FIL) price has increased significantly in comparison to counterparts such as Stellar and <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<h2><b>How Much Money Would You Make If FIL Reaches $10?</b></h2>
<p>According to <strong><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/filecoin/" rel="nofollow">Cryptopredictions.com</a></strong>, FIL can go as high as $10.9 by December 2025. Let’s assume that you invest a modest $100 in Filecoin today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132397" style="width: 1491px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-132397" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21105732/Screenshot-2022-12-21-at-10-17-09-Filecoin-FIL-Price-Prediction-2023-2024-2026.png" alt="Filecoin Prediction chart" width="1491" height="847" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132397" class="wp-caption-text">Filecoin Prediction chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to today’s price, which is $2.92, you will have approximately 34.26 FIL. If Filecoin’s price hits $10 in the next few years, your $100 will become approximately $342.6. Let’s say you bought $100 worth of FIL coins today. With the current rate, you will have approximately 34.26 coins. However, you can potentially make $342 when it reaches the $100 mark.</p>

It is one of the largest publicly listed crypto mining companies in the U.S. Core Scientific has decided to file for bankruptcy due to falling crypto prices and rising energy prices that deteriorated its finances.</p>
<p>Despite the $72 million in financing from its lender B. Riley last week to avoid bankruptcy, the crypto miner was unable to work efficiently and will work on restructuring, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/KenzieSigalos/status/1605420482005704705" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> CNBC. Core Scientific plans to keep mining until it restructures its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Core Scientific’s market cap dropped to $78 million on Tuesday, down from a $4.3 billion valuation in July 2021 when it went public. The CORZ stock price has fallen more than 98% in the last year. On Tuesday, the stock price ended at $0.21, up 3.07%.</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the company’s situation, the company is still generating positive cash flow. However, cash is insufficient to repay the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financing debt owed on mining equipment</a> it was leasing. Core Scientific will not liquidate and operate normally until reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, which hold the majority of the company’s debt.</p>
<h2>Crypto Twitter Reactions To Core Scientific Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Crypto influencers took to Twitter to report Core Scientific&#8217;s bankruptcy filing. Many crypto miners are facing financial constraints amid the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a>.</p>
<p>Crypto researcher Dylan Leclair reported that the firm owns approximately 5% of the global hash rate. He also shared the situation of listed crypto miners with many having stock prices down over 90% in 2022.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132410" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132410" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21114843/Crypto-Miners-Performance.jpg" alt="Crypto Miners Performance" width="710" height="378" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132410" class="wp-caption-text">Crypto Miners Performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>Crypto investor and board member at Iris Energy Mike Alfred said Core Scientific had told him that the company would have 13 EH by July of this year when he first looked at the company in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Many people showed concerns over the future of bitcoin mining as several crypto miners such as Argo Blockchain and Iris Energy are facing bankruptcy risks.</p>

<p>Core Scientific joins the list of other crypto miners who have succumbed to the crash in the crypto space and the soaring energy prices. A month ago, the Bitcoin miner had already hinted about <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme pain in its operations</a> and cash crunch owing to the market conditions.</p>
<p>Core Scientific was mining some proof-of-work digital assets such as Bitcoin. As we know, this requires high-end machinery and hardware while also consuming massive electricity in the process. Over the last year, the price of Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) stock has tanked by 99% losing more than $4 billion in valuations.</p>
<p>Last year in July 2021, the Bitcoin miner had gone for a public listing via a special purpose acquisition vehicle or SPAC. Although the company still generates a positive cash flow, it&#8217;s not enough to repay the financial debt on equipment, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-filing-for-bankruptcy-will-keep-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said sources</a> familiar with the matter.</p>
<h3>Core Scientific&#8217;s Further Action Plan</h3>
<p>The sources also added that core Scientific is not willing to liquidate, however, it would continue to operate normally while reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, who hold a majority of the company&#8217;s debt.</p>
<p>In their filing earlier in October, Core Scientific said that holders of their common stock might suffer a total loss on their investment. However, the Bitcoin miner&#8217;s deal with its convertible note holders is such that if the market conditions for Bitcoin improve, common equity holders might not get totally wiped out.</p>
<p>Core Scientific has operations currently in North Dakota, North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky. It is also one of the largest providers of blockchain infrastructure and hosting.</p>
<p>Core Scientific is not the only Bitcoin miner to face bankruptcy. Compute North, the hosting infrastructure for crypto mining also filed for bankruptcy in September.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has finally decided to drop his fight against extradition to the United States. As per the latest report from ABC News, SBF who&#8217;s currently in the Fox Hill jail of The Bahamas has agreed to his extradition to the US on multiple charges. Reports suggest that SBF has signed his <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/ftxs-sbf-signs-extradition-paper-will-fly-to-us-on-wednesday/" title="FTX&#8217;s SBF Signs Extradition Paper, Will Fly to US on Wednesday"></a></p>

As per the latest report from ABC News, SBF who&#8217;s currently in the Fox Hill jail of The Bahamas has agreed to his extradition to the US on multiple charges.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that SBF has signed his extradition paper and a hearing for the same will happen on Wednesday in Nassau. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-21/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-signs-extradition-papers/101796332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development</a> has been confirmed by Bahamas Acting Commissioner of Corrections Doan Cleare.</p>
<p>After signing his surrender documents on Tuesday, the Bahamas Commissioner said that SBF will sign a separate set of papers and finalize his waiver of rights to fight extradition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Federal authorities are looking to fly back SBF to the U.S. soon after Wednesday&#8217;s hearing. The Bloomberg <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sam-bankman-fried-to-fly-to-us-wednesday-escorted-by-fbi-agents-1.1861932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> notes that the disgraced FTX founder will be accompanied to the US by FBI agents in a non-commercial aircraft. Another source familiar with the matter said that the plane will leave from a private airport in The Bahamas.</p>
<h3>Not A Good Christmas for SBF</h3>
<p>Sam Bankman Fried has been facing severe charges over the misuse of customers&#8217; funds at FTX which led to a dramatic collapse of a $32 billion company. Some previous <a href="https://coingape.com/how-much-jail-time-sbf-is-looking-at-if-convicted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> suggest that SBF might face 115 years of prison which is equivalent to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>After getting earlier this month, the Bahamian court also denied bail to SBF last week. Since then, he&#8217;s been placed in one of the most notorious jail facilities of the island nation i.e. Fox Hill.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Bahamian authorities will escort Sam Bankman-Fried from the prison to the court. Although initially hesitant, SBF has agreed to the extradition to the U.S. This change in attitude might be partly due to the expectation that SBF could get bail in the US. So far, it isn&#8217;t clear where SBF is planning to land on Wednesday.</p>
