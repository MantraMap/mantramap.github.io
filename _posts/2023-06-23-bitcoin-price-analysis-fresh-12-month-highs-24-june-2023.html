<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retained positive upward momentum early in the Asian session as the pair worked to consolidate gains above the psychologically-important 30000 figure after escalating to the 31443.67 area, its strongest print since June 2022.&nbsp; The rapid appreciation to its strongest level in twelve months represented a test of the 31488.23 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp;</p>
