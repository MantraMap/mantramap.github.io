			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The IMF has published a blog post laying out its view on the perceived risks that crypto poses for the global financial system.</p>
<p>The IMF has warned time and time again of the dangers that the cryptocurrency sector poses for the legacy financial system. A recent blog post lays out its perception of how crypto collapses can spread contagion to banks and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>The blog post begins by stating that crypto &ldquo;has lost trillions in market value&rdquo;. At the height of the last crypto bull market the total market cap for crypto attained a value of $2.8 trillion. It is now at just over $1 trillion.</p>
<p>A new asset class is bound to see some volatility, especially given that the lack of regulation in the sector has allowed pump and dumps to thrive.</p>
<p>The IMF blog post also accused Bitcoin of losing money for three quarters of the investors who bought it. However, Bitcoin certainly isn&rsquo;t a digital asset for quick gains. It is an asset to be held over the long term, and retail investors would do well to be aware of this.</p>
<p>Had an investor held Bitcoin over the past few years then they would certainly have done a huge amount better than holding fiat currency in any bank or savings account.</p>
<p>Up until the last ten years in the traditional markets it was customary to see four-year boom and bust cycles, which is pretty much what has been seen in crypto in the last 14 years since its inception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, massive printing of fiat currency by central banks has propped traditional markets up, not allowing them to fall, and adding gargantuan piles of debt onto the shoulders of taxpayers who will one day have to bail the banks out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IMF authors highlight the banks&rsquo; exposure to crypto and welcome the Basel recommendations that are about to be voted on by the European Parliament. However, this particular amendment requires banks to hold reserves equal to more than 100% of any crypto-related exposure, and this may have the effect of them not wanting to engage with any digital asset companies.</p>
<p>If the crypto space was honest, it would admit that yes, there is a need for regulations to protect consumers, but only if these regulations are fair and are not designed to suppress crypto so that central banks can force citizens to continue holding fiat currencies that are losing their purchasing power at an ever-increasing rate.</p>
<p>It might be argued that for the next monetary system to survive, it will have to be completely decentralised, managed by code that cannot be tampered with, rather than humans who can manipulate things to their own advantage. The IMF is very likely to disagree.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Analysts suggest keeping an eye on Binance (BNB) and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN),</p>
<p>Both platforms are making a significant impact in the industry. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a revolutionary DeFi project that is revolutionizing the way crowdfunding and venture capital work, and the price of the native ORBN token has already skyrocketed 987% to $0.0435. Binance, on the other hand, is seen as the winner from FTX's recent crash, and analysts expect the platform's native Binance Coin (BNB) to rebound soon. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Binance (BNB) Set For A Massive Rebound</p>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and its global impact is vast. The gap between Binance Coin (BNB) and the second-largest exchange has grown since FTX went down. Binance Coin (BNB) also sells other things, such as the BNB Smart Chain and the Binance Coin (BNB).</p>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) started trading in 2017, and based on the volume of daily trades, it is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance (BNB) is a unique ecosystem of a decentralized system, and developers of cryptocurrencies are using new technology to ensure that users have precise access.</p>
<p>BNB Smart Chain is a decentralized EVM network that can be used as an alternative to Ethereum because it can scale better than Ethereum. Binance Coin (BNB) is Binance's most important product and the fourth-largest stablecoin.</p>
<p>Even though the market crashed, Binance was one of the biggest winners when FTX went down. Binance Coin (BNB) has a huge amount of control over both the spot and the derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Analysts think Binance Coin (BNB) will go up and down a lot this year, with many ups and downs. It has to deal with headwinds, which could get stronger this year. Even so, Binance Coin (BNB) has a strong position in the market, which lets it take advantage of its size and popularity.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Set To Change The Future Of Investing</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is transforming the crowdfunding and venture capital sectors. This is made feasible by equity-based NFTs that have been fractionalized to allow firms to obtain funds and investors to participate in these early-stage prospects.</p>
<p>Investing in potential businesses becomes more transparent and secure for investors. Allowing investors to invest in fractions of tokens also allows for smaller-scale investments, allowing anybody to participate.</p>
<p>Retail investors can invest in these NFTs via the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) for as little as $1. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) provides everyone access to the venture capital market by utilizing these equity-backed NFTs.</p>
<p>A "Fill or Kill" method is in place to safeguard both parties engaged in the fundraising process by returning investors' money if a financing round fails. "Fill or Kill" is used in the smart contracts that Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses and has been audited by Solid Proof.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has already risen to $0.0435, a gain of more than 987% from its starting value. According to analysts, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) might generate returns of up to 6000% and reach $0.24. </p>
<p>ORBN is the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem's native coin. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem will feature the Orbeon swap, exchange, wallet, and metaverse.</p>

<p>Binance Coin (BNB) started trading in 2017, and based on the volume of daily trades, it is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance (BNB) is a unique ecosystem of a decentralized system, and developers of cryptocurrencies are using new technology to ensure that users have precise access.</p>
<p>BNB Smart Chain is a decentralized EVM network that can be used as an alternative to Ethereum because it can scale better than Ethereum. Binance Coin (BNB) is Binance's most important product and the fourth-largest stablecoin.</p>
<p>Even though the market crashed, Binance was one of the biggest winners when FTX went down. Binance Coin (BNB) has a huge amount of control over both the spot and the derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Analysts think Binance Coin (BNB) will go up and down a lot this year, with many ups and downs. It has to deal with headwinds, which could get stronger this year. Even so, Binance Coin (BNB) has a strong position in the market, which lets it take advantage of its size and popularity.</p>

<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Set To Change The Future Of Investing</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is transforming the crowdfunding and venture capital sectors. This is made feasible by equity-based NFTs that have been fractionalized to allow firms to obtain funds and investors to participate in these early-stage prospects.</p>
<p>Investing in potential businesses becomes more transparent and secure for investors. Allowing investors to invest in fractions of tokens also allows for smaller-scale investments, allowing anybody to participate.</p>
<p>Retail investors can invest in these NFTs via the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) for as little as $1. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) provides everyone access to the venture capital market by utilizing these equity-backed NFTs.</p>
<p>A "Fill or Kill" method is in place to safeguard both parties engaged in the fundraising process by returning investors' money if a financing round fails. "Fill or Kill" is used in the smart contracts that Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses and has been audited by Solid Proof.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has already risen to $0.0435, a gain of more than 987% from its starting value. According to analysts, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) might generate returns of up to 6000% and reach $0.24. </p>
<p>ORBN is the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem's native coin. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem will feature the Orbeon swap, exchange, wallet, and metaverse.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The European Parliament will today vote on a draft law to oblige banks to hold enough reserves in order to cover all potential losses from their crypto clients.</p>
<p>In a move that could potentially cut the crypto sector adrift from banking and financing, the EU will vote on Tuesday on a draft law that would require banks to hold reserves that total more than 100% of any loss from crypto companies.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, one of the amendments up for the vote would require banks to set a risk-weighting of 1,250% to all capital that has exposure to crypto assets, which would mean that banks would be able to cover 100% of any potential losses.</p>
<p>The new law has been drafted in order to include the last elements of Basel III, which is a global agreement that requires banks to hold more capital so that they can deal with market shocks without having to put any reliance on taxpayers.</p>
Shadow banking
<p>The Reuters article also looks at how the amendments apply to the world&rsquo;s &lsquo;shadow banking&rsquo; sector. This is a term used for banking that typically goes on in a less regulated way, and applies to the &ldquo;insurers, hedge funds, and investment funds&rdquo; that are said to make up around half the world&rsquo;s banking sector.</p>
<p>An amendment would ask for a report from the European Commission which would look into the possibility of requiring banks to have a limited exposure to shadow banking.</p>
Opinion
<p>It might be argued that all laws and pronouncements coming out of Europe currently are designed to cut the arms and legs off of the crypto industry and severely curtail its ability to operate.</p>
<p>It could certainly be the case that some banks might have lost money by having exposure to this or that crypto company, but it could be argued that crypto has not had proper regulation for all the years of its existence, allowing some bad actors to operate in the space.</p>
<p>Attempting to cut the ground from under crypto projects in order to punish and suppress the industry isn&rsquo;t the best idea. The banking industry is in dire straits of its own making, and holding crypto up as a scapegoat isn&rsquo;t going to save it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto is a tiny asset class of around $1 trillion in value. The traditional finance industry holds hundreds of trillions in value, yet there aren&rsquo;t more than whispers out of Europe of the potential catastrophe of a wholescale financial collapse.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) is a relatively new industry that is disrupting how people earn rewards and how they interact with financial products. Token holders are given a derivative for their original token, which they can put to additional use, gaining rewards from two tokens instead of one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>unshETH.xyz is striving to take this industry a step further with a unified ERC-20 token (unshETH). All liquid staking derivative tokens on the Ethereum network can be swapped for this one token, increasing accessibility. Moreover, unshETH is taking a completely new approach to Liquid Staking Derivatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>unshETH is aiming to ensure decentralization of Ethereum validator nodes, y allowing users to delegate with whom their eth should be staked. The protocol will also be open source, so that any other LSD provider can copy their features. This will help to strengthen and improve the overall ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Decentralization of Ethereum Validator Nodes
<p>Ethereum runs on validator nodes. These nodes ensure that the industry is impervious to a 51% attack and that transactions are legitimate. To ensure the longevity and viability of the Ethereum ecosystem, it is important that Ethereum validators are decentralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, it costs nearly $50,000 (32 ETH) to run a validator node. This is not a flaw - the high price ensures that only those who are committed to the Ethereum ecosystem will invest for a long-time horizon. It also ensures that no single actor owns too many nodes, given the cost. The staked 32 ETH cannot be withdrawn, at least until the Shanghai Upgrade this March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But while the overall validator nodes on Ethereum are increasing in their decentralization via the overall numbers, this has not been the case for Liquid Staking Derivative validators. The unshETH team witnessed this firsthand, having developed some of the first LSD&rsquo;s themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this end, the core aim of unshETH is Ethereum validator node decentralization for liquid derivatives. One means they use to achieve this is that validator rewards decrease with the total amount staked. This should serve to greatly disincentivize centralization. The second is incentive engineering, whereby capital is distributed across the LSD ecosystem to promote decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
The Benefits of Liquid Staking Derivatives
<p>Liquid Staking provides multiple benefits for decentralized finance (DeFi) users. A derivative token is given to a user when the original token is staked. In this manner, the DeFi native gets staking rewards for the original token and can put the derivative token to a different use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use cases of liquid staking are innumerable. All traditional derivative products within the financial markets (such as futures and options) can be placed on a blockchain, with additional risk mitigation and transparency features. This would be done with a much smaller amount of red tape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all of these benefits can only come to fruition when the core network is sufficiently decentralized. unshETH provides a variety of mechanisms to restore decentralization for LSD nodes on Ethereum. It does this in an open source manner so that all other providers can assist with one of the most pressing issues of Web3 - node decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
Why unshETH is a Game Changer for Liquid Staking Derivatives
<p>unshETH allows liquid token holders to exchange their Liquid Staking Derivative assets (such as stETH or cbETH - built by Lido and Coinbase respectively) into one unified asset: unshETH. This is different from other providers that offer various derivatives for various tokens, resulting in a messy string of derivative pairs to keep track of. Moreover, they are focused on bringing back decentralization to the Ethereum LSD market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the other LSD providers are not focused on assisting in decentralization of validators. They are interested in taking a profit through fees. unshETH is Ethereum-specific and takes a more streamlined approach with its unified token. This will restore integrity to the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>unshETH aims to restore validator decentralization to the Liquid Staking Derivatives industry through incentive engineering, an idea that was strongly endorsed by Vitalik Buterin, the original Ethereum founder. This alone sets it apart from other providers. unshETH further allows liquid holders to consolidate a variety of derivatives into one functional and tradable unified token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users will be able to withdraw tokens after the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in March. This is when the full version of unshETH will be unlocked. The unshETH team will then roll out Validator Dominance Options, a brand new DeFi derivative designed to add another layer of enforcement of decentralization, by redistributing staking yield away from monopolistic LSD providers via a novel mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About unshETH</p>
<p>UnshETH is a decentralized initiative for disrupting the dominance of a single Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) on the Ethereum network by incentivizing the diversification of validator ownership through the use of incentive engineering. The core mission of unshETH is to ensure decentralization of Ethereum validator nodes, restoring original design principles. The protocol increases LSD market accessibility and helps users unlock the power of liquid staking derivatives in a fully decentralized manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency space is full of potential opportunities, and the market outlook for Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), Fantom (FTM), and Chainlink (LINK) looks especially promising. Today, we review these three coins and assess why they could be poised for a major rise in the near future.</p>
<p>With Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) nearing the end of the public presale, we may have to move quickly.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) could potentially revolutionize crowdfunding as we know it, with these four distinct features:</p>
<p>1) Blockchain-based - Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses the power of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain to provide safety and transparency.</p>
<p>2) Fractionalized NFTs - NFTs are useful for more than just collecting digital art. With fractional NFTs that represent ownership of a startup, investors can use just $1 to become part-owners of the project.</p>
<p>3) Smart contracts - Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses smart contracts to automate the whole crowdfunding process, eliminating a lot of paperwork and manual labor.</p>
<p>4) Utility token - As a decentralized project, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses a utility token to reward investors for their contributions. Holding ORBN grants passive income staking rewards, governance votes, first access to new startups, and more.</p>
<p>With such a game-changing approach to the $13.5B crowdfunding industry, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is one to watch out for. The current Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale represents an amazing opportunity to get in on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM)</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM) is an open-source, public blockchain platform designed to enable fast and secure transactions across the globe. Fantom (FTM) is built using a revolutionary consensus mechanism called Lachesis, which is designed to enable instant finality and scalability.</p>
<p>But the main difference between Fantom (FTM) and most other projects is the fact that Fantom (FTM) isn't a blockchain at all! Fantom (FTM) is actually a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which enables much faster transaction speeds and more secure transactions.</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM) is already being utilized by governments around the world, with the likes of Uzbekistan planning to use Fantom (FTM) as part of their digital transformation. This shows that Fantom (FTM) has strong fundamentals, making it a prime candidate for a major rise this year.</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK)</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) is making a name for itself as the go-to blockchain platform for decentralized finance (Defi). Chainlink (LINK) has been designed to be an intermediary between off-chain resources and Ethereum smart contracts, allowing developers to incorporate external data into their products via Chainlink (LINK).</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) sounds good in theory, and it also looks like the practice is measuring up &mdash; Chainlink (LINK) is already being used by some of the top Defi platforms including MakerDao, Aave, Compound, and others.</p>
<p>If that's not enough adoption for you, then the news of Accuweather and FedEx using Chainlink (LINK) should be convincing. Accuweather is using Chainlink (LINK) to provide live weather data feeds into their smart contracts, while FedEx is integrating Chainlink (LINK) to provide real-time shipment tracking.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Signature Bank, a partner of Binance, has advised that it will no longer support SWIFT transfers of under $100,000 for the exchange users.</p>
<p>Another day, another FUD story for Binance. This time, it is the news that Signature Bank will no longer provide SWIFT transfers of under $100,000 to the users of Binance.</p>
<p>In an article recently published on Decrypt, it was revealed that Binance had written the following in an email to Decrypt:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of our fiat banking partners, Signature Bank, has advised that it will no longer support any of its crypto exchange customers with buying and selling amounts of less than 100,000 USD as of February 1st, 2023. As a result, some individual users may not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to buy or sell crypto with/for USD for amounts less than 100,000 USD."</p>

<p>According to the article, only 0.01% of Binance users would be affected by the withdrawal of this service. Binance stated that it would be seeking a remedy to the situation.</p>
<p>Given that so few of Binance&rsquo;s users are using the SWIFT service, its withdrawal for smaller amounts wouldn&rsquo;t appear to have much impact on Binance at all.</p>
<p>However, Signature Bank seems to be the company that is most affected in this troubled climate for crypto. It was reported in an article in the Business Standard, that the bank was looking at reducing its risk in the cryptocurrency industry in the wake of the FTX collapse.</p>
<p>The bank was reported as saying back in December that it wanted to get as much as $10 billion in deposits from digital asset clients off of its books, as it begins to divest itself from services offered to the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The actions of Signature Bank come on the back of a warning put out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, advising banks of the risks posed by continuing to provide services to cryptocurrency-related clients.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Stellar has become the newest member of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s (CFTC) Global Market Advisory Committee (GMAC).&nbsp;</p>
First Blockchain On CFTC Committee
<p>The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), which is the issuer of the Stellar (XLM) coin and creator of the Stellar Aid Assist program, is one of the four crypto organizations to join the CFTC&rsquo;s Global Market Advisory Committee. The Stellar blockchain, which facilitates crypto-fiat transfers, will be the only blockchain represented by the foundation on the committee by its COO, Jason Chlipala.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chlipala recently announced the news via a company blog, in which he expressed that the goal was to bring the unique perspective of Layer 1 protocols to the GMAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our inclusion in the Committee marks another important moment for blockchain. It further acknowledges that the future of U.S. markets and our industry are connected. It also underscores the CFTC's commitment to building a diverse consortium representing more than just traditional finance players.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

The GMAC Committee
<p>The GMAC is a 36-member committee, which is being led by CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pharm and already includes major TradFi players like J.P. Morgan, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock. Also included are other crypto-focused organizations of CoinFund, Uniswap Labs, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. The representatives from all these institutions will present at the committee&rsquo;s yearly meeting on February 13, 2023, which Chlipala will be attending for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stellar network has been in the news recently for launching a $100 million fund to support smart contracts after preparing for it for at least a year in advance.&nbsp;</p>
Points Of Discussion
<p>The SDF will also address matters of remittances, the role of stablecoins in the digital asset markets, and their real-world use cases. Chlipala has expressed his appreciation for this opportunity for the blockchain industry to be able to participate in fintech and regulatory conversations. He believes that it is essential for the crypto industry&rsquo;s representatives to be in the same room as policymakers and regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At SDF, blockchain's future is not to supplant traditional finance but to build on top of and work with the system we've already created. This vision requires blockchain and traditional finance to work together and to ensure the systems are interoperable to work as seamlessly as possible. This body will serve as an excellent opportunity for conventional finance and blockchain to find the present and future prospects for integration to ensure the integrity and competitiveness of U.S. markets.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Internet City, Dubai, 23rd January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Kaia Wong, CMO of global crypto exchange LBank, has commented on remarks made by global leaders at Davos 2023 concerning the use of DAOs. At the World Economic Forum event, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and their regulation came under the spotlight.</p>
<p>The number of crypto businesses participating at Davos this year saw a drop due to last year&rsquo;s market slide. Nevertheless, the blockchain and crypto industry presence was still very much visible at the four-day event which started on January 16. Davos 2023 featured a number of panel discussions on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. One topic was DAOs and the opportunities they present for driving greater organizational efficiencies.</p>
<p>Finland&rsquo;s communications minister, Timo Harakka, said during a Davos panel that the EU should consider legally recognizing DAOs that govern web3 apps. Harakka expressed concerns over the current lack of regulation and potential problems if the EU does not think of regulation on a broader scale.</p>
<p>Responding to these comments, LBank CMO Kaia Wong said: &ldquo;DAOs are a new way to collaborate and communicate. Though not without their problems, they have the potential to promote a more egalitarian and transparent way of working and supporting treasury management. We&rsquo;ve already come a long way in terms of DAO adoption, but there&rsquo;s a need for greater regulatory clarity before DAOs can be more widely utilized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One clear consensus to emerge from Davos 2023 is that crypto needs greater regulation. The event saw active participation from government policy-makers and regulators, who came together to discuss the best way to regulate the evolving industry. The discussions addressing DAOs showed that more needs to be done to safeguard users, who face little legal protection in the event of a DAO being dissolved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At LBank, we believe in giving greater power to crypto users,&rdquo; said Kaia Wong. &ldquo;However, given the current landscape and the lack of a battle-tested DAO framework, there is the possibility that users could be taken advantage of. Regulation will be needed to protect users and their assets, especially when funds are pooled within a DAO.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The WEF released a DAO toolkit on January 17 with contributions from more than 100 industry experts. The document works as a guide for developers and policy-makers with the goal of helping them better understand, regulate, and govern DAOs.</p>
<p>A more condensed version of the toolkit was published in the form of an article on the same day, explaining many of the issues DAOs face and the need for oversight. &ldquo;Most seriously, DAOs operate within a fragmented and uneven landscape of law, policy, and regulation,&rdquo; the article stated. &ldquo;Collaboration across industry and government is crucial to realizing the potential, and mitigating the risks, of these systems.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade said that crypto will play a major role in its foreign trade transactions.</p>
Crypto outlook improving
<p>The economic environment for crypto seems to be improving, as the Federal Reserve appears to be committed to toning down its hawkish rate rises throughout 2023, with a pivot to come sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Even with what could be seen as some quite harsh regulation coming into play at some point in certain jurisdictions across the world, E.G. MiCA in Europe, many are starting to see how Bitcoin and crypto can play a part in economies.</p>
<p>For the foreign trade minister of the United Arab Emirates to come out and say that &ldquo;Crypto will play a major role for UAE trade going forward,&rdquo; is a pretty huge statement of intent, and one that will get many governments to focus even more keenly on the sector.</p>
<p>Thani Al-Zeyoudi, the UAE&rsquo;s minister of state for foreign trade, was being interviewed for Bloomberg Television while attending the Davos conference. The minister outlined how his country was trying to attract projects with its favourable outlook on crypto. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most important thing is that we ensure global governance when it comes to cryptocurrencies and crypto companies. We started attracting some of the companies to the country with the aim that we&rsquo;ll build together the right governance and legal system, which are needed.&rdquo;</p>

Global governance for crypto?
<p>Global governance for crypto might be a difficult feat to achieve, given that there are many differing views on just how to regulate the sector. For example, the US SEC has dithered for years over the question of whether most cryptocurrencies constitute securities. Failure to clear up conflicts on the subject and impose proper regulation, has allowed some bad actors to operate in the crypto sector.</p>
<p>Also, given that the US and Europe have very large and influential banking sectors, there is much internal pressure on lawmakers to over-regulate or even ban crypto. This is not likely to sit well with countries, perhaps like UAE, that have a more progressive approach.</p>
<p>Another of the UAE&rsquo;s ministers, Omar Sultan Al Olama, who is also attending the World Economic Forum at Davos, backed up the line of his ministerial colleague by affirming that his nation was &ldquo;committed&rdquo; to becoming a world cryptocurrency hub.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Amidst mutterings of the crypto market starting it&rsquo;s road to recovery in 2023, following one of the worst downturns in many years, some tokens have not only survived the storm, but have emerged triumphant and ready to take advantage of the space left bare of competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast emerging as one of the leading players in the blockchain space, Taboo has managed to create quite a name for itself and has built quite a community, boasting over forty-six thousand loyal investors currently behind the project. It has so far managed to get things right, and the market cap is a testament to this fact. While thousands of other projects perished and went bankrupt, Taboo went to work and ramped up its investment, knowing there would be an opportunity to rise from the ashes. Market volatility and the recent crash seemed to have little effect on the project, often referred to as the Playboy of Crypto.</p>
<p>And just as the recent rally took the TABOO brand to the top of the trending lists on platforms such as Coin Market Cap and Coin Gecko, the news of further marketing came.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only will the hugely successful billboard campaign take place once again, but the second Mansion Event is set to be bigger and better in 2023 with the Tier 4 holders and celebrity guests all queuing up for a place. Think Dozens of Supermodels, Luxury Villas, Super Yachts and Celebrity DJs and you&rsquo;ll start to realize just what Taboo has in store for any investors holding more than $10k of this hugely undervalued token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those unaware, Taboo is more than just a platform offering bold content. It&rsquo;s meant to empower content creators, provide them a platform to showcase their talent and earn a decent income in the process. The fiat currency part of the market is unsafe, is under strict observation of the authorities, has no laws protecting those employed in the industry, often leaving them at the mercy of the local administration, and does not offer a steady source of revenue. It is where Taboo emerges as a viable solution offering all the involved parties a safe and encouraging environment where they can explore their Taboo fantasies and heart&rsquo;s desires.</p>
<p>The start of all things Taboo</p>
<p>The project, having been launched back in 2021, has been the talk of the town ever since its inception. Anyone even reasonably acquainted with the blockchain space knows about Taboo and the potential held by it. The Adult Entertainment industry has a conservative estimate of $15 billion in annual revenue within the US alone, but it&rsquo;s never found a way into the crypto space until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A brief overview of the project</p>
<p>Taboo, unlike other projects, offers curated content from the finest creators in the industry. It aims to create scarcity in an oversaturated market. Not every supermodel or adult start can feature on the platform. Instead, they have to undergo a thorough screening process, and only after approval is received will they be featured. For the user part, Taboo has created a tier system consisting of 4 tiers. The higher the tier a user is subscribed to, the more content is accessible to them.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tier 1 - The first tier is free of cost and grants access to teasers from the higher tiers, as well as basic content added to Tier 1 by content creators. The transaction fee for this tier is 10%.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tier 2 - The first paid tier on Taboo, Tier 2, requires users to hold $1000 in their wallet or stake an equivalent amount on the platform. It grants access to NSFW content level, nudes, and strip teases, besides offering the option to video chat with content creators. Users on this tier get a 10% discount on purchases from the official store.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tier 3 - To access this tier, users need to hold or stake at least $5,000, which grants access to XXX areas of the platform. It includes video NFTs, explicit pictures, access to exclusive events, and a 3x chance at winning in Taboo giveaways.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tier 4 - The highest tier on Taboo, Tier 4, is where the real fun takes place. With $10,000 held in the wallet or staked, users get access to everything available on the three lower tiers, in addition to the possibility of meeting their favorite content creators at parties held by Taboo in their exclusive mansions. Users on Tier 4 are charged the lowest transaction fee, at 2.5%.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version 2 of the marketplace was launched last year offering a marketplace of delicious content as well as full staking functionality. Currently, depending on the lockup period, long term investors can see returns up to 20% APY on their stakes with interest calculated daily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taboo is currently in talks with several top exchanges and will list on many more throughout 2023, thus providing an additional boost to the Taboo token and the overall exposure of the project. Furthermore, Taboo plans to lend out ad space on the website and across the platform to other projects, which will ensure that Taboo generates substantial revenue as the project benefits from the increased traffic.</p>
<p>Every aspect of Taboo has been well planned and, in a way, ensures the long-term sustainability and viability of the project. For those who haven&rsquo;t yet, join Taboo and be a part of the revolution sweeping the world of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not official, but the green shoots of the beginning of a new crypto bull market are beginning to be seen.</p>
<p>The FUDish news has continued to rain down on the crypto sector. We aren&rsquo;t too long after the FTX implosion, and already another domino, in the shape of crypto lender Genesis, is toppling down.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of the bad news crypto is starting to motor. Bitcoin is currently in fifth gear, and is plunging headlong through resistance after resistance.</p>
<p>The king of the cryptocurrencies put on a spurt earlier this morning and attained a price of $23,300 before pulling back to currently sit at around $22,700. The bull flag it was in was broken to the upside, which was less likely considering that the flag was slanted upwards, instead of the more typical downwards slant.</p>
<p>$24,000 to $25,000 now beckons - a resistance area that is incredibly important, given that a consolidation above this could see Bitcoin magnetically pulled upwards to the next resistance at $30,000.</p>
<p>Such heights just couldn&rsquo;t have been envisaged only 3 or 4 weeks ago, as Bitcoin scraped along a local bottom and seemed as though it might take a further plunge down to the next $14,000 support.</p>
<p>It does make sense though, that when the entire world was screaming for Bitcoin and crypto to come crashing down and find new lows in a bear market that would just drag on for years, that the market would do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Many analysts point to the fairly rapid softening of inflation as a reason for the crypto market surge, and this might have something to do with it. However, the charts across the entire crypto market were looking extremely oversold, and it had got to the point where breakouts were only a short time away.</p>
<p>Retail investors sitting on the sidelines with any cash may well have piled in, in the hope of at least making something in a year that many have said will be recessionary.</p>
<p>Of course, Bitcoin really isn&rsquo;t about this. Those who are just after a quick buck just might get their fingers burned when the correction finally does come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for those who just wish to have a part of their portfolio outside of the fiat monetary system, and in something that has scarcity and is actual hard money, then Bitcoin is one of the only assets to be in for the longer haul.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Avraham Eisenberg with fraud and market manipulation. Eisenberg is also facing charges from the US Justice Department and the CFTC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eisenberg is responsible for the Mango Markets hack, stealing $116 million worth of crypto assets from the platform.&nbsp;</p>
Mango Markets Hacker Charged By SEC&nbsp;
<p>Avraham Eisenberg, the attacker behind the Mango Markets hack, was charged today by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC charged Eisenberg with offenses related to fraud and market manipulation connected with the hack, which took place in October 2022. Eisenberg, a United States citizen, was arrested in Puerto Rico in December and will be moved to New York to face the litany of civil and criminal charges against him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eisenberg is alleged to have manipulated the platform&rsquo;s market and token, resulting in the loss of approximately $116 million worth of crypto assets. Heisenberg boasted about the Mango Markets hack in a Twitter thread, describing the hack as a highly profitable trading strategy. As a result of the hack, Mango Markets was rendered insolvent as a result of the hack, which Eisenberg and a team of users executed. During an appearance on the Unchained Podcast, Eisenberg defended his actions, calling them legal market actions that utilized the protocol as designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week. I believe all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.&rdquo;</p>

Charges Brought Against Eisenberg&nbsp;
<p>Eisenberg has already been charged by the US Department of Justice and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). According to the SEC, Eisenberg has violated several federal securities laws provisions, including some anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation provisions. The SEC also stated that it viewed the Mango Markets governance token, the MNGO, as security, something a lot of people in the crypto ecosystem would dispute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC, under current chair Gary Gensler, has increased scrutiny on the crypto space and has often highlighted that it views all crypto assets as securities. The SEC&rsquo;s chief of crypto assets and cyber unit, David Hirsch, stated in a press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As our action shows, the SEC remains committed to rooting out market manipulation, regardless of the type of security involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other charges brought against Eisenberg by the SEC are similar to the ones brought in by the Department of Justice and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission. The DOJ has charged Eisenberg with market manipulation, including commodities fraud and manipulation. On the other hand, the CFTC has charged him with commodities fraud and manipulation, which also includes several violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The press release explained,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we allege, Eisenberg engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme to artificially inflate the price of the MNGO token, which was purchased and sold as a crypto asset security, in order to borrow and then withdraw nearly all available assets from Mango Markets.&rdquo;</p>

The Mango Markets Hack&nbsp;
<p>The Mango Markets hack took place in October, with Eisenberg targeting the native MNGO token and artificially inflating its price. He then took several loans, managing to drain the Mango Markets treasury for $110 million. He then tried to use the stolen MNGO governance tokens to manipulate the protocol&rsquo;s DAO to vote for his solution to return the tokens, following which the DAO offered Eisenberg a deal that let him keep $47 million worth of crypto assets as a bounty if he returned the rest of the assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that the Mango Markets hack was orchestrated from Puerto Rico, following which Eisenberg disappeared for some time before reappearing in the United States. Eisenberg had attempted to execute a similar attack on Aave in November. However, that attempt failed, with the hacker losing millions worth of crypto.&nbsp;</p>

Eisenberg, a United States citizen, was arrested in Puerto Rico in December and will be moved to New York to face the litany of civil and criminal charges against him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eisenberg is alleged to have manipulated the platform&rsquo;s market and token, resulting in the loss of approximately $116 million worth of crypto assets. Heisenberg boasted about the Mango Markets hack in a Twitter thread, describing the hack as a highly profitable trading strategy. As a result of the hack, Mango Markets was rendered insolvent as a result of the hack, which Eisenberg and a team of users executed. During an appearance on the Unchained Podcast, Eisenberg defended his actions, calling them legal market actions that utilized the protocol as designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week. I believe all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.&rdquo;</p>

Charges Brought Against Eisenberg&nbsp;
<p>Eisenberg has already been charged by the US Department of Justice and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). According to the SEC, Eisenberg has violated several federal securities laws provisions, including some anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation provisions. The SEC also stated that it viewed the Mango Markets governance token, the MNGO, as security, something a lot of people in the crypto ecosystem would dispute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC, under current chair Gary Gensler, has increased scrutiny on the crypto space and has often highlighted that it views all crypto assets as securities. The SEC&rsquo;s chief of crypto assets and cyber unit, David Hirsch, stated in a press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As our action shows, the SEC remains committed to rooting out market manipulation, regardless of the type of security involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other charges brought against Eisenberg by the SEC are similar to the ones brought in by the Department of Justice and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission. The DOJ has charged Eisenberg with market manipulation, including commodities fraud and manipulation. On the other hand, the CFTC has charged him with commodities fraud and manipulation, which also includes several violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The press release explained,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we allege, Eisenberg engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme to artificially inflate the price of the MNGO token, which was purchased and sold as a crypto asset security, in order to borrow and then withdraw nearly all available assets from Mango Markets.&rdquo;</p>

The Mango Markets Hack&nbsp;
<p>The Mango Markets hack took place in October, with Eisenberg targeting the native MNGO token and artificially inflating its price. He then took several loans, managing to drain the Mango Markets treasury for $110 million. He then tried to use the stolen MNGO governance tokens to manipulate the protocol&rsquo;s DAO to vote for his solution to return the tokens, following which the DAO offered Eisenberg a deal that let him keep $47 million worth of crypto assets as a bounty if he returned the rest of the assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that the Mango Markets hack was orchestrated from Puerto Rico, following which Eisenberg disappeared for some time before reappearing in the United States. Eisenberg had attempted to execute a similar attack on Aave in November. However, that attempt failed, with the hacker losing millions worth of crypto.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 21st January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, will list Speed Service Mobility (SSM) on January 27, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the SSM/USDT trading pair will be officially available for trading at 7:00 UTC on January 27, 2023.</p>
<p>Utilizing the power of blockchain technology, Speed Service Mobility (SSM) innovates the Electric Vehicle (EV) ecosystem by integrating various services such as EV charging, game, NFT, and more. Its native token SSM will be listed on LBank Exchange at 7:00 UTC on January 27, 2023, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Introducing Speed Service Mobility
Speed Service Mobility (SSM) is a project that aims to revolutionize the Electric Vehicle (EV) industry. There are four visions SSM wants to achieve. First of all, in order to solve the problem of the shortage of EV chargers, the SSM platform is applied to the existing personal chargers to convert to shared chargers, and the easy-to-use shared chargers will be developed in a similar form to personal chargers, so that individuals can easily install/operate them and become charging providers. This enables users in the EV ecosystem to form a shared community together.</p>
<p>Additionally, in order to prevent the excessive occupation and monopoly use of chargers, monetary (points/virtual assets) compensation or royalties based on token economics are given to actively guide users to make positive changes and realize the construction of autonomous EV infrastructure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the chargers operated/managed by different charging operators can be organically linked with each other. By providing "roaming service" to all charging operators, they can offer services that have no difference from each other, the accessibility of users can be improved and the technical problems of linkage between charging operators can be solved.</p>
<p>Last but not least, in order to help users actively use clean energy to achieve efficient energy use, SSM uses the battery of EV that has charged in advance as an energy storage device in case of insufficient daily power supply. Users who help to reduce the load during peak hours will get rewarded.</p>
<p>In addition to EV charging services, SSM also expects to attract consumers by providing games. The standard practice of the game industry is in-game purchases &ndash; personal upgrades or personalized products in the form of digital goods. The more players participate, the more additional benefits these purchases will generate. This unique in-game currency often adds value through enhanced functions, making it possible to adopt the universally accepted in-game payment standard, and providing special discounts when players purchase specific points in advance.</p>
<p>SSM will also attract subscribers with rich experience through NFT. This will help SSM create a single digital identity for all experiences, meaning that users can change their avatar skins and experience levels, or transfer other in-game items to create a more integrated SSM passenger experience. Therefore, in addition to accessing (interactive) SSM content libraries (games, experiences), subscribers can also access other functions.</p>
<p>In short, the core of SSM project is to improve the utilization rate of infrastructure by sharing personal charging tools for charging electric vehicles. In order to solve the problem of unauthorized or long-term occupation caused by a wrong understanding of the use method of public chargers, the use of an authentication system and possession penalty are proposed to prevent misuse of public charging infrastructure and promote and seek user convenience. In addition, through the use of two-way chargers, users are guided to participate in the use of clean energy, inhibit the use of electricity during the period of maximum load, reduce power consumption, increase the value of environmentally friendly travel means, reduce carbon emissions, and directly contribute to improving the environment.</p>
<p>About SSM Token
SSM is the native token of Speed Service Mobility project. It is used as a reward and payment method in the ecosystem, and can be traded not only on the SSM platform, but also on the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on Klaytn network, SSM has a total supply of 1 billion (i.e., 1,000,000,000) tokens, of which 20% is provided for token sale, 15% is allocated to the finance department, 15% is allocated to the team, 5% is provided for the fans and supporters, 20% is provided for the community, and the remaining 25% is allocated for the ecosystem.</p>

The listing of SSM token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 21st January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, listed GroveC (GRV) on Jan 19, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the GRV/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p>
<p>As a decentralized and secure green crypto, Grove is here to create a healthier and wealthier future for all. Its native token GroveC (GRV) has been listed on LBank Exchange at 12:00 UTC on Jan 19, 2023, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Introducing Grove
The energy consumption and electronic waste generated by traditional cryptocurrency mining methods has wide-reaching environmental consequences. As the world looks for greener solutions to tackle climate change, the public perception of cryptocurrency hampers its massive, untapped potential to be a driving force for positive change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grove is a project that aims to reverse that negative view with its Grove Green Plan and help crypto realize its latent potential. It is the guiding outline for the hybrid 'green crypto' blockchain ecosystem and a planet-friendly investment business built to pursue the mission of a healthier and wealthier future for all.</p>
<p>The ecosystem of Grove consists of 3 major components, one of which is GroveKeeper, the digital asset wallet providing an easy-to-use and secure method for investors to obtain and hold their cryptocurrencies and NFTs. With multiple layers of insurance and access to a DApps browser to facilitate buying, selling and swapping of coins and tokens as well as staking and farming for passive income generation, GroveKeeper will be a platform that maximizes usability while utilizing cutting-edge cybersecurity methodologies to protect users.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also GroveSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) utility of Grove. Users can buy, sell, swap and trade various cryptocurrencies across three blockchains with as-low-as-feasible network fees on each transaction. Investors are guaranteed a fast, reliable and safe experience as any project successfully listed on GroveSwap must be audited, interviewed and provide documentation regarding operational wallets and the deliverability of their project aims and utilities.</p>
<p>In addition to GroveSwap, the centralized exchange (CEX) GroveX is another capstone of Grove&rsquo;s crypto-industry utilities. As a robust, easy-to-use exchange for first-time investors or seasoned industry veterans, GroveX will be available online through mobile apps and support tokenomics for listed projects. This makes it more attractive to list on for developers and far more rewarding for the communities that support projects to engage with.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;GreenOasis&rsquo; program within GroveX is a unique support platform for Grove&rsquo;s fellow &lsquo;green crypto&rsquo; projects, offering support and partnership incentives that would help eco-friendly but potentially very niche projects receive awareness and attention in the broader market by leveraging the brand name power of Grove.</p>
<p>With a team of professionals and entrepreneurs, known to be the best in the field, Grove strives to create wealth, for all Grovers, by harnessing the opportunities of a secure, decentralized digital currency in an environmentally conscious way. By compensating nature for years of abuse, Grove will create a healthier, wealthier future for all.</p>
<p>About GRV Token
GroveC (GRV) is the native token of Grove ecosystem. Its blockchain is a fork of the BSC architecture. With its 'Proof-of-Stake' approach, this token supply protocol is counter to the environmentally harmful 'Proof-of-Work' mining approach. The GRV blockchain facilitates an entire ecosystem of digital finance utilities, as well as allowing other projects to develop on the same network. A portion of Grove Business profits will be provided for burning the GRV supply, ensuring ongoing value to holders.</p>
<p>Holders of GRV are invited to play an integral role through community engagement in future developments within its Digital Asset ecosystem. Users can also participate in Staking and Farming, which are passive income utilities available to GRV across all networks. The Annual-Percentage-Yield (APY) structure fixes the return rate for the duration of the Staking or Farming pool. Coins held in this way will be rewarded a proportionate amount of passive token generation of GRV.</p>
<p>GRV has a total supply of 100 million (i.e., 100,000,000) tokens. It has been listed on LBank Exchange at 12:00 UTC on Jan 19, 2023, investors who are interested in the Grove investment can easily buy and sell GRV token on LBank Exchange right now. The listing of GRV token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>
