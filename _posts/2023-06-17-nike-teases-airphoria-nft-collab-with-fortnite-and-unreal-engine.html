<p class="md-end-block md-p">Nike, a titan in the world of footwear and apparel, has started dropping hints about a potentially massive move: introducing a collection of sneaker nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in Fortnite, the massively popular online game developed by Epic Games.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Rumors of Airphoria: A Possible Revolution in the Gaming Industry</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In a series of June 16 social media posts, Nike teased an event set for June 20, which they termed the "ultimate Sneakerhunt". A promotional video showcased the logos of both Fortnite and Nike's Air Max amidst floating clouds. As the video transitions, it unveils the name of this intriguing venture, 'Airphoria', ending with a display of Nike's Web3 platform .SWOOSH logo alongside that of Epic Games' Unreal Engine.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">However, specific details remain elusive. Members of the NFT community have begun to speculate that Nike might have employed Fortnite Creative 2.0, a tool that allows users to craft their own virtual island game maps utilizing Fortnite assets, to devise an NFT-related game.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A Leap Into Web3 for Nike with .SWOOSH</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This wouldn't be Nike's first foray into gaming. The company has been stepping up its efforts to merge its NFT unit, .SWOOSH, into traditional gaming. Just recently, on June 1, .SWOOSH announced its intention to incorporate its NFTs into games developed by EA Sports, a household name responsible for the incredibly successful FIFA soccer game franchise, among others. Although it's still not confirmed which EA Sports games will incorporate Nike NFTs, this latest hint seems to suggest that Nike's integration into the gaming world might be deeper than previously anticipated.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Although not yet confirmed, the probability of NFTs featuring in Airphoria is high, given .SWOOSH's involvement and Epic Games' known affinity for NFT gaming. If the speculations prove to be true, the move could provide a considerable opportunity for Web3 adoption amongst traditional gamers. Considering Fortnite's impressive player base of over 242.9 million active players in the past 30 days, as reported by Active Player, the potential impact could be monumental.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Nike has previously launched NFT sneakers on Polygon, as well as an earlier collaboration with RTFKT. </p>
