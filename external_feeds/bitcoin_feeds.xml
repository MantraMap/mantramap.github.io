More than 40 countries have expressed interest to join the BRICS group, with 22 nations already having submitted official applications. “We&#8217;ve never had such a large outreach,&#8221; said South Africa&#8217;s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations.</strong></p>
<h2>69 Leaders Invited to BRICS Summit</h2>
<p>The upcoming BRICS summit is expected to be the largest yet, with 69 invitations already sent out, City Press reported. South Africa is hosting this year&#8217;s summit, which is scheduled to take place in Johannesburg from Aug. 22 to 24. The BRICS economic bloc comprises Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The South African diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, has revealed that all 54 African heads of state and the leaders of major Global South bodies have been invited to the summit. However, Western countries including the U.S., U.K., and France have not been invited. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/frances-macron-hopes-to-attend-brics-summit-in-south-africa-report/">expressed</a> interest in attending the BRICS summit but was met with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-opposes-french-president-macron-attending-brics-summit-citing-hostile-and-unacceptable-policy-toward-moscow/">opposition</a> from Russia.</p>
<p>Noting that many heads of state have been calling South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to request invitations to the BRICS summit, Sooklal said at a press briefing last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Ramaphosa took a decision to invite the entire [African] continent to the BRICS Plus [summit] as well as all of the political heads of the major Global South bodies. So, in total about 69 leaders have been invited.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Sooklal, President Ramaphosa&#8217;s decision to invite all African leaders to the BRICS summit was driven by the bloc&#8217;s involvement in Africa. South Africa recognized the importance of using its chairmanship to foster development on the continent, with a specific focus on advancing the continental free trade agreement, he explained.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve never had such a large outreach,&#8221; Sooklal stressed, noting that this year&#8217;s summit will be the largest. In comparison, he shared: &#8220;In 2018, we had the entire Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) heads of state present as well as leaders of the global south.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sooklal emphasized that the interest in participating in the summit demonstrated a vote of confidence from global leaders in the BRICS bloc. He clarified that while the group did not invite Western countries to its summit, the BRICS nations engage with the global community to address common issues.</p>
<p>The South African diplomat also said last week that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">more than 40 countries</a> are interested in joining the BRICS group, with 22 countries already having submitted formal applications. He also revealed that discussions at the summit will include &#8220;deepening interaction in trading in local currencies.&#8221; He emphasized: &#8220;Countries want to have greater flexibility and to be less dependent on the dollar.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Economist on Chinese Yuan and Reserve Currency</h2>
<p>The chief economist of South African financial services firm Nedbank, Nicky Weimar, discussed how a common BRICS currency could challenge the U.S. dollar’s hegemony last week, Independent Online reported. The BRICS group comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Noting that the economic bloc seeks to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">create</a> a reserve currency on par with the U.S. dollar and reduce its dependency on the USD, Weimar emphasized that to achieve this goal:</p>
<blockquote><p>You need foreign exchange reserves and you need the trust of the investment community.</p></blockquote>
<p>The economist explained that the U.S. dollar became the global reserve currency due to the backing of the Federal Reserve, which the market trusted.</p>
<p>“The U.S. has never defaulted on its debt. It’s given many people scary moments, but it’s never actually defaulted on its debt. The same cannot be said for any of the countries in the BRICS grouping. That’s the first problem,” Weimar described. Recently, the U.S. managed to avoid <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">defaulting</a> on its debt obligations amid a debt ceiling crisis.</p>
<p>The second problem was that the only country in the BRICS economic bloc to carry such a reserve currency was China, Weimer described, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>But China has capital controls. You cannot have a reserve currency if you have capital controls. So China in order to make this possible would have to undergo enormous financial liberalisation if they really want to compete with the dollar.</p></blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, the economist stressed: “They also can’t do it and then change course. They would have to do it and stick with it to gain the trust of the investor. So this is miles away because, ultimately, you must gain the trust of the investor. A currency only has value if people believe it has value. And that trust has got to be there. So they’ve got a long journey ahead of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting that China has the ability to do this, but huge changes must be implemented, she opined: “I don’t actually see them talking along those lines. It’s almost like they haven’t made that connection yet that you need to let go of some of the control. You also need to always be willing to provide it.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you agree with Nedbank’s chief economist? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The new legislation, which legalizes and regulates the use of Bank of Russia’s digital currency for payments and other transactions, will enter into force on Aug. 1. </strong></p>
<h2>President Putin Greenlights Law Introducing Digital Ruble as New Form of Russian Fiat</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a bill providing the legal basis for the implementation of Russia’s central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>), the Tass news agency and other Russian media reported. The new <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202307240009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal law</a> introduces a third, digital form of the national currency, the ruble, after cash and non-cash (bank) money.</p>
<p>Putin’s signature opens the door for using the CBDC named “digital ruble” as a means of payment and for other transfers in the Russian Federation. These will be free of charge for citizens while businesses will pay a 0.3% commission on the amount transferred.</p>
<p>Transactions with the digital currency will be processed through a dedicated information system — the digital ruble platform. Under the law, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is the sole issuer of the CBDC and will be the only operator of its payment system.</p>
<p>The CBDC will be stored in digital wallets and accessed through the mobile apps of commercial banks. At the same time, the law does not permit users to open bank accounts with digital rubles or receive loans in the central bank digital currency.</p>

<h2>Ruble Remains the Only Legal Tender in Russia</h2>
<p>The legislation, which was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-passes-digital-ruble-law/">passed</a> earlier in July by both houses of Russian parliament, the State Duma and the Federation Council, introduces amendments to the country’s Civil Code. Its main provisions will enter into force on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The adoption of the law is viewed as part of Moscow’s efforts to not only offer an alternative for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kids-wont-be-able-to-spend-moms-digital-ruble-as-they-wish-russian-official-says/">payments</a> inside Russia but also find ways to circumvent financial restrictions imposed over its war in Ukraine. Last week, Governor Elvira Nabiullina revealed that the CBR is exploring options to integrate its platform with other CBDC systems to facilitate the use of the digital ruble in cross-border settlements.</p>
<p>Russian officials have also been discussing the legalization of cryptocurrency payments, but only in foreign trade and under special legal regimes. Also this month, Putin signed a law effectively banning certain crypto payments for goods and services in Russia.</p>
<p>This legislation requires exchanges for digital financial assets, or tokens issued on blockchains run by authorized operators, to reject transactions where these assets can be employed as “monetary surrogates.” At least for now, the ruble, in its different forms, remains the only legal tender in Russia which is yet to determine the legal status of decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.</p>

(Ripple). District Judge Analisa Torres&#x2019; highly anticipated order has been touted as a landmark victory by some digital asset lawyers and other professionals in the beleaguered industry. The SEC claimed Ripple and some of its senior leaders conducted unregistered offering and sale of &#x201C;crypto-asset securities&#x201D; in connection with its issuance of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> token (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>).</strong></p>
<p><em>The following editorial was written by guest authors <a href="https://twitter.com/wyattnoble3">Wyatt Noble</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MDHesq">Michael Handelsman</a> for <a href="https://kelman.law/">Kelman.Law</a></em></p>
<h2>Ripple vs. SEC</h2>
<p>Specifically, the SEC alleged in its complaint that Ripple sold more than 14.6 billion <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, valued at more than $1.38 billion from 2013 through 2020, without filing a registration statement. According to the complaint these sales constituted a violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). Further, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> as an investment contract, which is a security under the SEC&#x2019;s jurisdiction according to the Securities Act (15 U.S.C &#xA7; 77b(a)(1)). The SEC alleged Ripple conducted three types of unregistered securities offerings: (1) programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges for which it received $757 million; (2) institutional sales under written contracts for which is received $728 million; and (3) other distributions under written contracts for which it recorded $609 million in &#x201C;consideration other than cash.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>How Judge Torres Ruled and Why</h2>
<p>In party holding for Ripple, the court considered whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> was an investment contract under the Howey Test, a legal doctrine that was developed by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co (328 U.S. 293 (1946)) to determine whether certain transactions are investment contracts. For the uninitiated, the Howey Test has three prongs: (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with the expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency advocates and executives from centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken have argued for years that the Howey Test is incompatible with cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. However, courts like the SDNY and regulatory agencies like the SEC appear to firmly believe the Howey Test is applicable to digital assets. Those who oppose applying the Howey Test tend to focus their arguments on the third prong, and argue that retail investors do not have a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others when buying from anonymous sellers through exchanges. Unsurprisingly, the third prong is where much of the controversy stemmed from in Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling.</p>
<p>Judge Torres held under the Howey Test that programmatic sales of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> to retail investors on digital asset exchanges did not constitute the offer and sale of securities because those sales were blind bid/ask transactions and retail buyers could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, another retail investor, or another seller of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>.</p>
<p>However, Judge Torres also held that Institutional sales of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> did constitute the offer and sale of securities because institutional investors would have purchased <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple&#x2019;s efforts, and Ripple led institutional investors to believe it would use the capital received from its institutional sales to improve the market for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> and develop uses for the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> ledger, in turn increasing the value of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. Additionally, other distributions were held not to constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts because recipients of the other distributions did not pay money or &#x201C;some tangible and definable consideration&#x201D; to Ripple for their <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>.</p>
<p>Many digital asset influencers, advocates, and even legal professionals have hailed the case as a decisive victory for both Ripple and the industry at large, claiming that Judge Torres essentially cemented that the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> token itself is not a security and that her reasoning can and will be applied to other digital assets that have recently been subject to SEC scrutiny. However, the implications of this much-anticipated ruling are not yet certain and that may not change for several years.</p>
<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
<p>The SEC will go back to the drawing board, and given that Chair, Gary Gensler, has already publicly expressed his disappointment with the ruling, an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals remains a possibility. Gensler&#x2019;s disappointment notwithstanding, an appeal could be risky for the SEC because the agency&#x2019;s jurisdiction over cryptocurrency markets could be reduced significantly if it appeals and loses. But part of this case &#x2013; that Ripple executives aided and abetted securities law violations in connection with institutional sales &#x2013; still has to go to trial, and SDNY has not yet set a date.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do in the Meantime?</h2>
<p>In light of ongoing regulatory uncertainty and the increasing frequency of enforcement actions by the SEC, it&#x2019;s more important than ever to consult with legal experts well-versed in digital assets. Consulting with the lawyers here at Kelman PLLC early on is the most efficient way to ensure compliance with potentially applicable laws and regulations, and avoid legal pitfalls and expenses that could otherwise handicap your business.</p>

Despite 18 months of beta testing and claims of more than 2 million sign-ups, the token has a scant 164,195 holders with its circulating supply exceeding 100 million WLD tokens.</strong></p>
<h2>A Look at Worldcoin’s Concentration of Holders at Launch</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-altman-backed-worldcoin-reaches-2-million-signups/">Worldcoin</a> iris scanning crypto endeavor, striving to fortify universal basic income (UBI) and promote digital identification amid the era of artificial intelligence (AI), debuted its cryptocurrency on Monday, July 24. As for Tuesday&#8217;s data, at 10:15 a.m. Eastern Time (ET), a maximum supply of 10 billion WLD tokens exists, and currently, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/worldcoin">coingecko.com</a> and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/worldcoin-org/">coinmarketcap.com</a> report a circulating supply of 107 to 108+ million WLD tokens. Upon its initial exchange listing, the price stood at $1.88 per token, later reaching a peak of $3.30 per coin that same day.</p>
<p>As of July 25, 2023, WLD is being traded for prices ranging from $1.91 to $2.56 per coin, exhibiting extreme volatility. With current prices at $2.17 per unit, WLD has declined over 35% from its all-time high. The Worldcoin concept and initiative have been in existence since 2019 when they were established by Openai CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/openai-boss-sam-altman-claims-hes-not-involved-in-worldcoins-day-to-day-operations-at-all/">Sam Altman</a>, Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania from the San Francisco and Berlin-based Tools for Humanity. Initially created on Ethereum, the token now <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-migrates-to-optimism/">utilizes</a> the Optimism (OP) layer two blockchain.</p>
<p>The project boasts support from numerous venture capital investors like Reid Hoffman, Andreessen Horowitz, Anatoly Yakovenko, Gavin Wood, Day One Ventures, Digital Currency Group (DCG), Coinfund, Blockchange Ventures, and more. Currently, with 107 million WLD tokens circulating, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s distribution is highly concentrated and held by only a few entities. For instance, among the <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xdc6ff44d5d932cbd77b52e5612ba0529dc6226f1#balances">164,195 unique addresses</a> possessing WLD tokens, the top wallet controls a significant 63.29% of the entire supply.</p>

<p>To illustrate this concentration further: the largest wallet holds 112,540,589 WLD, while the second largest wallet contains 32,488,727 tokens or 18.26% of all WLD. The third biggest WLD wallet possesses 8,722,407 coins, representing 4.9% of the circulating supply. Currently, the majority of WLD tokens are held by market makers and exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and the Optimism Gateway. Very few transfers have occurred since its inception — just 275,591 transactions have taken place since launch. Lots of which are <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x1f8c0396363df3de05cd44be51f6997536997363112855c047daaa1496876898">&#8220;claim&#8221; transfers</a> in the amount of 25 WLD per claim.</p>

<p>The objective of WLD is to ensure fair global distribution to individuals solely based on their unique identity. It&#8217;s reported that 75% of WLD will be allocated to the Worldcoin community; 10% is reserved for the Worldcoin team and advisors; an additional 10% is designated for the Worldcoin Foundation; and the remaining 5% is intended for early investors and strategic Worldcoin partners. Yet, the timeline for diluting the currently aggregated supply, along with the duration of its aggregation, hangs in the balance. Presently, it&#8217;s the market makers who primarily hold the reins of worldcoin&#8217;s (WLD) distribution.</p>

The dollar-pegged tokens USDP and GUSD experienced the largest 30-day reductions, shedding 45.1% and 27.2%, respectively.</strong></p>
<h2>Top Stablecoins Tumble: $3 Billion Evaporates in Less Than 40 Days</h2>
<p>Statistics reveal a significant contraction in the stablecoin economy, as billions of dollars have been withdrawn from dollar-pegged projects over the past year. About 39 days ago, the stablecoin economy was valued at $129.80 billion, but it has decreased to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">$126.70 billion</a> today, with more than $3 billion vanishing since <a href="https://archive.li/ANkYp">June 16, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The entire top ten stablecoins by market capitalization, except for tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>), have experienced notable 30-day reductions. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>&#x2019;s supply has increased by 0.6%, usd coin (USDC) has recorded a 30-day decrease of 6.4%. As of Tuesday, July 25, USDC&#x2019;s market capitalization is $26.63 billion, down from $28.25 billion 39 days ago.</p>

<p>In the past month, DAI has lost 6% of its value, and BUSD has decreased by 10.1%. The stablecoin TUSD saw a reduction of 10.7%, while frax dollar (FRAX) dropped 9.3%. Meanwhile, Tron&#x2019;s USDD recorded a modest 1.6% loss, and the Paxos-issued pax dollar (USDP) saw its supply dwindle by 45.1% over the same period.</p>
<p>Gemini dollar (GUSD) also experienced a significant loss, dropping approximately 27.2% over the past 30 days. On June 16, the 24-hour trading volume of stablecoins was around $30 billion, but it has since decreased to $23 billion. The global trading volume linked to stablecoin assets has notably declined over the past year.</p>
<p>Conversely, while the value of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins has dwindled, euro-anchored projects have recorded growth in the past month. Yet, it&#x2019;s crucial to note that the volume of these euro-backed stablecoin initiatives significantly trails that of the towering USD token behemoths.</p>

The latest surge took the price to its highest level since early May. Avalanche was another notable gainer today, rebounding from recent losses.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed to a fresh multi-month high on Tuesday, as traders continued to react to Twitter’s rebrand to X.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.07353 to start the week, DOGE/USD spiked to a peak of $0.07811 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>This resulted in the meme coin climbing to its strongest point since May 6, which is the last time price was above $0.08000.</p>

<p>Honing in on the chart, it can be seen that a breakout of the 63.00 zone on the relative strength index (RSI) triggered this latest rally.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 66.66, and looks set to be heading for a ceiling at 70.00.</p>
<p>In the event this destination is reached, there is a good chance that DOGE will be back at $0.08000.</p>

<h2>Avalanche (AVAX)</h2>
<p>Additionally, avalanche (AVAX) was back in the green during today’s session, after rebounding from Monday’s decline.</p>
<p>AVAX/USD ascended to a high of $13.38 earlier in the day, a day after slipping to a bottom at $12.92 to start the week.</p>
<p>The move came as the token closed in on a key support level at $12.90, however bulls rejected a breakout on this occasion.</p>

<p>Price strength also held firm at a support point of 44.00, before rising to a current reading at 47.28.</p>
<p>Despite this, momentum remains bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a downwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>

So far this year, a total of nine such block rewards from the 2010 era have been spent, resulting in the transfer of 450 bitcoins.</strong></p>
<h2>2010 Block Spend Makes the Ninth This Year</h2>
<p>According to btcparser.com, a rare 2010 block reward was <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=15tABe48T1RH2sQXCtztL74R9me3VPehni">spent</a> on Monday, transferring 50 bitcoins to an unidentified address. Although 50 bitcoins may not be a substantial sum, it is valued at $1.4 million, and expenditures of bitcoins from 2010 have become much less common nowadays. Moreover, the 50 bitcoins were essentially valueless back then, as bitcoin did not hit the <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/bitcoin+price+2010">five-cent mark</a> until July 17, 2010.</p>
<p>The funds were transferred to a <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qtahv60m9pwhym245urvql507f08e2yh7zwjnqu">specific bitcoin address</a> and moved on from there. Blockchair&#x2019;s privacy tool indicated that the transfer scored a 5 out of 100 on privacy, citing three issues, and it labeled the privacy level as &#x201C;low.&#x201D; The issues comprised the fact that the funds were swept, the same address appeared multiple times in the inputs, and the inputs were of diverse types.</p>
<p>The 2010 block reward transfer on Monday marked the ninth such expenditure this year, with the most recent previous transactions from this era occurring on June 26. On that day, two transfers took place, amounting to a total of 100 bitcoins. Moreover, both block rewards were acquired on the same day, July 12, 2010, which suggests they were transferred by the same individual.</p>

<p>Thus far in 2023, a total of nine 2010 block reward transfers have occurred, but only eight of these were from virgin, dormant bitcoin rewards. A <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/a1d49167de850e0d12a2f57f41258dcf8c2544d7acf4283748ad18942156536f">transaction</a> that occurred on April 22, 2023, spent a 50-bitcoin block reward, but the address had also <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/d7dd3050ba3ff04e8a14518b753ef7630234a66b63e9a91ed78099400abb1105">spent</a> a small amount, or 0.00001094 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, from the wallet on August 10, 2021. The remaining eight transactions, including the one on Monday, involved completely untouched block rewards that had remained idle for 13 years.</p>

<h2>Sam Altman Backed Worldcoin Launches Officially</h2>
<p>Worldcoin, the decentralized ID and wallet protocol backed by Sam Altman, CEO of Openai, announced its official launch on Monday. The project, which had been in its development stages for more than three years, is finally opening its services to the public, expanding its reach and aiming to reel in <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1683380244013809664?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 billion users</a> worldwide.</p>
<p>Worldcoin has two different components: World ID, a decentralized identity protocol that uses individuals&#8217; irises as a &#8220;proof of personhood&#8221; verification, using specialized devices called &#8220;Orbs&#8221; for this task, and World App, which allows users to receive incentives in the form of WLD, the native token of the protocol, and transfer and manage these resources with an internal wallet.</p>
<p>On reaching this milestone, Altman <a href="https://worldcoin.org/cofounder-letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worldcoin is an attempt at global scale alignment, the journey will be challenging and the outcome is uncertain. But finding new ways to broadly share the coming technological prosperity is a critical challenge of our time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>75% of the initial 10 billion WLD issuance will be <a href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/tokenomics#technical-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">granted</a> to users, while Tools For Humanity, the team behind the Worldcoin idea, and its investors, will retain ownership of the remaining 25%.</p>

<h2>Orb Acceleration</h2>
<p>While users can reserve their share of WLD tokens, they need to physically prove their humanness by getting their irises read by an Orb. To accelerate the growth of the protocol, Worldcoin also <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-begins-rollout-orbs-meet-global-demand-world-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a rollout of more than 1,500 orbs to more than 35 cities.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-altman-backed-worldcoin-reaches-2-million-signups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More</a> than 2 million users have already signed up using World ID, and with this move, Worldcoin expects to add more than 40,000 sign-ups weekly. The rollout of the devices will be focused on countries that have shown themselves to be receptive to Worldcoin&#8217;s proposal. In Spain, Worldcoin will ostensibly expand its operation 3x due to the more than 150,000 users that have already registered in the initial testing phases.</p>
<p>In countries like Brazil and France, the rollout will be more limited. Altman stated that, for the time being, Worldcoin will not be available in the U.S. due to a lack of regulatory clarity.</p>

The confidence index is expected to increase to a reading of 111.5 in July, up from 109.7 the month prior. Ethereum also bounced higher, after colliding with a key price floor.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
After dropping to a one-month low to start the week, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rebounded in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD jumped to a peak at $29,327.86 earlier in the day, following Monday&#x2019;s drop to a bottom of $28,934.29.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Bitcoin bulls rejected the pressure to settle at a support point of $28,800, and now seem to be targeting a ceiling of $30,000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One reason why the price appears to have stabilized is the relative strength index (RSI), which found a floor of its own around 42.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 41.90, with the next point of support around the 37.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, it appears that price will remain marginally stable above $29,000, however this could change following this afternoon&#x2019;s report.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) bounced from a support point of its own on Tuesday, after slipping to a multi-week low on Monday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a bottom at $1,836.85 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD marginally rose to an intraday high of $1,862.43 in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The bounce came after ethereum moved away from a recent support point at the $1,830 mark, with $1,900 now the likely target.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Similar to bitcoin, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s RSI settled at a floor around 43.00, which has played a big part in halting yesterday&#x2019;s sell-off.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Now tracking at 45.00, the next visible point of resistance lies at 50.00, and a move to this point will almost certainly send <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> to $1,900.&#13;<br />
