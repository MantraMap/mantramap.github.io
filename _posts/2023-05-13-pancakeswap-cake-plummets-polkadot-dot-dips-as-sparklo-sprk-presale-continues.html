<p>Cryptocurrency market trends are now showing upward trends as the market is slowly getting back in shape. Investors are making moves and filling their portfolios with the right coin which will likely appreciate as the bull run commences. </p>
<p>Although some coins like Polkadot (DOT) and Pancakeswap (CAKE) are not having it easy in the current cryptocurrency market, Sparklo has become largely untroubled even in bearish moments. Sparklo has shown the most promise with analysts predicting a staggering 4,000% increase in value before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="s7">Pancakeswap (CAKE) plummets amidst bullish call</p>
<p>In the wake of cryptocurrencies' bullish trend, Pancakeswap (CAKE) has suffered a dip in price in recent weeks. Pancakeswap which a few months ago strengthened its position in the DeFi world after its partnership with Fewcha wallet as the native swap function has seen its value dip by almost 24.4% in the last 7 days according to Coingecko.</p>
<p>Pancakeswap (CAKE) price is $2.5 but experts have predicted that the price will shoot up as the bull run commences with a potential to reach $3.59 before the end of 2023. Although a proposed change to Pancakeswap tokenomics may give it a lifeline, investors should do their own research to take a strong position on Pancakeswap (CAKE).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Concern as Polkadot (DOT) Suffers a Dip</p>
<p>The 51% increase in Polkadot (DOT) market cap in the first quarter of 2023 has not reflected in the coin market price as it suffers a dip in fortune. While most cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) posted impressive gains, Polkadot (DOT) has plummeted further with &nbsp;a 5.6% decline in value in the past three months. </p>
<p>Over the last 7 days, the dip has risen to 11% with a price value of $5.915. Although experts are predicting an upsurge in fortune, with a potential Polkadot (DOT) to reach $15 in 2023. Investors may have to take caution to see how events unfold.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) Revolutionizing Cryptocurrency as Presale Continues </p>
<p>Early adopters of Sparklo have been counting their gains as the value of Sparklo rises. Within a week, the coin has risen from $0.015 presale value to $0.017. Sparklo which prides itself as a platform that tokenizes physical assets such as gold, silver and platinum is currently enjoying an upshoot in the market with analysts predicting a whopping 4,000% increase soon. </p>
<p>With liquidity that will be locked for 100 years, Sparklo provides an opportunity to have in-store shops where physical gold, silver and platinum will be connected to the crypto market. This will allow investors to buy the physical assets using their minted NFTs. They can also use the minted NFTs to trade on the Sparklo platform with a little $0.01 charge as a transaction fee.</p>
<p>Sparklo is likely to be a game changer and the first of its kind in the cryptocurrency market. It is set to take a big leap in the near future.</p>
<p>With the current price of $0.017, this is a good time for investors to take advantage of this project. Sparklo is offering a 30% bonus to investors who purchase the coin from now till 5th May. What it means is that if you buy 10000 SPRK now, you will get 13000 in return. And this ends in a few days. So, take advantage of this opportunity and build your crypto portfolio now.</p>
