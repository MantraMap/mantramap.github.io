<ul>
<li>APT, the utility token of the Aptos network, has gained over 130% in the past seven days, tapping an all-time high. </li>



<li>PankcakeSwap&#8217;s community commitment to the network and its recent integration into Atomic wallet are linked to the token’s surge. </li>



<li>Fantom and Hedera also enter the weekly top gainers list recording over 20% and hitting new milestones.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Digital asset bulls continue swimming in ecstasy following recent upticks from the market as several assets break multiple resistance levels, which they hovered around for months.</p>



<p>The price of Aptos (APT) started this year with a rally and has maintained the momentum gaining over 130% in the past week. APT hit an all-time high of $18.30 after a bullish 24 hours of trading, which saw it grow by 41%.</p>



<p>This year, the token&#8217;s price has soared over 420% after its fall last year due to the controversy surrounding its tokenomics and centralization concerns. A 420% year-to-date (YTD) growth means that APT has eclipsed the YTD growth of market leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).</p>



<p>BTC has been up by 30%, while ETH, on the other hand, has gained 33% in 2023. BTC has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-targets-25000-in-ultra-bullish-breakout-as-whales-double-down-on-gigantic-btc-buys/">touched</a> levels not seen for months after it reached pre-FTX highs and later marched on to tap $23,400. BTC currently exchanges hands at $23,058, while ETH trades at $1,602 at press time.</p>



<p>The growth of Aptos was anticipated following its launch last year by former Meta employees with huge promises of technical development and increased web3 activities. Although the initial growth was stunted by <a href="https://zycrypto.com/aptos-mainnet-to-experience-nft-boom-despite-network-scalability-problems/">controversies</a>, Aptos now boasts of a market capitalization of over $2 billion in a few months.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-reason-behind-the-charts">The reason behind the charts</h2>



<p>The entire cryptocurrency market has been on a rally for weeks, with APT and other assets like Fantom (FTM) and Hedera (HBAR) among the biggest gainers. The recent rise of APT began after PancakeSwap’s community voted to stick with the network two weeks ago.</p>



<p>PancakeSwap is the first decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Aptos network and has over $32 million in assets locked on the network. The integration into Atomic Wallet also played a significant role in the surge.</p>



<p>Finally, overall decentralized finance (DeFi) activities boomed on the network in the last couple of weeks with further plans by the team to enter new non-fungible token (NFT) partnerships. Topaz, a leading NFT marketplace on APT, has recorded over 250% increase in sales volume in the last 30 days.</p>

<p>Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, has taken a swipe at critics for their smear campaigns particularly aimed at discrediting his country’s ability to meet its debt obligations after its Bitcoin stash value fell in the red.</p>



<p>In a thread of tweets Tuesday, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-strongly-believes-bitcoin-will-hit-100000-this-year/">bitcoin bull</a> condemned the so-called big media, financial analysts and the risk rating agencies for “shamelessly lying” to the world that El Salvador was broke and was going to default on its debts. Bukele’s outburst comes after his administration completed paying investors holding a Eurobond with a maturity of January 24, 2023.</p>



<p><em>“In the past year, almost every legacy international news outlet said that because of our “Bitcoin bet”, El Salvador was going to default on its debt by January 2023 (since we had an 800-million-dollar bond maturing today). Literally, hundreds of articles,”</em> wrote Bukele.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Well, we just paid in full, 800 million dollars plus interest,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>Since assuming office in 2019, the former mayor of San Salvador has come under <a href="https://zycrypto.com/president-bukele-faces-off-with-popular-bitcoin-critics-as-el-salvadors-stash-suffers-a-beat-down/">heavy criticism</a>, especially for his aggressive policies. However, from fighting corruption after campaigning on the slogan <em>“There’s enough money when no one steals” </em>to restoring law and order in the once crime-plagued Central American nation, his tactics endeared him to many in his country.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, some critics, especially international financial institutions, fell out with the Bukele administration further following the decision to make Bitcoin a legal tender in 2021. On several occasions, the World bank, as well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), urged El Salvador to scale back its push for Bitcoin as legal tender, noting that the country risked being cut off by international financiers.</p>



<p>Those warnings were further echoed by mainstream media, which devoted so much time and space to El Salvaldor’s economic initiatives, especially after last year&#8217;s crypto market crash.</p>



<p>Last July, Bukele hit out at the New York Times after the newspaper published an article titled “It’s clear they’re afraid, Bitcoin is inevitable”, which seemed to reprove El Salvador&#8217;s Bitcoin agenda.</p>



<p><em>“It’s clear they’re afraid Bitcoin is inevitable. By the way, they say we’re heading to default. Will they publish an apology once we pay everything on time?”</em> Bukele said at the time.</p>



<p>That said, the Bukele administration has remained unswayed by naysayers, promising to continue <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvador-and-justin-sun-to-start-buying-1-btc-every-day/">pushing</a> its agendas and living by its commitments and responsibility to pay its debts and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.</p>

<li>Australian cryptocurrency exchange, Digital Surge, goes into corporate administration in order to continue as a going concern amid FTX’s meltdown.</li>



<li>The company&#8217;s creditors have approved the bailout plans, which will see the company pay back its 22,545 consumers.</li>



<li>Investigations into the company reveal that the company’s directors acted in good faith with no links to fraud however, there are questions surrounding one employee.</li>
</ul>



<p>The implosion of FTX last year led to a chain of similar collapses as a result of links to the exchange leading to staggering losses and thousands of disappointed investors.</p>



<p>Digital Surge, a Brisbane-based cryptocurrency exchange, will continue to operate after its investors agree to a long-term deal to keep the company afloat as it recovers from the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-alamedas-financial-crisis-sends-bitcoin-and-ethereum-prices-tumbling-as-the-week-opens/">losses</a> of FTX. The company’s unfortunate event began when it transferred $33 million worth of assets to FTX two weeks before its collapse in November.</p>



<p>To satisfy all competing interests effectively, the company went into administration in December, and in a report released last week by KordaMentha, the company’s administrators, it was revealed that the company had 22,545 customers at the time of administration. </p>



<p>The second meeting of creditors gave the company the needed lifeline as they approved several restructuring proposals, as reported by Business News Australia. First, a $1.25 million loan was approved from Digico, allowing the firm to continue trading. </p>



<p>The Deed of Company Arrangement shows that customers with less than $250 will be paid in full, while those with more than $250 will receive 55% of their assets in the next few months. Customers will either be paid in digital currency or fiat as they choose, but the balance of 44% will be spread across five years and will be paid out of the quarterly profits of the exchange.</p>



<h2 id="h-investigations-indict-an-employee"><strong>Investigations indict an employee</strong></h2>



<p>As the norm in corporate administration, an investigation into the affairs of the company was carried out by KordaMentha. It was revealed that before the FTX went into bankruptcy, $6.5 million was withdrawn from Digital Surge along with $31,000 by five employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After investigations, the firm came to the conclusion that the directors of the company acted in good faith without breaching their duties, but the actions of an employee were questionable. The employee, whose name was withheld, withdrew $1.6 million worth of Bitcoin and Australian Dollars despite being aware of the company’s exposure to FTX, thereby deriving benefits over other creditors.</p>



<p>On the part of the directors, they stated that they transferred funds to FTX because they believed it was a reputable exchange at the time, as FTX held an Australian Financial Services License.</p>

<li>Hester Pierce reiterates the aim of Web 3 and blockchain as she addressed industry experts in the wake of a potential bull run.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The SEC commissioner called for collaboration between web3 project leads, teams, and communities along with the Commission to prevent recurring scams.</li>



<li>The market expects tighter regulations this year across the board with the recent comments made by the SEC, NYDFS, etc.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Last year recorded frequent digital asset scams leading to huge losses hitting over $2 billion as rug pulls, bridge, and flash loan attacks surged, leading to increased scrutiny by authorities.</p>



<p>Hester Pierce, a commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that industry players should learn from the bad experience of last year as they plan to shape the future. Speaking at the Duke Conference for Digital Assets, she told team leads to remember the purpose of cryptocurrencies and to carry the community in line.</p>



<p>“<em>Underlying these lessons is the truth that technology takes time to develop and often must combine with innovative developments in other fields to realize its full potential,” </em>she added.</p>



<p>She stressed that the essence of digital assets is not to drive up prices and abandon them for blind users but should always look to the advantages of the underlying blockchain technology for inspiration. She said the goal was about “<em>solving the trust problem” </em>while transacting with people they don’t know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Traditionally, people have looked to centralized intermediaries or governments to solve this problem, but technology like cryptography, blockchain, and zero-knowledge proofs offer new solutions.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>As the market flipped green this year with assets tapping <a href="https://zycrypto.com/early-q1-2023-crypto-prices-rally-on-favourable-us-inflation-data/">highs</a> not seen for months, bad actors may be tempted to carry out rug pulls and other similar scams. According to Pierce, reducing bad actors is better for both the SEC and crypto executives in their push for safe trading practices.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-pierce-calls-for-synergy"><strong>Pierce calls for synergy</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC commissioner also added that the Commission’s current approach of regulating the market through “<em>regulation by enforcement” </em>will take the Commission 400 years to achieve its aim at this rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>If we continued with our regulation-by-enforcement approach at our current pace, we would approach 400 years before we got through the tokens that are allegedly securities.”</em></p>



<p>To create better rules and proper governance mechanisms over the sector, she called for partnership between the SEC and industry players. According to her, industry leads should be on their toes to stamp out corrupt and shady practices in the sector rather than leaving them solely in the hands of the authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, she urged experts to constantly build on the value of digital assets despite little input from authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Crypto’s value proposition depends primarily on the builders of this technology, not on regulators like me who lack technical expertise and stand on the periphery looking in.”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The Dutch central bank has slammed Coinbase with a 3.3 million euros ($3.6 million) fine after finding the U.S-based exchange guilty of not meeting registration requirements before offering its services in the Netherlands.</p>



<h2 id="h-coinbase-fined-3-6m"><strong>Coinbase Fined $3.6M</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase, one of the world&#8217;s biggest crypto exchanges, has been served a $3.6 million slap in the wrist.</p>



<p>According to a statement released on Thursday, the Dutch central bank has fined Coinbase on allegations that it had been operating while unregistered between November 15, 2020, and August 24, 2022. </p>



<p>The penalty increased from the base $2.18 million due to the severity of the non-compliance, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) explained. The regulator said it also took into consideration the size of Coinbase’s customer base in the Netherlands and the competitive advantage it had enjoyed by not paying supervisory levies. The total fine, however, was reduced by 5% due to the fact that the firm had always intended to finish registration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto companies intending to set up shop in the Netherlands are required to register under the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act.</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Objects To The Fine</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase now has until March 2, 2023, to object to the fine. However, the company has disagreed with the DNB’s administrative order, saying it was “based on the time it took for Coinbase to obtain our registration in the Netherlands and includes no criticism of our actual services,” adding that the company “should not be penalized for playing by the rules and engaging in this process.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase is therefore carefully evaluating the objections and appeal process. Nonetheless, the exchange is committed to continuing to provide safe, trusted services to all its new and existing Dutch customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Dutch central bank <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dutch-central-bank-nukes-crypto-exchange-binance-with-3-4-million-fine/">imposed </a>a similar fine on the Binance crypto exchange in July 2022 for failing to obtain the necessary license to offer services in the Netherlands. </p>

<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unleashed a fury against the cryptocurrency industry on Wednesday. Speaking during an interview with the American Economic Liberties Projects, the longtime and almost mechanistically predictable opponent of crypto called on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to step up its crypto enforcement efforts. Warren posited that industry participants are “scared of a strong SEC”.</p>



<h2 id="h-warren-praises-sec-s-gary-gensler"><strong>Warren Praises SEC’s Gary Gensler</strong></h2>



<p>Elizabeth Warren, on January 25, blamed the previous SEC administration under former President Donald Trump for basically opening up the crypto market to “junk tokens, unregistered securities, rug pulls, Ponzi schemes, pump and dumps, money launderings and sanctions evasions”. But with Gary Gensler at the helm, the sector is being cleaned up, which has scared industry players.</p>



<p>“The SEC has brought enforcement actions against celebrity crypto promoters for not disclosing their compensation to the public. It has gone after the employees at exchanges like Coinbase for insider trading. It has charged crypto crooks for defrauding ordinary investors out of millions of dollars,” Warren opined — adding that the commission is just getting started.</p>



<p>Multiple U.S. agencies have jumped into the crypto world along with the SEC in recent years, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC). While most in the cryptosphere would prefer to deal with the CFTC, Warren indicated that the SEC and its chief Gensler are better suited for the role. She notes that some industry leaders spend millions of dollars each year in lobbying to dodge SEC oversight.</p>



<p>“The commission has been loud and clear that crypto doesn’t get a pass for long-standing security laws that protect investors and ensure the integrity of our financial markets,” Warren stated. “This is the right approach — the SEC has the right rules and the right experience, and Gary Gensler is demonstrating that he is the right leader to get the job done.”</p>



<p>The Massachusetts Senator further commended the SEC for disapproving applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) thus preventing them from giving investors easy exposure to the digital currency.</p>



<h2><strong>Warren Wants The SEC To Use “The Full Force Of Its Regulatory Powers”&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren then cited the implosion of a handful of crypto companies like Celsius, FTX, Alameda Research, Voyager Digital, and Three Arrows Capital last year as a key reason why the SEC oversight is vital.</p>



<p>Warren even suggested that the agency should “use the full force of its regulatory powers” across the crypto market so as to “reign in the frauds inflicted on American consumers.” She added that Congress needs to prop up the agency with new resources and new authority to ensure it can take on the sector at full strength.</p>



<p>The crypto skeptic also urged regulators in the environmental sector to hunt down crypto miners, who she accused of pushing up energy costs and contaminating the environment. The environmental impact of proof-of-work mining has long been a key point of contention that regulators cite in calls to prohibit bitcoin.</p>



<p>Notably, this isn’t the first time Warren has called for a more heavy-handed approach toward the crypto sector. In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box in July 2021, Warren memorably enraged crypto devotees when she <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jack-dorsey-backs-bitcoin-evangelists-open-letter-to-staunch-crypto-critic-senator-warren/">likened </a>digital assets like bitcoin to drugs and snake oil and called for an immediate regulatory crackdown on the fast-growing market.</p>

<p>A recent fourth-quarter (2022) fillings by the global EV manufacturing brand, Tesla, revealed that the company sold none of its estimated 10,725 Bitcoins throughout the last quarter of 2022. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing report released yesterday, January 25th, showed that Tesla had held on to its Bitcoin over the last six months despite prolonged market crashes from the rippling effects of FTX, 3AC and Terra.</p>



<p>Tesla, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-above-22k-even-as-elon-musks-tesla-dumps-75-of-its-btc-holdings/">which had sold</a> a third of its bitcoin holdings in July last year, opted to hold strong all of its 10,000+ BTC, currently valued at over $230 million, as Bitcoin underwent a brutal value shrink in the previous two quarters. The e-car maker’s Bitcoin value declined by $33 million. </p>



<p>The last sale had fetched the Elon Musk-owned company over $936 million and a throve of criticisms from maximalists who believed that selling Bitcoin while keeping its Dogecoin was a disadvantageous move for the market. The uncertainty following the pandemic and China&#8217;s lockdown had forced the self-acclaimed ‘Dogefather’ to ‘consolidate its cash position.’</p>



<p>Beyond Bitcoin, the reports further reveal a decent profit margin for the company. Its $24.07 billion estimated revenue margin was surpassed by approximately $200 million, bringing the total revenue for 2022 to 24.35 billion. It had closed the quarter with $1.19 earnings per share, as against the projected $1.12. Over 73,778 cars were produced during the period, and a total income of $4.1 billion was realized.</p>



<p>Back in 2021, the Tesla boss had hinted at plans of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin/">accepting Bitcoin</a> as payment for Tesla. Over $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin was purchased, with a disclosure that the company would hold bitcoin payments and not convert them to cash. The dream was soon short-lived as Elon called off plans sighting environmental concerns.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has since surpassed the 50% renewable energy condition given by Musk. According to the Bitcoin mining council, its mining and computing activities are responsible for a meagre 0.0017% of the world’s energy usage and 0.0011% of the world’s carbon emissions.</p>



<p>It is yet unknown if Elon would stay true to the promise of accepting Bitcoin, as this may demand billions worth of Bitcoin purchases to strengthen the company’s liquidity position.</p>



<p>Both Bitcoin and Tesla’s stock value briefly rallied upwards on the heel of the findings, with Bitcoin gaining 3% to peak at $22,963 and Tesla (TSLA) edging up 0.4% to reach $144.43.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated Djed stablecoin is scheduled for launch <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-centered-stablecoin-djed-set-to-debut-in-january-ada-poised-for-rapid-adoption/">next week</a>, fostering expansion and novel applications in the rapidly developing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector of the Cardano ecosystem.</p>



<p><em>“We are pleased to share another update about Djed’s progress and to inform you that the launch is scheduled for next week,”</em> COTI, a platform optimized for creating price-stable coins and the soon-to-be official issuer of Djed, announced Tuesday.</p>



<p>Without hinting at a specific date for the launch, the COTI team, however, noted that there are technological developments they were currently working on. Key among them was the so-called “chain indexing process”, which they said would take 14 days to complete before Djed launches. Chain index syncing refers to a process aimed at ensuring that all the nodes in a blockchain network are updated on issues such as transactions and block to keep the network healthy and secure. According to the team, this is currently the only technical bottleneck holding the launch.</p>



<p>The team also noted that they were developing a snapshot feature and user interface (UI) to be integrated into DJED. This will facilitate the staking of ADA and generate additional rewards for $SHEN holders, allowing $SHEN holders to monitor extra rewards. Additionally, they had added the “refund button”, a feature that allows users to cancel their orders as long as they haven’t been processed.</p>



<p>Since the Djed Public Testnet went live on May 4, 2022, the team has made significant progress with most of the work in configuration management, UI integration and final design out of the way. Moreover, over 40 platforms, including exchanges such as Wingriders and Bitrue have already expressed the intention to support Djed and Shen through listing as well as other partnerships.</p>



<p>When launched, Djed will become the first decentralized and overcollateralized stablecoin built on Cardano. Djed will be backed by ADA and use Shen as a reserve coin. Shen will ensure Djed’s stability by guaranteeing the peg and collateralization rate of the stablecoin.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while the news is yet to impact the price of Cardano’s native token, ADA, the crypto community is stoked at the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-unveils-djed-an-innovative-stablecoin-for-the-fast-growing-ecosystem-issued-by-coti/">vast improvements</a> and capabilities that the stablecoin will bring to the ecosystem.</p>



<p>At press time, ADA was trading at $0.36, down about 3.26% in the past 24 hours. Despite the asset’s price being down 88.33%- which is a far cry from its all-time high of $3.10, many hope that the launch of Djed will give the price the much-needed boost towards $1.</p>

<p>A recent update by Binance has revealed that Signature Bank, a major SWIFT gateway service provider, will partially terminate access to Binance customers starting in February.</p>



<p>The update sent by Binance, which a customer tweeted, read thus: </p>



<p><em>“The banking partner that serves your account has advised that they are no longer able to process SWIFT fiat (USD) transactions for individuals of less than 100,000 USD as of 1st of February 2023.”</em></p>



<p>Hours after the announcement, concerns were raised about the possibility of other US banks limiting exposure to cryptocurrencies by regulating their SWIFT gateway. However, a section of the crypto community expressed optimism about the unlikelihood of a widespread SWIFT ban, adding that this appears to be a lone case of limiting crypto exposure by the New York-based bank, which recently came under scrutiny for its in-house blockchain feature, Signet.</p>



<p>Signature Bank disclosed in December its plans to cut back exposure to crypto deposits after the impact of the fall of FTX tanked its share price 67% lower. In 2018, the bank launched Signet, a blockchain-based multipurpose instant payment platform for commercial users. Going toe-to-toe with global banking giants like JPMorgan, the bank boasted a platform that reduced traditional SWIFT delays from 3 days to 30 seconds and a thorough FinCEN-compliant KYC measure for preventing bad actors. It had onboarded the crème de la crème of crypto in a short time, sparking surprise amongst financial analysts familiar with the watertight regulatory terrain of the US.</p>



<p>Following the fallout of FTX, alleged reports now reveal a number of other crypto firms—like Binance, Nexo, Huobi, and Genesis Trading—under investigation that received Signature’s approval to use Signet. This leaves a lot to be answered on Signature’s due diligence.</p>



<p>SWIFT, which stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Transactions, is a unified gateway for the exchange of information and transactions by financial institutions worldwide. Within the crypto sector, SWIFT is crucial for the institutional adoption of crypto as it is the most widely used gateway for attracting inflows from new users into crypto. </p>



<p>A shutdown of SWIFT will mean significant paralysis for crypto, which still relies on the inflow of fiat to grow its ecosystem. The war in Russia witnessed the first time SWIFT access was terminated, prompting the rise of crypto through illegal platforms like Bitzlato to circumvent restrictions.</p>

<ul>
<li>The New York Department of Financial Services has released a new guideline to regulate how firms handle customer assets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The department takes the bull by the horn as it reacts to new revelations in the demystification of FTX.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Digital asset analysts laud the move to add more data regulations to protect user assets though some feel it’s “over-controlling.”</li>
</ul>



<p>As more revelations trickle in from the FTX saga, authorities around the world are ramping up regulations to avoid a repeat of the infamous incident.</p>



<p>The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has issued a new guideline on how digital asset firms are to handle user assets. In a letter to the industry, the department stated that user assets should be separated from each other to avoid commingling with the firm’s assets.</p>



<p>The statement also addressed how firms should apply customer funds and make proper disclosures to clients when applying user funds in line with best practices.</p>



<p>“<em>As stewards of others’ assets, virtual currency entities that act as custodians [&#8230;] must have robust processes in place, akin to traditional financial service providers”, </em>per the statement.</p>



<p>The robust statement by the NYDFS warns custodians to keep separate asset records both on-chain and in the firm&#8217;s internal records. To keep users informed on the status of their assets, custodians are now required to furnish customers with written notices that show the arrangements, application of funds, and how those funds have been separated from others, as well as the interest accrued, if any.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the regulation now makes user funds held by custodians for only safekeeping “<em>without creating a debtor-creditor relationship with the customer” </em>when funds are transferred.</p>



<p>The regulations apply to cryptocurrency-related firms that hold a BitLicense, a license issued by New York authorities to regulate the activities of virtual asset companies.</p>



<h2 id="h-mixed-reactions-follow-the-regulation"><strong>Mixed reactions follow the regulation</strong></h2>



<p>While many have lauded and pushed digital asset regulations in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/french-central-bank-governor-calls-for-stricter-crypto-regulations-ahead-of-mica-vote/">recent</a> months, several quarters have maintained scepticism over previous regulatory decisions. The NYDFS decision to roll out BitLicense in 2015 is a classic example leading to Kraken’s pull out of the state. </p>



<p>Last year, the CEO of Kraken, Jesse Powell, continued to criticize BitLicenses as a burden to digital asset firms.</p>



<p><em>“After all this time, I mean, if we just looked back and did a study of the economic damage done by the BitLicense, I&#8217;m sure it would be tremendous in the billions of dollars.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>However, those in support of the regulations and BitLicenses are more and point to the protection of user assets even if it slows the pace of development in the sector.</p>

<ul>
<li>Michael Sonnenshein has criticized the SEC’s regulatory approach, describing it as shallow and one-sided.</li>



<li>He calls for the SEC to work round the clock to remove bad actors from the industry but should not hinder the growth of digital assets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Debate on the thin line between proper and excessive burdensome regulation considering the nature of digital assets, makes rounds in the industry.</li>
</ul>



<p>Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein joins the bandwagon of industry players to call out the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its regulatory practices in the sector.</p>



<p>In his recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ftx-sbf-crypto-regulation-sec-11674493234?mod=opinion_major_pos16&amp;linkId=198344712">letter</a> published in the Wall Street Journal, Sonnenshein stated that the SEC’s approach to digital asset firms had stalled the growth of Bitcoin (BTC) in the country. He concurs with the widespread allegations that the SEC is “<em>late to the game” </em>with its regulations leading to the collapse of FTX.</p>



<p>“<em>Late’ doesn’t capture what transpired here. The problem is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s one-dimensional approach to regulation by enforcement,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>He further expressed the need for the SEC to rid the sector of bad actors as they continue to cripple the market. Sonnenshein wrote that the actions of the SEC have also limited the sector forcing American investors to pitch their tents offshore.</p>



<p>“<em>We are seeing the consequence of SEC priorities play out in real-time at the expense of US investors,”</em> Sommenshein said.</p>



<p>According to him, the SEC should be quick to block loopholes in the sector without making tight regulations for digital asset firms to limit the growth of BTC.</p>



<p>Grayscale is currently suing the SEC for “<em>arbitrarily denying</em>” the conversion of its Grayscale’s BTC trust (GBTC) to a spot ETF. The SEC has issued a reply to the company citing the proposal’s lack of disclosure in ways to protect user funds and fraud manipulations as reasons for denying the proposal.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-strict-should-regulators-get"><strong>How strict should regulators get?</strong></h2>



<p>Several industry players believe that the nature of digital assets requires special regulations different from traditional ones. The SEC v Ripple case <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-commissioner-makes-controversial-case-for-eth-xrp-faults-howeys-test/">encapsulates</a> this debate in applying the Howey Test to determine if digital assets classify as securities. </p>



<p>While tougher regulations will stifle growth in several areas of the industry, many users would prefer it to be in place because of the growing rates of fraud. The recent implosion of FTX, which resulted in investor losses hitting billions, has now sparked renewed enthusiasm in regulators.</p>



<p>As authorities ramp up regulations and push for more audits to the pleasure of users, many fear that the thin line between effective and harsh regulations will be crossed, leading to limitations not needed in the industry. </p>

<p>The eagerly awaited Shibarium layer-2 scaling solution for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is nearing its beta launch, with the lead developer Shytoshi Kusama hinting in his Twitter bio that Shibarium may come as soon as February or earlier.</p>



<p>On Friday, Kusama inadvertently exposed a likely date for the beta launch, veiled in a word puzzle, through his Twitter profile, which reads;</p>



<p><em>“Tending the Pine Tree of Life. Quickly learning to play the flute before putting Shibarium in a heart-shaped box with a bow.”</em></p>



<p>Following the profile update, the<a href="https://zycrypto.com/explosive-moves-in-the-offing-for-shiba-inu-bonk-and-dogecoin-as-trading-volume-tops-25-billion/"> Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> community has been trying to decode the message, with some concluding that Shibarium will be released on Valentine’s Day, February 14.</p>



<p><em>“Hints from the core developer suggest a Beta release on February 14th, based on tweets from Shytoshi Kusama and the SHIB HOLDER,”</em> one tweep wrote, echoing the thoughts of thousands of Shiba Inu adherents.</p>



<p>Late last week, Kusama issued another hint when he mysteriously tweeted;</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>During fall, the tree may have only a few leaves, but then spring appears…Luckily, Shibarium, in this context, is a Pine Tree. Still, it needs water, sunlight and proper soil. But pines survive and thrive during the harshest winters. (I also hear the needle tea is good for you.)</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>On Saturday, Kusama launched an official Telegram Group for Shibarium, which has over 12,000 members at the time of writing. He then stated that the channel would not communicate until the Layer-2 network is released, thus furthering speculation that it will be launched soon.</p>



<p>The latest developments have piqued the interest of the crypto community, with many speculating about the project’s potential and impact on the industry. Shibarium’s launch is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-renews-bullish-momentum-for-0-001-shib-as-massive-token-burn-expected/">expected</a> to scale performance for the Shiba Inu ecosystem and signals a shift in the industry as more projects are now looking to layer-2 solutions to boost scalability, privacy, and security. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Shib army has been eagerly awaiting the launch, with some speculating that it will cause the prices of SHIB and BONE to increase, potentially sending SHIB past $0.001.</p>



<p>In the last 48 hours, SHIB has jumped by over 5% and in the last week by a remarkable 21%, with the current price at $0.00001209. SHIB is trading at its highest level since November 2022, with a 43% increase from the start of the year.</p>

</ul>



<p>A Chinese firm is developing a new payment system interoperable with stablecoins and CBDCs &#8211;  that acts as a link for central banks to transfer and swap regulated digital currencies &#8211; recently unveiled at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>



<p>Dubbed the Universal Digital Payments Network (UDPN) and developed by Red Date Technology, the new system would reportedly work with the private sector, unlike the rival Ripple network, which mostly serves central banks. According to the announcement, several major banks, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Standard Chartered, have been selected to participate in the pilot phase.</p>



<p>UDPN, in particular, noted that it would not work with decentralized public cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, perhaps underscoring its efforts to comply with the ongoing Chinese ban on cryptocurrencies. Beijing is keen to prevent any form of capital outflow in the form of stablecoins or digital assets.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-commercialization-of-udpn-is-scheduled-for-mid-2023"><strong>The Commercialization of UDPN is Scheduled for Mid-2023</strong></h2>



<p>Per the project’s whitepaper, UDPN is planned to debut with two separate stablecoins, with the pilot commercialization set for mid-year. In the near term, the project team expects the network to support most of the global CBDCs and regulated fiat-based stablecoins. The system would also be extended to include the interoperability of the traditional messaging networks.</p>



<p>UDPN has a common messaging standard in multiple digital currency systems, which is essential in enhancing interoperability in CBDC and stablecoins. The system will also accelerate access to a fully decentralized economy by commercial banks with a system managed by an alliance of financial institutions and fintech firms.</p>



<p>Technically, UDPN would have four main nodes – the validator nodes and the transactions nodes – all operated on-chain. The validator nodes would have a hyperledger and governance systems. The next set of nodes, which would operate off-chain, is the business and the transaction nodes. Compared to the SWIFT network, which has led to an increase in cross-border and inter-bank transactions, UDPN is touted by its developers as an important link in the future of digital currencies.</p>

<ul>
<li>The fork is a test environment for the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.</li>



<li>Shanghai is expected to unlock the withdrawals of the staked ETH in the Beacon chain.</li>
</ul>



<p>Blockchain developers successfully launched a ‘shadow fork’ for the upcoming <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-next-big-upgrade-slated-for-2023-heres-why-its-super-bullish-for-eth/">Shanghai upgrade</a> in the Ethereum blockchain. The shadow fork – a test model for the actual mainnet that lets developers check if the code for the proposed upgrade functions well on a real blockchain – happened Monday at 5:30 am ET.</p>



<p>Shanghai upgrade is expected to take place by March, and among the proposed amendments is to allow for the withdrawals of the staked coins, which happened during the proof of stake transition. Ethereum developers have also noted that more shadow forks will be released in the coming week in the run-up to the network upgrade.</p>



<p>Amidst the upgrade, technical problems were reported for some of the Ethereum’s nodes using Geth clients, according to developer Marius Van Der Wijden, who said that the network was working to have the clients synchronized with the rest of the network.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-update-a-testnet-is-expected-before-the-end-of-february"><strong>The Next Update, a Testnet, Is Expected Before the End of February</strong></h2>



<p>Also in the offing is a public testnet proposed by the developers to take place before the end of February. The test network is set to bring on board the staking firms to test the Shanghai upgrade. Ahead of the update, the blockchain developers have also noted that additional forks would copy the network&#8217;s data to the testing environment or the shadow fork.</p>



<p>The Ethereum community has been concerned about how soon they can access their staked assets. There have been delays in the past for such forks in Ethereum, including the most recent PoS merge. On-chain data shows that the number of staked Ether in the validator contract to be unstaked is 16,167,572.</p>



<p>In November, the team behind the Shanghai update introduced the Shandong testnet but later replaced it with an enhanced alternative. Ahead of last year&#8217;s big change to the Ethereum network, the Merge, the blockchain underwent several test forks before the final deployment.</p>
