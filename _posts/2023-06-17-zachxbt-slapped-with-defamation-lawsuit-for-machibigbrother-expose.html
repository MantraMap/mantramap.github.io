A throwback article just came back to haunt one of the crypto industry&#8217;s favorite crypto investigators. ZachXBT, a popular crypto on-chain sleuth recently got slapped with a defamatory lawsuit over an article he published last year.  The Controversial Article That Started It All Around a year ago, ZachXBT published an article accusing Jeffrey Huang aka MachiBigBrother, of embezzling crypto assets using various methods ranging from failed pump and dump tokens to NFT projects. The article quickly gained widespread attention at the time, but it has been largely forgotten up until this point.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Positive Social Sentiment Sparks Bullish Speculation Jeffrey Huang, known online as Machi Big Brother, is a former Taiwanese-American musician and tech entrepreneur.  Huang has now filed a defamation lawsuit against ZachXBT, claiming the year-old article has damaged his reputation. Huang has insisted, at least according to a post that he published on Twitter, that ZachXBT&#8217;s charges are false and defamatory. As a result, he has decided to sue for defamation of character. A cursory reading of the article, on the other hand, reveals that it is an investigational piece that goes into considerable detail. In the article, ZachXBT provided on-chain data to back up his claims. The crypto sleuth initially accused Machi Big Brother of embezzling 22,000 ETH from Formosa Financial, a treasury management platform built for blockchain companies in 2018. Furthermore, ZachXBT then provided a list of other projects like Machi X and Wifey Finance.
