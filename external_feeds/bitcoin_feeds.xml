Binance Blockchain Week brings innovative leaders and conversations together to further the development and adoption of blockchain and Web3. The event will focus on the future of Web3, including how blockchain and crypto can empower the next billion people to improve their everyday lives.</p>
<p>The conference will feature over 100 prominent leaders, innovators and influencers as speakers across two stages.

<p>More than 2,000 people are expected to attend from all over the world, with millions more tuning in to the event virtually through <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/live">Binance Live</a>’s stream.

Our objective is to continue building the Web3 and blockchain industry together, expanding on its potential to improve financial equity and positively impact society overall,” said Yi He, Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer at Binance.</p>

Many supporters and market observers anticipate a price increase prior to the event. According to an anonymous market analyst known as Plan B, bitcoin&#x2019;s price could ascend to between $40,000 and $50,000 in the run-up to the next block reward halving.</strong></p>
<h2>Plan B Estimates Bitcoin Could Cross $40K Ahead of Fourth Halving Amidst Market Uncertainties</h2>
<p>Two optimistic events are stirring discussion in recent circles: the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., and the impending block reward halving. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-2024-halving-presents-new-challenges-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-mining-rewards/">forthcoming halving</a>, predicted to occur in about nine months, near April 24, 2024, will inevitably halve bitcoin miners&#x2019; revenues. Analysts at JPMorgan foresee financial challenges for bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) miners if the crypto asset&#x2019;s price and transaction costs fail to increase by that date.</p>
<p>&#x201C;While bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners,&#x201D; JPMorgan&#x2019;s senior analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou explained in a note to clients.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2023, a<a href="https://youtu.be/vmIlDbTgFYs"> video surfaced</a> from Plan B, an anonymous market analyst famed for creating the <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25">stock-to-flow (S2F)</a> price model. In this video, he posits that bitcoin&#x2019;s value could elevate to a range of $40,000 to $50,000 by the impending halving. A <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/plan-bs-stock-to-flow-price-model-denounced-by-vitalik-buterin-says-model-can-be-harmful/">wave of criticism</a> crashed over Plan B in 2022 when his S2F forecasts <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-supporters-sift-through-the-graveyard-of-technical-indicators-that-failed-to-predict-bitcoins-bottom/">fell short</a>. However, in this latest video, he employed the 200-week moving average as a tool to predict future price trends.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The 200-week moving average increases currently at about $500 [per month], so nine times $500 will be $4,500,&#x201D; Plan B explained in the video. &#x201C;Bitcoin&#x2019;s 200-week moving average right now is a little under $28,000, so $28,000 plus $4,000 is well [a] $32,000 dollars (200-week) moving average at the halving approximately.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The anonymous analyst added:</p>
<blockquote><p>And bitcoin would be above that right, and usually it would be like 50% above that, which would indicate a range of Bitcoin at the halving between $40,000 and $50,000.</p></blockquote>

<p>Plan B also sparked intrigue on July 17, 2023, by launching a <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1680948756806549504?s=20">survey</a> that posed the question: &#x201C;Can bitcoin this halving cycle (before April 2024) make a new all time low (ATL, currently $15.5K) and/or a new all time high (ATH, currently $69K)?&#x201D; At the time of writing, the poll has drawn more than 20,000 responses, with 37.9% predicting neither a new ATL nor a new ATH prior to April 2024.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Plan B&#x2019;s pre-halving price forecast is modest. For example, Matrixport <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/matrixports-year-end-2024-prediction-bitcoin-to-reach-125000-as-strong-performance-fuels-bullish-sentiment/">forecasts</a> a halving price of $63,160, fueled by Blackrock&#x2019;s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund filing and a marked rise in institutional interest.</p>

If the POL concept gains approval, validators can earn rewards from staking and also accumulate rewards from multiple Polygon chains.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon Labs Introduces Next-Gen Crypto With POL, a Potential MATIC Successor</h2>
<p>Polygon Labs <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-tokenomics">introduced</a> a multipurpose token named POL on July 13, 2023, following the release of a <a href="https://polygon.technology/papers/pol-whitepaper">white paper</a> on the subject by a group of Polygon founders and researchers. The white paper outlines POL&#8217;s role as a potential successor to MATIC, becoming a crucial tool in fostering growth and collaboration within the Polygon ecosystem. One significant advantage of POL is that stakers will have the opportunity to accumulate rewards in POL as well as from other Polygon-centric networks.</p>
<p>Described as a &#8220;hyperproductive&#8221; digital currency, POL has the capability to validate numerous blockchains, according to a blog post by Polygon Labs on POL&#8217;s tokenomics. “To attract more validators, some Polygon chains can choose to introduce additional rewards,” the post explains. “These rewards can be in any token, including but not limited to POL, stablecoins or native tokens of those Polygon chains.” Should it receive approval, POL&#8217;s supply is poised to match MATIC&#8217;s 10 billion, and users can exchange MATIC for POL at a 1:1 ratio.</p>
<p>Polygon Labs states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The upgrade from MATIC to POL would require a simple technical action – sending MATIC to the upgrade smart contract, which will automatically return the equivalent amount of POL.</p></blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, the team announced regular POL emissions as a means to finance a community treasury, the purpose of which is to encourage protocol development, promote protocol research, distribute ecosystem grants, and foster adoption incentives. “The community treasury should be governed by the Polygon community, via an agreed upon governance process,” the blog post elaborates.</p>
<p>MATIC holders will be accorded a time frame to exchange MATIC for POL, with Polygon Labs recommending a period of four years or more. Wrapping up, the team indicated that the transition could commence within a few months if the community endorses this proposal</p>

South Africa, along with Morocco, Ghana, Egypt, and the Ivory Coast, accounted for 23.8% of the continent&#8217;s interest in cryptocurrency year-to-date (YTD).</strong></p>
<h2>High Inflation and Currency Woes Fuel Nigerian Interest in Crypto</h2>
<p>According to the latest Coingecko Africa crypto <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/crypto-interest-africa?utm_source=explore&amp;utm_medium=app">report</a>, Nigeria had &#8220;the highest level of crypto interest&#8221; on the continent with a share of 66.8%. The West African nation’s share of the continent’s crypto interest is nearly 8 times that of the next highest-ranked country South Africa.</p>
<p>The data in the Coingecko report is the latest to reaffirm Nigeria’s status as Africa’s number crypto nation both in terms of user <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/study-nigeria-most-crypto-obsessed-english-speaking-country-globally/">curiosity</a> and traded volumes. According to the report, poor traditional finance infrastructure, high inflation, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-nigerian-anti-graft-body-identifies-individuals-fueling-the-nairas-rapid-depreciation/">currency depreciation</a> are some of the factors which explain Nigerian residents’ unparalleled fondness for crypto.</p>

<h2>Top Six Countries Account for Over 90% of Africa&#8217;s Overall Crypto Interest</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the data also shows that in the period between Jan. 1 and June. 4, no other African country had a level of interest in crypto which surpassed 10%. In South Africa, the level of interest in crypto stood at 8.36% during the same period. Morocco, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-french-crypto-trader-jailed-for-18-months-for-buying-a-ferrari-with-bitcoin/">jailed</a> a crypto trader in 2021, is ranked third with 5.43% while Ghana is just behind with 5.24%. Inflation-stricken Egypt completes the top five with a crypto interest level of 2.74%.</p>
<p>As shown by the statistics in the report, South Africa, Morocco, Ghana, Egypt, and the Ivory Coast accounted &#8220;for 23.8% of the continent’s interest in crypto YTD [year-to-date].&#8221; The data also suggest that the top six countries’ share of Africa’s overall crypto interest level in the period under review was more than 90%.</p>
<p>The findings also suggest that just eight countries had a level of interest in crypto which exceeded 1%. According to the data, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Mozambique had the least interest in crypto among the surveyed African countries.</p>

Ghadimi asserts that developers and users are more concerned with performance than the novelty of Web3 applications.</strong></p>
<h2>Web3 Regulation a &#8216;Certainty&#8217;</h2>
<p>While this may explain developers&#8217; use of or preference for Web2 infrastructure, according to Ghadimi, participants in the Web3 ecosystem can reverse this trend by &#8220;matching the performance and latency of Web2.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when asked about reports of the United States&#8217; attempt to regulate the decentralized finance (defi) ecosystem, Ghadimi told Bitcoin.com News that he remains optimistic regulators will not go after projects which adhere to rules. Although the eventual regulation of Web3 is now widely seen as a &#8220;certainty,&#8221; the researcher nevertheless said he is &#8220;increasingly optimistic&#8221; that this will be done in a &#8220;sensible&#8221; way.</p>
<p>In his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, Ghadimi also shared his thoughts on why the web infrastructure needs Web3. He also offered his thoughts about the future of centralized entities in Web3.</p>
<p>Below are all of Ghadimi&#8217;s responses to the questions sent.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): What does the decentralization of the Web3 infrastructure mean and what’s the need for moving infrastructure to a decentralized layer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parsa Ghadimi (PG):</strong> Decentralizing web infrastructure is the shift from using corporate-controlled web infrastructure and cloud platforms to permissionless, uncensorable, decentralized platforms. You are only as strong as your weakest link, and so if even one part of your stack is centralized, you are vulnerable to censorship, de-platforming, hacks, service failures, etc. That’s the main reason for needing to move internet infrastructure and software off corporate-controlled cloud platforms and onto decentralized networks. Web3 only becomes a reality if the entire stack is decentralized.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Many developers building decentralized applications are aware of the critical principles of Web3 yet they still go on to build dapps on Web2 infrastructure. Why do you think they still do this and what needs to happen to encourage them to switch to a decentralized base layer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PG:</strong> Performance/low latency is king. No one will care if your product is decentralized if it loads slowly. And so most developers are currently forced to use Web2 infra to get Web3 performance to meet developer/user demands. What needs to happen to encourage them to switch to decentralized infra is that there needs to be decentralized infra that can match the performance and latency of Web2. And that’s exactly what we are aiming to do with Fleek Network and building a decentralized edge network.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p><strong>BCN: Can you tell us about your platform — Fleek Network — and its approach to bringing developers a decentralized edge layer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PG:</strong> Fleek Network is a decentralized edge network. It’s optimized to facilitate the deployment and running of performant web and edge services (CDN, serverless functions, etc.). It brings centralized web-like performance to Web3 without sacrificing Web3 values. It will lower the barrier of entry and speed up time to market for developers building Web3 infra/middleware by allowing them to offload a portion of their stack to a decentralized edge, similar to how the modern web works today. And it can replace a lot of the current parts of their stack that they still need Web2 infra for (ex. Cloudflare).</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Over the past few months, we have seen regulators (particularly in the U.S.) become increasingly aggressive in their actions against crypto giants like Coinbase, Binance, and the crypto ecosystem in general. Do you foresee this happening to decentralized entities and do you believe that regulators have a role in an ecosystem that’s designed to be self-regulated?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PG:</strong> It seems like the U.S. is attempting to establish a framework for what ‘sufficient decentralization’ means. So I hope they won’t go after the projects that adhere to that criteria. Regulation seems like a certainty at this point whether we like it or not, I just hope it’s sensible. But I’m becoming increasingly optimistic that it will be.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Do you foresee more centralized entities in the Web3 space in the coming years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PG:</strong> In absolute terms yes, just given the growth of Web3 that we will experience this decade. But I would expect to see the growth of decentralized entities match or exceed that over the same time period.</p>

In this issue, the Argentine central bank sheds yuan for dollars as its reserves bleed, the Central Bank of Brazil would be able to manipulate balances and block digital real accounts, and the first bitcoin futures contract goes live in Argentina.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentine Central Bank Sheds Chinese Yuan as Its Reserves Bleed</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of Argentina is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-argentina-accelerates-yuan-sales-and-dollar-purchases-as-reserves-dwindle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveraging</a> its Chinese yuan stash to purchase dollars and manage its internal operations as its reserve level dwindles. The bank is making payments to importers using part of the Chinese swap line that government officials <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-to-expand-de-dollarization-efforts-seeks-extension-of-yuan-based-swap-line-with-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended</a> to $10 billion in June.</p>
<p>Local newspaper La Nacion reported that the bank lost $170 million on July 10 and July 11 due to the payments the republic had to disburse to importers and the purchase of dollars. The gross reserves of the central bank bled out $580 million last week, reaching $26 billion. Aurum Valores, a financial group, estimated that the central bank lost $100 million per day.</p>
<p>On this, analysts from the local group Portfolio Personal Inversiones stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A level of reserves is being tested that has never been observed since at least the late 1980s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Half the available amount of the Chinese swap line ($5 billion) is said to have been used already, leaving the country trying to organize a new deal to accelerate disbursements from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<h2>Central Bank of Brazil Would Be Able to Manipulate and Freeze Digital Real Accounts in CBDC Pilot</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of Brazil will reportedly be able to manipulate the numbers of specific accounts during the upcoming pilot test of the digital real, the Brazilian central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pemagalhaes_github-ioralabsrealdigitalsmartcontracts-activity-7082009809549484032-Beqi?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to Pedro Magalhaes, a developer that claims to have discovered the solidity code of the digital real pilot using reverse engineering, the functions associated with the Brazilian CBDC smart contract let its issuer freeze the funds in a wallet, block the functionality of transferring tokens for a specific account, and issue tokens directly to a digital wallet.</p>

<h2>First Bitcoin Futures Contract Goes Live in Argentina</h2>
<p>The first bitcoin futures product in Argentina went live on Thursday, issued by <a href="https://www.matbarofex.com.ar/documentos/investigacion/guia-de-futuros-de-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matba Rofex</a>, a regulated domestic stock exchange. The futures contract uses the Matba Rofex <a href="https://www.matbarofex.com.ar/Indice-btc-mtr/metodologia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a>, allowing qualified investors to put their funds behind bitcoin in local currency without worrying about the custody of the underlying asset.</p>
<p>The issuance of this contract was <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/noticias/la-cnv-aprobo-futuros-basados-en-indice-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> in April by the Argentine securities regulator. At that time, it stated this approval intended &#8220;to adapt to the regulatory challenges imposed by new technologies for the provision of financial products&#8221; and &#8220;promote the development of new and innovative products.&#8221;</p>

There have been no official updates from Sunacrip&#8217;s restructuring board, but Bitcoin mining activities are still halted per local sources&#8217; reports.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuelan Crypto Ecosystem Still Affected After Sunacrip Intervention</h2>
<p>The situation of the Venezuelan cryptocurrency ecosystem and the current status of its official cryptocurrency asset, the petro, are yet uncertain after four months of the intervention of Sunacrip, the Venezuelan cryptocurrency watchdog. The restructuring board has made no official statements on the processes it is developing, and it is currently not known if the regulatory institution will even survive.</p>
<p>The government of Nicolas Maduro issued an executive order to intervene in the superintendence on March 17 after the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/head-of-venezuelan-crypto-watchdog-sunacrip-arrested-on-alleged-corruption-charges-institution-to-face-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrest</a> of its head Joselit Ramirez, who was accused of intermediating payments for $3 billion in undeclared crude sales to third parties. The financial hole in the case, which is commonly known as the PDVSA-Crypto scheme, was later expanded to represent a potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-crypto-ended-up-at-the-center-of-a-potential-20-billion-internal-corruption-scandal-in-venezuela-bitcoin-mining-shutdown-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 billion loss</a> for the nation after more undeclared and unpaid sales linked to cryptocurrency payments were uncovered by Reuters.</p>
<p>The intervention of Sunacrip was followed by other measures that were not officially corroborated but were reported by local Bitcoin miners and media sources, like the operation&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/national-exchanges-reportedly-pause-operations-in-venezuela-as-attorney-general-confirms-crypto-watchdog-sunacrip-involvement-in-oil-sale-schemes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pause</a> in local exchanges. Also, miners from the registered cryptocurrency farms in the country were disconnected from the power grid by the state power company Corpoelec in mid-March.</p>
<p>This brought heavy losses for Bitcoin miners based in the country, with some <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-volcano-energy-bitcoin-mining-project-rises-in-el-salvador-venezuelan-miners-leaving-amidst-crypto-corruption-probe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mulling</a> moving to more crypto-friendly nations, such as Paraguay or El Salvador.</p>

<h2>Mass Layoffs and Petro Debacle</h2>
<p>Subsequently, there were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-inflation-skyrockets-in-argentina-el-salvador-processes-digital-assets-licenses-venezuelan-crypto-corruption-probe-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> of mass layoffs within Sunacrip, which had a payroll of approximately 600 employees, 400 being fired by April 26. But still, there were no official statements on the issue. Even after the Petro blockchain stopped its block production twice in May, with users <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-petro-blockchain-faces-operational-difficulties-hundreds-of-wallets-allegedly-blocked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> the blockage of hundreds of wallets, the institution has been radio silent.</p>
<p>Then, last month, sources linked to Sunacrip <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-indicate-venezuela-is-preparing-to-liquidate-the-petro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the decision to end the petro and its operations was already taken, and it would be made effective after liquidating big holders of the currency at a still unknown market price.</p>
<p>On the possible effects of this situation, Juan Blanco Bracamonte, a Venezuelan Bitcoin miner, <a href="https://twitter.com/JblancoB/status/1680585147874246657?t=GkVV7Q-lZULd5nDsNlFSzQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting from scratch will cost a lot of money and some investors are not willing to invest in the midst of the legal uncertainty that has been unleashed since March 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sunacrip intervention measure will be effective until September 17 but can possibly be extended by six months more.</p>

<h2>Economist Paul Krugman on U.S. Dollar Dominance and Chinese Yuan</h2>
<p>Nobel laureate Paul Krugman discussed the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance and the potential for the Chinese yuan to replace the USD in an opinion piece published in The New York Times earlier this month. Krugman won the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.</p>
<p>Krugman acknowledged the growing de-dollarization trend worldwide and the potential decline of the U.S. dollar&#8217;s role in international trade, as more countries seek to de-dollarize. However, citing a Federal Reserve report that analyzed various indicators of dollar dominance, he stressed that the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance has remained steady over the past two decades, adding that “diminution of the dollar’s status seems unlikely in the near term.”</p>
<p>Regarding the decline of the U.S. dollar&#8217;s share in central bank reserves, which dropped from 71% in 2000 to 58% in 2022, the Nobel laureate explained: &#8220;This decline mainly reflects diversification into smaller currencies such as the Canadian and Australian dollars, rather than a move to serious dollar rivals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting that many people hold the view that the U.S. is weaponizing its currency through financial sanctions, Krugman further cited the Fed paper, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just about all prominent reserve currencies are issued by close U.S. allies, who have also participated in sanctions against Russia. As a result, geopolitical adversaries do not have many attractive alternatives to the U.S. dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Krugman also discussed the possibility of the Chinese yuan displacing the U.S. dollar as the world’s dominant currency. While admitting that China is a major economic power, he questioned whether Mandarin will become the dominant language of international commerce or if the yuan will become a major international currency. The Nobel Prize-winning economist believes that it is unlikely that either will become dominant in international commerce in the near future, pointing to factors such as the limited use of Mandarin as a second language and China&#8217;s capital controls.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Krugman opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The greenback’s dominance won’t last forever, because nothing does. But the hype about de-dollarization is much ado about almost nothing. For now, the dollar dominates because there just aren’t any good alternatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Multiple people have warned about the end of the U.S. dollar dominance, including Rich Dad Poor Dad author <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosakis-warnings-giant-crash-incoming-end-of-us-dollar-approaching/">Robert Kiyosaki</a>, S&amp;P Global economist <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-predicts-end-of-us-dollar-dominance-as-more-countries-de-dollarize/">Paul Gruenwald</a>, and veteran trader <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-us-dollars-time-coming-to-an-end-as-countries-seek-alternatives/">Jim Rogers</a>.</p>
<p>One currency that many expect to replace the U.S. dollar is the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">proposed BRICS currency</a> which could be backed by gold. U.S. Treasury Secretary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-brics-currency-wont-threaten-us-dollar-dominance/">Janet Yellen</a>, however, doesn&#8217;t see the proposed BRICS recurrency as a threat to the USD.</p>

<p>&#13;<br />
The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, commented on the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">ruling</a> in the SEC v. Ripple case during his remarks at the National Press Club luncheon Monday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The court ruled last Thursday, as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">described</a> by Ripple&#x2019;s chief legal officer, that &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is not a security &#x2026; sales on exchanges are not securities.

Other <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> distributions &#x2014; to developers, to charities, to employees are not securities.&#x201D; The Ripple legal counsel noted: &#x201C;The only thing the court found constitutes an investment contract is past direct <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> sales to institutional clients.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Gensler was asked: &#x201C;How does the federal court ruling last week in the Ripple case impact your stance towards digital asset regulation? Does it inject urgency in the need for federal legislation to clarify regulatory oversight of this industry?&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The SEC chief replied: &#x201C;We are pleased from that decision recognizing the importance of protecting institutional investors and the court&#x2019;s movement with regard to &#x2018;fair notice.'&#x201D; He continued:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>While disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we are still looking at it and assessing that opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
While the crypto community celebrated the Ripple-<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> ruling, there were cautionary voices. Former SEC internet enforcement chief <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-official-warns-of-reversal-in-sec-v-ripple-ruling-on-xrp-says-the-decision-resides-on-shaky-ground/">John Reed Stark</a> and lawyer <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/legal-expert-warns-victory-may-be-short-lived-for-ripple-and-xrp-says-judge-got-the-law-wrong/">Bryan Jacoutot</a> believe that the ruling rests on shaky ground, warning that the decision could be overturned.&#13;<br />

Gensler was also asked: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the next frontier for the SEC crypto enforcement push?&#x201D; The SEC chair replied: &#x201C;Our role at the SEC is again protecting the markets, the investing public, [and] the capital formation &#x2014; and ensuring compliance with the laws in the books as Congress passed them. That&#x2019;s what we are doing.&#x201D; He continued:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>So what&#x2019;s next? We are going to continue to try to bring firms that may not be in compliance into compliance without prejudging any one of them and try to ensure that we protect the investing public.</p></blockquote>

Throughout most of the year in 2023, except for a brief period of seven days in April, the TVL in defi has consistently remained below the $50 billion range. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Value Locked in Defi in 2023 Remains Above $40B but Stagnates Below $50B</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Throughout the first half of 2023, the decentralized finance (defi) landscape has exhibited a lackluster performance, with the value locked in the sector remaining relatively stagnant. Specifically, on Monday, July 17, 2023, the total value locked (TVL) stands at $44.19 billion, according to defillama.com <a href="https://defillama.com">metrics</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Within this sum, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/liquid-staking-derivatives-in-ethereum-swell-by-1-5-million-eth-in-2-months/">Lido Finance</a> commands a significant portion, securing $14.78 billion, which accounts for 33.45% of the aggregate TVL. Following Lido, prominent players in the defi realm include <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/aave-launches-gho-stablecoin-on-ethereum-network/">Aave</a> ($5.88B), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/makerdao-issues-emergency-proposal-to-address-3-1b-in-usdc-collateral-after-stablecoin-depegging-incident/">Makerdao</a> ($5.47B), Uniswap ($3.78B), and Justlend ($3.69B).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
With the exception of a notable period from April 12th to the 19th, the TVL in the defi sector has consistently hovered below the $50 billion range throughout the year. In the middle of June, the TVL hit its lowest point in 2023, standing at $40.9 billion. However, it has managed to remain above the $40 billion threshold this year.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">Ripple ruling</a>, which led to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/xrps-rise-causes-ripple-of-gains-in-crypto-economy/">substantial gains</a> in the cryptocurrency markets and smart contract tokens, the TVL in the defi sector approached the $46 billion threshold. However, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform">top smart contract token economy</a> has since relinquished most of those gains, experiencing a 2.4% decline to reach approximately $351 billion in the past 24 hours.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite the overall retracement, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SOL/">solana (SOL)</a> has managed to sustain a 21.5% increase against the U.S. dollar over the past seven days. <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA/">Cardano (ADA)</a> has also made notable strides, rising by 6.4% throughout the week.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Additionally, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/MATIC/">polygon (MATIC)</a> has defied the broader crypto market downturn, surging by 3.7% in the same period. Amid the broader market fluctuations, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> experienced a minor setback of 0.5%, while <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB/">binance coin (BNB)</a> witnessed a decline of 1.4% over the course of this week.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Notably, out of the total value locked (TVL) recorded during this period, Ethereum-based defi protocols accounted for a substantial <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">58.47%</a>, surpassing the $25 billion mark. Trailing behind Ethereum, Tron holds the second-largest blockchain in terms of TVLs, commanding 12.83% or $5.65 billion.&#13;<br />
