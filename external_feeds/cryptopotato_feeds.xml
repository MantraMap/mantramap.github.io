            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meme coin market has exploded in popularity in the past two months – and Wall Street Memes ($WSM) has emerged as one of the most talked-about projects in the space.</p>
<p>This community-centric meme token has already raised over $15m in its presale phase, highlighting the huge level of demand from retail investors.</p>
<p>With this demand showing no signs of slowing down, some are wondering if <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-coin-wall-street-memes-hits-15m-in-presale-is-it-the-next-pepe" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> could follow in the footsteps of Pepe ($PEPE) and replicate its massive returns.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Team Leverages Industry Expertise to Launch $WSM</h2>
<p>Since launching its presale phase at the end of May, Wall Street Memes has swiftly turned heads in the meme coin market.</p>
<p>Raising over $15 million in its presale, the project’s successful launch showcases the substantial community backing already in place.</p>
<p>Despite entering a saturated meme coin market, where hundreds of new tokens are launched each week, $WSM has emerged as a promising contender to become the next $PEPE.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260983" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-17-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Importantly, Wall Street Memes is being developed by the creators of the red-hot <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Bulls NFT collection</a> – which sold out in just 32 minutes in 2021.</p>
<p>Now, the creators are leveraging their expertise and understanding of the digital assets space to launch $WSM, allowing holders to gain financial exposure to the growth of the Wall Street Memes brand.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes&#8217; presale is currently in Stage 23 out of 30, with $WSM tokens on offer for just $0.0316.</p>
<p>This stage-based setup means the $WSM price will increase between stages – incentivizing would-be investors to act swiftly to obtain the lowest entry point.</p>
<h2>Hyped Community &amp; Planned Exchange Listings Fuel $WSM Demand</h2>
<p>One key factor driving demand for $WSM is the project&#8217;s already-established community of &#8220;degens.&#8221;</p>
<p>This community comprises over 1.1 million people, spread across several social media platforms.</p>
<p>For example, Wall Street Memes’ <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a> has 253,000 followers, while the official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallstbets/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Instagram page</a> boasts an audience of 534,000.</p>
<p>This backing has helped the Wall Street Memes&#8217; presale become an instant hit, with over $300,000 being invested daily.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260984" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="329" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-17-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Considering the hype around $WSM, some suspect it could be a promising prospect for major crypto exchanges, including Binance.</p>
<p>Although this is currently just speculation, <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-coin-wall-street-memes-hits-15m-in-presale-is-it-the-next-pepe" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes&#8217;</a> team has revealed that $WSM will be listed on CEXs and DEXs once the presale concludes – although the names of these exchanges are still under wraps.</p>
<p>Given that 50% of the total $WSM is being reserved for presale investors, it’s clear that early supporters are being given a significant stake in the project’s future.</p>
<p>This distribution strategy not only reinforces the community-centric approach of the creators, but also indicates their confidence in $WSM&#8217;s potential success following exchange listings.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes’ Ambitious Roadmap Attracts Influencer Attention</h2>
<p>As part of Wall Street Memes’ marketing strategy, the team has launched an airdrop campaign for presale supporters.</p>
<p>This campaign will see a whopping $50,000 worth of $WSM split between five lucky winners.</p>
<p>To enter the draw, interested parties must join the official Wall Street Memes <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4E538pzeGX" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> and carry out several straightforward tasks related to the project’s social media channels.</p>
<p>Alongside this airdrop campaign, Wall Street Memes’ team has laid out an impressive roadmap in the project’s <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260985" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="188" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14-300x94.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-14-50x16.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This roadmap details plans for high-profile influencer partnerships, global awareness campaigns, and an exclusive “gated community” for $WSM holders.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the developers even aim to reach a $1 billion market cap with $WSM in the future.</p>
<p>Although this goal may seem ambitious, Wall Street Memes’ early presale success and expert team suggest it has the potential to join the top tier of meme coins.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is already making progress towards wider recognition, attracting the attention of prominent influencers.</p>
<p>On July 12, YouTuber Michael Wrubel uploaded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZFYPQGqKog&amp;ab_channel=MichaelWrubel" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a> to his 310,000 subscribers, expressing his optimism for $WSM and highlighting that he had invested in the presale.</p>
<p>With significant interest already on display, Wall Street Memes has all the ingredients to become a major player in the meme coin space.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Solana doubled in price since June, and it seems it wants to go much higher.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $26</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $33</strong></p>
<h2>Uptrend Intact</h2>
<p>The impressive performance by Solana continued in July, and a major breakout took place last Friday when the price moved above $26 and almost reached $33, which is the current resistance. SOL has turned the $26 level into support, and so long as this level holds, this cryptocurrency has a clear path higher.</p>

<h2>Buying Volume Exploded</h2>
<p>Last week&#8217;s buy pressure exceeded any expectation with levels not seen since the start of 2023. This impressive interest from buyers rapidly translated into a higher price. The volume has decreased somewhat compared to last week, but buyers continue to be present.</p>
<figure id="attachment_260956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260956" style="width: 1826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-260956" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43.png" alt="SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43" width="1826" height="845" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43.png 1826w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-1024x474.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-768x355.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-1536x711.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-43-50x23.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1826px) 100vw, 1826px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-260956" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. RSI is Overbought</h2>
<p>The daily RSI is giving a clear signal that Solana may have reached a local top right now after hitting 82 points. This means a pullback is likely on lower timeframes, and buyers have to do their best to stop sellers at the key support.</p>
<figure id="attachment_260957" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260957" style="width: 1826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-260957" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05.png" alt="SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05" width="1826" height="902" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05.png 1826w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-1024x506.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-768x379.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-1536x759.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-17_13-18-05-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1826px) 100vw, 1826px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-260957" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SOL is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SOL Price</h2>
<p>The price action remains bullish for Solana, and momentum is favoring buyers. Nevertheless, a short-lived pullback could take place before the price attempts to break the key resistance at $33. If, for any reason, the support at $26 fails, then the pullback may last longer than initially expected.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Now that the court has partly cleared Ripple’s name, the company behind XRP is expecting business to pick up.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple that had been raging for 3 years was finally settled, at least partially.</p>
<p>Although Judge Analisa Torres ruled that some primary sales of XRP should have been registered as securities offerings, the secondary sale of the asset does not count as unlicensed securities.</p>
<h2>Open for Business Again</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">case</a> may yet go to trial, and financial penalties for the primary sales of XRP may still occur. However, the ruling cleared Ripple’s name as far as using XRP to facilitate money transfers, which in the past not only made potential customers cautious against engaging with the company – it also lost them its biggest customer, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-and-moneygram-part-ways-amid-sec-litigation-while-xrp-eyes-0-50/" data-wpel-link="internal">Moneygram</a>.</p>
<p>Brad Garlinghouse – Ripple’s CEO – previously stated that the court’s decision will allow the firm to pursue new moneymaking avenues again.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse says that a federal court&#8217;s decision means that its crypto token XRP “is not a security,” giving the digital-payments company more freedom to pursue various business opportunities <a href="https://t.co/lpNFuakr6K" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/lpNFuakr6K</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZKmb1nt4Ac" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ZKmb1nt4Ac</a></p>
<p>— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1679931605165694977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Furthermore, Garlinghouse believes the outcome of this landmark case will be beneficial for the entire industry, not just Ripple.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the SEC, it is really an overreach to suggest, as the Chair has said many times, that basically, everything in the crypto space is a security. Well, you now have a judge who is very clearly saying that is just not true and very clearly saying XRP is not a security on exchanges and all these different use cases, which I think helps the whole industry, for sure.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Ripple to Explore Deals Regarding Cross-Border Transactions</h2>
<p>Now that the dust has settled, Stu Alderoty, Ripple’s general counsel, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the company will begin talks with new potential clients starting in the third quarter, which is only 2 weeks away.</p>
<p>According to Alderoty, Ripple will seek to enter deals with firms in the American banking sector. Chief among target customers are banks and payment processors who do business abroad, as Ripple’s XRP token eliminates the need for pre-funded banks on the receiving end.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think we’re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business. […] Hopefully, this quarter will generate a lot of conversations in the United States with customers, and hopefully some of those conversations will actually turn into real business.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although most of Ripple’s revenue is reportedly generated outside of the U.S., this was more a matter of necessity due to the legal troubles. Now that those have largely been done away with, Ripple is looking to pivot strongly towards U.S. business partners yet again.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The pricing structure for .eth domains on Unstoppable will remain consistent with that of the ENS website with optional add-on services such as the Vault feature and auto-renewal. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web3 domain provider Unstoppable Domains is extending support to .eth domains enabling users to purchase via the official website. Unstoppable Domains typically offer domain endings such as .crypto, .blockchain, .nft, etc, while the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the only place Ethereum enthusiasts have been able to purchase the .eth domain names.</p>
<p>The addition of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) based .eth domains to the Unstoppable website aligns with its broader plans to become the first &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for Web3 domains with support for all leading naming systems and blockchains.</p>
<h2>Unstoppable Domains&#8217; New Functionality</h2>
<p>According to the official press release shared with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the launch will allow anyone to natively buy .eth domains via Unstoppable for the first time. New functionalities such as will be incorporated to attract and engage a fresh audience to .eth.</p>
<p>For one, users can access the optional Unstoppable Vault &#8211; Domain Vault &#8211; to secure their .eth or other Web3 domains within a private vault managed by Unstoppable. This feature enables users to acquire .eth domains without the immediate need to connect them to a crypto wallet.</p>
<p>Besides offering an added layer of security, the domains stored in the vault are entirely owned by the users themselves and not by Unstoppable, which can be easily transferred to a self-custodial wallet whenever desired.</p>
<p>To address the challenge of remembering on-chain Ethereum renewals and preventing the accidental loss of .eth domains, Unstoppable will also introduce an optional auto-renewal feature specifically for .eth domains. This functionality will let users choose the duration of renewal, with each auto-renewal priced at $4 per renewal period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform will also offer new options for buying.eth domains, including credit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay, along with Bitcoin and 11 other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In an exclusive statement, Unstoppable Domains&#8217; COO Sandy Carter said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The ultimate mission of Unstoppable Domain is to become the first universal “one-stop shop” for every user’s web3 domain and digital identity-related needs. To achieve this goal, we are constantly striving to offer support for all leading naming systems and blockchains, and the recent addition of .eth functionality was a big step in this direction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a bid to ensure no naming collisions, every .eth domain acquired from Unstoppable&#8217;s website will be registered through the ENS smart contract with the same full functionality as other .eth domains.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Unstoppable domains will enable users to manage .eth domains, including setting crypto addresses, managing on-chain profile data, and transferring .eth domains.</p>
<p>The development comes more than a year after the platform <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/web3-registrar-unstoppable-domains-secures-65-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> closing $65 million in Series A funding, making it a unicorn. The capital infusion was said to have been deployed to fuel product innovation and forge partnerships in the Web3 space.</p>
<h2>Addressing Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite being a novel technological advancement, the Web3 domain sector initially faced a lack of adoption. While the tides are indeed turning, challenges still persist.</p>
<p>To that extent, Carter believes that blockchain-based platforms still require a higher tech acumen than major centralized services, intentionally designed to be as accessible as possible even as the former offers countless innovative features that were &#8220;simply untenable&#8221; just a few years ago.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To address these issues, Unstoppable Domains and other web3-native companies focus on making the web3 ecosystem user-friendly and easy to understand, allowing users to easily navigate web3 via decentralized domains and self-owned digital identities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[1inch Network's native token has soared 45% daily and 90% weekly. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin continues to trade sideways after last week&#8217;s enhanced volatility and has not made a major move for a third consecutive day.</p>
<p>Most altcoins are also relatively quiet, with XRP surging the most from the larger caps, while BNB has retraced by over 2%.</p>
<h2>BTC Gets Boring</h2>
<p>The last few business days of last week were quite eventful for the entire crypto space. This came as Judge Analisa Torres, president over the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled in favor</a> of the blockchain project in regard to its XRP sales. This has a profound and immediate effect on all assets, including bitcoin.</p>
<p>The primary cryptocurrency shot up by $1,500 to a 13-month peak at over $31,800 (on Bitstamp). However, it failed to keep its momentum going and retraced by several hundred dollars almost immediately.</p>
<p>More violent moments <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-rejected-at-31k-again-ripple-xrp-dumps-8-daily-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">followed</a> on Friday when BTC dumped to just under $30,000. The bulls finally managed to intervene and pushed the asset to around $30,300 by Saturday. Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/weekend-watch-bitcoin-btc-defends-30k-cardano-ada-drops-4-daily/" data-wpel-link="internal">stalled</a> for the next 48 hours and has not made a move since.</p>
<p>As such, its market capitalization remained at $590 billion, and its dominance over the altcoins is still at 48.5%.</p>

<h2>1INCH Steals the Show</h2>
<p>Needless to say, XRP was the most significant gainer after Ripple&#8217;s win over the SEC. The asset almost doubled in value within the first 24 hours after the ruling and neared $1. However, it failed there and retraced to $0.7 yesterday. It has bounced off and added 4.5% in a day now and trades at $0.75.</p>
<p>In contrast, BNB, which was outplaced by XRP, is down by 2.3% and struggles to remain above $240. SOL, ADA, MATIC, LTC, AVAX, and BCH are also slightly in the red from the larger-cap alts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Uniswap, Arbitrum, and Aptos have all jumped by between 4-5% in a day.</p>
<p>The best performer from the top 100 alts, though, is 1inch Network&#8217;s native asset. 1INCH has soared by 45% in a day and over 90% weekly and sits well above $0.5.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has seen a minor increase and stands above $1.220 trillion on CMC.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Seychelles, Seychelles, July 17th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">As part of Flipster&#8217;s (formerly AQX) name launch, the business today announced an additional 1,500,000 USD worth of bonus rewards to encourage new users to join and trade on their exchange. Until the rewards are fully distributed, the futures exchange will run at least one campaign per week to encourage new users to signup and trade derivatives on the Flipster platform. Under the old name the exchange has already made available more than 400,000USDT worth bonus in past campaigns.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The first promotion in the series kicked off on the 17th of July, 2023 (running for seven days). A massive 110,000 USDT in bonuses has been allocated. 10,000 USDT to reward new users when completing identity verification with a 10 USDT Bonus. The remaining 100,000 USDT bonus is to incentivise and reward high volume traders that give the platform a chance. The top performer by trading volume will be rewarded with 10,000 USDT in Bonus at the end of the weekly campaign.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Flipster has reimagined futures trading with a mobile-first approach to appeal to casual crypto traders with limited experience in derivatives trading (or, as they say, Flipping).</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The method is to specialize in derivatives trading, stripping back the app experience to make it faster to learn and easier to use. Novice traders can open, close and monitor positions from any location. Potentially meaning some users may make more money on the bus to work, than from their days Labor. Beyond ease of use, the portable experience makes trading fun and feels less like a technical task.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The flip to a mobile-first approach came after initially having a web experience similar to other futures exchanges. The traditional UI for futures trading has a steep learning curve and is considerably more technical, which strongly contrasts with the UI that most contemporary apps users have become familiar with. The data concluded that users new to derivatives were not attracted to this experience as it had been built for experienced traders. The Flipster team discovered a few alternative UIs for future trading and none that have successfully been created to onboard new users to crypto futures trading at scale.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">While the focus is on simplicity, Flipster has features that will spark the interest of experienced traders as well. The exchange regularly adds new perpetual swap contracts, and as of today, over 120 assets can be traded with leverage, making Flipster a competitive exchange for traders to consider. Amongst their assets are tokens not found for futures on other exchanges and some even with low visibility in spot markets.</p>
<blockquote><p>CEO Yongjin Kim said, &#8220;The team has been working very hard on bringing this new vision for futures trading to life, and now is the right time to incentivise users to trade with us. Once users start trading on our platform, they will be coming back again and again. Rather than just copying what every other exchange has done, we are doing something fresh, and I believe the market is ready for some injection of new ideas. To our existing users, I want to thank you for being with us, and to the new guys coming in now, Welcome&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[DeFi lending protocol Aave launched its long-awaited stablecoin GHO to mainnet. Yet, it enters an already crowded stablecoin market dominated by one player.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, the Aave DAO successfully launched the GHO stablecoin on the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
<p>The dollar-pegged stablecoin was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/aave-proposes-to-launch-an-usd-pegged-stablecoin-called-gho/" data-wpel-link="internal">proposed</a> in July 2022 as a way to allow users to mint GHO by supplying crypto collateral to Aave v3 in a similar system to MakerDAO’s DAI.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Aave DAO has successfully launched <a href="https://twitter.com/GHOAave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@GHOAave</a> on the Ethereum Mainnet.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>$2.2 Million GHO Minted</h2>
<p>The team said GHO was slightly different from other stablecoins because repaid interest on it is redirected to the Aave DAO treasury, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This supports the sustainability of the protocol and the ongoing development of new features.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It added that AAVE token stakers would get a discount for minting GHO. According to the official website, 2.2 million have already been minted on Ethereum. However, at the time of writing, the stablecoin was trading just below its peg at $0.992, according to CoinGecko.</p>
<p>Aave explained that minting GHO requires “Facilitators” that are approved and governed by Aave Governance. “Governance-approved facilitators will be able to mint up to a specified amount of GHO agreed upon by the DAO,” it added.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the multi-collateral token can be minted with any collateral on the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/aave-token-holders-vote-on-proposal-seeking-conversion-of-1-6k-eth-from-protocols-treasury/" data-wpel-link="internal">Aave</a> v3 protocol.</p>
<p>Aave’s native token of the same name was trading flat on the day at $77.51 but has gained 10% over the past week.</p>
<p>GHO is entering an already crowded stablecoin market, with one player commanding the lion’s share of it.</p>
<h2>Stablecoin Ecosystem Outlook</h2>
<p>The stablecoin market is currently worth around $128 billion, which represents about 10% of the total crypto market capitalization.</p>
<p>Tether is the dominant player with a 65% market share and $83.7 billion USDT in circulation. Its supply has grown by 27% since the beginning of 2023 as its U.S. treasury collateral has made a steady income.</p>

<p>Conversely, rival stablecoin issuer Circle has seen its supply of USDC decline by 38% over the same period as regulatory pressure in the United States mounts.</p>
<p>USDC has a market share of 21%, with $27.3 billion in circulation. The third largest stablecoin in the market is DAI, with $4.3 billion.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Guilds has attracted more than 230 beta testers since June 29, with traders earning nearly $330,000 in PnL last week.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX launched a dedicated space where traders can actively engage with each other. The new solution, dubbed Guilds, is currently in beta (testing) phase.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The upcoming development could be considered a breath of fresh air for the company that went through some serious setbacks during the crypto winter. It dismissed a chunk of its employees last year while its CEO Alexander Höptner stepped down.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Enter Guilds</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a document seen by <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the social trading option will be available to all BitMEX users. Guilds will allow them to exchange ideas, talk about trading strategies, and share insights. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Each Guild will consist of a leader who will take responsibility for customizing and defining its identity. Other customers can join once the feature is established and discuss in a private chat room integrated into the trading UI.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Any verified BitMEX user with at least 10,000 BMEX staked can become a leader, while each Guild can host up to 49 members.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stephan Lutz &#8211; CEO and Group CFO of BitMEX &#8211; stated that Guilds aims to &#8220;drive collaboration&#8221; amongst the platform&#8217;s community and &#8220;stands as a testament to our commitment to helping our traders thrive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He noted the progress made by leading companies in the ETF field, saying BitMEX must comply with the high expectations in the current crypto industry:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As industry veterans, we understand the expectations and unique requirements of professional traders, especially during times when more Wall Street players enter the space and ETF applications are being made more accessible by institutions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The initial success of BitMEX&#8217;s latest offering gives me the confidence in the direction we are taking with product development and in our ability to empower and support traders through our comprehensive ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The feature (introduced at the end of June) has already amassed over 230 beta testers, with traders earning approximately $330,000 in PnL last week. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last Year&#8217;s Turbulence</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The bear market in 2022 harmed the operations of BitMEX, which saw its previous CEO Alexander Höptner </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitmex-ceo-alexander-hoptner-steps-down-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">resigning</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> from his post.

			            <description><![CDATA[The men who stole investor funds to live like millionaires will most likely spend some years behind bars.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American authorities have reportedly arrested Brandon Austin and his father, Eugene &#8220;Hugh&#8221; Austin, over accusations that they run a massive crypto fraud, embezzling over $10 million from investors.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brandon, who has already pleaded guilty, will hear his sentence on September 6.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conning Investors to Fund a Lavish Lifestyle</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to recent <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/father-son-duo-hugh-and-brandon-austin-accused-of-scamming-dollar10-million-in-crypto" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">coverage</a>, federal agents detained the 27-year-old Brandon Austin in April and his dad on July 5. US Attorney Damian Williams said the duo &#8220;victimized both sophisticated and novice cryptocurrency investors alike out of millions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specifically, the family encouraged people to purchase cryptocurrencies through them by promising great returns. However, they swindled every cent and used the money for their own benefit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The officials claimed the wrongdoers stayed in posh hotels, bought luxurious cars, and visited expensive restaurants. They also gifted funds to their loved ones via wire transfers. Brandon sent $50,000 to the mother of his children and $32,000 to his girlfriend, while Hugh handed $10,000 to his dad and lover. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The duo went further, organizing glamorous trips to New York, Miami, and Europe, inviting investors as special guests who would later understand that those parties were thrown so the Austin family could amass new victims. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Each investor parted with a different sum, with one losing over $500,000. At one point, they got angry with Hugh, urging him to keep his promise and send him the assets and return on the investment. The alleged criminal replied plainly:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I w call u (sic) in about 25 minutes. Thanks, Hugh.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brandon has pleaded guilty, agreeing to forfeit $3.4 million and to pay $2 million in restitution. The federal agents also confiscated a 2022 E-Pace P250 Jaguar that was said to be worth over $60,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The two men face up to 20 years in prison on charges like money laundering and wire fraud. The magistrates are expected to decide Brandon&#8217;s punishment on September 6.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Mini Version of OneCoin?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The aforementioned case looks similar to one of the biggest frauds in the history of crypto &#8211; OneCoin. The Ponzi scheme, orchestrated by Ruja Ignatova (a.k.a. &#8220;The Cryptoqueen&#8221;), ran between 2014 and 2016, draining approximately $4 billion from investors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The head of the scam mysteriously disappeared shortly after the authorities launched an investigation against OneCoin. Ignatova was last spotted in Athens, Greece, in 2017, and her whereabouts have been the subject of conspiracy theories from that moment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some believe she is hiding on a luxurious yacht in the Mediterranean Sea, away from the coast (where law enforcement agencies are unauthorized to arrest her).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other sources have </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/was-fbis-most-wanted-cryptoqueen-brutally-murdered-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">hinted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that Ignatova might have been brutally murdered in 2019 after a Bulgarian drug lord got burned from investing in her scheme. </span></p>
