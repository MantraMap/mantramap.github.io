<li dir="ltr"><strong>DeFi continues to attract more users with strong products and services across segments such as decentralised exchanges, lending protocols and staking.</strong></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Users across the sector increased by 31% quarter on quarter in 2022, although that pales compared with the 525% spike seen in 2021.</strong></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Latest estimates for total DeFi users suggest the number will surpass 5.5 million in Q4, 2022.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Decentralised finance, or <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/defi/">DeFi</a>, remains big, though not with the same numbers as seen a year ago. In 2021, user numbers skyrocketed 545% as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a> boomed on the back of a staggering bull run.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While DeFi statistics for 2022 show a decline in user growth amid the year-long crypto winter, the sector still witnessed a 31% increase in users. The quarter on quarter increase in users was captured in the <a href="https://capital.hashkey.com/en/insights-and-research/2022-defi-ecosystem-landscape-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest report</a> on DeFi growth by HashKey Capital.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">DeFi users have surpassed 5 million</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As HashKey Capital analysts highlighted in their recent report, DeFi is not just eating into the traditional finance, or TradFi market, but it&rsquo;s also curving its own new market. The trend relates to what is a &ldquo;blue ocean market,&rdquo; the report noted, with the DeFi sector&rsquo;s new and innovative services capturing demand that&rsquo;s adding to the steady growth in users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A drop in total value locked (TVL) &ndash; it is now below $40 billion as per <a href="https://defillama.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DeFiLlama</a>, still doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story of decentralised finance in the past one year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, user wallets across DeFi segments such as decentralised exchanges (DEXs), lending, collateralized debt positions (CDPs), bridges, staking and yield, surpassed 5 million in the third quarter of 2022. It is estimated DeFi users will number more than 5.5 million by the end of Q4, 2022, with a growth projection of 8% during the quarter.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Projects use crypto winter to build and improve</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A look at market prices shows that most assets in the space have plummeted in value and the DeFi index has shrunk by 76%, compared with a 65% decline for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. But despite this, projects have used the crypto winter to build and improve their products, attracting more users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The sector has also seen continued investment from venture capitals. For example, the first half of 2022 saw VC invest more than $14 billion across 725 projects in the crypto space. Many of these were DeFi-focused.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">OKT token rose by double digits last week</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency has been boosted by new partnerships</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">OKT is correcting but remains on an uptrend</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">OKT, the cryptocurrency native to the OKX Chain, made headlines last week. The cryptocurrency rose by double digits to end the week at $27 after trading at just $17 seven days earlier. OKT has since cooled and traded at $22 as of press time. A spot technical check shows that the token has been on an uptrend for more than a month. What has been boosting the price?</p>
<p dir="ltr">OKX is a Cosmos IBC-linked blockchain. It is EVM-compatible and focuses on true interoperability for high performance. The blockchain dubs itself the next-gen platform for decentralised applications. OKX Chain&rsquo;s Web3 wallet allows users to manage their portfolio of NFTs and tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">OKT&rsquo;s gains come on the back of positive&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrency news</u></a> of the OKX Chain. The blockchain announced partnerships with social gaming platform Candy Club, DEX network Lovely Swap, and meme asset Chihuahua Chain. The other firm in the latest wave of collaborations was market analytics firm Nansen. The collaborations increase the utility of OKT since the cryptocurrency will be employed in a number of related use cases. Investors have been taking note and buying the little-known token.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>OKT corrects after meeting resistance at $27</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/19/1671473010897-5c571bb4-91be-43df-95b8-9076b8cc9974.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="314"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OKTUSDT/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>OKT/USDT Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A technical outlook shows OKT on a clear uptrend but currently correcting. The moving averages are bullish for the cryptocurrency and provide support. The RSI hit the overbought levels but shows a correction underway. The reading is still above the midpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will OKT continue rising?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The future price action for OKT will depend on how the key collaborations will continue to drive it. It should be remembered that the broader market sentiment is bearish. So, OKT should be looked at with the bearish sentiment in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For investors looking to&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/where-to-buy-okexchain-coin-okt-surges-50/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buy OKT,</u></a> the level around $19 should be watched. The formation of bullish signals at the level could attract buyers and push the price higher again.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chainlink traded at $6 on Monday, stabilising at the crucial support</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">LINK buyers have always defended $6 against the onslaught of bears</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">LINK could fall further if a break in the crucial support happens</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The start of&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/chainlink/what-is-chainlink/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chainlink</u></a> staking ignited an interest in the native token LINK. The cryptocurrency was on an uptrend in the last two weeks of November, ahead of the crucial milestone in early December. But as the early access kicked off, LINK has failed to register gains. Instead, the token has succumbed to the bear market. Bulls are battling $6, as the price now faces a brutal collapse if bears win. But will this happen?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Chainlink price outlook and analysis</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">$6 is an important price level for Chainlink. Past price action shows that bulls have defended this crucial level since June. The level has been tested severally, offering clues that LINK could overcome a further slump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, there is no price action signal to support a recovery up to this point. From the daily chart below, multiple inside bars are forming at the crucial level, underlying indecision in the market. Since this happens in a bear market, it signals the exit of sellers or the entry of buyers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/19/1671472498399-2ad45363-0c69-4931-89a6-6b121a57fd9c.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="315"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LINKUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>LINK/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From a technical outlook, LINK trades below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. The moving averages have almost been flat, indicating that LINK is better considered to be in an extended consolidation. The cryptocurrency is recovering slightly, although the RSI signals that bears remain in control.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will Chainlink recover?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The next price action will shape the direction of Chainlink.&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/chainlink/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>LINK price</u></a> has stabilised at $6, but the bear pressure is still on. If the cryptocurrency loses this support, a lower price of around $5.4 will remain in sight.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Binance coin recovered slightly on Monday after a losing streak</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Crypto analyst says Binance could collapse similarly to Terra Luna</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency is under pressure due to concerns about centralised exchanges</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/what-is-binance-coin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Binance</u></a> (BNB/USD) traded up marginally on Monday, overcoming an accelerated selloff the past week. The selloff has been sparked by concerns of market turmoil for the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Delphi Digital, a crypto insights firm, Binance recorded over $5 billion in crypto outflows on December 13th&nbsp;and 14th. The outflows happened amid concerns about the insolvency of Binance following the collapse of FTX. Binance produced its proof of reserves to assure its stability, but this didn&rsquo;t calm the markets. As CoinJournal&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/will-this-worrying-binances-proof-of-reserves-crash-bnb-further/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>, auditor Mazars faulted the reserves, and this caused a further confidence crisis. A crypto analyst now thinks Binance could head the LUNA direction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remember the famous Terra Luna crash? Perhaps it could sound too alarming to think Binance could have a similar fate. But pseudonymous crypto analyst Smart Contracter says the multi-year trend of BNB versus BTC mirrors that of Terra Luna. Using the Elliott Wave theory, the analyst says BNB/BTC has completed Elliot&rsquo;s five-wave cycle. He says this is the same price action LUNA printed before crashing in May. Smart Contracter says BNB is set for a reversal at $0.007378 BTC, coinciding with the 61.8% Fib level. The analyst says BNB could fall to $80-$100 next.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BNB recovering above the 23.6% Fib level amid bear pressure</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/19/1671472074610-c4959b95-c626-479c-92b9-94e3ee58f1e8.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="314"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">We apply the Fibonacci retracement levels, with the June bottom as the swing low and the November top as the swing high. From the Fib levels, BNB lost dynamic support at 78.6%, 61.8%, 50%, 38.2%, and 23.6% Fib levels. The latest recoveries have pushed the price above the 23.6% Fib level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, BNB should be considered bearish as long as the price remains subdued by $266, support-turned-resistance.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for BNB?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">BNB could remain under bear pressure as long as negative&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrency news</u></a> emerges. In a bear scenario, BNB stares at $200. The price has to move above $266 to consider the upsides possible.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shiba Inu recovered 1.21% on Monday after a bearish move</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The developers teased a &ldquo;countdown,&rdquo; as some fans speculate the Shibarium update</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">SHIB could touch the June lows next</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/what-is-shiba-inu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Inu</u></a> (SHIB/USD) gained 1.21% on Monday to trade at $0.0000087. The token is slightly recovering from a bottom price of $0.0000080 over the weekend. This is an important zone for SHIB, or rather, the cryptocurrency could touch a demand zone that was crucial to bulls in the past.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A historical price movement of SHIB shows that $0.0000072 is a potential demand zone for SHIB. At the height of a bear market earlier this year, SHIB settled at this zone in June before embarking on a strong recovery. The gains took SHIB to a high of $0.0000179 in August before another bear cycle followed. Amid the intraday gains, this is the next level to watch for SHIB.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu community is guessing about the Shibarium beta test. This was after a weekend tweet teased users with a &ldquo;special countdown.&rdquo; The countdown was still running down at 7 hours and 48 minutes as of press time. It is unclear what this countdown is all about, but users started to speculate on the Shibarium update. Others quashed it as a distraction to unimportant partnerships and hire.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the &ldquo;countdown&rdquo; unfolds, Shiba Inu fans will keep their hands crossed that something important will pop up. Probably, this could coincide with reports that SHIB is alongside BTC and ETH, the most watched cryptocurrencies on Binance. But technical indicators show a potential further slump.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SHIB recovers slightly from an oversold level near the June lows</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/19/1671469206161-3ac5cfb3-fbe1-4ff0-920e-7c7f702b6362.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="310"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SHIB/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">On the daily chart, SHIB is on a slight upside after touching a level slightly above the June lows of $0.0000072. The trend is still bearish, and a potential decline to June&rsquo;s bottom could be on the card. The RSI reading is still below the midpoint, signalling a bear control.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>When will SHIB become bullish?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The $0.0000072 could attract buyers again if bulls fail to capitalise on the current&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/#:~:text=One%20Shiba%20Inu%20Token%20is,using%20our%20historical%20price%20data." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SHIB price&nbsp;</u></a>recovery. This is the level to watch for bullish reversal signals.</p>

The L2 solutions scale applications and handle transactions off Ethereum. In doing so, they raise the transaction&rsquo;s throughput and cut the gas fees. But do you know which tokens of Ethereum L2 solutions to buy next year? Read on:</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Polygon (MATIC)</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/polygon/what-is-polygon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Polygon</u></a> is easily the most popular L2 scaling solution on Ethereum. Polygon is already tapped by many projects, including Sushiswap, and continues to attract firms building into the Web3 and metaverse. Projects enter Ethereum through Polygon due to its highly scalable and fast transactions. There are over 7,000 transactions per second on a single sidechain on Polygon&rsquo;s internal testnet. This is significantly higher than 14 TPS on Ethereum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the growing popularity of Polygon, investing in its native token, MATIC, makes a lot of sense. The cryptocurrency trades at $0.9, compared to its all-time high of nearly $3.0 last year. The cryptocurrency has been on a slow recovery, offering a glimpse of its former self that investors could love. MATIC is currently ranked #10 on CoinMarketCap with a value of $7.89 billion.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Cardano has lost 13% in seven days to hit a new bottom for the year</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The blockchain continues to attract new projects as Plutus scripts near 5,000</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ADA is still very bearish, and a lower price is possible towards year-end</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Barely two weeks to the end of the year,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/#:~:text=One%20Cardano%20is%20currently%20worth,45%3A00%20GMT%2D8." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cardano price</u></a> (ADA/USD) shows no signs of resuscitating. Trading at just $0.264, ADA is extending its losing streak in the year, having lost 13% for the week. The level is now a new low for the cryptocurrency. But as speculators continue to wane, Cardano enthusiasts should be happy for a new milestone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Cardano&rsquo;s weekly data, the number of smart contracts on the platform is closing to the 5,000 mark. The contracts hit 4,855 in the past one week after increasing by another 400. The total projects launched on Cardano now stand at 111 after the blockchain added 3 more members.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rising projects on Cardano show that its September Vasil upgrade continues to bear fruits. But even as this milestone pays off, Cardano&rsquo;s bear market is not over yet.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>ADA trapped in a descending channel amid bear indicators</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/19/1671465167621-d2de0eb9-8273-4c97-934d-35919389a190.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="308"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ADA/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From the technical outlook, ADA is still trapped in a descending channel. The cryptocurrency trades at the bottom of the channel with weak momentum. From the previous price action, ADA has jumped any time it hits the bottom of the channel. We may see slight price appreciation before the cryptocurrency claims another potential low.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The technical indicators are bearish. The MACD has moved further into the bear zone, with the indicator shifting below the signal line. The volume indicator is more on the sell than the buy side, suggesting a further bear market.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What to do next for ADA?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Although there is an increase in activity on the Cardano blockchain, it is better to keep off&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying ADA</u></a> now. The bear market could stay longer, and ADA could claim a new low in the year based on the price action. Investors would be better off buying from a confirmed bullish reversal signal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Lima upgrade is the 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade on the Tezos protocol.</li>
<li>Tezos is referred to as the &ldquo;self-amending blockchain&rdquo; for its ability to seamlessly upgrade using its on-chain governance.</li>
<li>Lima upgrade reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts among other benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tezos, one of the original Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, has activated its 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade, the Lima upgrade, which was voted upon and approved by the Tezos community. The new upgrade which introduces several new features also reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts.</p>
<p>Lima marks the fourth protocol upgrade in 2022 and the 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade since the Tezos protocol was unveiled. Tezos is known for its ability to seamlessly upgrade through its on-chain governances which allows the protocol participants to propose and vote on upgrades and changes that they believe are important for the protocol.</p>
<h2>Key improvements introduced by Lima upgrade</h2>
<p>The Lima upgrade introduces several key improvements to Tezos functionality including faster processing speeds, the introduction of consensus keys, and improvements to tickets.</p>
<p>The Lima upgrade continues with the &lsquo;Pipelining validation project&rsquo; that speeds up the processing of blocks and operations on Tezos by separating validation processes from application processes. A new block on Tezos is first validated before being forwarded to other peers; a feature that speeds up block propagation on the network and reduces the block time to 15 seconds and increases the overall throughput for the blockchain.</p>
<p>The consensus keys will allow validators (known as bakers in Tezos) to designate a special key for signing blocks and consensus operations. This feature prevents backers from losing delegators due to a change in setup or the need to coordinate with delegators off-chain to move them to a new address.</p>
<p>Tickets are a type of data unique to Tezos smart contracts and a great foundation for the scalable solutions that have allowed for many use cases including tokenization, authentication, and voting among others. Lima upgrade in particular deprecates the creation, storage and transfer of zero-amount tickets thus reducing the risk of bugs in smart contracts.</p>
<p>In addition to the improvements to the current Layer 1 Tezos solutions, the Lima upgrade also finalizes the development work towards Smart Rollups, which is an innovative Layer 2 scaling solution that is expected to debut in the subsequent Tezos upgrade proposal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The main purpose is maximizing the value returned to clients &nbsp;</li>
<li>Voyager&rsquo;s claims against Three Arrows Capital are still with the bankruptcy estate</li>
<li>Binance.US will make a $10 million deposit in good faith reimburse Voyager up to $15 million </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Voyager Digital LLC, the operating unit of Voyager Digital Ltd., has chosen US exchange BAM Trading Services Inc.&rsquo;s bid (operating as Binance.US) as the best and highest for its assets after reviewing strategic options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main purpose is maximizing the value returned to clients and creditors as soon as possible, CoinJournal learned from <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voyager-announces-agreement-for-binanceus-to-acquire-its-assets-301706065.html">a press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance.US is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Palo Alto, CA. It has a licensing agreement with Binance.com, but is an independent legal entity.</p>
<h2>Bid was worth just over a billion</h2>
<p>The bid from Binance.US is valued at around $1.022 billion. It consists of the to-be-set fair market value of Voyager&rsquo;s crypto portfolio, valued at $1.002 billion at current market prices, plus an additional consideration equivalent to an incremental value of $20 million.</p>
<p>Voyager&rsquo;s claims against Three Arrows Capital are still with the bankruptcy estate. The administrators will distribute any future recovery of claims to the estate&rsquo;s creditors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per platform capabilities and disbursements decided on by the court, the Binance.US bid intends to return crypto to clients in kind. Voyager <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/voyager-hasnt-transferred-any-assets-to-ftx-ucc/">planned to transfer assets to FTX</a>, but that didn&rsquo;t materialize.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Binance to reimburse Voyager for up to $15m</h2>
<p>Binance.US will make a $10 million deposit in good faith reimburse Voyager up to $15 million for certain expenses. If the deal isn&rsquo;t closed by April 18 next year (with the possibility of a one-month extension), Voyager may move to return value at once.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A series of high-profile bankruptcies&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A bankruptcy court has to allow Voyager Digital LLC to enter into the asset purchase agreement with Binance.US. The respective hearing has been scheduled on January 5, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sale to Binance.US will be concluded pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan, which will be subject to a number of habitual closing terms, including a creditor vote. Voyager&rsquo;s is one of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/blockfi-is-bankrupt-where-did-it-all-go-wrong/">a series of bankruptcies of leading crypto platforms</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance.US and Voyager will cooperate to close the deal as soon as possible after the bankruptcy court approves the chapter 11 plan. This purchase agreement follows Voyager&rsquo;s entry into a voluntary restructuring process targeting the return of maximum value to customers on July 5, 2022.&nbsp;</p>
