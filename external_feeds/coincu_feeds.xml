<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Steadefi strategic leverage project was attacked with an estimated $1.1 million in damage.</em></li>



<li><em>Currently, all funds are at risk as an attacker has taken possession of a wallet that implements the protocol.</em></li>



<li><em>The project calls for the hacker to return the money to receive the 10% bonus, otherwise, that part will go to the tracker, and the hacker will face a lawsuit.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Steadefi, an automated earnings leverage strategy platform, said on Twitter that the protocol was hacked, and all funds are now at risk. According to security company CertiK Alert&#8217;s monitoring, Steadefi <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1688668943622230016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has lost</a> about $1.1 million in this incident.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-404.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-404-1024x538.png" alt="Steadefi Strategic Leveraged Vault Mine Was Mined $1.1 Million, All Funds At Risk" class="wp-image-208902" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-404-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-404-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-404-768x404.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-404-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-404-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-404.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Steadefi Strategic Leveraged Vault Mine Was Mined $1.1 Million, All Funds At Risk 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Steadefi briefly updated the specific situation regarding the hack in another tweet. It said that the wallet that implements the protocol (also the owner of all the vaults in the protocol) had been compromised.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A brief overview of the exploit:<br><br>The attack vector is that our protocol deployer wallet &#8212; which is also the owner of all vaults in the protocol &#8212; has been compromised.  <br><br>The exploiter had transferred ownership of all the vaults (lending and strategy) to a wallet they control,â€¦</p>&mdash; Steadefi <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f53a.png" alt="ðŸ”º" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f499.png" alt="ðŸ’™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="ðŸ”¶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@steadefi) <a href="https://twitter.com/steadefi/status/1688638572608552960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>All funds are in jeopardy because the attacker has taken ownership of all the vaults (loans and policies) transferred to a wallet they control and proceeds to perform many actions only for holders, such as allowing any wallet that can borrow any available funds from the loan vault to be swapped for ETH and bridged to Ethereum.</p>



<p>The depositor&#8217;s vault has not been exhausted (as of now) because the attacker has no sole owner function to withdraw the deposit from the vault. If a user deposits funds into the strategic vault, withdrawals are still made of the available assets (assuming the attacker does not pause the vault). The attacker also paused the liquidity mining contract, which means that if you (and most people) deposit svtoken or ibtoken into the farm, you won&#8217;t be able to withdraw them either, even though the attacker public can&#8217;t extract them either.</p>



<p>Although the protocol did not reveal the exact damage, they did send a message to the attacker&#8217;s wallet address to negotiate. Steadefi hopes to cooperate with the participation. The parties involved in the exploit will discuss the bounty issue and offer a 10% reward for the stolen funds.</p>



<p>Steadefi threatens that if the attacker returns 90% of the funds by August 10 at 08:00 UTC, the protocol will extend the bounty to the public, and offer the complete 10% to the identifiable person your character in a way that leads to your conviction in court.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<li><em>The cryptocurrency exchange is in talks to raise more capital to open the market.</em></li>



<li><em>The company plans to expand into Europe, Asia, and the UK early next year.</em></li>



<li><em>The company&#8217;s current and only priority is to raise money through strategic investors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/crypto-exchange-bitstamp-in-fundraising-talks-seeks-expansion?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg News</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/194829-bitstamp-join-uk-crypto-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitstamp </a>Global CEO Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux said they are currently in talks to raise new capital to expand the market and increase operations.</strong></h5>

<p>A Bitstamp spokesperson said the exchange kicked off the fundraising process at the end of June, with Galaxy Digital Holdings as an advisor. The company plans to use the money for operations, including launching derivatives trading in Europe next year and expanding operations in Asian and UK markets.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our current and exclusive priority is to raise money through strategic investors to accelerate Bitstamp&#8217;s growth by providing new products and services to retail and institutional crypto customers,&#8221; Graftieaux said in a statement.</p>



<p>The U.S. regulatory crackdown and banking crisis have also made it a lot more difficult to trade crypto in USD. This seems to have prompted crypto companies to move to more breathable markets.</p>



<p>Founded in 2011, Bitstamp, based in Luxembourg, is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, having been the main venue for Bitcoin trading, acting as an alternative to Bitcoin exchanges. The dominant at that time was Mt.Gox.</p>



<p>Recently, Binance.US is bleeding. A week after the SEC lawsuit, market makers and traders left the exchange in droves. As measured by aggregate market depth for the 17 tokens on the exchange, liquidity has dropped by almost 80%. The market share of Binance.US, the US version of Binance, plummeted from 27% in April to just over 1% at the end of June.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the Binance slump, three smaller exchanges, Kraken, LMAX, and Bitstamp, jumped up by 25.5%, 9%, and 6%, respectively, according to Kaiko. Currently, Bitstamp USA, the US unit, has a coveted license called BitLicense, which allows it to serve customers in the state of New York.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After over two weeks of deliberation, Mantle DAO has <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0xa34107e34b4dc4ff4cd16b77d66e62a51f4d35457a4f4b1f68ab8ac821f58561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> official approval for its proposal to convert treasury reserve assets into stETH, marking a significant milestone for the project.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-401-1024x535.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-401-1024x535.png" alt="Mantle DAO Now Advocates Transforming Treasurys And Elevating Liquid Staking" class="wp-image-208892" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-401-1024x535.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-401-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-401-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-401-750x392.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-401-1140x596.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-401.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Mantle DAO Now Advocates Transforming Treasurys And Elevating Liquid Staking 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Dubbed as MIP-25, the proposal was skillfully crafted by Cateatpeanut, a core member of the Mantle team. Following the green light from the Mantle community, an economics committee will be instituted to oversee the management of the layer 2 blockchain&#8217;s treasury.</p>



<p>This newly established Mantle Economics Committee will bear the responsibility of making crucial decisions regarding the allocation of the treasury&#8217;s resources. With the bulk of these assets held in the form of MNT, the governance token of Mantle, their judicious distribution becomes paramount.</p>



<p>In a significant show of support, the layer 2 network underwent a successful governance vote that paved the way for the Mantle Economics Committee&#8217;s formation. Furthermore, it introduces enhanced liquidity through the endorsement of the liquid staking protocol, Mantle LSD. This endorsement also greenlights the allocation of 40,000 ETH from the treasury towards stETH.</p>



<p>The proposal&#8217;s core tenet <a href="https://coincu.com/201860-mantle-plans-to-invest-200000-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involves</a> the conversion of 200,000 ETH from the treasury into stETH. Notably, a cap of 40,000 ETH has also been established for stETH/wstETH and mntETH liquidity, heralding the dawn of a novel liquid staking paradigm within Mantle&#8217;s development ecosystem.</p>



<p>A noteworthy collaboration is set to unfold between Mantle and the pioneering Liquid Staking platform, <a href="https://coincu.com/197517-lido-proposes-a-40k-eth-from-mantle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido</a>. </p>



<p>This strategic partnership gains prominence as Lido envisions an alliance network for the sharing of revenue. Mantle reciprocates the sentiment, pledging to expand its liquid staking portfolio while assessing associated risks cautiously.</p>



<p>These initiatives mark Mantle&#8217;s pioneering moves following the successful launch of its <a href="https://coincu.com/203354-mantle-network-launched-its-mainnet-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainnet</a> in July 2023. The governance proposal extends its scope to encompass Mantle LSD and ETH staking strategy, underscored by its collaboration with Lido.</p>

<p>Key Points:</p>

<li><em>Sino Global Capital files a $67.3 million claim against FTX over fund partnership fallout.</em></li>



<li><em>Liquid Value fund targeted high-net-worth individuals, raised $90 million, but FTX link wavered.</em></li>



<li><em>Huobi and Galois Capital&#8217;s losses to FTX spotlight cryptocurrency market risks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sino Global Capital&#8217;s Liquid Value fund, managed by Matthew Graham, has lodged a $67.3 million claim against FTX Trading Ltd., according to a <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/07/sino-global-files-67m-claim-against-ftx-alameda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em> report.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-399-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-399-1024x683.png" alt="Sino Global Asks FTX To Pay $67 Million Losses" class="wp-image-208886" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-399-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-399-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-399-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-399-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-399-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-399.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Sino Global Asks FTX To Pay $67 Million Losses 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>The fund, striving to amass $200 million, primarily targets high-net-worth individuals. This venture marked a significant shift for <a href="https://coincu.com/203770-former-ftx-at-sino-global-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sino</a>, as it marked their first foray into external capital sourcing through a formal fund mechanism.</p>



<p>FTX&#8217;s role was initially characterized as &#8220;co-GP and anchor LP&#8221; in the promotional material for the fund.</p>



<p>The prospect of leveraging <a href="https://coincu.com/208336-bankman-fried-now-faces-jail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a>&#8216;s diverse token universe was highlighted. By January 2022, the fund had already garnered $90 million in investments, with FTX being a prominent anchor investor.</p>



<p>While Sino Global initially claimed their connection with FTX was limited to a mid-seven-figure custody holding, SEC filings from 2022 disclosed Bankman-Fried&#8217;s indirect investment in the fund, along with Alameda Research and its subsidiary, Alameda Ventures.</p>



<p>Although the fund is no longer under SEC registration, it remains active under the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. This move comes as the latest development in an ongoing saga that started with the fund&#8217;s partnership with Sam Bankman-Fried in 2021.</p>



<p>Looking back to the prior year&#8217;s conclusion, Sino admitted that their exposure to <a href="https://coincu.com/208172-ftx-dubai-subsidiary-us-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> had crumbled, resulting in damage amounting to an undisclosed &#8220;seven-digit&#8221; sum.</p>



<p>Before Sino&#8217;s predicament, a series of other victims had also come forward, revealing their own exposure and vulnerabilities to FTX. For instance, <a href="https://coincu.com/208621-huobis-troubles-deepen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huobi</a> faced an $18 million setback, while the Genesis Capital fund sustained losses amounting to $40 million.</p>



<p>In response to FTX&#8217;s collapse, Sino released a statement expressing their initial trust in FTX&#8217;s commitment to industry advancement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CoinsPaid lost $37 million in the swift cyberattack.</em></li>



<li><em>Suspected Lazarus Group behind the elaborate 6-month operation.</em></li>



<li><em>The incident underscores rising cybersecurity challenges for crypto businesses.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent cybersecurity incident that unfolded in late July, Estonia&#8217;s leading crypto payment provider, CoinsPaid, fell victim to a meticulously planned attack, resulting in a staggering loss of $37 million.</strong></h5>

<p>The attack was executed with remarkable speed and precision, indicating the possible involvement of <a href="https://coincu.com/206197-lazarus-group-supposed-behind-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lazarus Group</a>, a hacking group linked to the North Korean government, as suggested by <a href="https://coincu.com/206999-coinspaid-battles-hackers-in-37m-crypto-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinsPaid</a> and Match Systems investigators, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/fake-job-offer-opened-door-to-suspected-north-korean-crypto-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</p>



<p>The ordeal began when a programmer engaged in a video interview with a recruiter who had extended a promising job offer via LinkedIn. During the virtual meeting, the programmer was instructed to download a file for a technical assessment, a seemingly innocuous task that masked the hackers&#8217; true intentions. </p>



<p>Just a few days later, on July 22, the CoinsPaid security team detected a series of unauthorized withdrawals, rapidly depleting company funds. The hackers remained covert, obscuring both the origin of the pilfered cryptocurrency and the recipient&#8217;s digital wallet addresses.</p>



<p>CoinsPaid&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer, Pavel Kashuba, revealed that the attack&#8217;s swiftness and sophistication were indicative of seasoned professionals at work. </p>



<p>This incident culminated in an intricate six-month operation characterized by numerous denial-of-service and brute-force attacks. Hackers systematically probed the network for exploitable technical vulnerabilities, ultimately zeroing in on the breach.</p>



<p>The hackers diligently studied CoinsPaid over time, launching phishing attacks and ingeniously contacting multiple staff members with faux inquiries and enticing job offers. This calculated approach granted them access to internal systems, laying the groundwork for the devastating breach.</p>



<p>As the investigation unfolds, the possibility of Lazarus&#8217; involvement underscores the growing sophistication and global reach of cyber threats facing the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tether&#8217;s USDT selling shakes Curve and Uniswap pools, causing imbalances.</em></li>



<li><em>USDT stands strong despite uncertainty, holding over 84 billion tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD stablecoin launch could reshape the market, affecting competitors and pushing for growth and regulations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tether is facing difficulties now that USDT is in danger of losing its peg, according to the <a href="https://marketing.kaiko.com/tether-imbalance-raises-alarm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaiko report</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-396.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-396.png" alt="Tether&#039;s USDT Started To Show Signs Of Losing Pegs Again: Report" class="wp-image-208874" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-396.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-396-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-396-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-396-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Tether&#039;s USDT Started To Show Signs Of Losing Peg Again: Report 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>Over the past weekend, both Curve&#8217;s 3pool and Uniswap V3&#8217;s primary USDT-USDC pool <a href="https://coincu.com/208288-usdt-depegs-again-strong-selling-to-usdc-dai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encountered</a> imbalances due to a surge in USDT selling. Uniswap saw approximately $40 million in selling, while Curve experienced around $35 million. </p>



<p>The imbalance is particularly pronounced in the Curve pool, which currently holds 60% of USDT. Concurrently, USDT experienced a slight dip below its dollar peg on several centralized exchanges (CEXs) in recent days, as per Kaiko.</p>



<p>The reasons behind this USDT exodus remain uncertain, as no apparent bearish catalyst has emerged. Interestingly, <a href="https://coincu.com/208426-tether-and-bitfinex-triumph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether</a> recently reported significant Q2 revenues, suggesting a positive trajectory. </p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, proposes the possibility of foul play, speculating a connection between the selling and Binance&#8217;s listing of the new stablecoin <a href="https://coincu.com/206151-binance-postpones-fdusd-stablecoin-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDUSD</a> on July 26, issued by Hong Kong-based First Digital. However, such a correlation lacks supporting evidence.</p>



<p>Despite these developments, Tether&#8217;s USDT remains the world&#8217;s largest stablecoin, boasting a total supply exceeding 84 billion tokens. Moreover, the stablecoin sector has been enriched with PayPal&#8217;s entry into the arena.</p>



<p>PayPal, the famous payment giant, introduced its stablecoin today. Ardoino asserted that the launch of <a href="https://coincu.com/208865-paypals-pyusd-connected-to-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin</a> (PYUSD) would not impact USDT, given its U.S.-specific launch, <em>The Block </em><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/243602/paypal-stablecoin-tether-usdc-impact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>. </p>



<p>However, Ardoino noted that if PYSDC were to foster positive influence in international markets and regulations, it could positively launch in international markets and regulations.</p>



<p>In contrast, Tether maintains its emphasis on emerging markets and countries. As the stablecoin landscape continues to evolve, these developments may reshape the dynamics of the market in unpredictable ways.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Collaboration between PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD stablecoin and FTX on Solana was postponed due to the FTX crash.</em></li>



<li><em>PayPal&#8217;s $1B+ crypto holdings reinforce its push for PYUSD stablecoin, aiming to transform digital payments.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite hurdles, Paxos prepares to issue PYUSD, backed by US Dollar reserves, underscoring stablecoins&#8217; transactional potential.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An ambitious collaboration between PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin PYUSD and FTX, initially slated for issuance on the Solana blockchain in 2022, has hit a roadblock.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-394-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-394-1024x576.png" alt="PayPal&#039;s Innovative PYUSD Project Was Closely Connected To The Defunct Exchange FTX" class="wp-image-208866" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-394-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-394-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-394-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-394-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-394-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-394.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="PayPal&#039;s Innovative PYUSD Project Was Closely Connected To The Defunct Exchange FTX 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1688573353064534016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wu Blockchain</a>, the digital payment giant and FTX had entered into a cooperative agreement to launch PYUSD on <a href="https://coincu.com/204372-solana-is-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a>. However, the project faced suspension due to a crash experienced by FTX, as disclosed by insiders familiar with the matter.</p>



<p>The proposed expansion of PYUSD to other Layer 1 (L1) blockchains faces challenges due to the classification of major public chain tokens as securities by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Previously, <a href="https://coincu.com/208826-paypal-pyusd-new-stablecoin-u-s-dollar-deposits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PayPal</a> had made waves with its announcement of the <a href="https://coincu.com/208844-us-representative-mchenry-praises-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PYUSD</a> stablecoin, a move set to revolutionize the utilization of digital currencies for payments.</p>



<p>PayPal&#8217;s involvement in the cryptocurrency space has been steadfast, with its crypto holdings surpassing $1 billion in the first quarter of 2023. The introduction of the PYUSD stablecoin aims to solidify its standing in the digital payments sector.</p>



<p>Paxos, a prominent financial institution, is slated to issue the PYUSD stablecoin. The currency will be fully backed by a reserve of US Dollar deposits, cash equivalents, and short-term Treasury bills. </p>



<p>Targeting the American market, the PayPal stablecoin will be pegged to the US Dollar, catering to domestic users.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that FTX and PayPal have a history of collaboration. The exchange and the global payment platform joined forces in the past to facilitate cost-effective transactions for users via bank wires.</p>



<p>Despite the setback, the potential of PYUSD remains significant, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of stablecoins and their role in reshaping digital transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>KuCoin reinforces its KYC procedure with ID verification and facial recognition for new users as of August 31, 2023, ensuring tighter security and regulatory alignment.</em></li>



<li><em>Existing users who have not completed KYC by August 31 can sell coins and close positions, but deposits will pause.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange previously halted Bitcoin and Litecoin mining pools on August 15.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>KuCoin has <a href="https://www.kucoin.com/announcement/en-announcement-regarding-kucoin-s-upgraded-standard-user-identity-verification-procedure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> plans to fortify its Know Your Customer (KYC) policy, signaling a crackdown on illegal activities and a boost in user account security.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-393-1024x567.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="567" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-393-1024x567.png" alt="KuCoin Empowers Security By Unveiling Enhanced KYC Protocol" class="wp-image-208860" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-393-1024x567.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-393-300x166.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-393-768x425.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-393-750x416.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-393-1140x632.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-393.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="KuCoin Empowers Security By Unveiling Enhanced KYC Protocol 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>The enhanced procedure requires new users to complete <a href="https://coincu.com/198648-kucoin-mandatory-kyc-verification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KYC</a>, including uploading identification documents and undergoing facial recognition, as part of standard identity verification.</p>



<p>This measure is aimed at meeting compliance with regulations and battling money laundering and terrorist financing. The rollout is scheduled for August 31, 2023, at 00:00 UTC.</p>



<p>In accordance with the announcement, users registered prior to August 31, 2023, who haven&#8217;t concluded their identity verification will face limitations.</p>



<p>These individuals can engage only in specific functions such as coin selling, closing futures and margin positions, and redeeming earned products and ETFs. Notably, their ability to deposit funds will be paused, although withdrawals remain unaffected.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/205917-kucoin-faces-profit-woes-surround/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KuCoin</a> underscores the importance of this upgrade, emphasizing the unchanged security of account funds during the transition. However, users are strongly urged to promptly fulfill the standard KYC requirements to ensure uninterrupted access to their accounts.</p>



<p>In a separate development, the exchange had previously <a href="https://coincu.com/208132-kucoin-halts-btc-and-ltc-mining-pools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disclosed</a> its decision to suspend support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) mining pools, effective August 15, 2023. To prepare for this suspension, users are advised to back up and maintain their mining records before August 27, 2023.</p>



<p>KuCoin&#8217;s strategic moves aim to align with evolving regulatory demands, fostering a more secure and compliant trading environment for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Starting from 8:00 on August 10, 2023, traders will have access to BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT pairs.</p>



<p>Notably, <a href="https://coincu.com/208152-hashkey-exchange-unveils-licensed-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HashKey Exchange</a> holds the distinction of being the pioneer recipient of a <a href="https://coincu.com/208740-hong-kong-securities-commission-issues-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong</a> license under the open crypto policy, implemented on June 1, 2023. This coveted license has since been granted to OSL as well, marking the second such achievement in the region.</p>



<p>The competitive landscape has been energized by Hong Kong&#8217;s decision to permit individual investors to engage in cryptocurrency trading. Prominent exchanges like OKX, Huobi, and BitMEX have vied for licenses, but <a href="https://coincu.com/188649-hashkey-group-to-raise-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HashKey</a> has emerged as a standout contender. It swiftly obtained class 1 and class 7 licenses, enabling the provision of trading services to individual investors. The company is inviting users to register and partake in the HSK token airdrop.</p>



<p>HashKey&#8217;s rapid license acquisition â€“ a mere two months following policy implementation â€“ underscores the efficiency of the local government&#8217;s processes.</p>



<p>Supporting HashKey Exchange&#8217;s operations is Standard Chartered Bank, which facilitates fiat deposits and withdrawals for users. This partnership follows HSBC&#8217;s pioneering initiative in enabling customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.</p>



<p>While HashKey Exchange&#8217;s advancement into the new trading pairs domain opens opportunities, it also acknowledges the potential challenges posed by decentralized and open-source systems. The risk of technological non-collaboration affecting network performance and the possibility of BTC and ETH being superseded by more efficient competitors are among the concerns being transparently communicated.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Chairman McHenry supports PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin launch and its correlation with bipartisan stablecoin regulation.</em></li>



<li><em>PayPal introduced PYUSD, a regulated stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, backed by deposits and bills, enabling seamless transfers.</em></li>



<li><em>The company&#8217;s stablecoin entry signals the potential for reshaping consumer payments with regulatory backing and innovative features.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On August 7, Patrick McHenry, the Chairman of the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed</a> optimism about PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin announcement, linking it to the recently passed bipartisan Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391-1024x536.png" alt="US Representative McHenry Praises PayPal&#039;s Groundbreaking Stablecoin Launch" class="wp-image-208848" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391-1024x536.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391-1536x804.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391-750x393.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391-1140x597.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-391.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US Representative McHenry Praises PayPal&#039;s Groundbreaking Stablecoin Launch 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>This Act aims to regulate stablecoins by establishing clear guidelines for issuers and providing robust consumer safeguards through a unified federal standard.</p>



<p>McHenry hailed <a href="https://coincu.com/186410-paypal-crypto-deposits-hit-record-of-943m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PayPal</a>&#8216;s move as a positive indicator for the future of stablecoins within a defined regulatory framework.</p>



<p>Stressing the importance of comprehensive digital asset regulation, he emphasized the need for Congress to take action, especially regarding stablecoins.</p>



<p>He acknowledged the influential role of states in regulating digital asset firms and commended successful state models like New York&#8217;s.</p>



<p>The announcement unveiled the launch of the PYUSD stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar and backed by U.S. dollar deposits and short-term Treasury bills.</p>



<p>This fully regulated stablecoin, issued by Paxos, is set to be a part of the ecosystem, enabling easy transfers within the network and to compatible third-party wallets.</p>



<p>Designed for seamless conversion to US dollars and other cryptocurrencies within the network, <a href="https://coincu.com/208826-paypal-pyusd-new-stablecoin-u-s-dollar-deposits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PYUSD</a> will empower purchases and is slated to integrate with <a href="https://coincu.com/154980-venmo-paypal-and-cashapp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venmo</a>, PayPal&#8217;s renowned payment app.</p>



<p>To ensure transparency, Paxos plans to release monthly reports detailing the assets securing PYUSD, accompanied by a third-party attestation from an accounting firm.</p>



<p>While stablecoins have primarily been utilized for trading purposes, PYUSD&#8217;s launch hints at their broader potential for consumer payments.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, but PayPal&#8217;s entry could signal a transformative shift in the landscape. With regulatory backing and tangible utility, stablecoins could soon become more prominent in modern payment systems.</p>
