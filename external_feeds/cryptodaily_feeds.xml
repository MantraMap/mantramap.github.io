<p>As reported by Gulf Today, Bybit, one of the world's leading crypto exchanges with over 15 million users, will take on the role of the official listing partner for the Crypto Centre.

<p>Bybit brings to the table its expertise in transparency, listing procedures, custodial services, and more, aiming to make a lasting impact on Dubai's position as the crypto capital and to fulfil its vision of becoming, what Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO, calls the world's "Crypto Ark."</p>
<p>Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive of DMCC, expressed his excitement about the partnership, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dubai has firmly established itself as a global hub for crypto and Web3, with the DMCC Crypto Centre serving as the region's premier platform for crypto firms. Bybit's presence further strengthens this position, and we are delighted to have them on board as an official ecosystem partner. Through their expertise and financial contribution, we anticipate an acceleration in the growth and influence of Dubai's pioneering crypto and Web3 businesses."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The SEC on Monday sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for allegedly mishandling funds and lying to regulators. </p>
<p>On Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused cryptocurrency exchange Binance of allegedly mishandling customer funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations.</p>
<p>The SEC also sued Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging that he and the exchange failed to restrict US customers from its platform and mislead investors about its market surveillance controls. The regulator further accused Binance of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>In a press release, the SEC said:</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Binance Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Binance&rdquo;), which operates the largest crypto asset trading platform in the world, Binance.com; U.S.-based affiliate, BAM Trading Services Inc. (&ldquo;BAM Trading&rdquo;), which, together with Binance, operates the crypto asset trading platform, Binance.US; and their founder, Changpeng Zhao, with a variety of securities law violations.</p>

<p>In a case filed in federal court in Washington, DC, the SEC said the exchange has been mixing &ldquo;billions of dollars&rdquo; in customer funds and secretly sent them to Merit Peak Limited, a separate company controlled by Zhao. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint details that Binance and Zhao controlled customers&rsquo; assets, allowing them to mix and divert funds and that Binance created separate US entities &ldquo;as part of an elaborate scheme to evade US federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gary Gensler, Chair of the SEC, said:</p>

<p>Through thirteen charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>As alleged, Zhao and Binance misled investors about their risk controls and corrupted trading volumes while actively concealing who was operating the platform, the manipulative trading of its affiliated market maker, and even where and with whom investor funds and crypto assets were custodied.</p>
<p>They attempted to evade US securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes so that they could keep high-value US customers on their platforms. The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms.</p>

CZ Dismisses Charges
<p>Zhao dismissed the charges on Twitter by saying &ldquo;4,&rdquo; a popular reference in the Binance community that urges users to ignore FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">4.Our team is all standing by, ensuring systems are stable, including withdrawals, and deposits. We will issue a response once we see the complaint. Haven't seen it yet. Media gets the info before we do.🙏</p>
&mdash; CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) June 5, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Zhao assured the community that Binance&rsquo;s systems are stable, with deposits and withdrawals operating per usual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance published its response to the suit shortly after the news broke. The exchange said:</p>

<p>We are disappointed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chose to file a complaint today against Binance seeking, among other remedies, purported emergency relief.&nbsp; From the start, we have actively cooperated with the SEC&rsquo;s investigations and have worked hard to answer their questions and address their concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most recently, we have engaged in extensive good-faith discussions to reach a negotiated settlement to resolve their investigations.&nbsp; But despite our efforts, with its complaint today the SEC abandoned that process and instead chose to act unilaterally and litigate.&nbsp; We are disheartened by that choice.&nbsp;</p>

Crack Down on Binance Continues
<p>The newest suit adds to the list of regulatory action taken against the exchange by US regulators. In March, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance and Zhao, accusing the exchange of trading on its own platform and alleging that the founder partook in insider trading. &nbsp;</p>
<p>CZ outright denied the allegations stating that Binance does not and will never trade for profit or &ldquo;manipulate&rdquo; the market. Despite CZ&rsquo;s denial, users withdrew around $400 million in 24 hours from the exchange.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">As decentralized finance (DeFi) experiences phenomenal growth, the Aave (AAVE) token seems to be riding this wave, forecasting a bullish trend for 2023. On the flip side, EOS (EOS), another prominent player in the crypto space, is projected to face a challenging future, potentially slipping below the crucial $1 support level. </p>
<p class="s5">Meanwhile, Sparklo, a newcomer in the crypto arena, is making remarkable strides, demonstrating rapid progress that has captured the industry's attention.</p>
<p class="s8">2023 Forecasts: Sparklo's Impressive Growth Trajectory</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo is set to revolutionize how we invest in precious metals in the digital realm. Making waves with its groundbreaking model, Sparklo allows investors to buy parts of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), each one representing a physical asset. Additionally, the platform enables purchasing a complete NFT, with the tangible precious metal delivered to the owner.</p>
<p class="s5">Currently progressing through its second presale phase, Sparklo positions itself as a lucrative venture for aspiring investors. With a current price tag of just $0.030, renowned crypto analysts predict an impressive rise in Sparklo's value. Forecasts indicate an extraordinary 1,500% increase by the end of 2023, highlighting the potential rewards on offer.</p>
<p class="s5">The Sparklo smart contract's robustness has received the nod of approval from the Interfinetwork after rigorous auditing. To prevent any potential rugpull situations, the Sparklo team has committed to locking the liquidity for a hundred years, demonstrating their long-term vision. Backed by extensive research and promising prospects, Sparklo is shaping to be a promising investment contender for 2023. Interested investors can purchase tokens via the platform's linked partners.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Aave (AAVE) 2023 Forecast: DeFi Surge Bolstering Bullish Trajectory</p>
<p class="s5">In light of the escalating popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi), Aave's (AAVE/USD) 2023 trajectory seems promisingly bullish. With predictions indicating a top between $700 and $750, Aave (AAVE) is set to harness the power of this newfound adoption of digital currencies and their decentralized protocols. Further supporting this bullish trend, experts forecast a potential peak at $1,500 within the next two years, suggesting a sustained growth phase for Aave (AAVE) that could push trading values as high as $2,500 by 2026. These Aave (AAVE) projections are based on historic price trends and the increasing embracement of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p class="s5">Founded in 2017 by Stani Kuchelov, Aave (AAVE) has evolved into a robust decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Aave (AAVE) has paved the way for quicker loan processing with a revolutionary DeFi model that eliminates the need for matching lenders and borrowers. </p>
<p class="s8">EOS (EOS) in 2023: A Decline Towards Sub-Dollar Territory</p>
<p class="s5">Entering 2023, EOS (EOS), a popular cryptocurrency, faces challenging market dynamics. Ranked 49th in the crypto industry, the resilience of EOS is evident despite the 2022 crypto fallout. The strength of the EOS (EOS) network - a thriving and well-knit community of traders - ensures that EOS (EOS) maintains a foothold in the industry, irrespective of market fluctuations. However, EOS (EOS) current trajectory reveals a downward trendline, suggesting a dip below the $1 psychological support level. As of May 25th, 2023, EOS (EOS) to USDT trades at $0.861996, showing a decrease of 0.74% from the previous price.</p>
<p class="s5">By the end of 2023, EOS is projected to hover around the $1.14 mark, with a bottom lineexpectation of not less than $1.10. Although this shows signs of a possible return to its 2021 value of $2.77, it's essential to consider the market conditions and the factors affecting the cryptocurrency. Like other cryptos, EOS undergoes similar fluctuations, and the future growth patterns largely depend on the coin's inherent features and the broader crypto market sentiment.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Top cryptocurrency risk management firm Elliptic has announced last Thursday, June 1 their move to integrate large-language model (LLM) ChatGPT for their risk management and intelligence gathering operations. According to the statement, Elliptic expects that they &ldquo;will be able to synthesize and organize intelligence on new risk factors in higher volumes and at a quicker speed than ever before.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Elliptic has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency risk management and security. It recently published a report (commissioned by Nikkei Asia) on the cryptocurrency losses inflicted by North Korean hackers from 2017-2022. The report said that Asian countries, with Japan at the top, made up three of the four hotspots of hacking. Japan is estimated to have lost $721 million in cyberattacks. Now, Elliptic has taken steps to improve their solutions with the help of ChatGPT.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the ChatGPT integration, Elliptic aims to bolster its capabilities in risk analysis and threat detection. According to CEO Simone Maini, their continuous pursuit of cutting-edge technology is crucial to their mission. "We pride ourselves in being on the forefront of blockchain innovation, and incorporating cutting-edge technologies to enhance how we work without compromising the high standards for which we are known is part of our DNA,&rdquo; she stated.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The success of ChatGPT has attracted the attention of many in the crypto space and see a world full of potentials enabled by the LLM. Solana (SOL) has recently announced their plans to integrate the LLM through a plug-in and enable user interaction with the Solana network itself. The plug-in will enable users to ask questions and have them promptly answered by ChatGPT. At the same time, Solana has also announced a grant program for AI-focused projects built on the network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The use of AI for crypto projects, and especially for risk management and security is not without its risks. Many have noted the LLM&rsquo;s shortcomings and limitations especially when dealing with more complex queries. There is still a very big room for improvements in the LLM and for a security firm as big as Elliptic, mistakes can be very costly.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Within the economic monetary system, continuous printing of fiat currency means that the purchasing power of the dollar is always falling. Bitcoin is scarce with a fixed supply. Do the Maths.</p>
Purchasing power is dwindling fast
<p>For the average Joe and Jane, finding enough money (currency) to pay the bills always seems to get more and more difficult with each passing year. Both of them probably work, unlike their parents or grandparents who seemed to get along on just one wage.</p>
<p>The last few years had seemed much worse. Since the Pandemic, when bank accounts were pretty flush with government handouts, things have begun to get more problematic. Now, many families are not able to save, and if they had to find just a few hundred dollars for an unexpected shortfall, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to produce it.</p>
<p>What has happened is that governments have printed their way out of the Pandemic, and if we are really being factual, they have been printing more and more currency for many decades because that is the only way this debt-based system stays afloat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The countries of the world all use a fiat monetary system, and since the US dollar came off of its gold backing in 1971, they have remained pegged to a currency that is being printed with gay abandon at the expense of the purchasing power of all citizens.</p>
<p>There is only one destination for all fiat currencies and that is zero, just like every fiat currency in the history of the world. The average lifespan of a fiat currency is only 27 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the creation of the US Federal Reserve system in 1913, the dollar has fallen in purchasing power. One dollar at the time of the Pandemic in 2020 was worth more than $26 back in 1913.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With trillions being added since the outbreak of Covid in 2020, that figure has become far worse. Also, with the Federal Reserve probably loosening its monetary policy as the US heads towards recession, and given that the debt ceiling has no ceiling for the next 2 years, at least another $4 trillion will be added to the debt pile, and will further eat away at the purchasing power of all.</p>
Bitcoin is the way out
<p>Bitcoin will only ever have a supply of 21 million coins. It is hugely decentralised, incredibly secure, and well out of the reach of any government to confiscate or manipulate.</p>
<p>The average Joe and Jane have a way to get any savings out of failing banks and into Bitcoin. The mainstream narrative on Bitcoin is a cover to prevent people from doing the obvious thing. Education is the only way to help people protect themselves from what is to come.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Image source: AngelBlock</p>
<p>Crypto investors have an enticing opportunity to gain early access to SOLA-X, the first project seeking to raise capital on AngelBlock, a new, non-custodial fundraising protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AngelBlock revealed SOLA-X as its first raise in a blog post last month, tempting investors with the promise of much greater oversight and control over the project&rsquo;s progress, thanks to its clever &ldquo;post-raise governance&rdquo; mechanisms that ensure it must achieve specific goals prior to unlocking capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On its website, AngelBlock explains that too many investors have been burned in the past due to a lack of transparency and governance on traditional crypto launchpads. Once the funding has been raised, crypto projects are basically left to their own devices, with no checks on their progress or control over how they use the capital they have generated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AngelBlock aims to change this with its post-raise governance, which dictates that projects must establish a series of milestones that must be met, to the satisfaction of its investors, before the next chunk of capital can be accessed. Once the project completes a milestone and files a report, investors will have the opportunity to vote on it and can either approve it and unlock the next pot of funds, or reject it and ask the team to make improvements. This way, AngelBlock says the interest of the project&rsquo;s founders and investors become better aligned, increasing the prospects of success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent any single investor, or groups of investors, from having a disproportionate influence on these votes, AngelBlock has created options that can define the maximal voting power of a single token holder. The idea with this is that it reinforces democratic decision-making throughout the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While giving investors access to exclusive deals yielding high returns and saving time, we want to shape the future of crypto by making the lives of founders and entrepreneurs easier, while protecting investor capital and driving more transparency and benefits to community members of these particular startups,&rdquo; AngelBlock explains in a blog post.</p>

<p>Regarding the first project to launch on AngelBlock, SOLA-X looks like an interesting one. It&rsquo;s a DeFi protocol that has developed an &ldquo;advanced liquidity management system&rdquo;, wherein users can provide a single crypto asset that will be distributed across multiple liquidity pools. Its key promises are to simplify the process of providing liquidity while minimizing the risk of impermanent loss, and to do so it has created an innovative system to manage liquidity in real-time. Through this, it will be able to generate additional yields for investors. The SOLA-X protocol will be fully decentralized, with token holders able to participate in its governance and also stake them for additional rewards. You can read more about SOLA-X on its official website, and on its AngelBlock profile page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AngelBlock has developed a unique staking tiers system that grants priority access and larger ticket sizes to investors based on the amount of $THOL tokens they stake. First priority is given to institutional investors, or those who stake at least 500K $THOL, who will have a 24-hour window in which they get first dibs on the token sale. Next will be angel investors, who stake between 100K and 499K $THOL, with their own 24-hour window, followed by value investors who stake between 20K and 99K $THOL. Once that third 24-hour window closes, standard users (who can stake between 0 and 20K $THOL) will have their own opportunity to snap up whatever tokens remain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AngelBlock&rsquo;s SOLA-X raise will take place at the end of this month.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to Eleanor Terrett, Ripple and its underwriters met Wall Street investors as they look to generate interest in a potential IPO.</p>
An IPO On The Cards?&nbsp;
<p>Several rumors suggest that Ripple may go the IPO route following the conclusion of its long-running lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission. This became a topic of discussion on Twitter, where it was revealed that the company held a private roadshow event in April, during which company executives met Wall Street investors with the goal of generating interest for an IPO. Eleanor Terrett, Fox Business Journalist, picked up the news, tweeting,</p>

<p>&ldquo;In April, @Ripple hosted a private &ldquo;road show&rdquo; (a marketing event where a company and its underwriters meet with potential investors to generate interest in an IPO). I&rsquo;m told it was attended by just about every reputable institutional investment firm on the Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Deaton, a pro crypto attorney, noted that Ripple could be in a relatively good position depending on the outcome of the summary judgment. Deaton believes that an outright win for Ripple or a mere slap on the wrist could show that ongoing and future sales of XRP are not securities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If @Ripple wins the SEC lawsuit or gets the functional equivalent of a slap on the wrist, along with a ruling that ongoing and future sales of #XRP are not securities, the lawsuit will prove a blessing in disguise for Ripple.&rdquo;</p>

Long Running Lawsuit Nearing The End
<p>Deaton also commented on the potential outcome of the lawsuit, stating that there is a minimal chance (less than 3%) that the Securities and Exchange Commission can score an outright win against Ripple. Deaton has been a vocal supporter of Ripple&rsquo;s fight against the SEC, and was speaking during the June 3rd episode of the Good Morning Crypto podcast. Apart from his predictions about an outright Ripple victory, he also added that there was a 50% chance that Ripple could emerge victorious through a &ldquo;splitting the baby&rdquo; ruling. The last option is a reference to Judge Torress drawing a line in the sand, potentially ruling that XRP was offered as an unregistered security before 2018. However, following the Hinman documents, it could be possible that cryptocurrencies could make the transition from securities to commodities once they are sufficiently decentralized. Deaton added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that XRP itself is going to be deemed not a security and that I think that secondary market sales show comment. Even if [Judge Torres] does rule finding that Ripple violated the law, that doesn&rsquo;t apply to secondary market sales.&rdquo;</p>

Decision Before the 30th of September&nbsp;
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s executives have been predicting an end to the lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission for a while. Deaton also believes so and predicted that Judge Torres would likely make a final ruling before the 30th of September. He pointed to what he called a &ldquo;six-month list&rdquo; that district judges have to file before Congress and added that Judge Torres has never been on the list. The list contains details of all summary judgments that have been pending for longer than six months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deaton has also given his predictions about the price of XRP following a positive ruling, stating that the token&rsquo;s value could hover between $2 and $10. He also urged the Ripple community to mark the 13th of June, which is when investors would discover if XRP was the topic of discussion between the SEC staff before the Hinman speech. The Hinman files will be unsealed on the 13th and could dramatically impact the case.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Rebranding marks the start of a new era with a focus on pilots and onboarding partners.</p>
<p>Amsterdam-based fintech Dusk Network rebrands itself as Dusk. The company has matured over the last 5 years, and after focusing on research and development, it is now time to begin disclosing pilots and partnerships, and ramp up business adoption. The old brand was more associated with technological pioneering, while the new visual branding of Dusk has been designed to appeal to the financial industry without reneging the blockchain foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">After 5 years of research and development, Dusk Network rebrands into &lsquo;Dusk&rsquo;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Dusk shifts focus to pilots and onboarding partners</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A more business-oriented approach and international expansion plans for adoption</li>
</ul>
<p>Dusk was created in 2018 with the ambition to use blockchain technology for financial empowerment and economic inclusion. The vision was to create a &lsquo;network&rsquo; - hence the name - where institutions would create instruments inexpensively, and users would harvest them directly. Neither vision nor ambition have changed, but it takes a lot of commitment and a mature legislative framework. In the past years, the focus was on research and development; how to provide the technology to realize all this? Groundbreaking research and codes were one of the results, with the launch of a first testnet in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Regulated and Decentralized Finance
<p>By dropping &lsquo;Network&rsquo; from the name, and adding the tagline &lsquo;Regulated and Decentralized Finance&rsquo;, the brand represents both its ambition and vision in a clearer way. The transition into a more mature company blends in seamlessly with three key pillars when it comes to realizing their ambitions; bringing real-world assets to people's wallets, compliance, and privacy. These three pillars underscore everything Dusk has been building and is the driving force behind all decisions made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These pillars are key for everyone to have access to real-world financial instruments and to exert complete control over that which they own. Without compliance, mass adoption remains a fantasy. This is why Dusk is such a strong proponent of Regulated Decentralized Finance (RegDeFi). Without compliance with well-made regulations, crypto can never leave the crypto sandbox.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dusk Network was founded in 2018 and in that time we&rsquo;ve worked tirelessly to create the technology to unite the worlds of crypto and real-world assets and to bring financial freedom and inclusion to everyone. With the rebranding of Dusk, it feels like we&rsquo;re entering a new era, moving forward as a scale-up and can finally trial our tech stack with the onboarding of pilots. Besides that, we focus on new partnerships and business development&rdquo;. - says Emanuele Francioni, founder &amp; CEO at Dusk.&nbsp;</p>

Onboarding partnerships and embarking pilots
<p>During an exclusive network and relationship dinner, a sneak peek of the new brand was revealed. It was part of an engaging moment of connection with partners, prospects and game-changers in the industry. During the event, Emanuele Francioni, founder and CEO of Dusk elaborated on recent business developments. Dusk made a strategic investment in the London-based startup OutDID, as part of the development of self-sovereign identity and to tie in with its own KYC products, Citadel and Shelter. All these will contribute to smarter use of and access to data, tying back to the three main pillars of Dusk. A partnership with NPEX, the licensed MTF exchange, to participate in the European Union Distributed Ledger Technology Regime (DLTR). Together with a top-tier financial institution, the aim is to make the first MTF for asset tokenization under this exemption. Also new upcoming partnerships with Mavryk (tokenized real estate), Cosimo X (already an investor), and IPwe (intellectual property-backed debt instruments) were mentioned.&nbsp; The new brand identity accelerates the more mature direction of the company, with a cadence of business development announcements coming up in the next months.&nbsp;</p>

Besides that, we focus on new partnerships and business development&rdquo;. - says Emanuele Francioni, founder &amp; CEO at Dusk.&nbsp;</p>

Onboarding partnerships and embarking pilots
<p>During an exclusive network and relationship dinner, a sneak peek of the new brand was revealed. It was part of an engaging moment of connection with partners, prospects and game-changers in the industry. During the event, Emanuele Francioni, founder and CEO of Dusk elaborated on recent business developments. Dusk made a strategic investment in the London-based startup OutDID, as part of the development of self-sovereign identity and to tie in with its own KYC products, Citadel and Shelter. All these will contribute to smarter use of and access to data, tying back to the three main pillars of Dusk. A partnership with NPEX, the licensed MTF exchange, to participate in the European Union Distributed Ledger Technology Regime (DLTR). Together with a top-tier financial institution, the aim is to make the first MTF for asset tokenization under this exemption. Also new upcoming partnerships with Mavryk (tokenized real estate), Cosimo X (already an investor), and IPwe (intellectual property-backed debt instruments) were mentioned.&nbsp; The new brand identity accelerates the more mature direction of the company, with a cadence of business development announcements coming up in the next months.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The potential of Ripple's XRP in fostering cross-chain developments on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is significant in the crypto world. As we delve into the revolutionary possibilities it offers, the crypto world also witnesses Sparklo (SPRK), a digital investment opportunity disrupting traditional norms. Read on to explore how XRP can be harnessed for cross-chain XRPL enhancements and how Sparklo is reshaping how we approach investments, one NFT-backed precious metal at a time.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Impact of Sparklo (SPRK) on the Digital Investment Realm</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) introduces an innovative platform that significantly changes the game in a bold move toward redefining digital investment in precious metals. Sparklo (SPRK) uniquely allows the acquisition of fractional parts of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), each correlating with a tangible asset. Alternatively, the platform also provides an opportunity to purchase an entire NFT, leading to the delivery of the linked precious metal.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) emerges as an attractive proposition for potential investors in its second presale phase. Priced attractively at only $0.030, leading voices in the crypto industry predict a substantial increase in value, forecasting an impressive 1,500% rise by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Passing a rigorous audit by the Interfi network, the solidity of the Sparklo (SPRK) smart contract has received notable recognition. Furthermore, as a preemptive measure to prevent rugpull risks, Sparklo (SPRK) has committed to secure liquidity for an incredible hundred years. Considering its well-researched background and promising future, Sparklo (SPRK) solidly positions itself as a formidable contender for investment in 2023. Tokens are currently available for purchase on the links below.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>XRP (XRP) Crucial Role in Cross-Chain XRPL Interactions</p>
<p>A pressing issue in the XRPL development community is the study of the XLS-38d amendment related to cross-chain communication within the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The amendment's effects on XRP (XRP) and the potential for centralization generate concerns. Specifically, these relate to "witness" servers - entities that must authenticate the parity of assets, such as XRP (XRP), across the cross-chain bridges. The significant responsibilities of these 'witness' servers, including their necessity for the trust of all parties and their influence over XRP (XRP) asset bridging, lead to questions about potential regulatory scrutiny and the need for off-chain coordination.</p>
<p>The emergence of multiple XRP (XRP)-based synthetics and the integration of cross-chain bridges into the XRPL pose both challenges and risks. The question arises whether the benefits of integrating these bridges, particularly for XRP (XRP), outweigh the associated risks. Future discussions on XRPL's cross-chain solutions, including their implications for XRP (XRP), will encompass issues like costs and resource efficiency. In addition, these cross-chain bridges are crucial to the liquidity ecosystems of major blockchains and dApps, especially for assets like XRP (XRP).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the last six weeks, the cryptocurrency market has been in a consolidation phase leaving investors questioning where the next direction would be for their favorite assets. However, the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum (ETH), has continued to record price declines, losing a major price support level.</p>
<p>The bearish sentiment of Ethereum isn&rsquo;t shared by the likes of Shiba Inu and Tradecurve, which have shown bullish strength recently. But where would their prices go next? In this article, we will discuss the price prediction for these three major cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shiba Inu Accumulation Spike Amidst Increase in Price</p>
<p>The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB), the Dogecoin competitor, has continued to increase amidst an increase in the accumulation of the meme coin. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the number of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens held by major whales has increased by 100 billion SHIB since the beginning of the week. The increased accumulation of Shiba Inu (SHIB) follows a price increase over the last two days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trading as low as $0.000008499, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) spiked reaching highs of $0.00000875. Market analysts predict that the potential US debt ceiling deal in the coming days will drive the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) higher. If the debt ceiling is increased, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) could trade between $0.0000100 and $0.00001750. However, the ever-optimistic Shiba Army has predicted prices of up to $1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ethereum Price Drops Further &ndash; What&rsquo;s Next for the Leading Altcoin?</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH), the leading smart contracts platform has continued to sustain price declines. From highs of $1,920 this week, the price of Ethereum (ETH) dropped as low as $1,850. However, there has been a resurgence in the price of Ethereum over the last few days, as the leading altcoin now trades at $1,880 at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Although most signals point towards a bearish sentiment, there are hopes that the upcoming debt ceiling increase could turn the tide for Ethereum (ETH). However, in the short term, Ethereum will need to break above the $1,920 level to mark a bullish reversal. But If the price of Ethereum (ETH) falls below $1,850, it could be a free fall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve Predicted to Record 100X Price Increase in 2023</p>
<p>Unlike Ethereum, Tradecurve has been more bullish than bearish over the last few weeks. The price of Tradecurve jumped by 25% as it entered its third presale phase, but market analysts believe there could be more increases to come. Tradecurve will be an all-inclusive trading platform, allowing users from anywhere in the world to open an account without the need for KYC requirements.</p>
<p>The bullish sentiment investors and industry experts have about Tradecurve stems from it being the first decentralized trading platform built on a blockchain that will allow users to access the global financial markets including stocks, options, CMDs, forex, and ETFs all from one account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tapping into the $632 trillion over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market and the forex market with a global turnover of $7.5 trillion per day is bound to yield rewards for Tradecurve. Experts believe that this gives TCRV the opportunity to jump by 100x. You can join the growing number of investors buying into the Tradecurve presale as a token now sells for $0.015 before the price jump.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recently proposed draft bill could set clearly defined roles for the SEC and the CFTC, giving much-needed clarity to the U.S. crypto industry. Let&rsquo;s find out more.&nbsp;</p>
Bitcoin
<p>USDT stablecoin issuer Tether has announced its plans to set up Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay using renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum and Bitcoin have long been regarded as two top giants battling for supremacy in the crypto ecosystem. However, according to a top trader, Ethereum might be having the upper hand soon. In other news, Tradecurve's presale stage 3 has recorded immense growth in the past few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) Set for a Breakout Against Bitcoin (BTC) - Top trader</p>
<p>An influential trader within the crypto community known as Bluntz has recently shared his optimistic outlook on Ethereum in relation to Bitcoin. With over 223,100 on Twitter, Bluntz suggests that the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair is on the brink of a potential breakout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Year-to-date, Bitcoin has performed Ethereum, gaining 63% compared to the latter&rsquo;s 56%. However, Bluntz believes the trend could change in the coming weeks, with Ethereum performing better than Bitcoin in the bull market. According to his analysis, if this breakout occurs, Ethereum's value would increase against Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Displaying a chart on his tweet, Bluntz pointed out a falling wedge pattern on the ETH/BTC pair, which typically indicates a bullish trend. On the other hand, he expresses concerns about Bitcoin's performance against the USD, emphasizing the breach of a crucial support level. As a result, the trader advised investors to limit their exposure to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) Presale Gains Massive Traction In Stage 3</p>
<p>While a top trader is bullish on the prospects of Ethereum, Tradecurve, a new trading platform that could send the likes of Binance and Huobi packing, has gained increased attention in its Stage 3 presale. The sale of millions of Tradecurve utility tokens has captivated the attention of experts in the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve, a hybrid, decentralized trading platform has caught the attention of many investors as it aims to address several challenges faced by traders when using traditional trading platforms, including security, limited trading options, high trading fees, transparency, and privacy. Tradecure will be the first platform where users can utilize digital assets as collateral, users can trade forex, stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities on Tradecurve through a single account.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the platform's notable advantages is its user-friendly accessibility, eliminating the need for the KYC process. Traders can create an account with just an email and a crypto wallet. This anonymous trading sets Tradecurve apart from established platforms like Binance and Kraken. Moreover, Tradecurve offers an array of features, including algorithmic trading that allows users to subscribe to automated AI bots, high leverage starting at 500:1, and copy trading where newbies can replicate the trades of experienced traders for a given fee.</p>
<p>Currently, Tradecurve's utility token, TCRV, is up for presale available at just $0.015 per token. There is also a 25% deposit bonus for every purchase. Smart investors are already stashing up TCRV tokens before the price skyrockets. Besides, market experts anticipate a 50x surge during the presale stage and a staggering 100x increase upon the launch of TCRV, followed by its listing on a prominent Tier-1 CEX (Centralized Exchange).&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Fantom (FTM) is implementing a unique strategy of compensating developers for generating gas fees to boost its network activity. This bold initiative underscores Fantom (FTM) commitment to fostering a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem. Meanwhile, the spotlight is also on Sparklo (SPRK), a digital investment platform that's readying itself for stellar gains. Set against an increasingly digital economy backdrop, both Fantom (FTM) and Sparklo (SPRK) offer unique value propositions poised to reshape the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK): Poised for Massive Gains in the Digital Investment Arena</p>
<p>Revolutionizing the domain of digital investments in precious metals, Sparklo is primed for a disruptive leap. Uniquely, Sparklo provides the ability to purchase portions of an NFT, with each segment tied to a physical asset. Moreover, they present the exciting opportunity to own an entire NFT, leading to the ownership of the corresponding precious metal.</p>
<p>Navigating through its second presale phase, Sparklo is a lucrative prospect for potential investors. Valued at an attractive $0.03, leading experts in the crypto field anticipate a significant rise in its value. Projections depict a huge 1,500% surge by the end of 2023, offering substantial returns.</p>
<p>Sparklo's sturdy smart contract has been awarded the Interfi network's seal of approval after a comprehensive audit. In a preemptive measure to prevent rugpull risks, Sparklo has committed to secure liquidity for a whole century. Given the extensive research and promising prospects, Sparklo presents itself as an enticing investment opportunity in 2023. The tokens are available for acquisition in the links below.</p>

<p>Fantom (FTM) Innovative Approach: Remunerating Developers for Gas Fees Generated</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM), a prominent player in the blockchain space, has just announced a unique initiative, the "Gas Monetization Program." According to the May 31 announcement, the Fantom (FTM) Opera network team will now compensate developers for the gas fees produced by their applications. To be eligible for the program, apps must have conducted over 125,000 transactions and been live on the Fantom network for at least three months.</p>
<p>Six Web3 apps, including ParaSwap, Beethoven X, Stargate, LayerZero, WOOFi, and SpookySwap, have already been approved and are actively partaking in this program. However, it's not unrestricted access for all developers, as those with inefficient gas contracts may face competition and potential suspension from the program. With this new program, Fantom (FTM) hopes to create an alternative revenue source for developers, encouraging a sustainable ecosystem.</p>

Meanwhile, the spotlight is also on Sparklo (SPRK), a digital investment platform that's readying itself for stellar gains. Set against an increasingly digital economy backdrop, both Fantom (FTM) and Sparklo (SPRK) offer unique value propositions poised to reshape the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK): Poised for Massive Gains in the Digital Investment Arena</p>
<p>Revolutionizing the domain of digital investments in precious metals, Sparklo is primed for a disruptive leap. Uniquely, Sparklo provides the ability to purchase portions of an NFT, with each segment tied to a physical asset. Moreover, they present the exciting opportunity to own an entire NFT, leading to the ownership of the corresponding precious metal.</p>
<p>Navigating through its second presale phase, Sparklo is a lucrative prospect for potential investors. Valued at an attractive $0.03, leading experts in the crypto field anticipate a significant rise in its value. Projections depict a huge 1,500% surge by the end of 2023, offering substantial returns.</p>
<p>Sparklo's sturdy smart contract has been awarded the Interfi network's seal of approval after a comprehensive audit. In a preemptive measure to prevent rugpull risks, Sparklo has committed to secure liquidity for a whole century. Given the extensive research and promising prospects, Sparklo presents itself as an enticing investment opportunity in 2023. The tokens are available for acquisition in the links below.</p>

<p>Fantom (FTM) Innovative Approach: Remunerating Developers for Gas Fees Generated</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM), a prominent player in the blockchain space, has just announced a unique initiative, the "Gas Monetization Program." According to the May 31 announcement, the Fantom (FTM) Opera network team will now compensate developers for the gas fees produced by their applications. To be eligible for the program, apps must have conducted over 125,000 transactions and been live on the Fantom network for at least three months.</p>
<p>Six Web3 apps, including ParaSwap, Beethoven X, Stargate, LayerZero, WOOFi, and SpookySwap, have already been approved and are actively partaking in this program. However, it's not unrestricted access for all developers, as those with inefficient gas contracts may face competition and potential suspension from the program. With this new program, Fantom (FTM) hopes to create an alternative revenue source for developers, encouraging a sustainable ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The native cryptocurrency behind Gate.io, GateToken, has fallen in value as the exchange witnessed nearly $150 million in outflows. Rumors surround the exchange that it might have been affected by the Multichain incident, and that the CEO cannot be reached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gate.io saw a boost in usage following the collapse of the FTX exchange, as cryptocurrency investors looked at alternatives to trade at, but it is clear that CEXs are not the right choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized alternatives like Tradecurve are taking over and we can see that the demand is here as the utility token behind the platform, TCRV has surged in value by 50%.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Gate.io Records $150 Million in Withdrawals and Worries Investors</p>
<p>According to data from DeFi Lama, among the top 10 CEXs on a global scale, Gate, it has seen the highest levels of outflow, which have affected the value of GateToken. The outflows over a 7-day and 1-month period are also high. It is unclear why so much money has been going outside of Gate.io currently, but the movement has hit the value of the GateToken hard, where the cryptocurrency dipped in value by 17.1% in the past month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of July 2, 2023, GateToken trades at $4.36. Within the last two weeks, GateToken dropped by 10.3%. In the last 24 hours alone, GateToken saw a decrease in its value by 2.6%. Based on this, it is clear that GateToken has entered the red zone and it is heading toward a downward trend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The $150 million in withdrawals have affected GateToken in a negative way, so investors are looking to diversify with alternatives. TCRV is the utility token behind Tradecurve that has gained a significant level of attention as a result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Tradecurve&rsquo;s utility token TCRV Spikes by 50%</p>
<p>According to the whitepaper, Tradecurve is described as a &ldquo;hybrid trading platform that combines the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges.&rdquo;. The platform enables users the ability to trade anything from cryptocurrencies to any other derivative product without the need to complete a KYC procedure while also maintaining their privacy through the platform's DeFi capabilities.</p>
<p>Tradecurve offers traders a wide range of trading tools, such as algorithmic trading opportunities with the usage of AI, negative balance protection, a VIP account service, and even educational resources through a dedicated Trading Academy with subscription-based social trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Each user can open an account using just an email address, deposit crypto with their wallet, and get access to anything, as the crypto will be used as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the tiny spreads, risk management tools, native support for desktop and mobile, and a simple user interface, anyone will be able to use and understand Tradecurve. The TCRV token has spiked 50% in value and now trades at just $0.015 during Stage 3 of its presale. The team will raise $20 million during the presale and can onboard 100,000 new users during the first three months of operations, where TCRV can climb 100x in value.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to introduce $RON, an ERC20 token poised to revolutionize the intersection of digital culture and politics. With the upcoming 2024 Presidential race, $RON stands as the pioneering token that embraces technological advancements, community engagement, and a progressive approach to governance. With a vision of technological innovation, $RON aims to bridge the gap between politics and crypto, setting a new standard for political campaigning in the digital age.</p>
<p>The project's vision is to leverage the power of blockchain and cryptocurrency to assist Governor Ron DeSantis in winning the presidential race and becoming the 47th President of the United States. As a MEME token, $RON embodies the commitment of its supporters to bridge the gap between politics and crypto, championing a more inclusive and innovative future.</p>
<p>Since its launch, $RON has achieved remarkable milestones, underscoring its potential for growth and community engagement. In just three days, the token reached an all-time high of 10.5 million USD, while gaining over 1800 new holders. These achievements solidify $RON as a promising investment opportunity in the dynamic world of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.</p>
<p>One of the key driving forces behind $RON's momentum is the public endorsement of Governor Ron DeSantis by Elon Musk. This endorsement has sparked anticipation of attention-grabbing tweets about DeSantis, directing the public's interest toward the original $RON token. The project's Smart Contract, which foresees Governor DeSantis's victory, is immutable and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, adding a historic dimension to the meme project trajectory.</p>
<p>A recent tweet by the account @ERC20DeSantis has sparked interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and supporters of Ron DeSantis. The tweet, which includes a link to donate Ethereum to an ETH address "our-great-american-comeback.eth," urges individuals to contribute funds towards DeSantis's campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notably, the tweet sets a target of 1 million engagements before the collected donations will be allocated to Ron DeSantis's campaign. This initiative showcases the growing intersection of digital currencies and political fundraising, highlighting the evolving dynamics of engagement and support in the modern era.</p>

This alignment positions $RON at the forefront of innovative token projects, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and supporters of Governor DeSantis alike.</p>
<p>Investors and supporters of $RON can be assured of its potential for growth and impact in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technological Innovation: $RON represents a groundbreaking blend of digital culture and politics, showcasing an innovative approach to campaign financing.

By combining the power of blockchain technology with the enthusiasm of crypto-enthusiast DeSantis supporters, $RON aims to bridge the gap between politics and crypto, paving the way for a more inclusive and progressive future.</p>

Their expertise in trading, NFTs, and Solidity ensures a strong foundation for the project's success. Additionally, the team is supported by a dedicated marketing group, the Brother Marketing team, which brings its skills and creativity to amplify the reach and impact of $RON.</p>
<p>While the primary focus of $RON is to support Governor Ron DeSantis's presidential campaign, there are plans to introduce various forms of utility to the token. Staking incentives, NFTs, and other WEB3/DeFi-related utilities are among the possibilities that may be explored in the dynamic and ever-evolving WEB3 space. The $RON team remains committed to adapting to market trends and seizing opportunities that add value to the token and its community.</p>
