According to Jorn Lambert, chief digital officer at Mastercard, "there is still a high desire for cryptocurrencies among clients".</p><p>“There’s a lot of consumers out there that are really interested in this, and intrigued by crypto, but would feel a lot more confident if those services were offered by their financial institutions... It’s a little scary to some people still.” Mastercard’s chief digital officer, Jorn Lambert, told CNBC.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Is the dream of escaping banks dead?</h3><p>Many in the cryptocurrency community view blockchain technology as a way to liberate people from banks, now every major banking institution seems to be aggressively moving to take positions within the crypto market.<br /><br />According to Mastercard, many people prefer having their bank involved. They claim that when they surveyed customers, almost 60% of those surveyed stated they were willing to own cryptocurrency in the future but preferred to do so through their current bank.<br /><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Mastercard's bold offer to banks: We're ready to handle every major concern...</h3><p></p><p>Large investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan already have specialized crypto teams, but still haven't offered a way for their clients to buy cryptocurrency - but they may be more likely to begin if all they need to do is trust Mastercard, rather than directly partner with an exchange.<br /><br />Mastercard says that if a bank chooses them to handle crypto offerings to customers, they will handle both security and regulatory compliance - the two main concerns that have held many intuitions back.&nbsp;<br /><br />Opening to a new market usually comes with a new load of liabilities - but with Mastercard taking responsibility for them adhering to crypto compliance guidelines, confirming transactions, and offering anti-money-laundering and identity monitoring services, there's not many reasons left to say no.<br /><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Bad News for existing exchanges... maybe...</h3><p></p><p>The program will involve Mastercard routing orders to Paxos, an exchange they've already been working closely with - so if banks do embrace this Mastercard model, it may take a bite out of the pool of potential future users of Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and other exchanges operating in the U.S. <br /><br />However, if successful, Mastercard's program will likely inspire banks to create their own, similar partnerships directly with crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p><p>The pilot program will launch in the first quarter of 2023. There is currently no information on which banks will participate.<br /><br /><br /><span face="Roboto, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: small;">-------&nbsp;<br /></span><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small; user-select: text;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; user-select: text;"><b>Author:</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #252525;">Justin Derbek</span><br /></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small; user-select: text;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;"><span><span><span><span style="color: #0b5394; font-weight: bolder;">New York News Desk</span></span><b style="color: red;"><br /></b></span></span></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small; user-select: text;"><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/" style="backface-visibility: hidden; box-sizing: border-box; color: #e51515; cursor: pointer; display: inline; margin: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; touch-action: manipulation; user-select: text;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #666666; user-select: text;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></i></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
