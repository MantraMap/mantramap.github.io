<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase claims to have filed a lawsuit in a US federal court, asking the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for feedback on setting up specific rules for digital.</em></li>



<li><em>The recent lawsuit seeks answers from the SEC on a lawsuit they filed last year asking for a formal rule-making in digital assets.</em></li>



<li><em>Last month, the SEC allegedly listed and offered unregistered securities goods on Coinbase, and the agency threatened legal action against the exchange.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>According to the official <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-takes-another-formal-step-to-seek-regulatory-clarity-from-sec-for?__cf_chl_f_tk=WimG_B52luNRl8y70nrUlYI9n0GYd6Lc84zaY.TvZyQ-1682384633-0-gaNycGzNDfs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase post</a>, the exchange said it had filed a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a US federal court, intending to ask the court to order the SEC to respond lawsuit over cryptocurrency rules.</p>



<p>On Monday, Coinbase submitted an Administrative Procedure Act complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, requesting that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals require the SEC to give &#8220;regulatory clarity&#8221; regarding how applicable securities laws are applied to the digital asset sector.</p>



<p>The filing is a preemptive move by the crypto exchange amid threats from the SEC that it will sue the exchange over allegations of listing and offering unregistered securities products in September before. Coinbase is expected to respond to specific allegations by the end of April.</p>

<p>The lawsuit will force the SEC to answer yes or no to Coinbase&#8217;s July 2022 petition asking the SEC to use its official rule-making process to provide guidance to the crypto industry. A rule-making process exists so that agencies can develop regulations with the benefit of public input and have their positions examined through judicial review. More than 1,700 organizations and individuals have submitted comments to the Coinbase petition, echoing the explicit request.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;From the SEC&#8217;s public statements and enforcement activity in the crypto industry, it seems like the SEC has already made up its mind to deny our petition. But they haven&#8217;t told the public yet. So the action Coinbase filed today simply asks the court to ask the SEC to share its decision.&#8221;</p>
<cite>The exchange shared in its statement.</cite></blockquote>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Last week, digital asset investment funds had net withdrawals for the first time in six weeks, totaling $30.4 million.</em></li>



<li><em>Outflows started on April 14, just as Bitcoin reached $30,000, implying that the most recent sell-off resulted from profit-taking.</em></li>



<li><em>Ether received $17 million in inflows, indicating investor confidence after the Shanghai network improvement.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin outflows of $53.1 million <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-128-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-827534831424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped</a> end a six-week streak of inflows into digital asset investment products.</strong></h5>

<p>According to the CoinShares weekly report, digital asset investment products had a net outflow of $30.4 million last week, capping a six-week streak of inflows.</p>



<p>Outflows started on April 14, coinciding with <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183349-bitcoin-accepted-at-the-grand-bazaar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> surpassing $30,000 for the first time in over a year, implying that the current sell-off was the result of profit-taking, CoinShares reported. Overall outflows for the week as the price of BTC declined by nearly 10%.</p>



<p>There was a net outflow of $53.1 million in Bitcoin investment products, a net inflow of $16.8 million in Ethereum investment products, and a net inflow of $1.5 million in short-selling Bitcoin investment products.</p>



<p>Apart from the main two cryptocurrencies, Polygon received another $1 million in inflows this week.</p>



<p>In the preceding four weeks, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency by market size has received $310 million in inflows.</p>



<p>BTC&#8217;s price has lately steadied over $27,000, but it faces stiff resistance above $28,350.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1650407496962523137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent research</a> by Michael van de Poppe, BTC&#8217;s value has the ability to rise if it successfully breaks beyond the $27,800-$28,000 region.</p>



<p>If this happens, BTC may possibly reach $29,200. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s upward momentum, however, is dependent on whether it can maintain the breakthrough over the barrier level.</p>

<p>Traders, however, emphasized that BTC remained optimistic, anticipating a possible copycat move of price action from February when BTC/USD burst higher following a period of consolidation. Nevertheless, a new study <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-17-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that hodlers were split on whether to sell into strength, even during BTC&#8217;s run above $31,000.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="341" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-1024x341.png" alt="Teahouse Finance Raises $5 Million To Solve Centralized Liquidity Problem" class="wp-image-183648" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-1024x341.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-300x100.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-768x256.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-1536x512.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-2048x683.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-750x250.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-1140x380.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Teahouse Finance Raises $5 Million To Solve Centralized Liquidity Problem 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Teahouse Finance was founded in 2021 to address the tough, concentrated liquidity provision dilemma. In basic words, the concentrated liquidity issue arises when liquidity providers are permitted to choose a certain price range for providing liquidity in order to be more purposeful and strategic in how they supply liquidity.</p>



<p>This capability was brought to the DeFi world with the March 2021 release of Uniswap V3. Teahouse Finance was aware of the possible issue with concentrated liquidity early on and intended to be the first to overcome the complex challenge.</p>



<p>Teahouse smart contracts employ dynamic algorithms to handle customers&#8217; assets on their behalf, similar to an investment portfolio, with the bonus that users may enter/exit on a weekly basis.</p>



<p>Techniques use a variety of inputs, including market volatility, to dynamically alter liquidity pool ranges and hedge positions in order to maximize trading fees while limiting temporary loss.</p>



<p>In addition to liquidity, the company has created seven DeFi strategy vaults across several chains to assist people and companies in conveniently investing and becoming more lucrative on Web3. Initially restricted to Teahouse NFT holders, the company released its first publicly available liquidity provision strategy in January of this year, with an average APR of 54.37%.</p>



<p>Teahouse co-founder and CEO Fenix Hsu stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“With the recent collapse of trust in CEXes due to underhanded dealings by ex-industry-leaders like FTX, it is now more critical than ever to provide secure and transparent investment options that reside on-chain. We continue to focus on solving the hardest challenges, educating the community, and building an awesome ecosystem with our partners.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to its primary goal of democratizing DeFi via initiatives like Perpetual Protocol and Chainlink, Teahouse Finance plans to launch its enterprise-ready B2B offering, Teahouse Private Vaults, in Q2.</p>



<p>These unique vaults, with specific smart contracts for each investment, are managed by Safe&#8217;s multi-sig wallets, gated by NFTs, and safeguarded by action filters that allow only certain transactions to occur. Teahouse Private Vaults are intended for Web3 projects searching for a secure location to HODL or keep their assets and conventional enterprises interested in diversifying into cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Teahouse employs off-chain algorithms that communicate with the main TeaVault through smart contracts. The TeaVault, constructed on modular vaults dubbed &#8220;atomic vaults&#8221; that communicate with distinct DeFi protocols, holds the user assets on-chain.</p>



<p>According to the project team, the $5 million will be spent on numerous vault products now under development.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s DeFi interaction filters protect all transactions made possible by these vaults, and only those pre-approved are carried out automatically by smart contracts. These interactions are managed by the HighTableVault, which also handles network fees and incentive payments.</p>

<li><em>Sam Bankman-Fried parents&#8217; smartphones will be closely watched.</em></li>



<li><em>The additional phone limits come after attorneys struggled to enforce an earlier court order related to a bail issue.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Once a court <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/133/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accepts</a> the additional conditions, Sam Bankman-Fried</strong> <strong>parents&#8217; smartphones will be tightly watched while the disgraced former FTX head is under house arrest in their California home.</strong></h5>

<p>According to the latest court order, a consultant will evaluate keystroke logs and screenshots from Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried&#8217;s mobile phones at least thrice weekly.</p>



<p>The additional phone limits come after attorneys struggled to enforce an earlier court order related to a bail issue involving Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>Attorneys for FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried are <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182698-bankman-frieds-attorneys-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to satisfy bail requirements</a>, including one that requires phones used by Bankman-Fried&#8217;s parents to capture images of the user every five minutes.</p>



<p>The difficulties in satisfying Bankman-bail Fried&#8217;s requirements were detailed in a letter submitted to the court on April 19. The letter also said that the defense team has looked into other ways to lock the parents&#8217; mobile phones in a manner that conforms with the bail requirements without going into specifics.</p>



<p>On Saturday, Judge Lewis Kaplan authorized a motion to put monitoring software on the phones of Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, which would keep a tight eye on their internet surfing, applications, and texts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We believe these restrictions are sufficient to prevent Mr. Bankman-Fried from using the Parents’ Phones to circumvent his bail conditions,&#8221; Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys wrote to the court in a letter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As part of his new bail conditions, Bankman-Fried recently exchanged his smartphone for one that can&#8217;t connect to the internet and his laptop computer for one that has monitoring software and limits his internet usage.</p>



<p>The former FTX CEO has pled not guilty to criminal allegations stemming from his involvement with the now-defunct crypto exchange and its sister crypto trading company, Alameda Research. He is scheduled to stand trial in October.</p>

<p>As local administrations warm up to the electronic money known as the e-CNY, a city in eastern China&#8217;s Jiangsu province aims to utilize the mainland&#8217;s sovereign digital currency in cross-border commerce with Belt and Road nations.</p>



<p>Xuzhou, the starting point for many Chinese freight trains destined for Europe, has released a strategy to promote the e-CNY, including its use in cross-border commerce. The city has 18 frequent cross-border train links to 21 European and Asian nations.</p>



<p>One of the first CBDCs to be designed and extensively tested was the digital yuan, often known as digital RMB. Although no formal launch has occurred, the government has widened its testing parameters to cover numerous cities and millions of individuals.</p>



<p>The e-CNY may be used to &#8220;better support the Belt and Road Initiative,&#8221; according to the Xuzhou local administration, alluding to Beijing&#8217;s trade and investment drive. Originally, e-CNY will be used to pay for services and storage fees for products transported by rail. According to the idea, the e-CNY will also be utilized to pay taxes and utility services in Xuzhou in the future.</p>

Changshu, another city in the province, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183570-digital-yuan-used-to-pay-servants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it would pay civil officials and employees of government agencies using digital yuan.</p>



<p>Trials have already begun. Shenzhen, a nearby city, started giving retail discounts to Hong Kong visitors who pay with e-CNY in February. In December, the Bank of China offered cash rewards to registered clients who utilized digital yuan.</p>

<p>The United States Treasury Department&#8217;s sanctions monitor <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">barred</a> three North Koreans from aiding the Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacker squad infamous for cyber thefts that U.S. officials allege were used to fund the country&#8217;s weapons development.</p>



<p>The sanctions, issued jointly by the governments of South Korea and the United States on Monday, target a person called Sim Hyon-sop, who is connected to the Korea Kwangson Banking Company, a North Korean bank sanctioned by the UN Security Council since 2016.</p>



<p>According to the government, Sim assisted in the laundering of millions of dollars acquired illegally by North Korean IT personnel operating incognito outside and in funding the regime&#8217;s weapons projects.</p>



<p>It was the sixth penalty imposed by the Yoon Suk Yeol administration on North Korean businesses or persons, and the first on a North Korean individual linked to illicit cyber operations that the South Korean government imposed concurrently with the US.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Sim has been involved with illegally financing North Korea&#8217;s nuclear and missile programs through activities such as money laundering,” said the Foreign Ministry in Seoul.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the agency, two of the sanctioned persons, Cheng Hung Man and Wu Huihui, were over-the-counter (OTC) dealers who facilitated crypto transactions for Lazarus, while a third, Sim Hyon Sop, offered additional financial assistance.</p>



<p>Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The DPRK continues to exploit virtual currency and extensive illicit facilitation networks to access the international financial system and generate revenue for the regime.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lazarus Group has been accused of waging a multimillion-dollar campaign against the crypto world, with the earnings allegedly funding North Korea&#8217;s weapons development.</p>



<p>According to the Treasury, the hacking gang is directed by North Korea&#8217;s intelligence outfit, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, and it was responsible for the largest-ever crypto robbery, stealing $625 million in digital assets from the Ronin network linked to the Axie Infinity game.</p>

<p>A dormant Bitcoin whale address, which had not been active for 12 years, recently transferred almost $11 million in Bitcoin. The address sent 400 bitcoins in batches of 100 to another address, totaling a U.S. dollar value of $10.9 million. According to Whale Alert data, the transfer transaction fee was 19 satoshis, or $5.22.</p>

<p>Last week, a Bitcoin whale address that had been dormant for over nine years transferred 2,071.5 BTC ($60.7 million) out. During the time, another whale awoke after a decade of inactivity, transferring 279 bitcoins — worth $7.8 million — to three fresh addresses.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Standard Chartered said on Monday that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024, saying that the so-called &#8220;crypto winter&#8221; is over. However, longer-term forecasts are often inaccurate. A Citi analyst said in November 2020 that Bitcoin could climb as high as $318,000 by the end of 2022. It closed last year down about 65% at $16,500.</p>



<p>This recent trend of long-dormant wallets springing back to life has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community. Whether it signals a new wave of activity or is merely a blip on the radar remains to be seen. Only time will tell how these wallets will impact the cryptocurrency market.</p>
