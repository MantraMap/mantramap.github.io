<p>Poliant, ai private club designed especially for crypto users, has recently launched Follow the Whale, its main product. Follow the Whale is a platform that will significantly contribute to the crypto space by analyzing data and predicting important updates in the market.&nbsp;</p>
A Game Changer for the Crypto Space
<p>Poliant, a yearly founded crypto project, has just developed and launched its main product, Follow the Whale (FTWP). Follow the Whale Pool is an exclusive platform developed with the main goal of analyzing terabytes of data per second in order to anticipate crucial information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the Whale will be able to identify when a whale enters or exits the market of a cryptocurrency. The platform will achieve that by accessing large quantities of data in a very short time. The data will come from the market and exchanges in the form of data packages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By analyzing such data, Poliant and Follow the Whale aim to offer users valuable information, as well as provide additional information to AI (Artificial Intelligence) software, in order to help it act in the best way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, Follow the Whale will have one job - to follow the whale&rsquo;s signal. When a whale exit&nbsp; the market, the pool of Follow the Whale will go &ldquo;Short&rdquo;, while when a new whale enters the market, the system will go &ldquo;Buy&rdquo;. Thanks to this system, the team behind Follow the Whale can use whales&rsquo; market movements to generate rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the Whale can indeed contribute to the well-functioning of the crypto space, considering that it anticipates some events that can truly affect the crypto market. Besides, Poliant&rsquo;s focus on helping the AI industry can indeed increase the popularity of the crypto project and its main product, considering that artificial intelligence is fastly developing and gaining remarkable popularity with each day that passes.&nbsp;</p>
