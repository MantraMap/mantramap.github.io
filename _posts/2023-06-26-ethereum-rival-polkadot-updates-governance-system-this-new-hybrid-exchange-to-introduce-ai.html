Polkadot Makes Update to its Governance System
<p class="s5">Polkadot (DOT), a major Ethereum challenger, has announced a major update to its governance system to take the network into a new era of decentralization. As part of the network update, Polkadot launched OpenGov to give the Polkadot community full control of the network by allowing holders of the DOT token to vote and propose referenda to make changes to the network.</p>
<p class="s5">Polkadot hopes to transform its network into a fully autonomous, transparent, &amp; efficient decision-making network by giving users equal rights to vote. As a result, OpenGov has removed the so-called first-class voters like the Polkadot Council and the Technical Committee from the voting. Now, the amount of DOT tokens a holder has determines their voting strength.</p>
<p class="s5">In addition, this new governance infrastructure will allow for multiple governance proposals to be simultaneously voted on by the Polkadot community. With OpenGove in place, Polkadot has been transformed into a fully decentralized Web 3 project where all the governance processes are directly controlled by its community members.</p>

Tradecurve to Integrate AI Support Into Its Hybrid Exchange
<p class="s5">Since the launch of OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT in November 2022, many projects have been exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.</p>
<p class="s5">Tradecurve is a new hybrid exchange that is building the first crypto-exchange platform with AI integration to support algorithmic or automated trading.</p>
<p class="s5">With the inclusion of AI-assisted trading, Tradecurve users will be able to leverage the advanced mathematical models of the platform to make trading decisions. The AI trading feature of the platform will support several variables, including price, timing, and volume, for users to place trades automatically.</p>
<p class="s5">To add to AI trading, Tradecurve will also support copy trading. With this feature, traders can directly copy the trading positions of other more successful traders on Tradecurve.</p>
<p class="s5">As a hybrid exchange, Tradecurve combines the best features known to centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to create a well-rounded platform. Tradecurve is currently in the fourth stage of its presale, where its native utility token currently retails for $0.018 apiece, but is expected to rise by up to 40% in the upcoming week.</p>
