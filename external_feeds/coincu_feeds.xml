<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has revealed that the regulatory agency is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with Binance. </strong></h5>

<p>The discussions come in the wake of charges that the CFTC initially filed against Binance on March 27, 2023, alleging that the popular cryptocurrency exchange solicited U.S. users to trade derivatives illegally.</p>



<p>CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson has stated that her agency has been in conversation with Binance to give them the opportunity to explain their conduct and work together to find a way forward. While she has not made any definitive statements regarding the course of litigation, Johnson did reveal that the CFTC typically has preliminary conversations with companies before launching litigation.</p>

<p>Despite Binance&#8217;s initial response to the charges, where they pledged to cooperate with U.S. regulators, and a number of subsequent discussions between the two parties, the CFTC has not yet found a satisfactory resolution to the matter. Johnson noted that the discussions with Binance have been focused on addressing the exchange&#8217;s &#8220;potentially problematic&#8221; actions but that the parties have not yet decided whether to settle the case out of court or to proceed with litigation.</p>



<p>In light of this ongoing legal dispute, Johnson has called for more cryptocurrency regulation from U.S. Congress, specifically around spot trading. She believes that such regulations would fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC and would help to clarify the legal status of exchanges like Binance. While there is currently no immediate path forward in the case, Johnson remains optimistic that a solution can be found through continued discussions with Binance and other stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

We’ll be shutting down the servers on May 1st &#8211; please enjoy SBB until then, and thanks for all the memories <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2665.png" alt="♥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>&mdash; Storybook Brawl (@StorybookBrawl) <a href="https://twitter.com/StorybookBrawl/status/1650879463922749440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Despite exploring various options, the team has decided to discontinue the game. This news comes after FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, acquired the digital game developer Good Luck Games LLC in March 2022, with SBF mentioning at the time that the purchase would explore the intersection of NFTs, crypto, blockchain, and gaming.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the free-to-play card game gained widespread popularity after reports emerged that SBF played it during meetings and calls. The game&#8217;s popularity has skyrocketed, amassing a loyal fan base disappointed by the shutdown. Gustavo Affonso, a gamer, expressed his willingness to contribute to crowdfunding efforts to keep the game running. The game&#8217;s fanbase is passionate and dedicated to keeping it alive.</p>



<p>Interestingly, SBF&#8217;s crypto empire collapsed in November 2022 after experiencing a bank run, leading to a decline in its stablecoin reserves. Since then, executives of the firm, including SBF, have been charged with criminal offenses. As of now, SBF is currently facing several criminal charges in connection to the case.</p>



<p>The shutdown of Storybook Brawl&#8217;s servers is a significant blow to the gaming community, especially those interested in cryptocurrency. With the rising popularity of gaming with cryptocurrency, this decision could not have come at a worse time. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that the gaming industry is always evolving, and something new is always on the horizon.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency lending platform CoinLoan suspends all user services, including withdrawals.</em></li>



<li><em>The suggestion is that the company is going through bankruptcy proceedings even though it has not officially filed for bankruptcy.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform&#8217;s surprise announcement was made due to &#8220;no other choice&#8221;.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On April 26, crypto lending platform CoinLoan <a href="https://coinloan.io/blog/important-message-to-all-coinloaners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in a recent announcement that it had received a notice of restricted processing, asking to stop all user activities, including user withdrawals.</strong></h5>

<p>CoinLoan called the announcement &#8220;surprise&#8221; and said the changes would take effect immediately, adding that it &#8220;had no choice but to comply.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;A Notice of restraint on disposition received yesterday, April 24, 2023, obliges CoinLoan to halt all operations for its users, including withdrawals. This action is unexpected and has an immediate effect. As a result, we have no choice but to comply with the said requirements. We are doing everything possible to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice also states that CoinLoan cannot dispose of assets without the consent of the temporary liquidator. It also hinted that bankruptcy proceedings are underway, although the company has not confirmed that it has filed for bankruptcy.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Our legal team has provided sufficient arguments to prove CoinLoan&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations. The appointment of the interim trustee seems to be the easiest way for the court to find a solution by letting an independent third party verify the financial situation of the company. We are going to file an appeal, but we must also obey the existing court ruling.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lending platform has been waning since July following the Terra crisis and the collapse of a series of significant crypto funds. It had to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/105697-coinloan-decreases-withdrawal-limit-by-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limit</a> user withdrawals in July 2022, which also applies to the FTX crisis in November 2022. In both cases, CoinLoan set a daily withdrawal limit of 5,000 dollars, and it needs to be clarified if the platform will remove this withdrawal limit.</p>

<p>The agreement marks an important step in FTX&#8217;s efforts to return funds to stakeholders following its bankruptcy filing in November 2022.</p>



<p>FTX acquired LedgerX in 2021 and rebranded the service as US Derivatives. The move was seen as a strategic one, with the acquisition allowing FTX to expand its reach in the derivatives trading market. However, FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy filing put those plans on hold.</p>



<p>Now, with the agreement to sell LedgerX to M7 Holdings, an affiliate of Miami International Holdings, Inc., FTX and its debtors expect to earn $50 million from the deal. FTX CEO John Ray III expressed optimism about the sale and its potential to benefit stakeholders.</p>



<p>The sale agreement is set to be approved in a court hearing on May 4, 2023. Assuming the agreement is approved, Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIH) will carry out the purchase itself, according to a separate announcement from the buyer.</p>



<p>MIH is the owner of the Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX), and has made strategic investments in the crypto industry. For example, in April 2023, MIAX invested in CoinFLEX, a crypto firm that has faced controversy in recent months. While many investors have denied investing in OPNX, the successor to failed crypto firms Three Arrows Capital and CoinFLEX, MIAX&#8217;s investment in CoinFLEX suggests that the company sees value in the crypto industry despite the risks and controversies that come with it.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The New York Fed has restricted its reverse repurchase program (RRP) partner standards, which could prevent stablecoin issuer Circle from obtaining a Fed loan.</em></li>



<li><em>Circle is said to have placed about $25 billion in short-term US Treasury reserves in a separate fund managed by BlackRock called the Circle Reserve fund.</em></li>



<li><em>The RRP allows selected partners to lend to the Fed overnight at a fixed rate (currently 4.8%).</em></li>
</ul>

<p>According to a press release from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the funds are &#8220;organized for a single beneficial owner&#8221; and registered as a &#8220;2a-7 fund&#8221; with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) &#8220;will generally be considered ineligible.&#8221; Because the Circle Reserve Fund seems to fall into this category.</p>



<p>Circle is said to have placed about $25 billion in short-term US Treasury reserves in a separate fund <a href="https://news.coincu.com/139450-circle-internet-financial-usdc-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed </a>by BlackRock called the Circle Reserve fund. According to an earlier press release from Circle and the SEC filing with the fund, the Circle Reserve Fund is only used by Circle and is registered as a &#8220;2a-7&#8221; government money market fund.</p>



<p>RRP allows selected partners (e.g. money market funds, banks) to lend to the Fed overnight at a fixed rate (currently 4.8%). While the instrument was originally created as a stabilizing tool for the financial system, it has since become an attractive means of obtaining high returns with minimal counterparty risk. Currently, the funding for the program is nearly $2.3 trillion.</p>



<p>In January, the Banking Policy Institute, a key advocacy group for US banks, said Circle&#8217;s USDC with access to the RRP would create &#8220;a stable currency effectively backed by the Fed.&#8221; and potentially destabilize the financial system. Fox-Geen added that this access would pave the way to move USDC&#8217;s remaining cash reserves from partner banks to funds under Fed accounts.</p>

<p>When its financial partner Silicon Valley Bank abruptly failed last month, USDC faced a problem and briefly lost its peg. Until the government bailed out depositors who had more deposits above the deposit insurance limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, almost $3.3 billion of USDC&#8217;s cash reserve stored at SVB remains unreachable for days and sent shockwaves across the stablecoin market.</p>

<p>Romero emphasized the importance of taking action to address the primary feature that makes cryptocurrencies appealing to illicit finance— anonymity. She stressed that the risks associated with digital assets must be managed because market integrity, national security, and financial stability are crucial and cannot be compromised.</p>



<p>Romero suggested that reducing the anonymity of cryptocurrencies is a potential solution for mitigating illicit finance risks in the cryptocurrency market. She explained that while public blockchains provide some transparency and traceability, mixers and anonymity-enhancing technology increase the potential for substantial risk. Mixers are services that blend many users&#8217; cryptocurrencies to confuse the funds&#8217; origins and owners. This level of privacy is hard to achieve in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other public blockchains because they are transparent. Therefore, Romero encouraged all crypto companies to distance themselves from mixers and anonymity-enhanced technology while still appropriately providing financial privacy for their customers.</p>



<p>Romero also highlighted the importance of identity verification, stating that two mixers— Blender and Tornado Cash—were recently sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department. Tornado Cash was allegedly involved in laundering $7 billion, including millions of dollars stolen by the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus Group, which has been involved in cyberattacks to aid illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Thus, identity verification is crucial to prevent crypto&#8217;s use for illicit finance.</p>

<p>Romero emphasized that there is a distinction between financial privacy and anonymity. Traditional finance (TradFi) ensures financial privacy by verifying the customer&#8217;s identity through Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) measures without relying on anonymity-enhancing technology. Therefore, Romero encouraged exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to verify the digital identity of users, pointing out that more often than not, DeFi services are not fully decentralized but instead maintained by central parties who could verify identities and may be held accountable for doing so.</p>



<p>Romero mentioned that there are existing technologies to provide digital identity and more are being developed. Congress is also considering new laws addressing anonymity and digital identity. The U.S. government will continue to prioritize preventing crypto&#8217;s use for illicit finance.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American investment management business Ark Invest, which is led by Cathie Wood, purchased further shares of Coinbase Global Inc. This occurred on the same day that the cryptocurrency exchange announced that it will be suing the SEC.</p>



<p>According to a trading notification that was sent out via email, the ARK Innovation ETF purchased 122,083 shares of Coinbase, and the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/176580-the-banking-crisis-is-bullish-for-crypto/">ARK</a> Next Generation Internet ETF purchased another 20,327 shares. Both ETFs are managed by the Ark Invest. During this time, the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF purchased 14,633 shares of the company.</p>



<p>Coinbase, one of the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges, recently made news when it announced the purchase of shares that were valued at approximately $8.6 million based on current pricing. This development follows Coinbase&#8217;s submission of a rule-making petition to the SEC during the summer of 2018, in which the company requested permission to provide a new loan product to its customers. However, a recent complaint that Coinbase filed against the SEC provides evidence that the regulatory agency did not reply to the petition in the appropriate manner.</p>

<p>The SEC has allegedly threatened to take legal action against the firm if it continues to operate its loan product, but according to the lawsuit, the SEC has not provided clear instructions on how Coinbase should operate its lending product. Instead, the SEC has threatened to take legal action against the company. If Coinbase&#8217;s lawsuit is successful, a federal judge may order the SEC to formulate new guidelines, but this outcome is contingent on the SEC&#8217;s continued resistance to the company&#8217;s demands.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Deatons-Support-Helps-Coinbase-Win-Lawsuit-Against-SEC-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Deatons-Support-Helps-Coinbase-Win-Lawsuit-Against-SEC-1.jpeg" alt="John Deatons Support Helps Coinbase Win Lawsuit Against SEC 1" class="wp-image-183849" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Deatons-Support-Helps-Coinbase-Win-Lawsuit-Against-SEC-1.jpeg 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Deatons-Support-Helps-Coinbase-Win-Lawsuit-Against-SEC-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Deatons-Support-Helps-Coinbase-Win-Lawsuit-Against-SEC-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Deatons-Support-Helps-Coinbase-Win-Lawsuit-Against-SEC-1-750x500.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="John Deaton&#039;s Support Helps Coinbase Win Lawsuit Against SEC 28"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This move is unprecedented as it is not common for a company to file a lawsuit against a regulator. However, Deaton is pleased that Coinbase followed his footsteps in filing the second Writ of Mandamus against the commission.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@coinbase</a> filing today is the 2nd Writ of Mandamus filed involving Crypto. I <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> the Petition b/c I filed Crypto’s 1st Writ of Mandamus when I sued the SEC asking a judge to order the SEC to do its job and amend the <a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Ripple</a> Complaint to only include direct sales by Ripple. <a href="https://t.co/9hd8ZyRhup" target="_blank">https://t.co/9hd8ZyRhup</a></p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1650748541344546820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Deaton was the first person to file such a lawsuit in the history of the crypto ecosystem in the country, and it was on behalf of XRP. His Writ of Mandamus aimed to get the SEC to amend its complaints against Ripple by limiting the focus to XRP coins sold by the blockchain payments firm. This would ensure that the SEC could not indict even secondary sales of the digital currency. While Deaton was not fixated on the key details of his own lawsuit, he was more amused to see that more entities in the industry are standing up to the SEC and demanding better regulatory governance.</p>



<p>Drawing parallels with the Coinbase lawsuit, Deaton said the SEC cannot keep citing one case to back its claims based on the Howey Test that was formed more than seven decades ago. He further added that the SEC needs to realize that the crypto industry is constantly evolving, and therefore, its regulatory framework should also evolve to keep up with the changes. Deaton believes that it is time for the SEC to take a fresh approach towards regulating the crypto industry and work with industry participants to create a fair and balanced regulatory environment that encourages innovation while protecting investors.</p>

<p>According to the most recent release, the primary objective of Starknet in 2023 will be to improve the user experience (UX). Following that year, the company will place its attention on decentralization in addition to making decisions that define the network.</p>



<p>In particular, during the year 2023, Starknet will concentrate on issues such as usage efficiency, network throughput and latency, transaction costs, and transaction speed. The plan for this endeavor is as explicitly outlined below.</p>



<p>In accordance with this, this year is also the year when Starknet begins the &#8220;Regenesis&#8221; phase, which upgrades Cairo 0 smart contracts to Cairo 1.0 version without requiring the network to restart or having any interruptions.</p>

<p>The final chapter of the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/180183-aave-v3-on-starknet/">Starknet</a> roadmap includes a number of major milestones, including one called &#8220;Regenesis.&#8221; From that point forward, any important future network changes will be decided by the community through decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance.</p>



<p>Notably, when the 2024 sharing project will be the year of network decentralization, many people have implicitly predicted that this may be the moment when layer-2 will launch the STRK token to serve as project governance. This is notable since the year 2024 will be the year the sharing project will be the year of network decentralization. Starknet made its initial announcement regarding the implementation of STRK and its deployment to the Ethereum mainnet back in November of the previous year. This announcement served to establish the tokenomics associated with the coin.</p>



<p>This concept is comparable to the layer-2 zkSync Era project, which likewise announced in 2024 that it will place an emphasis on network decentralization.</p>
