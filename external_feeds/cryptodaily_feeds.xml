			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve in 2023, various platforms have continued to compete and evolve to meet users&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p>While Polygon and Polkadot are popular cryptocurrencies, they are facing increasing competition from other coins. One of these coins is Tradecurve&rsquo;s TCRV token. Tradecurve.io is a new DEX project that has been gaining popularity among investors due to its plan for low fees, fast transaction times, and intuitive user interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve.io Token Set To Surge&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve, is an innovative decentralized exchange (DEX) solution that has been the talk of Web3 community for weeks. Tradecurve will offer lower fees, faster transaction times, and a more user-friendly interface than most other crypto trading platforms</p>
<p>At its core, Tradecurve is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that enables users to trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without the need for a centralized authority. Tradecurve uses an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm to determine prices and liquidity for trading pairs, and supports a wide range of tokens and assets.</p>
<p>In addition to Tradecurve&rsquo;s DEX capabilities, they will also offer yield farming and liquidity mining opportunities, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity to the platform. Tradecurve also features a suite of analytics and trading tools to help traders make more informed decisions and optimize their trading strategies.</p>
<p>Holders of Tradecurve&rsquo;s native token, $TCRV, have access to a number of benefits including trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and best of all, the astounding profit potential of a 500:1 trading leverage.</p>
<p>Tradecurve&rsquo;s token (TCRV) is currently at the first stage of presale, selling at $0.01. Once the tokens at this stage are sold out, the price will pump to $0.088 at launch</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) Price Prediction</p>
<p>The Polygon network was designed as a layer 2 solution based on the Ethereum blockchain. Polygon aims to enable Dapps, smart contracts, and transactions at a quicker and more affordable rate than the Ethereum network. The Polygon network's native token, MATIC, is in charge of the administration, transaction fees, and security of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Polygon peaked in 2021, Polygon&rsquo;s MATIC has decreased in value by 67% and is now only worth $1.09 per token. As a result, many Polygon investors have started selling their Polygon (MATIC) assets and shifting their attention to better investment alternatives.</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) News</p>
<p>Polkadot is a multi-chain platform that aims to provide interoperability between different blockchains. Polkadot (DOT)has gained a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency space. This is mostly due to the Polkadot network&rsquo;s unique architecture and potential to enable cross-chain communication. However, recent price analyses of the Polkadot platform&rsquo;s token DOT have shown a consistent bearish trend.</p>
<p>The price of Polkadot (DOT) has already dropped 15% last month and is on the verge of falling another 15%. The Polkadot drop follows the rise on Wednesday, which was preceded by a technical rejection and many support level breaches. Traders and investors are currently unsure of the feasibility of a Polkadot (DOT) bullish run.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) and WOO Network (WOO) enthusiasts are shifting their focus to Yachtify (YCHT) &ndash; a project in its first token presale phase with the potential to revolutionize the yacht industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts have predicted that early investors will receive as high as 4,000x their initial investment. This makes it an attractive opportunity for those seeking to diversify their portfolio and invest in real-world assets using cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Shows Bearish Pattern</p>
<p>Since March 17th, Bitcoin's (BTC) price has been exhibiting a head and shoulders pattern, which is often considered a bearish indicator as it usually signals a potential drop in prices. Currently, the neckline of this pattern is situated at $27,500.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Bitcoin's (BTC) value drops below this level, it could experience a further decline to $23,200, which corresponds to the 0.5 Fib retracement support level. However, if Bitcoin (BTC) manages to break above the right shoulder of the pattern, it could defy the bearish trend and potentially climb to $42,000.</p>
<p>Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,083.75, with a 24-hour trading volume of $14,918,910,435. This reflects a 1.42% increase in the last 24 hours and a 2.57% rise over the past week.</p>
<p>WOO Network (WOO) Price Bounces After Recent Fall&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2023, WOO Network (WOO) price has been rising within a long-term ascending parallel channel. On April 15th, the token's price declined after facing rejection at the channel's resistance line.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, WOO Network (WOO) found support at the $0.26 horizontal level and is currently trading in the upper part of the channel. If WOO Network's (WOO) upward trend persists, the next resistance stands at $0.36. Conversely, if the price drops, WOO Network (WOO) may revisit the $0.26 support area.</p>
<p>According to CoinGecko, the WOO Network (WOO) price stands at $0.294097, with a 24-hour trading volume of $47,360,074. This is a 12.38% increase in the last 24 hours and a 9.05% rise over the last week.</p>
<p>Yachtify (YCHT) Offers A Chance For Low-income Earners To Penetrate The $100B+ Yacht Industry&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yachtify is building an ecosystem that will serve the needs of cryptocurrency supporters and yacht lovers alike. The platform will offer a marketplace for users to invest in fractional amounts of NFTs that are backed by physical yachts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will also feature a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans at competitive rates by using their NFT assets and physical yachts as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, Yachtify will establish a rewards club for its members, providing them access to curated networking events, unique NFT releases, and premium benefits. Meanwhile, the platform has taken a step to ensure funds are safe and the token's price does not drop.</p>
<p>To prevent a sudden sell-off at launch, tokens are vested, with investors receiving 20% of their tokens each week for five weeks. Yachtify's initial presale phase offers tokens for only $0.1 each, with a 30% bonus for early investors who purchase before the price hike at the end of this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yachtify has the potential for significant growth and could potentially become a blue-chip cryptocurrency. Smart investors are already bagging Yachtify tokens, you should do the same.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Kenya is considering implementing a 3% tax on cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) transfers as part of the country's proposed budget.</p>
Latest Budget Proposes Crypto Tax
<p>The latest budget proposal for the country has a contingency for taxing crypto transactions, including NFT transfers. The Finance Bill 2023, presented to the Kenyan parliament on May 4 by the country&rsquo;s finance ministry, the National Treasury, has proposed levying a 3% tax on all &ldquo;income derived from the transfer or exchange of digital assets.&rdquo; The proposal has also included NFTs in its definition of &ldquo;digital assets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto exchanges or those who initiate the transfer of crypto or NFTs would be required to collect the tax, having to deduct 3% of the transfers&rsquo; value to be paid to the government. Exchanges not registered in Kenya would have to register under the tax regime.</p>
<p>As just a proposed bill, the legislature has a long journey ahead before it can become law. It will need to pass through five rounds of readings, committees, and reports by the National Assembly. In the next major step, it will end up at the President's desk, who will take the final call to pass it into law.&nbsp;</p>
Raising Funds Through High Taxes
<p>The proposal intends to raise revenue for the East African country, which has been facing an economic crisis since the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has hit the Kenyan economy hard, with many businesses shutting down and unemployment rates skyrocketing.</p>
<p>The bill is also looking to generate revenue for the government by taxing digital content monetization. This means that online celebrities and influencers could have to give up 15% of their earnings on monetized content on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. The scope of the taxable earnings will extend to brand deals and sponsorships, affiliate marketing, merchandise sales, and paid subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the bill also proposes to increase taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic drinks, as well as introduce a tax on plastic waste.</p>
Where Does Kenya Stand?&nbsp;
<p>The proposed tax has received mixed reactions from the Kenyan cryptocurrency community. Some believe that the tax will help regulate the industry and generate revenue for the government, while others fear that it may stifle innovation and drive away investment. In addition, the governor of the Central Bank of Kenya has shown an aversion to the trend of converting the country&rsquo;s reserves into Bitcoin, even though the institution has been exploring its CBDC options.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Discover four cryptos that could help you build an explosive portfolio. Learn about NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Gala (GALA), Curve DAO (CRV), and Uwerx and why they could benefit your portfolio. Don't miss out on investing in these promising cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts are constantly searching for the next digital asset that could deliver explosive returns on investments (ROI) for their portfolio. The best practice is to seek coins that have performed well in the past, like NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Gala (GALA), and Curve DAO (CRV).</p>
<p>However, new cryptos in their presale stage, like Uwerx, could also deliver explosive returns. Heading into the new week, here&rsquo;s why these four tokens could benefit your portfolio.</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Delivering More Blockchain Scalability Than Ethereum (ETH)</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is a smart-contract-enabled Layer-1 blockchain ecosystem that allows developers to develop and deploy dApps. Often listed among the rivals to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) aims to provide a faster and cheaper blockchain solution to Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>However, users, developers, and investors are keener on the network because it promises faster throughput compared to other competitors. NEAR Protocol&rsquo;s (NEAR) throughput can go as high as 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). That is above Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Algorand (ALGO), which have 3,000 TPS, 4,500 TPS, and 6,000 TPS, respectively.</p>
<p>As a result of this keen interest, many analysts believe that the value of NEAR, the native utility token of the NEAR Protocol (NEAR), could hit $2.93 within Q4 2023.</p>
<p>GALA (GALA): Improving Gala Games User Experience</p>
<p>GALA (GALA) is the native utility coin for the Gala Games ecosystem. It is the primary token used to purchase NFT items and also the reward received by Founder&rsquo;s Node operators in exchange for running nodes. In addition, it is the gas token used to pay network fees on the Gala (GALA) network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focusing on GameFi and Web3, the intention of the developers of GALA Games is for GALA (GALA) to offer a viable and secure payment mode and settlement between participants interacting within the Gala Games ecosystem.</p>
<p>As a result, GALA (GALA) has been rising in value amid a wave of optimism thanks to the network's ongoing expansion and development. The ecosystem recently implemented the GALA token burn mechanism used whenever customers make purchases on the GALA (GALA) platform.</p>
<p>As of writing, GALA (GALA) had a daily increase of 3.72%. This data was obtained from CoinMarketCap. Currently trading at $0.035, priceprediction.net predicts the coin to reach $0.065 within Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Curve DAO (CRV): Powering Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</p>
<p>Curve DAO (CRV) is an Ethereum-based crypto that powers Curve Finance, a blockchain-based decentralized exchange (DEX) that leverages an automated market maker (AMM) system. The Curve protocol facilitates the exchange of various ERC-20 tokens while offering swap support for Ethereum-based Bitcoin (BTC) tokens and stablecoins like Dai (DAI). As a decentralized exchange that links users to exchanges with the best pricing, Curve provides low slippage rates and low costs for trading digital coins.</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): Aiming To Disrupt The Gig Economy</p>
<p>Uwerx will likely be the future of the gig economy and freelancing. By bringing the power of blockchain technology and its unique features to the freelance industry, the InterFi Network and Solidproof audit-approved soon-to-launch project will revolutionize an already innovative industry.</p>
<p>For the presale, the revolutionary crypto project will accept up to 18 different cryptos as payment, improving payment flexibility. At the end of the presale, liquidity tokens of developers will be locked for 25 years to reinforce developers' commitment and investors' funds' security. Plus, the team will forfeit smart contract ownership of the project when taxes hit zero to give investors more assurance about the project and prevent rug pulls.</p>
<p>As a result, we strongly believe that WERX value can reach $1.20 in Q4 2023. So, why sit on the fence? Join the most exciting presale at $0.00995 before the price increase to $0.012 on Satuday and enjoy a 20% purchase bonus whilst your at it! An alpha version of the platform is also due to be unveiled within the current stage.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Failure to invest in the right projects in crypto often results in a long wait for profits or losses. With gains the primary drive in crypto investment, investors have made it a habit to find safer projects with a significant likelihood of gains that they can invest in. Sparklo presale is currently that project, and investors are actively investing in it.</p>
<p>Near Protocol (NEAR): Partnership with Cosmose Likely to Impact Price in the Future</p>
<p>Near Protocol (NEAR) recently announced a partnership with Cosmose AI, an AI-based company primarily focused on retail shopping. An undisclosed amount of funding was provided by Near Protocol (NEAR) to Cosmose AI to assist in its quest to make crypto payments cheaper. Today, the company is estimated to be valued at about $500 million, thanks in part to Near Protocol&rsquo;s (NEAR) funding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cosmose is also planning to integrate its customers&rsquo; data into the Near Protocol (NEAR) blockchain to improve efficiency. This is expected to impact its price at some point, which many enthusiasts share.</p>
<p>However, Near Protocol (NEAR) is still trading at $1.8, down by a considerable 4% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing. This bearish descent was followed by a further extension over the past 30 days, down by 8.5%. While a rally in the price of Near Protocol (NEAR) might be imminent, investors are nonetheless opting for the Sparklo presale. They believe its growth will be more significant than that of the Near Protocol (NEAR).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY SPARKLO TOKENS&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK): An Innovative Project Poised to Disrupt The Investment Industry</p>
<p>In addition, to promote transparency, the KYC audit is almost at its final stage, while the smart contract has been audited by InterFi Network, which it passed with flying colors. Without forgetting the liquidity, it has been locked for a lifetime&mdash;100 years&mdash;which has further improved trust in the project.</p>
<p>Sparklo is projected to have significant growth in the coming months thanks to its innovative fundamentals, imminent adoption, and supportive community. Sparklo is an innovative blockchain-based investment platform aiming to provide more access to investment in gold, silver, and platinum, which is an unprecedented move.</p>
<p>The Sparklo investment platform aims to provide the opportunity to own and invest in bits of precious metals through fractionalized NFTs. By owning bits of NFT, investors are possessing digital assets backed by real-world rare assets. To possess the physical asset directly and not through NFTs, investors can purchase the complete NFT, and it will be delivered directly to them.</p>
<p>Today, Sparklo&rsquo;s presale is worth a cheap price of only $0.017 and an additional 30% bonus until May 5th. It also comes with high growth potential, which analysts have predicted to surpass 3,000% the following year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the smart contract has been audited by InterFi Network, which it convincingly passed. In addition, there is an ongoing KYC audit and a liquidity lock of 100 years, which improves investors&rsquo; confidence.</p>

"It offers unprecedented levels of interoperability and scalability for developers and players alike, opening up exciting new possibilities for in-game experiences and interactions."</p>

<p>Multichain tech offers limitless possibilities for new in-game experiences, including cross-chain quests, inter-game tournaments, and franchise crossovers. ReneVerse is leading the way in asset interoperability technology that uses innovative metadata solutions and also benefits from multichain functionality. The developers can use their robust SDK to select their preferred blockchain while still being able to communicate and exchange assets with other blockchain projects.</p>

<p>"ReneVerse's multichain capabilities will enable developers to communicate and collaborate on multiple blockchain networks, enriching both player experiences and developer outcomes," adds Dang.</p>

<p>ReneVerse's commitment to advancing the potential of multichain technology is evident in its ongoing efforts to create a seamless gaming ecosystem that fosters creativity, collaboration, and excitement for both players and developers. As more and more projects embrace the power of multichain, the possibilities for web3 gaming will continue to grow exponentially.</p>
<p>Anik Dang, Founder and CEO of ReneVerse concludes, "We are passionate about revolutionizing the gaming industry by bringing the value of web3 technology and multichain functionality to the forefront. Gaming should be accessible, enjoyable, and rewarding for everyone, and multichain technology is one way to achieve that goal."</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore, May 03, 2023 &mdash; ReneVerse, a leading name in web3 gaming and asset interoperability, is set to revolutionize the gaming industry by embracing the potential of multichain technology. Through facilitating cross-blockchain communication, asset interoperability, and cross-platform compatibility between different blockchain networks and technologies, multichain facilitates cross-chain communication and asset interoperability.</p>
<p>Multichain functionality in web3 gaming enables game developers to select the blockchain that meets their game's scalability, security, and performance requirements. This way, they can stay connected with other blockchains. Players also benefit from multichain technology, as they can access and use their digital assets in any game, regardless of the blockchain on which they are stored. This not only expands the selection of playable games but also broadens the diversity of the player community, creating massive content variety and freedom of choice within gaming experiences.</p>

<p>"In the world of web3 gaming, multichain technology is a game-changer," says Anik Dang, Founder and CEO of ReneVerse. "It offers unprecedented levels of interoperability and scalability for developers and players alike, opening up exciting new possibilities for in-game experiences and interactions."</p>

<p>Multichain tech offers limitless possibilities for new in-game experiences, including cross-chain quests, inter-game tournaments, and franchise crossovers. ReneVerse is leading the way in asset interoperability technology that uses innovative metadata solutions and also benefits from multichain functionality. The developers can use their robust SDK to select their preferred blockchain while still being able to communicate and exchange assets with other blockchain projects.</p>

<p>"ReneVerse's multichain capabilities will enable developers to communicate and collaborate on multiple blockchain networks, enriching both player experiences and developer outcomes," adds Dang.</p>

<p>ReneVerse's commitment to advancing the potential of multichain technology is evident in its ongoing efforts to create a seamless gaming ecosystem that fosters creativity, collaboration, and excitement for both players and developers. As more and more projects embrace the power of multichain, the possibilities for web3 gaming will continue to grow exponentially.</p>
<p>Anik Dang, Founder and CEO of ReneVerse concludes, "We are passionate about revolutionizing the gaming industry by bringing the value of web3 technology and multichain functionality to the forefront. Gaming should be accessible, enjoyable, and rewarding for everyone, and multichain technology is one way to achieve that goal."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market is simmering away, waiting for a sharp breakout that will propel it into a new bull run. AI could lead the charge.</p>
Bitcoin breakout soon?
<p>Those who experienced previous bull markets may say that the crypto space is a trifle boring right now. Yes, bitcoin did rise over 100% since the beginning of the year, but apart from the odd surge up or down, it has generally moved sideways.</p>
<p>A downward trendline has formed for bitcoin since its high for this rally earlier in April. On the weekly time frame there have now been 4 touches of this line so a breakout could be on the cards for next week as long as the price stays around the current level of $29,000.</p>
AI narrative remains strong in crypto
<p>Looking at the altcoins, it can be noted that for several of them the higher, weekly time frame Stochastic RSIs are either at the bottom, or are close to coming down and resetting.</p>
<p>It might be further noted that of these coins, several of them are AI-related. It must be remembered that some of the AI (artificial intelligence) coins were among the best performers over the whole of this latest crypto rally which topped in early February.</p>
<p>$AGIX was the most successful among them. From lift-off on January 2 of this year, $AGIX rose 1,370% in only 6 weeks. Since that time it has drifted sideways and down, coming down to almost touch the 61.8 Fibonacci level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>$AGIX has nearly come back down to this level again, which has good support, formed back in 2021, with the added attraction that the weekly time frame Stochastic RSI is at the bottom and just waiting for a cross up.</p>
<p>Fetch.ai ($FET) was another bright star of the AI altcoins. $FET achieved 520% over the same time period as $AGIX, but if one was to take into account that it started its surge back in November then this would give it a rise of 1,060%.</p>
<p>One further AI-related altcoin that could start another surge soon is Alethea Artificial Liquid Intelligence ($ALI). Since the beginning of the year this coin surged 1,171%, but like $FET, if you take it from the low, it rose over 1,900% since early November.</p>
<p>It must be noted that many factors need to be taken into account before trading any cryptocurrencies. World financial markets and new regulatory impositions are also part of this.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins are back in crypto in earnest. Pepe the frog, based on thin air, is roaring towards a $1 billion market cap.</p>
All aboard the Pepe meme train
<p>Pepe &ndash; the digital token named after one of the most iconic internet memes ever &ndash; has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. Its market capitalisation is fast approaching 1 billion dollars and its value has skyrocketed recently due to growing support from investors worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret to Pepes success lies in its unique branding and community driven nature. It was launched as a fun project by a group of crypto enthusiasts but has rapidly grown into something much bigger than anyone could have anticipated. The current uptrend for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is also driving interest in Pepe further contributing to its rapid rise in popularity.&nbsp;</p>
A word of caution
<p>However, those wishing to jump onto the Pepe bandwagon and take advantage of the widely expected moon shot need to understand that everything about the Pepe the frog crypto meme coin is pure casino.</p>
<p>Fundamentals do not exist, and the friendly frog is likely to disappear as rapidly as it appeared. Be that as it may, it seems that the kind of retail investor that jumps onto these meme coins just doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>The thought of quick money, and for a very few, massive returns, just inspires those retail investors who want to get rich quick. Social media is all part of it, and influencers who hype coins like this and drive buyers into a frenzy all do their bit.</p>
<p>The sad part of it is that the vast majority of retail who jump on this now could likely lose a large chunk of their investment, if not all of it. The cryptocurrency sector is a complex space, and many new investors who are only here for the memes will not understand how to manage their accounts, especially, God forbid, if they are using leverage.</p>
<p>How much longer Pepe continues to rocket skyward is anyone&rsquo;s guess. 1,300% over the last 3 weeks isn&rsquo;t a bad return, and for those who bought very early and held, many thousands of percent would be their prize.</p>
Good for crypto?
<p>The crypto sector has a heritage of openness and is entirely neutral to anyone who wants to launch a token on a blockchain. However, for those who are watching the crypto industry from outside, and who are perhaps involved in, or pro the banking sector shall we say, might see this casino in play and may well use it as an example to confirm their distrust of the sector.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Pepe fever may continue for the time being. For the investors who lose out, you have been warned &hellip;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain security firm CertiK has revealed that it has frozen around $160,000, which was stolen during the Merlin DEX rug pull last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merlin, a zkSync-based decentralized exchange, fell victim to an insider rug pull, resulting in a loss of $1.8 million.&nbsp;</p>
Stolen Funds Blocked&nbsp;
<p>The blockchain security firm and smart contract auditor shared the news of the freezing of funds via its official Twitter handle. CertiK tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to provide the community with an update regarding the Merlin DEX incident that took place on April 25th, when Merlin insiders rugpulled their users for $1.8M. This was an internal rug pull. Merlin insiders abused the owner&rsquo;s wallet privileges. We initially tried to collaborate with the remaining members of the Merlin team, but a number of core members were unwilling to verify their true identities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to CertiK, the firm tried to reach out and collaborate with members of the Merlin team. However, they were unwilling to verify their identities, leading to complications in efforts to aid victims of the rug pull.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This lack of cooperation has complicated our efforts to validate and aid victims. We are focusing on working with law enforcement and have submitted information to relevant US &amp; UK agencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The firm also added that it was monitoring the stolen funds and working with law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have successfully frozen $160K of the stolen funds with the help of partners. We will continue to monitor the movement of all stolen funds in an attempt to freeze and recover the remaining amount.&rdquo;</p>

The Merlin Rugpull&nbsp;
<p>Merlin tweeted on its official handle that the rug pull was orchestrated by its back-end team, adding that it had put a high degree of trust in the team. It added that it would continue to support the community and help resolve the issue. CertiK also took on some of the blame, stating that they failed to adequately inform users about the risks that could arise from centralization. The firm added that they would put more emphasis on such issues during future audits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are working to improve the clarity of our audit summaries in our reports &mdash; especially around centralization risks &mdash; and to better communicate with the community about the purpose of an audit. Going forward, CertiK will prioritize centralization risks in audit summaries to ensure users have a complete picture of potential risks. We recognize that audit reports can be highly technical documents, and it&rsquo;s our job to communicate the risks clearly and transparently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, CertiK also added that smart contract auditors could not be held entirely responsible for failing to identify rug pulls. It stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Code Audits serve the purpose of uncovering vulnerabilities, not to detect a potential rug pull. It&rsquo;s important to recognize that many projects, both large and small have centralization issues flagged, and the vast majority do not result in a rug pull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CertiK is also working with Merlin and planning to launch a victim aid fund to help those impacted by the Merlin DEX exploit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The firm also added that it was monitoring the stolen funds and working with law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have successfully frozen $160K of the stolen funds with the help of partners. We will continue to monitor the movement of all stolen funds in an attempt to freeze and recover the remaining amount.&rdquo;</p>

The Merlin Rugpull&nbsp;
<p>Merlin tweeted on its official handle that the rug pull was orchestrated by its back-end team, adding that it had put a high degree of trust in the team. It added that it would continue to support the community and help resolve the issue. CertiK also took on some of the blame, stating that they failed to adequately inform users about the risks that could arise from centralization. The firm added that they would put more emphasis on such issues during future audits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are working to improve the clarity of our audit summaries in our reports &mdash; especially around centralization risks &mdash; and to better communicate with the community about the purpose of an audit. Going forward, CertiK will prioritize centralization risks in audit summaries to ensure users have a complete picture of potential risks. We recognize that audit reports can be highly technical documents, and it&rsquo;s our job to communicate the risks clearly and transparently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, CertiK also added that smart contract auditors could not be held entirely responsible for failing to identify rug pulls. It stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Code Audits serve the purpose of uncovering vulnerabilities, not to detect a potential rug pull. It&rsquo;s important to recognize that many projects, both large and small have centralization issues flagged, and the vast majority do not result in a rug pull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CertiK is also working with Merlin and planning to launch a victim aid fund to help those impacted by the Merlin DEX exploit.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase had some cause for cheer as it released its first-quarter revenue report, with results exceeding expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exchange reported a net loss of $79 million but also reported a 22% growth in revenue.&nbsp;</p>
Analyzing The First Quarter Revenue Report&nbsp;
<p>The report, released on the 4th of May, saw Coinbase Global report a loss for the fifth consecutive quarter. The results potentially indicated that users and investors had fallen out of the company, despite a steady recovery of the crypto space during the first quarter. However, the numbers posted have beaten expectations, with the company reporting a loss of $79 million. This figure is significantly lower than the $430 million loss reported during the same period last year. Analysts were expecting a loss of over $316 million for the company at a net loss per share of $1.45.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase also reported that its net revenue increased by 22% quarter over quarter, rising to $736 million, with its operating expenses falling by 24% from the previous quarter. The reduction in operating expenses can be attributed to the company cutting down its workforce. Coinbase had laid off 950 employees in January, with the restructuring process costing the company $144 million. However, Coinbase stated that restructuring helped it become more efficient, allowing it to &ldquo;do more for less.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
More Numbers&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase also reported that its transaction revenue increased by 16% to $375 million. Consumer transaction revenue also increased by 14%, while institutional transactions rose by 67%. Its quarterly trading volume stood at $145 billion, which was equal to the numbers posted during the previous quarter. The company&rsquo;s &ldquo;assets on platform,&rdquo; which refers to the US dollar value of various digital assets, rose by 62% to $130 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase also reported an increase in its quarter-over-revenue in several other categories. Its subscription and services revenue reported an increase of 28%, rising to $362 million. Additionally, blockchain rewards grew by 18%, rising to $74 million, while custodial fee revenue reported an increase of 48% to $17 million. Last but not least, interest income reported an increase of 32%, rising to $241 million.&nbsp;</p>
Regulatory Landmine&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase is mired in a regulatory tussle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On several occasions, the SEC has threatened enforcement action and lawsuits against the exchange. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer for Coinbase, has stated that the legal fight against regulatory authorities could take a significant amount of time. However, he expected the firm to be fully operational, with no significant hiccups expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase revealed earlier this week that it would be shutting down its Coinbase Borrow services by the 10th of May. However, the company did not clarify why it was shuttering the service. Coinbase was also at the receiving end of a lawsuit during the ongoing week, with executives accused of dumping millions in stock to prevent losses.&nbsp;</p>
Outlook For Q2&nbsp;
<p>The company also gave a glimpse into its outlook for Q2. In its report, Coinbase stated that it expects transaction expenses to make up around 15% of its net revenue. It also expects to see around $300 million raised through subscription and services revenue. This is a decline thanks to a drop in the market capitalization of USDC. It also predicted that technology and development expenses and other administrative expenses could reach $650 million. This is a considerable increase, thanks in part due to increased legal expenses, thanks to its ongoing issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company also stated that marketing and sales expenses could reach $80 to $90 million thanks to an NBA partnership and stock-based compensation. Meanwhile, the company&rsquo;s stock surged by 9% in after-hours trading, according to data from MarketWatch, with COIN shares hitting $53.75 on the 4th of May. Coinbase shares have gained a staggering 60% since the start of the year. However, they are still a far cry from their peak price of $343, achieved in November 2021.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a Reuters exclusive, Israeli authorities have revealed that, since 2021, they have seized 190 Binance accounts linked to designated terrorists.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The report also cited a document released by Israel&rsquo;s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) on January 12 identified two Binance accounts linked to the Islamic State (ISIS). Hamas, the ruling party currently running the conflicted zone of Gaza, was another organization identified by the NBCTF to have received funds through Binance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">At the time of writing, however, no further information was provided on the precise amount of crypto seized (and which specific cryptocurrencies were involved) and how they were able to find out the accounts&rsquo; links to ISIS.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Last December 2022, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz revealed a court ruling approving the Israeli government&rsquo;s seizure of &ldquo;any and all cryptocurrency assets from digital wallets that have funded terrorism&rdquo;. This enables the Israeli government to confiscate all assets in a wallet, even those deemed not directly used to fund &lsquo;terrorist activities.&rsquo; The NBCTF subsequently tagged three Gaza-based firms for their links to Hamas and shut down 80 Binance accounts linked to them. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Reuters report also homes in on Binance itself. Binance has been facing a tough start for 2023, most notably its arm in the United States, a known close ally of Israel. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has sued the exchange, along with its CEO Changpeng Zhao and former compliance chief Samuel Lim, last March for &ldquo;wilful evasion&rdquo; of commodities laws. The CFTC&rsquo;s complaint highlighted how Binance executives knew about illegal dealings in the exchange, particularly Hamas&rsquo; dealings and how the exchange even provided users information on how to use VPNs in order to access Binance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Zhao immediately responded to the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint, calling it &ldquo;an incomplete recitation of facts.&rdquo; Binance itself has emphasized its willingness to comply with the U.S. government&rsquo;s regulations and to their requests for information.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This debacle puts the spotlight to the discourse on regulation as well as its urgent geopolitical implications. While money-laundering and criminal activity are important issues that have to be addressed as crypto grows, the line becomes (or should become) thin on questions of geopolitics, especially in the context of Israel. The gradual displacement of Palestinians, often through the use of force, has been a highly-contentious issue ever since the State of Israel was established in 1948. Hamas has emerged as one of the main organizations fighting for Palestinian nationalism, which would explain the terrorist tag by the Israeli government.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This development shows how crypto exchanges and global crypto regulation play a crucial part in the ongoing conflict and thus, their roles, especially in terms of regulation, have to be carefully thought through.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi recently condemned what he calls the "unipolar world order", emphasizing that Iran plans to join the BRICS group to help create a multipolar world and in effect challenge the dominance of U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. There are broad implications to the crypto industry with this move, and it only represents a beginning.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Iran Condemns 'Unipolar World Order'</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The BRICS group is an association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The acronym was initially coined in 2001 by Jim O'Neill, an economist at Goldman Sachs, to represent the four countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. South Africa joined the group in 2010, officially expanding the acronym to BRICS.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These countries are characterized by their large, fast-growing economies, significant influence on regional and global affairs, and the potential to become among the world's dominant economic powers in the 21st century. The BRICS nations collectively represent about 42% of the world's population, 23% of the global GDP, and around 18% of the world's total trade.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Iran wants to have constructive relations with all states on the basis of common interests,&rdquo; stresses Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement was made on Lebanese media outlet Al Mayadeen, with Raisi quoted that after his country's recent membership with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Iran is now "getting ready" to join the BRICS Group. The Iranian president was quoted as saying:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We condemn the unipolar world order which makes it possible for the United States and some three to four other countries to feel the rulers of the world."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The BRICS nations have been ramping up their de-dollarization efforts and settling trades in national currencies. The group is also working to create a new common currency that is expected to be discussed at the group&rsquo;s next leaders&rsquo; summit. What does this mean for crypto and, specifically, stablecoins?</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Potential Impact on the Dominance of USD-pegged Stablecoins</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The ongoing efforts of the BRICS nations and Iran to move away from the U.S. dollar and establish a new common currency could potentially impact the global dominance of USD-pegged stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). These stablecoins, which maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar, have been widely used in the cryptocurrency market for trading and settling transactions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As the BRICS countries and Iran seek to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar and move towards settling trades in their national currencies, it could lead to a decrease in demand for USD-pegged stablecoins. This may open up opportunities for the development of new stablecoins pegged to other currencies or even a common currency as proposed by BRICS. Could this new common currency be blockchain-based? We could hope so.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Political and economic Implications of De-dollarization</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">De-dollarization efforts by the BRICS countries are a direct challenge to the United States' global financial hegemony. The U.S. dollar has long been the dominant reserve currency, and its position has allowed the U.S. to exert significant political influence over global economic policies. The move towards de-dollarization by the BRICS countries signals a shift in the global balance of power, with these nations seeking to establish a more multipolar world order.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This shift could reduce the United States' ability to impose economic sanctions and maintain control over global financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. It may also lead to a more fragmented global economic landscape, with multiple centers of power and influence.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The economic implications of de-dollarization are multifaceted. By reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar, the BRICS countries aim to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations and promote financial stability within their respective economies. The move towards settling trades in national currencies or a common currency could lower transaction costs and facilitate more efficient cross-border trade between these nations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">De-dollarization may also pave the way for the rise of alternative reserve currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, the euro, or even a digital currency backed by a coalition of nations. This development could lead to increased competition for the U.S. dollar, potentially affecting its value and global demand.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto Regulation in the U.S. and Europe</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto regulation in the United States has been more stringent compared to Europe. The U.S. has adopted a more conservative approach, with regulators often classifying cryptocurrencies as securities subject to strict regulatory oversight. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been particularly active in regulating initial coin offerings (ICOs) and pursuing enforcement actions against non-compliant projects.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In contrast, Europe has taken a more progressive approach to crypto regulation. The European Union (EU) has implemented a comprehensive regulatory framework, the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which covers cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. Additionally, individual European countries, such as Switzerland and Estonia, have established crypto-friendly regulatory environments, attracting numerous blockchain projects and businesses.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Breaking Chains: On De-Dollarization and Decentralization </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Recent years have shown a significant surge in the adoption of crypto, driven by the inherent benefits of decentralization and the potential to disrupt the traditional financial systems. It is thus worth considering the potential impact of decentralized digital currencies on the stability and growth of global economies. Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of cryptocurrencies is their decentralized nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks and financial institutions.This can lead to reduced transaction costs, faster processing times, and increased financial inclusion for individuals who have limited access to traditional banking services. There's also the core attribute that crypto, despite its early failures, can operate on a global scale, enabling seamless cross-border transactions and fostering international trade.</p>
<p>Decentralized digital currencies also offer the potential for enhanced monetary stability. Unlike fiat currencies, which are often subject to inflationary pressures and currency devaluation due to government policies or economic fluctuations, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have a predetermined supply cap, limiting the risk of excessive inflation.The divergent approaches to crypto regulation in the U.S. and Europe could have significant implications for the success of BRICS countries' de-dollarization efforts. The more stringent regulatory environment in the U.S. may deter innovation and the adoption of digital currencies, limiting the potential for digital currencies to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On the other hand, the more progressive regulatory environment in Europe could encourage the development and adoption of alternative digital currencies that could facilitate de-dollarization efforts by the BRICS countries. The European Union's interest in creating a digital euro, for example, may further contribute to the diversification of reserve currencies and strengthen the position of the euro as an alternative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The political and economic implications of de-dollarization efforts by the BRICS countries, coupled with the divergent crypto regulations in the United States and Europe, could lead to a reshaping of the digital currency landscape and the stature of economic power as distributed across the globe.</p>

These stablecoins, which maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar, have been widely used in the cryptocurrency market for trading and settling transactions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As the BRICS countries and Iran seek to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar and move towards settling trades in their national currencies, it could lead to a decrease in demand for USD-pegged stablecoins. This may open up opportunities for the development of new stablecoins pegged to other currencies or even a common currency as proposed by BRICS. Could this new common currency be blockchain-based? We could hope so.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Political and economic Implications of De-dollarization</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">De-dollarization efforts by the BRICS countries are a direct challenge to the United States' global financial hegemony. The U.S. dollar has long been the dominant reserve currency, and its position has allowed the U.S. to exert significant political influence over global economic policies. The move towards de-dollarization by the BRICS countries signals a shift in the global balance of power, with these nations seeking to establish a more multipolar world order.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This shift could reduce the United States' ability to impose economic sanctions and maintain control over global financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. It may also lead to a more fragmented global economic landscape, with multiple centers of power and influence.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The economic implications of de-dollarization are multifaceted. By reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar, the BRICS countries aim to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations and promote financial stability within their respective economies. The move towards settling trades in national currencies or a common currency could lower transaction costs and facilitate more efficient cross-border trade between these nations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">De-dollarization may also pave the way for the rise of alternative reserve currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, the euro, or even a digital currency backed by a coalition of nations. This development could lead to increased competition for the U.S. dollar, potentially affecting its value and global demand.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto Regulation in the U.S. and Europe</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto regulation in the United States has been more stringent compared to Europe. The U.S. has adopted a more conservative approach, with regulators often classifying cryptocurrencies as securities subject to strict regulatory oversight. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been particularly active in regulating initial coin offerings (ICOs) and pursuing enforcement actions against non-compliant projects.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In contrast, Europe has taken a more progressive approach to crypto regulation. The European Union (EU) has implemented a comprehensive regulatory framework, the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which covers cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. Additionally, individual European countries, such as Switzerland and Estonia, have established crypto-friendly regulatory environments, attracting numerous blockchain projects and businesses.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Breaking Chains: On De-Dollarization and Decentralization </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Recent years have shown a significant surge in the adoption of crypto, driven by the inherent benefits of decentralization and the potential to disrupt the traditional financial systems. It is thus worth considering the potential impact of decentralized digital currencies on the stability and growth of global economies. Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of cryptocurrencies is their decentralized nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks and financial institutions.This can lead to reduced transaction costs, faster processing times, and increased financial inclusion for individuals who have limited access to traditional banking services. There's also the core attribute that crypto, despite its early failures, can operate on a global scale, enabling seamless cross-border transactions and fostering international trade.</p>
<p>Decentralized digital currencies also offer the potential for enhanced monetary stability. Unlike fiat currencies, which are often subject to inflationary pressures and currency devaluation due to government policies or economic fluctuations, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have a predetermined supply cap, limiting the risk of excessive inflation.The divergent approaches to crypto regulation in the U.S. and Europe could have significant implications for the success of BRICS countries' de-dollarization efforts. The more stringent regulatory environment in the U.S. may deter innovation and the adoption of digital currencies, limiting the potential for digital currencies to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On the other hand, the more progressive regulatory environment in Europe could encourage the development and adoption of alternative digital currencies that could facilitate de-dollarization efforts by the BRICS countries. The European Union's interest in creating a digital euro, for example, may further contribute to the diversification of reserve currencies and strengthen the position of the euro as an alternative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The political and economic implications of de-dollarization efforts by the BRICS countries, coupled with the divergent crypto regulations in the United States and Europe, could lead to a reshaping of the digital currency landscape and the stature of economic power as distributed across the globe.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Yesterday May 4th (aka Star Wars Day), NFT startup Cryptoys unveiled their newest NFT collection based on the massive media franchise.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement follows the company's successful collaboration with toy brand Mattel on the Masters of the Universe collections.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The Star Wars NFTs, priced at $39.99 each, will be minted on the Flow blockchain, which hosts popular collectibles platforms like NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day. Each NFT will have one of five stylized skin designs and will be available in "Common," "Rare," "Legendary," "Grail," and "Ultra Grail" rarity levels. The collectibles will be presented in Star Wars-inspired digital "holocrons," a reference to the data storage devices used in the film franchise. Buyers will receive a "blind box" pack, meaning they won't know which character they've purchased until they open it.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cryptoys&rsquo; Star Wars NFT collection is set to drop on May 24. The collection will be minted in the Flow blockchain, which has been recently stirring up news as a potentially revolutionary NFT ecosystem. Flow is notable for being the home of the successful NBA Top Shot NFTs. Back in November 2022, longtime toymaker Mattel released their own NFT marketplace on Flow. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This Star Wars NFT collection is not the first of its kind though. VeVe, a digital collectibles platform featuring NFTs from various Disney and Marvel properties, has previously released sets containing 3D digital models, digital posters, and comic book covers related to the Star Wars universe. With the upcoming launch of Cryptoys' Star Wars NFT collection, fans of the franchise will have yet another opportunity to own unique digital collectibles inspired by their favorite characters.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The bear cycle of 2022 has been generally bad for crypto, and NFTs were not spared. Meta announced their abandonment of their NFT projects just last March. However, a potentially new market would be NFT toys.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A newly filed lawsuit alleges that crypto exchange Coinbase improperly collected, stored, and distributed customers&rsquo; biometric data. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been slapped with a lawsuit filed with a District Court in California on May 1 for violating Illinois&rsquo; Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The suit alleges the exchange collected and improperly used its customers&rsquo; fingerprint and facial recognition data.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports plaintiff Michael Massel is seeking relief in the form of $5,000 in damages for each &ldquo;intentional and reckless violation&rdquo; of BIPA and an additional $1,000 for every violation Massel&rsquo;s legal representation can find.</p>
<p>According to Decrypt, the lawsuit accuses Coinbase of collecting biometric information through its KYC procedures and that this data was illegally obtained, used, stored, and disseminated. BIPA regulations require a company seeking to collect biometric data to inform a person in writing that it obtains such data and must specify the purpose and duration of the data&rsquo;s storage.</p>
<p>BIPA further requires written consent from a customer, and the company seeking to obtain such data must publish &ldquo;publicly‐available written retention schedules and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric identifiers and biometric information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Massel&rsquo;s legal team argues Coinbase does not comply with the regulations when it collects customers&rsquo; data before and after creating new accounts.</p>
<p>The suit alleges Coinbase&rsquo;s &ldquo;collection, obtainment, storage, and use&rdquo; of customers&rsquo; biometric data is &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; and opens clients up &ldquo;to serious and irreversible privacy risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legal document asserts:</p>

<p>If Coinbase&rsquo;s database containing facial geometry scans or other sensitive, proprietary biometric data is hacked, breached, or otherwise exposed, Coinbase users have no means by which to prevent identity theft.</p>

<p>The lawsuit further states that the exchange should have &ldquo;permanently destroyed&rdquo; such data after a customer created a Coinbase account, as the information was obtained solely to create an account.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Looking for the best crypto coins in 2023? Below, we&rsquo;ll introduce you to Ethereum (ETH), Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) and the reasons why experts believe that these three cryptocurrencies are set to explode in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p class="s11">Collateral Network (COLT) has a rather different approach, as this blockchain-based platform appeals directly to everyday investors and individuals. </p>
<p class="s7">When in need of cash, many people sell their expensive belongings, such as luxury watches or fine art, to raise money. Collateral Network (COLT) is the first platform on the blockchain where borrowers can use these assets as collateral for loans instead of selling them. The Collateral Network (COLT) platform appraises the asset and mints an asset-backed NFT representing the physical asset. The holder of the asset, the borrower, unlocks cash, while numerous lenders can earn passive income by investing their capital in portions of these fractionalised NFTs.</p>
<p class="s7">Indeed, Collateral Network (COLT) is a nurturing environment for lenders, who provide liquidity to the ecosystem and are rewarded with fixed interest rate payments and the ability to trade their loan portfolios for additional income.</p>
<p class="s7">Collateral Network (COLT) is a new project with a huge potential to increase 35 times before it hits the exchanges. Priced at only $0.014, the Collateral Network (COLT) token has already increased by 40% and is estimated to reach as high as $0.35 in the near future, providing early investors with 3500% returns. </p>
<p class="s7">If you wish to purchase the $COLT token for only $0.014, follow the links below and take advantage of this unique opportunity to earn an extra 40% purchase bonus on your investment!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Ethereum (ETH)</p>
<p class="s11">The case for Ethereum (ETH) is quite simple &ndash; it has had an excellent price performance so far in 2023. Despite many new projects competing with it, Ethereum (ETH) remains the champion when it comes to the DeFi space. </p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) has increased by nearly 60% year-to-date, which could make some people reluctant to buy, thinking it may be overpriced. However, it&rsquo;s worth noticing that Ethereum (ETH) still trades about 50% below its all-time high, so it has a high chance of exploding this year. </p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) is a market leader and its continuous developments keep it at the forefront. The main challenges of the network are cost and speed. But one of its co-founders, Vitalik Buterin, stated that Ethereum (ETH) currently operates at only half of its potential, indicating that more upgrades down the road are to address these main issues. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Cosmos (ATOM)</p>
<p class="s11">Dubbed the &ldquo;internet of blockchains&rdquo;, Cosmos (ATOM) aims to solve a major issue that has always been plaguing the crypto world. Interoperability means that blockchains can communicate with each other, such as sending one asset to another &ndash; and this is the thesis put forth by Cosmos (ATOM). </p>
<p class="s7">If Cosmos (ATOM) manages to solve the interoperability issue, the year 2023 could prove crucial for the company. Although competition is fierce in the crypto industry, Cosmos (ATOM) is specially built on the idea of scalability &ndash; such as allowing developers to create new blockchains and plug them into the &ldquo;Cosmoverse&rdquo; to communicate with other blockchains. </p>
<p class="s7">Still relatively a small project, many investors probably have not heard of Cosmos (ATOM) just yet. However, if it manages to expand, Cosmos (ATOM) could explode in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Summary</p>
<p class="s11">If you are looking for new crypto projects to add to your portfolio, Ethereum (ETH), Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) are well worth your attention. With high potential and sturdy underpinning concepts, these three projects have the potential to be market leaders this year. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The collapse of several banks - Silvergate, Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, and First Republic - has left a significant number of people concerned about their deposits, questioning the strength of the existing financial infrastructure.&nbsp; This week Pac West bank stocks dropped in value more than 40%.</p>
<p>While once the domain of free-market capitalists and right-wing libertarians, the policies of quantitative easing and centralized banking are now queried by those of a more moderate disposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A systemic collapse could herald increases in the price of cryptocurrency and NFT tokens, but the effects could be catastrophic. Strategic thinking is still required to transfer from fiat to crypto in the safest manner possible, choosing the best possible projects and ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
The Banking Crisis - An Overview
<p>Silvergate Bank shut its doors in early March 2023. FTX was a major client of Silvergate and it was no real surprise that it ultimately went under, losing over $1 billion in a single quarter after intense customer withdrawals. But it was the start of a chain of banking failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) both collapsed, within days of one another. Both catered to technology startups, particularly in the sphere of cryptocurrency. In the case of SVB, what happened was that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, and a large number of depositors started to withdraw their money. This forced the bank to sell its bonds at a discount, ultimately rendering it insolvent. SVB ultimately misjudged its interest rate risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to insure the deposits in excess of $250,000, even though there was no initial insurance for accounts. They also covered Signature Bank, which was taken over by the New York Department of Financial Services. Three major banks - &ldquo;SSS&rdquo; - all collapsed within 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 16th, First Republic Bank was bailed out in a private rescue plan from the major Banks. As of April 28th, there are even more talks about a second rescue plan for First Republic, a further cause of concern. Customers pulled over $100 billion in withdrawals amidst the crisis.&nbsp; Around May 1st,&nbsp; First Republic was seized by regulators and sold at a discount to JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>On March 19th, another bank failed, this time outside the USA, as Credit Suisse was rescued by UBS. Credit Suisse is a major international bank headquartered in Switzerland.&nbsp; With Credit Suisse, it was a $68 billion bank run on deposits that triggered the collapse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 4th, local Californian bank Pac West stocks dropped dramatically. It sank 45% in early trading and was halted for volatility. The bank management now doing everything to bring back shareholders&rsquo; value. So the trend of the traditional banks collapsing continue.</p>
Decreased Trust In The Banking Sector
<p>The bailouts came at an enormous cost. Guaranteeing deposit insurance at SVB and Signature Bank has cost the Federal Reserve $140 billion. The Swiss state has guaranteed $225 billion to UBS, the institution that took over Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, bank loans are at record highs in the USA. All this indicates a potential recession and severe difficulty in obtaining loans from banks, who will be more reluctant to lend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it can be made to sound very technical and complex, the reality is much simpler. When people lose faith in banks, for any reason, they withdraw their money quickly. The bank then has to liquidate assets (at a discount) to cover its existing positions, which accelerates the trend as customers withdraw even more. This is a typical bank run. Social media exacerbates this problem because news can spread so quickly in the modern era.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does quite a lot to reassure people. Customer deposits are safe, possibly even in instances where the bank has no insurance (such as Signature and SVB). But with recent events, alongside customer frustration with banks and their fees, many are still turning to crypto and Web3 finance, which is proving more flexible, and yet more stable.&nbsp;</p>
Alternative Banking Options Via Web3 Solutions
<p>There are multiple alternatives to using the banking infrastructure and many ways to manage your funds. In fact, pretty much anything that can currently be done on the legacy architecture can be done on a faster, safer, more efficient blockchain. Thousands of industry professionals, analysts, and mathematicians can come together to make a more innovative and flexible solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stoic AI, for instance, supplies users with crypto trading bots that manage multiple portfolios based on risk tolerance levels, without any of the emotionality associated with retail investing. The app connects to Binance or Coinbase via API so funds never leave your account. The company behind the product, Cindicator, has been in operation since 2015 with over $130M in assets under management from 15,000+ customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) within the capital markets industry, Stoic can tune your portfolio to the risk level you are comfortable with. Current portfolio options include conservative, balanced, and volatile, each containing its own set of strengths. Only the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap are traded. All of this is done through emotionless automation at a fraction of the cost of traditional hedge funds and with much greater APY potential.</p>
<p>And this example only applies to portfolio management. There are a plethora of Web3 options that cater to various industries including crypto lending, collateral, mortgages, house rentals, yield farming, insurance, international finance, microfinance, charitable donations, privacy-based tokens, and more. And all of this can generally be achieved with less red tape and more efficiency as compared to the centralized banking model.&nbsp;</p>
All Paths Point To A Crypto Price Increase &amp; Renewed Interest
<p>Ultimately, even if a systemic crisis is averted, it will still result in a rise in cryptocurrency (the price has already risen significantly). This is due to the fact that commercial banks are only being saved with money printed by central banks, resulting in even more inflation, which encourages more people to purchase commodities and cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bailouts can only be done for so long before the system crashes completely as it continually devalues the currency. A &ldquo;saved&rdquo; bank comes at a huge cost. This cost is acceptable now and again, but if a multitude of banks has to be propped up, the end result is a government-dominated state with a poor economic climate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this can only lead to a renewed interest in cryptocurrency products and services, as existing institutions fail to provide adequate financial safeguards for the population. </p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The collapse of several banks - Silvergate, Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, and First Republic - has left a significant number of people concerned about their deposits, questioning the strength of the existing financial infrastructure.&nbsp; This week Pac West bank stocks dropped in value more than 40%.</p>
<p>While once the domain of free-market capitalists and right-wing libertarians, the policies of quantitative easing and centralized banking are now queried by those of a more moderate disposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A systemic collapse could herald increases in the price of cryptocurrency and NFT tokens, but the effects could be catastrophic. Strategic thinking is still required to transfer from fiat to crypto in the safest manner possible, choosing the best possible projects and ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
The Banking Crisis - An Overview
<p>Silvergate Bank shut its doors in early March 2023. FTX was a major client of Silvergate and it was no real surprise that it ultimately went under, losing over $1 billion in a single quarter after intense customer withdrawals. But it was the start of a chain of banking failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) both collapsed, within days of one another. Both catered to technology startups, particularly in the sphere of cryptocurrency. In the case of SVB, what happened was that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, and a large number of depositors started to withdraw their money. This forced the bank to sell its bonds at a discount, ultimately rendering it insolvent. SVB ultimately misjudged its interest rate risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to insure the deposits in excess of $250,000, even though there was no initial insurance for accounts. They also covered Signature Bank, which was taken over by the New York Department of Financial Services. Three major banks - &ldquo;SSS&rdquo; - all collapsed within 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Across the Web3 space, projects are consistently battling to reach the top spot in regard to market capitalization and to truly provide investors and traders with a lot of value, both in regard to their native cryptocurrency as well as the overall project's offering.</p>
<p class="s6">With the recent decrease in the value of Axie Infinity (AXS) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), investors and traders have begun eyeing the presale of Yachtify, the first platform where anyone can buy, sell, rent or own a timeshare in anything from a Jetski to a Sunseeker Yacht. Let&rsquo;s dive in to see what makes this project truly stand out.</p>
<p class="s8">Axie Infinity (AXS) Dips By 20.6% Despite Updates</p>
<p class="s6">The Axie Infinity (AXS) Twitter page made waves in April when they announced the player experience updates as well as the AXS and Seasonal Achievement Rewards.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, on May 3, 2023, Axie Infinity (AXS) announced the Extreme Home Makeover: Lunacian Edition and gained a lot of momentum.</p>
<p class="s6">However, despite the developments and momentum, the value of the Axie Infinity (AXS) cryptocurrency has been in decline. As of May 3, 2023, Axie Infinity (AXS) traded at $7.64. Within the last 30 days, Axie Infinity (AXS) decreased by 10.4%, and in the last two weeks, the overall decrease of the cryptocurrency was by 20.6%.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Decreases by 23.2% Despite New Partnership</p>
<p class="s6">PipeFlare made an announcement that they joined forces with NEAR Protocol (NEAR) in order to make onboarding an easier procedure. This means that the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) ecosystem has experienced a high level of growth.</p>
<p class="s6">This, however, did not translate to an increased value of the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) cryptocurrency. On May 3, 2023, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) traded at $1.80. Within the last 30 days, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) saw a decrease of 6.3%, and in the last two weeks, the decrease was by 23.2%.</p>
<p class="s8">Yachtify (YCHT) To Change The Way Investors Earn Revenue</p>
<p class="s6">Yachtify will be a marketplace in which every investor will gain the opportunity to earn passive income through making investments in and having ownership over fractions of boats.</p>
<p class="s6">Specifically, when the boat that they have ownership over gets lent out, they can earn a portion of the rental based on their overall share of the boat.</p>
<p class="s6">So if an investor had fractional ownership of 30% of a specific boat, they would then earn 30% of the income generated from renting it, aside from the trading fees.</p>
<p class="s6">The YCHT cryptocurrency is currently undergoing stage one of its presale, where its value is at just $0.10.</p>
<p class="s6">Experienced investors know that significant gains can be made when they get into the early stages of a project that can become a dominant force in the Web3 space. The Yachtify network has been audited by InterFi network, and the liquidity will be locked for life, which means that it will be completely safe for investors. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Across the Web3 space, investors and traders are consistently on the lookout for projects that can provide them with a lot of value. </p>
<p class="s6">With the decrease in value of well-established projects, such as Dash (DASH) and GMX (GMX), it has become clear to many that the true value can be found in projects that are undergoing their presale stage. One of the most notable presale-stage projects to grab the attention of investors and traders is currently Yachtify, and today, we will go over why it has captured so much attention.</p>
<p class="s8">Dash (DASH) Dips in Value by 20.7%</p>
<p class="s6">The Dash (DASH) project made waves across social media when the team discussed how its partnership with NOWPayments can benefit investors and traders. Additionally, they also went over their partnership with HitBTC. Based on this, it is clear that the Dash (DASH) ecosystem has been growing.</p>
<p class="s6">When we go over the value of the ​​Dash (DASH) cryptocurrency, however, on May 3, 2023, it traded at $47.37.</p>
<p class="s6">Within the last 30 days, Dash (DASH) saw a decrease in its value by 17.1%. In the last two weeks alone, Dash (DASH) saw an additional decrease in its value by 20.7%, and this has left investors worried about its future.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">GMX (GMX) Sees a Decrease of 23.7% Despite Updates</p>
<p class="s6">GMX (GMX) published a Tweet on May 3, 2023, where they went over how the network collected $3,783,115.98 within the last seven days in the weekly rewards. </p>
<p class="s6">Additionally, the GMX (GMX) team also published updates in the referral page UI for GMX V2 and added the option to claim rewards for affiliates alongside adding the subgraph for V2 referral stats.</p>
<p class="s6">When we go over the value of the GMX (GMX) cryptocurrency, however, on May 3, 2023, the cryptocurrency had a value of $67.95. Within the last 30 days, GMX (GMX) saw a decrease in its value by 8.8%. In the last two weeks, the value of GMX (GMX) decreased by 23.7%.</p>
<p class="s8">Yachtify (YCHT) To Change The Way People Earn</p>
<p class="s6">The Yachtify platform will enable a new way through which users can earn by gaining access to fractional private yacht ownership that can provide them with a unique opportunity.</p>
<p class="s6">Specifically, through the usage of the native YCHT token, investors can buy fractional non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The underlying yachts are insured and stored in ports across the globe. </p>
<p class="s6">Every NFT, as a result, enables investors to earn/ FOr example, if an investor has 25% ownership over a specific boat, they can earn 25% of the income generated from it getting rented, aside from the trading fees that occurred.</p>
