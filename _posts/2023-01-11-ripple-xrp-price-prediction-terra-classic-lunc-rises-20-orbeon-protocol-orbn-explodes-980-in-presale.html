<p>Ripple operates on an open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer technology that enables seamless money transactions. Ripple's clientele includes a number of well-known banks and financial industry companies. Ripple (XRP) is utilized in its products to facilitate the rapid conversion of multiple currencies. Ripple, which was released in 2012, is one of the earliest cryptocurrency projects on the coin market.</p>
<p>The Ripple network utilizes a consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) process. The consensus process tries to strengthen the system's integrity by eliminating double-spending.</p>
<p>Ripple will have little trouble reaching the top of the coin market since it can securely execute transactions for nearly any type of cryptocurrency. The price of Ripple (XRP) is expected to rise after the cryptocurrency emerges from its legal battle with the SEC.</p>

<p>Investors in Terra Classic (LUNC) are extremely concerned about the future of their holdings. This is due to the fact that Terra Classic (LUNC) had a difficult year in 2022, as the Terra Classic (LUNC) price sank to almost zero after a major scandal resulting in the collapse of its network.</p>
<p>Although Terra Classic (LUNC) has seen some positive price movement recently, having days where the token rallies by double digits, Terra Classic (LUNC) is currently up 149% in the past 200 days.
