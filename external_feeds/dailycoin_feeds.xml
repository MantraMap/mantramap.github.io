			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) </span><a href="http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230103a1.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a joint statement warning banks of risks associated with cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American regulators said that banks should aware of the multiple crypto risks like fraud, legal uncertainties, inaccurate disclosures by crypto companies, volatility in the markets, stablecoin risks and contagion risks, and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks should be extra careful when dealing with crypto-related companies to prevent risks that “cannot be mitigated or controlled [from migrating] to the banking system”, the statement said. The regulators alluded to the recent blow-up of the second-largest crypto exchange FTX as a reason for taking a cautious approach to crypto.</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Given the significant risks highlighted by recent failures of several large crypto-asset companies, the agencies continue to take a careful and cautious approach related to current or proposed crypto-asset-related activities and exposures at each banking organization,”</strong> they said.</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulators also said that issuing or holding crypto assets is “highly likely inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices”.</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Based on the agencies’ current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued, stored, or transferred on an open, public, and/or decentralized network, or similar system is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices,”</strong> the statement said.</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulators added that they have “significant safety and soundness concerns” about crypto-related companies and activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulators’ statement comes after years of inability to provide a clear regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and others have argued that the hesitancy of U.S. regulators to introduce regulation in crypto markets has caused the FTX phenomenon.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase (COIN) chief legal officer (CLO) Paul Grewal </span><a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1610646785369772039?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Twitter on Wednesday that he and the exchange are “grateful” for the $100 million settlement with New York regulators over historical compliance failures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S.-based exchange was fined $50 million after the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) discovered in their investigation that Coinbase allowed users to open accounts without conducting sufficient know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, among other compliance failures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase also agreed to invest another $50 million into its compliance program. Grewal said that Coinbase has – and will continue to – develop its compliance program</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“While no company wants to be in this situation, this consent order reflects our commitment to continuous improvement, our engagement with key regulators, and our push for greater compliance in the crypto space – including for ourselves. Our teams built our comprehensive compliance program from the ground up. It took some time, but we have sought to set a higher standard for ourselves and the industry every step of the way,”</strong> Grewal said.</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that Coinbase is “grateful” for the resolution and has “never shied away from working with regulators.”</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYDFS’ statement on the reached settlement with Coinbase revealed some details about the exchange’s failures to ensure robust compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in one instance, Coinbase unknowingly helped a scammer steal $150 million from an unnamed company by pretending to be an employee at that company and opening an account with Coinbase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYFDS said that Coinbase’s compliance woes go back to 2018. At one point in 2021, when the exchange experienced massive growth amid the roaring bull market, it had over 100,000 alerts of unreviewed suspicious customer transactions. The backlog of customers requiring enhanced due diligence grew to over 14,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulator said that Coinbase had neither the personnel nor the tools to deal with the backlogs that grew to “unimaginable” levels. Coinbase eventually improved its compliance program in 2022 but still lacked sufficient checks and balances to prevent money laundering and other suspicious activity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, COIN had a rough 2022. It lost more than 85% of its value last year and almost 90% since the IPO day, which saw COIN reach its all-time high of $357.39.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silverbank, a crypto-focused bank, also pumped on the news. SI is trading at around $21.50, 25% higher than at the start of the trading day. The stock is still down more than 91% from its all-time high of $239.26, according to TradingView.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the developers are working on an official Layer-2 solution for DOGE. The scaling solution <a href="https://dailycoin.com/shiba-inu-shib-vs-dogecoin-doge-which-memecoin-has-more-use-cases/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">is being developed</a> in partnership with BluePepper and is set for an early to mid-2023 release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if that wasn’t enough, a new version of the self-custodial <em>MyDoge Wallet</em> was recently launched after trust in CeFi exchanges hit an all-time low. Finally, with the latest Dogecoin node upgrade, Doge Designer, a prominent member of the DOGE Army, suggests that crypto enthusiasts should immediately upgrade to v.1.14.16 for improved network efficiency.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Impact on cvxCRV holders: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new update will issue a new wrapper contract for cvxCRV staking. This will allow Convex to add additional incentives for cvxCRV holders. The update will also let cvxCRV holders choose the token they want to be rewarded in – CRV, CVX, 3CRV, or any weighted mix of the three.</span></li>
<li><b>Impact on CVX holders: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to utilize the new wrapper contract and remove the old cvxCRV from circulation, Convex will introduce a new proposal to divert some of the platform fees to the cvxCRV wrapper contract. Also, the protocol will divert some of the existing CVX emissions to this wrapper. The new fee distribution will look as follows:</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Eden apologized for the mishap on Twitter, explaining that a third-party service provider caused the issue. On top of that, Magic Eden fully denied the hacking allegations and reassured the NFT enthusiasts that their digital assets were safe.

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the strong bearish trend that emerged right after the FTX liquidity crunch led Solana to the bottom. Following a protracted descent, SOL fell to just a $3bn market cap on December 30th, 2022. Several crypto influencers were ready to bury the embattled SOL alive, as there were <a href="https://dailycoin.com/solanas-sol-days-are-numbered-says-entrepreneur-david-gokhshtein/?swcfpc=1" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple bearish signals</a> by the end of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ultimately, the $3bn market cap is just a drop in the ocean if compared to the $52.2bn market at the beginning of 2022. The market cap that the popular altcoin fetched during the successful period was partly because Solana’s blockchain attracted many institutional investors. Having suffered the most from the recent crypto crisis, SOL still has a large community. It was recently praised by the renowned <a href="https://dailycoin.com/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-most-bullish-about-rollups/?swcfpc=1" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmer Vitalik Buterin</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulators warned banks about the “significant volatility and vulnerabilities&#8221; the crypto industry has experienced over the past year. The regulators added that banks with crypto exposure could especially be at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement says regulators will carefully review future proposals from banks to participate in crypto-related services. This ensures that crypto-asset risks do not migrate to the banking system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim is to align the crypto assets-related activities from banks with safe and sound banking practices. This would mean crypto services provided by banks comply with consumer protection, legal permissibility, and other laws.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Logan Paul, CryptoZoo&#8217;s lead developer Zack Kelling &#8220;lied&#8221; about the number of developers, saying they were 30 instead of the &#8220;three engineers&#8221; that worked on the project.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has </span><a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1610352765129338880" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he is optimistic about the U.S.’s regulatory clarity about crypto in 2023 in the wake of the collapse of multiple crypto exchanges and projects last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commenting on the first day of the 118th Congress, Garlinghouse said despite the stalling of previous efforts at regulatory clarity, he is “cautiously optimistic that 2023 is the year we will (finally!) see a breakthrough.” </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the bear market continues to hit hard, Wyre, a cryptocurrency payment firm, may cease operations, amid staff layoffs, according to a report from </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/03/wyre-shutdown-crypto-winter" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People familiar with the situation said that Ioannis Giannaros, the CEO, informed staff of the development. As revealed, the CEO sent a mail to employees stating that the company would liquidate, thus going to terminate their services this month. According to reports, the CEO said in another email that the firm is still operating but scaling back to plan what to do next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some staff members, however, complained about the firm&#8217;s decision to consider a sudden layoff. They cited how the firm didn&#8217;t offer any compensation, pointing to a possible scenario in which Wyre might be liquidating. An employee took to </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-staib-482610205_wyre-openforwork-activity-7014745625246277632-eTC9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to confirm the development.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that Wyre went into negotiation with popular e-commerce company Bolt at the height of its struggles on a possible takeover deal worth $1.5 billion in April 2022. Reports indicated that the two parties hoped to complete the deal by the third or fourth quarter of 2022 before the plan’s eventual collapse in </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220912005551/en/Ether-Capital-Provides-a-Material-Exchange-Disclosure-Regarding-the-Proposed-Transaction-of-Wyre" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the deal&#8217;s collapse, the acquisition was tipped to become the largest takeover involving a cryptocurrency firm. If the deal had materialized, Bolt would have integrated Wyre’s blockchain technology into its services, and Wyre would have operated a part of Bolt instead of existing independently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite calling off the deal, the two agreed to remain business partners. Through Wyre, Bolt now receives payment in cryptocurrency in some selected markets. The recent development highlights a difficult period for the cryptocurrency sphere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the industry endured major setbacks that almost crumbled it. Notable firms like Celsius, Voyager, 3AC, FTX, and Core Scientific went bankrupt. In addition, the </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/terra-and-ftxs-role-in-bringing-down-the-crypto-market/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of FTX, LUNA, and UST delivered a major blow to firms within their blast radius.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The famous YouTuber Logan Paul has over 23 million subscribers patiently waiting for the social influencer’s new game. CryptoZoo, inspired by the movie of the same name, was announced in September 2022. The blockchain game <a href="https://twitter.com/SoNotPsych/status/1610540788991107076" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">quickly attracted NFT enthusiasts</a>, who bought <a href="https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2022/12/23/cryptozoo-logan-pauls-nft-project/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">$2.5M worth of NFT animals</a> on CryptoZoo’s marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s the beginning of 2023, and the actual game is nowhere to be found. Popular YouTuber and crypto detective Coffeezilla recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=386p68_lDHA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">launched an investigation</a> into the project.

			<p>The new crypto scam allegations targeting YouTube megastar Logan Paul is the newest addition to the celebrity-backed crypto scam saga. Previously, the SEC charged Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr. for promoting the EthereumMax (EMAX) pump and dump scheme on Instagram. Kardashian <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">was subsequently acquitted</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Madonna, Steph Curry, Jimmy Fallon, and other <a href="https://dailycoin.com/madonna-jimmy-fallon-future-among-celebrities-hit-with-massive-bayc-lawsuit/?swcfpc=1" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">top celebrities were targeted</a> in a class-action lawsuit for promoting Bored Apes NFTs on social media as a &#8216;safe investment.&#8217; However, Paul&#8217;s potential case would be different, as the YouTuber owns the project he&#8217;s endorsing.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Stephen <em>&#8220;Coffeezilla&#8221;</em> Findeissen, Logan Paul’s crypto project could be easily classified as a rug pull. The 60-minute series by Coffeezilla explains how Logan Paul lured millions of his subscribers into buying animal-themed NFTs for his upcoming blockchain game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, Logan Paul failed to deliver promises several times, but not without the help of three partners in crime. Logan’s friend Eddie Ibanez was supposed to oversee the project&#8217;s development, while Ben Roth and Jon Youshaei <a href="https://cryptozooworld.com/logan-paul-talks-cryptozoo-jon-youshaei-interview/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">were actively involved</a> in promoting the project to the crypto community. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baku, the original dream-eating hybrid creature from the original CryptoZoo movie distributed by Magnolia Pictures, has nothing on Logan Paul’s money-eating hybrid creatures.
