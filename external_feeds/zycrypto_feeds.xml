<p>Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer behind <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-unlocks-remarkable-price-trajectory-amid-exciting-ecosystem-updates-for-shibarium/">Shiba Inu</a>, has provided a glimpse into the highly anticipated launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 protocol within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, sparking excitement and speculation among the community.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Lucie, the content marketer for Shiba Inu, took to Twitter to share a discussion in a Telegram group chat, where Kusama was asked about any potential changes to the launch date or plan of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-looks-nigh-as-shiba-inus-testnet-sees-rising-activity-ahead-of-shibarium-mainnet/">Shibarium</a>. Confidently, Kusama responded, <em>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter; everything is already set. I can&#8217;t change the date or plan. It&#8217;s called a launch strategy.&#8221;</em> </p>



<p>This tweet quickly gained traction within the community, generating further anticipation and interest with various individuals praising the project&#8217;s developers.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Wow. Strong Words!! I love how the team is handling the launch. Very strategic!! And I believe the timing will be perfect,&#8221;</em> American Businessman Old Horse replied to Lucie&#8217;s tweet.</p>



<p>However, critics of Kusama have accused him of toying with people&#8217;s emotions by consistently raising false expectations.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Honestly ShytoshiKusama, I would believe that statement had you not been insinuating the launch of Shibarium and giving false hope, especially as much as you have in the recent six months. At this point, you&#8217;re just toying with people&#8217;s emotions,&#8221;</em> one individual commented.</p>



<p>In April, Kusama indicated a launch timeframe of two to four months. Last month, the developer disclosed that the launch of Shibarium is imminent. Lucie also hinted in May that the Shibarium launch is closer than expected. Interestingly, July 11 would mark the four-month milestone since the beta release, prompting discussions around the possibility of the launch happening on that date.</p>



<p>Austin Hilton, CEO of Redhill Group and a member of the Shiba Inu community predicted on July 3 that Shibarium would likely launch in mid-August. Hilton expressed his intention to purchase and hold over 20,000 BONE tokens leading up to August, hoping that the Shibarium launch will bring exponential growth potential to BONE.</p>



<p>That said, these conflicting projections have left the community in anticipation, eagerly awaiting an official announcement from the Shiba Inu team regarding the launch date. Despite this obscurity, excitement is expected to keep building around SHIB, preparing it for a massive surge.</p>



<p>Following a significant decline to its lowest point of the year, SHIB faces difficulties breaking the $0.000008 monthly resistance. Should Bulls demonstrate sufficient strength to overcome the level, there is a possibility of witnessing SHIB subtracting another zero and surging to $0.00002 soon.</p>



<p>At press time, SHIB was trading at $$0.000007478 after dropping 2.73% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink, who once said Bitcoin was being largely utilized for “illicit activities”, said on July 5 that the original cryptocurrency was “digitizing gold.”</p>



<p>Fink’s remarks come weeks after the world’s biggest asset manager <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">filed paperwork</a> to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, with digital asset exchange Coinbase acting as its surveillance partner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-as-an-international-asset"><strong>Bitcoin As An “International Asset”</strong></h2>



<p>BlackRock boss Larry Fink delivered pro-bitcoin comments during his latest interview.</p>



<p>Speaking on<em> Fox Business</em> Wednesday, Fink said he believes the role of crypto was mostly “digitizing gold”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in — let’s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,” the billionaire added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> is an International Asset. &#8211; Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO <a href="https://t.co/WIVKITXYPj">pic.twitter.com/WIVKITXYPj</a></p>&mdash; Michael Saylor<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1676687611379826688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>BlackRock, which manages over $9.5 trillion in assets worldwide, helped Bitcoin <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">bounce out of the doldrums</a> with its ETF filing with the SEC, causing big institutional players to pour capital into the space and driving the top crypto to levels not seen in 12 months.</p>



<p>Crypto enthusiasts are excited by the prospect of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. that would offer investors exposure to the flagship digital asset on a regulated crypto exchange without the hassle of custody.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BlackRock Seeks To Democratize Crypto: Larry Fink</strong></h2>



<p>Fink further said his company would work with regulators and hear any concerns they might have regarding their spot bitcoin ETF application.</p>



<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do with crypto is make it more democratized and make it much cheaper for investors,&#8221; Fink explained. &#8220;Right now, the bid-ask spread for crypto is very expensive. It does erode a lot of the returns&#8230;We hope our regulators look at these filings as a way to democratize crypto,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>Although BlackRock has a stunning record of getting ETFs greenlit by the SEC, the CEO admitted he has no idea when a decision for its spot bitcoin ETF could be made amid the regulator’s brutal crackdown on the crypto industry.</p>



<p>Fink’s bullishness now is a noticeable <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-could-evolve-into-a-global-market-says-head-of-the-worlds-largest-asset-firm/">change of tune</a> from back in 2017 when he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/13/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-calls-bitcoin-an-index-of-money-laundering.html">posited </a>that “Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.” However, he later conceded that BTC was a “great asset class” and that New York-based BlackRock had even accrued some profits after investing in the cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s rebel child is presently changing hands at $31,200.39 at the time of publication, up 2.4% over the past 24 hours as per CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency was valued at less than $17,000 at the beginning of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ProShares-Bitcoin-ETF-To-Go-Live-Tomorrow-Marking-Major-Milestone-For-Crypto-World.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="ProShares Bitcoin ETF To Go Live Tomorrow, Marking Major Milestone For Crypto World" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ProShares-Bitcoin-ETF-To-Go-Live-Tomorrow-Marking-Major-Milestone-For-Crypto-World.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ProShares-Bitcoin-ETF-To-Go-Live-Tomorrow-Marking-Major-Milestone-For-Crypto-World-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ProShares-Bitcoin-ETF-To-Go-Live-Tomorrow-Marking-Major-Milestone-For-Crypto-World-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ProShares-Bitcoin-ETF-To-Go-Live-Tomorrow-Marking-Major-Milestone-For-Crypto-World-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-resilience-shines-amid-largest-decline-of-btc-inflows-and-supply-in-history/">Bitcoin</a> has had a remarkable price performance this year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 15% year-to-date gain. The price of Bitcoin has climbed by 83% since the start of 2023, with a sizable chunk of that growth taking place after June 15th. When BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, applied for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/legal-expert-reveals-the-odds-of-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-in-2023/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>, prices surged alongside.</p>



<p>BlackRock joined a group of fund managers, including ARC, Invesco, VanEck, and Grayscale, who were all eager to enter the market. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), so far, has turned down any applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF, primarily due to concerns about fraud and manipulation.</p>



<p>BlackRock&#8217;s reputation and track record have instilled hope within the crypto world, as the company has had an overwhelmingly successful history with its ETF applications. Out of BlackRock&#8217;s 576 ETF applications, only one was rejected in 2014. Therefore, the crypto sector eagerly awaits the outcome of BlackRock&#8217;s latest filing.</p>



<p>BlackRock and NASDAQ recently resubmitted their application and named Coinbase as the custodial surveillance partner for the Spot Bitcoin Trust in response to the SEC&#8217;s requirement that BlackRock designate a surveillance partner to solve these issues.</p>



<p>Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, emphasized the firm&#8217;s dedication to long-term investors and their history of close cooperation with authorities in an exclusive interview with Liz Claman and Charlie Gasparino on Fox Business’ “The Claman Countdown”. Fink expressed hope about working with authorities and addressing their concerns to eventually get permission, even if he couldn&#8217;t specify the present submission.</p>



<p>Fink emphasized BlackRock&#8217;s commitment to product digitization, noting that ETFs have already transformed the mutual fund sector. His firm believes that tokenizing the assets and securities that Bitcoin symbolizes will further democratize investment. BlackRock wants to make investing more accessible and affordable by offering investors fractional shares.</p>



<p>Fink said: <em>“You know ETF was a big revolution for the mutual fund industry and it&#8217;s really taking over the mutual fund industry and we do believe that if we can create. More tokenization of assets and securities, and that&#8217;s what Bitcoin is. It could revolutionize again, finance.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The huge bid-ask spread for cryptocurrencies, which reduces returns and raises transaction costs, is one issue that Fink noted. BlackRock wants to democratize the cryptocurrency industry and lower costs for investors, and to do this; it needs regulatory clearance for Bitcoin ETFs. Fink&#8217;s optimistic view of Bitcoin contrasts with his earlier scepticism, brought on by early contact with illegal activity. Fink views Bitcoin as a digital asset that can act as an alternative investment, much like gold, offering a buffer against inflation and currency devaluation as it becomes more widely available.</p>



<p>He added: “<em>Let&#8217;s be clear Bitcoin is an international asset it&#8217;s not based on anyone currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.”</em></p>



<p>Regarding the underlying technology, Fink thinks blockchain has a lot of promise to simplify transactions and do away with some financial intermediaries. Fink acknowledges the technology&#8217;s growth and potential to improve transaction processes by ensuring transparency and doing away with the need for custodians, even though it has not yet reached its full maturity.</p>



<p>The comments by Fink, founder of the largest asset manager in the world, come as a surprise to many. As recent as a few years ago, his viewpoint on crypto was arguably different and recent comments come as a 180-degree turn. In a CNCB Interview in 2021, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m probably more on the Jamie Dimon camp,&#8221; referring to the former JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman who <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-calls-bitcoin-worthless-asserts-regulation-will-kill-it/">stated that bitcoin is &#8220;worthless.&#8221;</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Swirling rumours of Gary Gensler’s resignation have been confirmed by the SEC to be fake.</li>



<li>Forensics indicate that the source of the rumour stems from an AI-generated text.</li>



<li>The markets took a steep dive but recalibrated itself after an official disclosure by the SEC debunking the rumour</li>
</ul>



<p>Gary Gensler’s time at the helm of affairs at the SEC will not be ending anytime soon following the squashing of AI-generated resignation rumours.</p>



<p>Crypto Twitter whipped itself into a frenzy after a news story made the rounds that SEC Chair Gary Gensler had submitted his resignation following an internal investigation. According to the report, Gensler was investigated for “alleged misconduct, and the decision to step down underscores the seriousness of the findings.” </p>



<p>Several Web 3 influencers on Twitter shared the story, with one post from Whale Chart reaching over 1.4 million views. Still reeling from the SEC designation of some virtual currencies as securities and repeated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-refusal-to-approve-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-makes-it-a-failed-regulator-says-geminis-cameron-winklevoss/">denials</a> of a Bitcoin spot ETF, a large majority of the virtual assets industry welcomed the news of Gensler’s resignation with glee.</p>



<p>However, the SEC’s public relations team has denied the rumors of Gensler’s resignation, with FOX Business reporters Eleanor Terrett and Charles Gasparino poking holes in the story.</p>



<p>Digital analysis of the fake story revealed that a large chunk of the text was generated by artificial intelligence (AI). According to the AI-text detector ZeroGPT, the article in question was 96.8% generated, while other posts on the website indicated heavy AI usage.</p>



<p>In the hours following the rumors, virtual asset prices took a hit as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) lost as much as 2% of their values. However, the start of the week saw a rebound in the markets as the largest virtual currency assets recouped some of their losses heading into the holidays.</p>



<p>At the moment, the global crypto market capitalization stands at $1.19 trillion, a 1.26% plunge over the last 24 hours. The biggest winners from the SEC’s clarification appeared to be transaction volumes, as 48-hour volume inched toward $40 billion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-the-first-fiasco-with-gensler"><strong>Not the first fiasco with Gensler</strong></h2>



<p>This is not the first time rumors of Gensler’s resignation are circulating in the ecosystem. In April, a similar publication made the rounds claiming the SEC Chair was about to be sacked.</p>



<p>Gary Gensler has received scathing criticisms over the SEC’s handling of the FTX fiasco and increased enforcement action over the digital asset industry, underscored by its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-mounts-offensive-against-sec-crypto-lawyer-explains-why-this-is-a-huge-move/">lawsuits</a> against Ripple Labs, Coinbase, and Binance.</p>



<p>A bill titled “The SEC Stabilization Act” by U.S. lawmakers in early June sought to fire Gensler from his role as head of the SEC on grounds of tyranny.</p>



<p><em>“U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one,”</em> said U.S. Rep. Warren Davidson. <em>“That is why I’m introducing legislation to fix the ongoing abuse of power and ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come.”</em></p>

<p>The price of cryptocurrencies has significantly increased in recent weeks, with <a href="https://zycrypto.com/legal-expert-reveals-the-odds-of-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-in-2023/">Bitcoin</a> reaching a one-year high of $31,344, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The leading digital currency recently rose to a level last seen in June 2022, and many investors and enthusiasts believe this could herald the beginning of the long-awaited Crypto Spring.</p>



<p>On CNBC&#8217;s Crypto World, Chris Ferraro, President and Chief Investment Officer at Galaxy Digital, discussed what investors should anticipate for the year&#8217;s second half. In his view, two main catalysts will determine the market in the third quarter.</p>



<p>The prospective release of regulated access products, notably ETFs, by critical international financial institutions in the United States and the results of ongoing regulatory proceedings are two essential elements that Ferraro identifies as influencing the cryptocurrency market. He thinks the primary market driver will be accepting these easily accessed financial products.</p>



<p>Ferraro highlights the underlying success of Bitcoin, which has witnessed considerable growth and has outperformed many other assets globally and cites the excellent atmosphere around ETF applications.</p>



<p>Ferraro admits that the lack of regulatory clarity has been a troublesome theme this year when it comes to this topic. He is upbeat about the asset class and its prospects globally, though. He provides examples of other nations actively developing a legislative framework and encouraging cryptocurrency enterprises, including the UK, Europe, and Hong Kong.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“I&#8217;m less optimistic in the US and I&#8217;m less optimistic only because we really risk losing our competitive advantage. The United States has been the largest capital market and the place where capital formation happens globally for decades and the path that we have taken is in the opposite direction of that for crypto. And so capital both physical capital, intellectual capital is moving to other jurisdictions.”</em></p>



<p>Ferraro raises concerns about the possibility of the US losing its competitive edge in the cryptocurrency industry if legislative reforms proceed more slowly, causing the exodus of capital and expertise to other jurisdictions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-case-for-altcoins"><strong>The Case for Altcoins</strong></h2>



<p>The rise of Bitcoin frequently sets the pace for the broader cryptocurrency market. The question is whether the Altcoin market will follow Bitcoin&#8217;s impressive year-to-date rally.</p>



<p>It is usual for other cryptocurrencies, the so-called Altcoins, to see similar upward fluctuations as Bitcoin develops momentum and garners attention. In the past, cryptocurrencies have imitated Bitcoin&#8217;s success by riding the crest of investor interest and favourable mood.</p>



<p>However, altcoin performance may not always perfectly reflect that of Bitcoin, mainly because they are not all created equal. Every cryptocurrency has a set of distinctive qualities, and market dynamics can differ greatly. While some alternative cryptocurrencies might closely follow Bitcoin&#8217;s price development, others might show independent price changes depending on their fundamentals and market demand.</p>

<p>The crypto community is closely monitoring the likelihood of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in 2023, even as more institutions continue to apply for the product.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with prominent crypto media journalist Andrew Throuvalass, pro-Bitcoin lawyer Joe Carlasare shared his expert insights on the matter, projecting the likelihood of approval to be in the range of 30% to 40%. Carlasare highlighted two of the most prominent institutions to apply for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-refusal-to-approve-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-makes-it-a-failed-regulator-says-geminis-cameron-winklevoss/">Bitcoin spot ETF</a> in his analysis, including BlackRock and Grayscale. </p>



<p>BlackRock, a leading investment management corporation, recently confirmed its collaboration with Coinbase, the largest spot Bitcoin exchange in the United States, in its renewed application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. However, despite Coinbase&#8217;s prominence, Carlasare raised concerns that the SEC may question whether it represents a &#8220;sufficient size&#8221; market for establishing an ETF.</p>



<p>Given that a significant portion of spot trading volume occurs outside the U.S., the collaboration with Coinbase may not meet the SEC&#8217;s requirements.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Sufficient size is somewhat ambiguous, but they have said it has to be a market large enough so that a person or firm attempting to manipulate the Bitcoin spot market would need to necessarily trade on that platform,&#8221;</em> said the Illinois-based lawyer.</p>



<p>Carlasare then highlighted the lawsuit filed in 2022 by Grayscale against the SEC over the denial of an application to convert Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. He emphasized that even if Grayscale wins its ongoing lawsuit, it does not guarantee the conversion into a spot ETF.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;A &#8216;win&#8217; may just mean the court of appeals directs the SEC to revisit their decision,&#8221;</em> he said, adding, however, that while a favourable outcome in the lawsuit could prompt the SEC to reconsider, the ultimate approval of a spot ETF remains uncertain.</p>



<p>Carlasare&#8217;s predictions come just days after Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg&#8217;s senior ETF strategist, estimated a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/theres-a-50-chance-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-gets-greenlight-from-sec-top-bloomberg-analyst-predicts/">50% probability</a> of BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF receiving approval from the SEC primarily due to the increased likelihood of Grayscale prevailing in their ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Brokerage firm Bernstein released a report on Monday indicating a &#8220;relatively high&#8221; probability of approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF. According to the report, the SEC could approve the product based on its prior approval of futures-based Bitcoin ETFs and leverage-based futures ETFs. However, it emphasized that the SEC may demand regulatory oversight of spot ETFs from exchanges within its purview, such as the CME, rather than Coinbase.</p>



<p>SEC&#8217;s cautious approach to cryptocurrencies stems from concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the overall stability of the cryptocurrency market. As a result, it has denied several Bitcoin ETF applications in the past due to what it perceives as insufficient information and inadequate safeguards. Nevertheless, industry players have been fighting back, with firms like BlackRock, Invesco and Wisdom Tree reapplying for the product.</p>

<p>Bitcoin kicked off the week with a stable trading range on Monday, maintaining its position within a key resistance area of $30,870 and finding support at $29,700.</p>



<p>This comes after the cryptocurrency reached a yearly high of $31,384 approximately two weeks ago. Since June 23, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-reveals-what-market-conditions-could-supercharge-bitcoin-price-to-310000/">Bitcoin</a> has been trading sideways, displaying a consolidated pattern as it navigates the abovementioned resistance and support levels.</p>



<p>Notably, Bitcoin has witnessed a significant trend amid its sideways movement. According to Cryptoquant, there has been an 80% decline in addresses sending their coins to crypto exchanges over 612 days. Additionally, since March 2020, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have dropped by over 30%, marking the first consistent period of decreasing supply in Bitcoin&#8217;s history.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;This suggests an enduring and positive evolution in the general perception of Bitcoin, especially when coupled with BlackRock and other ETFs recently filed/re-filed and some of the upcoming regulatory frameworks being introduced among leading markets, particularly the G20. Retail traders and institutions are holding more Bitcoin than ever,&#8221;</em> wrote Cryptoquant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I4ZiUADDRVRE5uqabB89vxA4PG2jkA2HTX2Vex_CHYnuu0WQmqnagiw6_QaEejdk7r9mtOAMAWNM0DitoaR2Gnqxmk3Q_sgsToPc2Emwhzci6gOHOkS7ph9ZjHlxKifUpsk8Q1RWvYhm1wLLx-TQ1Q" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Institutional investors have also continued accumulating Bitcoin, as noted by &#8220;Tarek Onchain,&#8221; an analyst for Cryptoquant. In a note on Monday, Tarek observed a significant upward trend in the accumulation of BTC by institutional entities, demonstrating a strong interest in acquiring the cryptocurrency at its current price level.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;By closely observing fund holdings, we can identify a significant upward trend in the accumulation of bitcoins by these institutional entities. This exponential increase in holdings indicates a strong interest to acquire Bitcoin, even at its current price level,&#8221;</em> said Tarek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Historically, institutional investors are known to demonstrate a patient approach, seeking long-term investment opportunities in Bitcoin, which is good for price.</p>



<p>That said, from a technical point of view, Diana, a CFA financial analyst, wrote on Monday that bulls appear hesitant to take profits at current prices, which indicates their optimistic outlook for further price gains. In her <a href="https://twitter.com/Forex__XAUUSD/status/1675753053780324354">analysis</a>, Diana argued that if Bitcoin manages to break and sustain its position above $31,000, it could potentially initiate the next phase of its upward trend, with a target of $40,000.</p>



<p><em>“Buyers must push and sustain the price above the $31,431 mark to signal a resumption of upward momentum,”</em> she added.</p>



<p>Conversely, the pundit mentioned that for the Bears to make a comeback, they would need to drive the price down and maintain it below $27,622.</p>



<p>That said, amid a cautious market sentiment prevailing during the current consolidation period, traders and investors eagerly await a breakthrough above resistance or below support levels, setting the stage for the next substantial price movement. Notably, resilient demand amidst declining exchange inflows and continued institutional accumulation paint a promising future for Bitcoin, hinting at potential upward momentum shortly.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin traded at $30,425 after a 1.99% decline in the past 24 hours. </p>

<p>Arrington Capital, a prominent Washington-based digital asset management firm, has recently taken a significant step towards launching an XRP-based hedge fund.</p>



<p>The news of this development was initially disclosed on Twitter by U.S. presidential candidate and CEO of Reaper Financial Patrick Riley on July 2. In his tweet, Riley mentioned that Arrington Capital had recently submitted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an XRP-focused hedge fund, indicating a positive outlook for the endeavour. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;Arrington recently filed with the SEC for an XRP-based hedge fund. Seems there is an expectation for all to go well&#8230;&#8221;</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/PLR_2024/status/1675296576368001025">tweeted</a> Riley sharing a photo of Michael Arrington, the founder of Arrington Capital, alongside Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple. According to documents perused by ZyCrypto, the filing was made on June 30, 2023.</p>



<p>The said filing elicited excitement among the crypto community, with Pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton jokingly tweeting, <em>&#8220;What do you do when the SEC has spent well over a $100M in manpower and resources the last three years arguing XRP is an illegal security? You apply for an XRP Hedge Fund.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Hedge funds are investment vehicles or firms that pool capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors to invest in a variety of assets to generate returns. They are known for their flexibility in investing across different markets and asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>While specifics regarding the hedge fund are scarce at the moment, Riley&#8217;s announcement suggests that Arrington Capital holds an optimistic view of the potential outcome of the Ripple-SEC case, prompting them to create a hedge fund centered around XRP. Arrington Capital has established two additional funds focused on the Algorand and Moonbeam ecosystems, along with a diverse portfolio of over eighty investments spanning various protocols.</p>



<p>Arrington Capital&#8217;s recent action holds substantial significance for Ripple and XRP, particularly in light of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-continues-to-see-new-twists-and-turns-as-alderoty-reveals-ripples-benefits-in-sec-case/">SEC&#8217;s ongoing lawsuit</a> brought against Ripple. The lawsuit, initiated in December 2020, alleges that XRP, currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is unregistered security. With all necessary motions filed, the case has been awaiting a summary judgment from Judge Analisa Torres, who presides over the matter.</p>



<p>While the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC case remains uncertain, attorneys, including prominent figures like John Deaton, have been actively offering their predictions on the possible outcomes of this legal battle. Notably, the possibility of an <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-crypto-lawyer-sheds-light-on-imminent-judgment-in-sec-case-as-xrp-army-awaits-verdict/">imminent judgment</a> in the Ripple-SEC case has sparked extensive speculation, particularly after recent remarks from the Ripple CEO suggesting it could arrive within weeks. </p>

<p>Cardano (ADA) has experienced a relatively flat trading pattern since last October, lacking significant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ada-eyes-explosive-adoption-as-49-billion-telecom-giant-vodafone-chooses-cardano-for-first-nft-drop/">upward momentum</a>. The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently down approximately 92% from its all-time high of $3.</p>



<p>However, ADA&#8217;s recent price behaviour has shown some signs of recovery. After hitting a low of $0.22 earlier last month, it has since rebounded by around 33%, with experts now predicting a potential surge in its price in the coming months.</p>



<p>According to popular crypto analyst Alan Santana, the focus should be on the long-term perspective when evaluating ADA&#8217;s potential. In a recent analysis on Tradingview, Santana highlighted a pattern sequence consisting of three stages that could drive ADA&#8217;s price during the upcoming bull market. The pundit opined that the first two stages have already been completed, with the third stage expected to follow.</p>



<p>Santana&#8217;s analysis pointed to potential price targets once the bull market resumes. He predicted that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">Cardano</a> could reach $0.665 this year and potentially even surge as high as $1.34. In the long term, Santana anticipated targets of $2 and $2.5. Moreover, he mentioned the possibility of ADA reaching new all-time highs, indicating potential levels of $4.9 and $7.77, with the potential for even higher prices in the future.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hPVunKXh0nDc_tZAkvUDWj9XDqDiWnJa2nQMDS33LpkYlrPaXlT4z2FiX4EFN8plX6t0zuje6cQbAFBQs4k1ZoXCPBJ65NPtQw_74JG6DlcvpBBgwNKCjcMPqn1cOVhmF1-8DfasxF_RU4V27GETlQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Another analyst, Dan Gambardello, also shared his insights on Cardano&#8217;s price movement, observing various indicators that suggest ADA may continue its upward momentum. In a July 4 video, the analyst emphasized the importance of ADA breaking through the $0.32 key resistance level, which coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci resistance and the 50-day moving average.</p>



<p>He noted that ADA had exhibited higher highs and lows, indicative of upward momentum. Examining ADA&#8217;s weekly chart, he pointed out a higher low on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) from a previous swing low, which coincided with the bear market low in December 2022. He says this bullish divergence on the weekly chart suggests a positive outlook for ADA.</p>



<p>The analyst further attributed ADA&#8217;s oversold condition to the recent news surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and acknowledged that other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have different chart patterns than ADA. However, he emphasized that ADA has significant ground to cover to catch up with its counterparts.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem has continued to thrive, further supporting predictions for price growth. Notably, the DeFi sector has experienced exponential growth, witnessing a remarkable surge of over 148% in Total Value Locked (TVL) during the first half of 2023. Moreover, the number of projects being developed on the network reached a new high last month, with a total of 1261 projects now building and an impressive 131 projects already being launched.</p>



<p>ADA was trading at $0.2936 at press time, up 1.18% in the past day and just over 5% in the past week.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin could surpass its one-year high after finishing June on a positive note.</li>



<li>Experts say the decline in liquidity has the potential to result in an upward trend, as on-chain metrics indicate bullishness.</li>



<li>The chatter about a spot Bitcoin ETF has contributed its fair share to a surge in the asset’s price over the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>As the U.S. celebrates Independence Day, Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are rubbing their hands in glee at the prospects of the asset surpassing its 52-week high.</p>



<p>Onchain analytics indicate a cooling of the virtual currency markets ahead of the holidays marked by dwindling levels of liquidity. Despite the falling liquidity metrics, pundits aver that Bitcoin is poised for a rally, building upon an already impressive streak.</p>



<p><em>“Historically liquidity is definitely lower around holidays and combined with a relatively large increase in leverage recently, prices will be more susceptible to sharp movements,”</em> remarked Kyle Doane, an executive at Arca. <em>“The market is still leaning bullish and overall sentiments continue to improve.”</em></p>



<p>At the start of the week, BTC climbed to $31,375 after a strong show of resilience in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. Pundits are predicting that the asset class will surge past its one-year high of $31,389 over the holidays, but it all hangs in the balance.</p>



<p>Since the start of the year, BTC has climbed by a staggering 80% from lows of around $16,000. Although the current price is still a far cry from the all-time high of $68,789, the steady upward momentum of BTC in 2023 offers a glimmer of hope to investors of the asset class.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s rise in recent weeks has rubbed off positively on the shares of several digital asset companies in the space, with the stock of U.S,-based exchange, Coinbase climbing by 12% to trade at $79.93. Other firms notching impressive wins in the build-up to the holidays include Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy, and Riot Platforms as they recorded double-digit wins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-etfs-stoking-the-flames"><strong>Bitcoin ETFs stoking the flames</strong></h2>



<p>There has been significant activity around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with a clutch of firms amending their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">applications</a> to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Under the new amendments, applicants are naming markets to be monitored in a new surveillance-sharing agreement. Fidelity and BlackRock are jostling for the SEC’s approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the potential to send the asset class to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-gains-fidelity-re-files-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-amongst-many-is-demand-driving-btc-price/">new highs</a>.</p>



<p>In the weeks following the SEC’s approval for a future-based Bitcoin ETF, the asset class <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-briefly-touches-60000-thanks-to-reports-sec-wont-block-btc-futures-etf-in-the-us/">surged</a> to its peak of $68,789 back in November 2021.</p>

<p>After hitting highs well above $0.55 in Mid-June, the highest for XRP since Late 2022, the price of XRP has been somewhat on the decline. Currently, XRP sits just above 48 cents and is the only top ten coin in the red. A reason for the lacklustre performance may be the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, where a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-crypto-lawyer-sheds-light-on-imminent-judgment-in-sec-case-as-xrp-army-awaits-verdict/">decision by Judge Torres is expected</a> any day now.</p>



<p>However, a <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/citigroup-reviews-partnership-with-crypto-custodian-metaco-1.1939963">report</a> by Bloomberg suggests there could be other reasons for the below-par performance of XRP. According to the report and citing unnamed sources, Citigroup Inc. is presently reevaluating its collaboration with the Swiss fintech firm Metaco to custody digital assets. The collaboration between Citigroup and Metaco was first revealed roughly a year ago.</p>



<p>Ripple Labs, combating the US Securities and Exchange Commission in court for years, had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">paid $250 million to acquire Metaco</a>. It&#8217;s unclear whether Ripple&#8217;s purchase of Metaco has anything to do with Citigroup&#8217;s reconsideration of the collaboration. According to Ripple, Metaco will continue to run independently under its current CEO, Adrien Treccani.</p>



<p>Last year, Metaco also established partnerships with BNP Paribas SA and Forge, Societe Generale SA&#8217;s division for digital assets. According to Bloomberg, while BNP Paribas did not comment on the collaboration, Societe Generale confirmed their relationship with Metaco was still active and operational.</p>



<p>Ripple purchased Metaco as part of a strategic drive to diversify the company&#8217;s offerings beyond payments. With the acquisition, Ripple could allow its customers to tokenize, settle, and offer custody services for various assets.</p>



<p>When Ripple took over Metaco in May, CEO Brad Garlinghouse outlined the high hopes the company seemed to have in the acquisition. Garlinghouse said: <em>“Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint</em>.”</p>



<p>Regarding XRP price, whether the news about Citigroup and Metaco will deter investors in the long run, remains to be seen. A decision in the lawsuit may likely serve much more as a catalyst of any price movement, with some pundits expecting solid performance in case of a Ripple win.</p>



<p>However, given the magnitude of the case, many legal commentators seem to have already factored in that no matter how the judge decides, the case will likely come in front of appellate courts and perhaps even as high as the Supreme Court of the United States. In this case, the price of XRP could remain suppressed for an indefinite amount of time.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu, the renowned meme-based cryptocurrency, experienced an astounding 1900% burn rate surge within 24 hours. This remarkable spike came on the heels of the Shibarium testnet, Puppynet, reaching a significant milestone of 25 million total transactions, generating immense excitement and anticipation for the imminent mainnet release.</p>



<p>PuppyScan, the dedicated blockchain explorer for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-gathers-pace-with-big-metaverse-updates-amid-rocket-pond-reveal-as-0-001-shib-price-beckons/">Shiba Inu</a>, reported that the Shibarium beta testnet had surpassed the impressive mark of 25 million transactions at a staggering 25,507,335. Moreover, 17,001,839 wallet addresses have actively participated in Shiba Inu transactions, highlighting the widespread engagement and interest in this captivating cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The testnet has processed over 1,483,165 blocks, boasting an impressive average block time of 7.5 seconds. These impressive statistics showcase the efficiency and scalability of the testnet and contribute to the growing optimism surrounding Shiba Inu and the expanding possibilities within its ecosystem.</p>



<p>The excitement further intensified when Shytoshi Kusama, the esteemed lead developer of SHIB, took to Twitter to share a compelling 19-second video clip accompanied by an image featuring the iconic dog-headed SHIB logo. While the video contained minimal captions, it offered a tantalizing glimpse into the project&#8217;s plans. The dynamic motion lettering within the video alluded to an imminent revelation, with the cryptic message, &#8220;Something is coming. Actually, we are going somewhere.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-unlocks-remarkable-price-trajectory-amid-exciting-ecosystem-updates-for-shibarium/">Shibarium</a>, a cutting-edge Layer 2 blockchain platform, is poised to empower the development of Decentralized Applications (DApps). As the launch of the mainnet approaches, Shiba Inu enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the boundless opportunities and prospects that this innovative platform will unlock.</p>



<p>Regarding price action, Shiba Inu was observed trading at $0.000007722, registering a notable 3% increase in the past 24 hours. While volatility is inherent in the cryptocurrency market, the recent surge in burn rate and the significant milestone achieved by the Shibarium testnet undoubtedly contribute to the prevailing positive sentiment surrounding Shiba Inu amid calls for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">$0.001 SHIB price</a>.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits further updates and announcements from the dedicated team behind Shiba Inu, the resounding success of the Shibarium testnet and the growing engagement with Shiba Inu transactions establish a solid foundation for the project&#8217;s future growth and widespread adoption.</p>

<p>Jack Dorsey, the founder and former CEO of Twitter, has urged the current leadership to integrate censorship-resistant protocols to help alleviate the burden of restrictions. This comes just months after billionaire Elon Musk acquired the social media giant and embarked on a journey to transform the platform.</p>



<p>Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1675280187704086528">tweeted</a> early Sunday, acknowledging the challenges of running Twitter and expressing hope for the platform&#8217;s success. He further emphasized the importance of building on open protocols like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-refusal-to-approve-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-makes-it-a-failed-regulator-says-geminis-cameron-winklevoss/">Bitcoin</a> and NOSTR to preserve the open internet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_XwRZf2kieCN-aye4y5GTJFiZpQCkvgl6-5jMWXQx1ypNgutXGbtzBWeXASWDaDAGEKj_rWCpr5rQ6-jZz2kjmOxF_3qQpyKeaavCHe_LXlSSShsrDIF4Tj5gesJU3Hn7ijLpd7WcjtQ8437p_yxLg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>NOSTR is a protocol designed to create a censorship-resistant global social network using simple and flexible event objects and standard elliptic-curve cryptography for keys and signing.</p>



<p>The timing of Dorsey&#8217;s tweet was notable, as it came just minutes before Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, announced temporary limits on account activities to address issues of data scraping and system manipulation.</p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s tweet sparked speculation about the platform&#8217;s future direction under his leadership, with various users reporting temporary restrictions to views. In a later tweet, the Tesla boss stated that implementing the rate limit on Twitter was a last resort to prevent competitors from accessing Twitter&#8217;s data. While acknowledging that it is a temporary measure, he assured users that normal Twitter functionality would be restored.</p>



<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s acquisition of Twitter last year was met with anticipation and concern. The $44 billion deal marked a significant moment for the social media service but also raised questions about the platform&#8217;s direction under Musk&#8217;s ownership.</p>



<p>Musk, known for his strong views on free speech, expressed his intention to create a more freewheeling platform, reverse the permanent ban on former President Donald J. Trump and integrate cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-hints-at-integrating-dogecoin-for-millions-of-users-if-he-buys-twitter-or-creates-own-platform/">Dogecoin</a> for payments. Musk&#8217;s ownership of Twitter also promised sweeping changes for the platform, including pledging new leadership, job cuts, and innovative strategies to monetize the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critics, however, have been voicing concerns about the potential for increased toxic content and misinformation on Twitter, with the public Square being sued for various alleged violations, including a $250 million copyright case last week by 17 music publishers.</p>



<p>That said, as Elon Musk addresses the challenges faced by Twitter, Dorsey&#8217;s proposition on the integration of Bitcoin and NOSTR holds the potential to revolutionize the platform into a more decentralized and censorship-resistant space, according to some. At press time, however, Musk was yet to respond to the proposition.</p>

<p>In a scathing critique of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, has condemned the regulatory body for its decade-long <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-non-futures-etf-structure-is-the-superior-approach-says-vaneck-ceo-as-sec-refuses-to-approve-a-bitcoin-spot-fund/">refusal to approve</a> a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>



<p>In a Sunday tweet, the crypto guru claimed that the SEC&#8217;s actions have been detrimental to U.S. investors and demonstrated its failure as a regulator. Winklevoss&#8217;s statement came on the 10th anniversary of his initial filing for the first <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-gains-fidelity-re-files-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-amongst-many-is-demand-driving-btc-price/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>



<p>Over the years, the SEC has repeatedly rejected proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs, denying investors the opportunity to access one of the best-performing assets of the last decade. Winklevoss argued that this refusal had had significant negative consequences, forcing investors into alternative avenues that offer suboptimal options. Specifically, he highlighted the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as a prime example.</p>



<p>According to him, the SEC is a failed regulator because it <em>“‘protected’ investors from the best-performing asset of the last decade -pushed investors into toxic products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which trades at a massive discount to NAV and charges astronomical fees.”</em></p>



<p>Moreover, Winklevoss pointed out that the SEC&#8217;s refusal to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs had pushed spot Bitcoin activity offshore, diverting it to unlicensed and unregulated venues. This trend poses potential risks for investors who seek exposure to cryptocurrency but are forced to operate in a less secure environment.</p>



<p>Winklevoss accused the SEC of indirectly leading investors into the arms of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/house-committee-requests-information-on-gary-genslers-interaction-with-sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx/">FTX</a>. This cryptocurrency exchange was embroiled in one of the largest financial frauds in modern history. In his view, by failing to provide a regulated avenue for investors to access Bitcoin through spot ETFs, the SEC inadvertently directed them to less trustworthy platforms, exposing them to more significant risks.</p>



<p>Calling for a reassessment of the SEC&#8217;s approach, Winklevoss suggested that the regulatory body should focus on its core responsibilities of investor protection, fostering fair and orderly markets, and facilitating capital formation. By doing so, the SEC could have achieved far better outcomes for U.S. investors.</p>



<p>This critique from Winklevoss comes in the wake of recent statements by the SEC that ETF filings by BlackRock and others were &#8220;inadequate&#8221;. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has expressed concerns over investor protection, market manipulation, and the need for robust regulatory oversight before greenlighting such products, stating last month that &#8220;<em>There’s nothing about the crypto securities markets that suggests that investors and issuers are less deserving of the protections of our securities laws.”</em></p>



<p>However, Gensler’s assertions have been heavily criticized, with industry players accusing him of overreaching his mandate under U.S. securities laws. Notably, in the past few weeks, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-lawmakers-officially-introduce-legislation-to-oust-sec-chair-gary-gensler/">calls for his sacking have increased</a>, with pro-crypto congressman Warren Davidson filing a bill last month to reform the SEC and remove the “tyrannical Chairman” Gary Gensler.</p>
