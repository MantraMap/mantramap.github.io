Bulls Trying To Ease Market Pressure Dogecoin market sentiment seems bearish as today&#8217;s Fear &#38; Greed Index is 27 (Fear). This indicates a relatively low investor sentiment towards DOGE and suggests that the market may be experiencing fear or uncertainty. Notably, DOGE is experiencing high volatility, fluctuating rapidly over short periods. Despite the downtrend, the Dogecoin bulls are trying to ease market pressure by continuing to buy the asset and pushing its price up. Dogecoin trades below the 50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). These levels indicate that DOGE is in a downtrend or bearish movement due to high selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator shows 45.24, which suggests that the asset&#8217;s momentum is relatively neutral. An RSI reading of 45.24 is closer to the oversold region than the overbought territory, which may indicate that the asset is slightly undervalued or oversold. The MACD trades below the signal line, indicating that the sellers control the market. The MACD histogram also confirms the bearish sentiment as the histogram is below the zero line.
