										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The advent of LSDFi has stirred a frenzy among blockchain enthusiasts as it introduces exciting new possibilities to the DeFi space. As a result, various parties are now vying for dominance over vePENDLE, a sought-after asset within the Pendle ecosystem. The battle lines are drawn, and PenPie, Equilibria, and Stake DAO have emerged as the main contenders in this epic conflict.</strong></h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As the conflict intensifies, all eyes turn to two main players, PenPie and Equilibria, due to Stake DAO&#8217;s limited traction in the vePENDLE arena. In this article, <a href="https://twitter.com/Coincuofficial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coincu</a> delves into the current situation of the Pendle War.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824.png" alt="Pendle War Intensify: PenPie And Equilibria Battle for Yield Farming Supremacy" class="wp-image-205847" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824-750x393.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Pendle War Intensify: PenPie And Equilibria Battle for Yield Farming Supremacy 1"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Causes of Pendle War</h2>



<p>With its unique features and tools, Pendle empowers users to maximize interest rates, increase yields during bull markets, and offer hedging plans during bear markets.</p>



<p>At its core, Pendle utilizes three main tools to achieve its objectives. First is the concept of yield tokenization, which involves creating encrypted versions of tokens that yield on the Pendle platform. These yield tokens (PT and YT) are crucial for participating in Pendle&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>



<p>The second tool is Pendle&#8217;s Automated Market Maker (AMM), allowing users to trade the PT and YT yield tokens, enabling them to capitalize on fluctuating yields in response to token price movements and other market factors.</p>



<p>The third tool is governance, where Pendle leverages vePendle for project administration. This mechanism incentivizes projects to accumulate and acquire vePENDLE, sparking a governance battle within the DeFi market, known as Pendle War.</p>



<p>Pendle War revolves around projects competing for vePENDLE and attempting to attract holders from the parent project to their own child projects. The allure lies in the possibility of acquiring a substantial amount of veTokens, which confers greater power in directing incentives, rewards, and emission flows into the pools for their benefit.</p>



<p>The ongoing Pendle War currently features a heated competition between two major projects, Equilibria (ePENDLE) and Penpie (mPENDLE), with others such as Stake DAO and Swell Network also joining the fray. As more projects are expected to participate in the near future, users stand to benefit from the optimized yield sources created by these subprojects.</p>



<p>The success of Pendle is evident in the continuous inflow of funds, propelling its Total Value Locked (TVL) to new all-time highs. According to Defilama, Pendle&#8217;s TVL has surged nearly tenfold since the beginning of the year, growing from $15 million to an impressive $150 million.</p>



<p>In addition to the TVL growth, the native token PENDLE has experienced significant price appreciation despite the overall market being in a downtrend. The token&#8217;s value surged from $0.04 to approximately $1, marking an impressive 25-fold increase in the second half of 2023. Furthermore, Pendle&#8217;s listing on Binance on July 3 has attracted additional attention and interest from the market.</p>



<p>Another factor fueling Pendle&#8217;s growth is its association with the booming LSDFi (Leveraged Staking DeFi) array. As LSDFi&#8217;s TVL continues to climb, Pendle&#8217;s prominence within this segment also rises. Reports from reputable organizations like Binance Research have contributed to a surge in community attention towards LSDFi and Pendle.</p>



<p>Pendle has created a new market in the Crypto market that is DeFi Yield &#8211; Trading Protocol. With Pendle, users can build strategies to generate profits from their own future profits. Currently, the assets that Pendle is aiming for are LST (Liquid Staking Token), such as sfxrETH, stETH. It can be said that up to the present time, Pendle is doing one of the platforms leading the recent LSDfi trend.</p>



<p>Pendle&#8217;s veToken model has some of the following characteristics:</p>



<ul>
<li>vePENDLE will be locked for a maximum of 2 years the value of vePENDLE will gradually decrease within 2 years.</li>



<li>Voters use vePENDLE to boost yield from LPs and share revenue with the protocol.</li>



<li>Participating in voter voting will receive additional incentives &amp; transaction fees from voting pools.</li>
</ul>



<p>It can be seen that the model of vePENDLE has many similarities with the model of veCRV. The key point here is that Pendle must have a large revenue stream, which is currently being shown when <a href="https://defillama.com/top-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TVL</a> and volume on Pendle are still growing very well.</p>



<p>This has opened up a real war that is Pendle War. In this war, two names are competing fiercely, which are Penpie and Equilibria. Now we&#8217;ll take a closer look at this war to see who is benefiting and which project&#8217;s strategy will help them win the Pendle War.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Overview of Pendle War</h2>



<p>PenPie and Equilibria, are currently engaged in a heated battle for dominance in the <a href="https://dune.com/coumarin/pendle-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pendle War</a>. The focus lies on their vePENDLE holdings, with both projects accounting for a substantial amount of this coveted asset, while Stake DAO trails behind with a mere 2.99 percent share.</p>

<p>VePENDLE, an essential asset for yield optimization, serves as the battleground for PenPie and Equilibria, and understanding their respective approaches is crucial.</p>



<ul>
<li>PenPie, a robust Yield Farming platform, is deployed on both Ethereum and Arbitrum chains. The vePENDLE amount on PenPie is calculated by combining holdings on both chains, offering users the potential for higher rewards.</li>



<li>On the other hand, Equilibria also operates on two chains but solely calculates its vePENDLE amount on Ethereum. Although it provides a Yield Farming solution for vePENDLE holders, it lacks the cumulative approach offered by PenPie.</li>
</ul>



<p>A Brief Introduction to PenPie and Equilibria:</p>



<ul>
<li>PenPie, designed by the Magpie team, aims to maximize profits for PENDLE holders. It leverages the expertise gained from the successful Wombat Wars project on both BNB Chain and Arbitrum.</li>



<li>Equilibria, on the other hand, provides a platform for PENDLE holders to profit from vePENDLE without the concern of locked assets in the protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Battle Factors</strong></h3>



<p>In this Pendle War clash, several factors will determine the ultimate victor:</p>



<ul>
<li>APR from PENDLE deposits: PenPie holds a clear advantage in terms of profitability metrics for PENDLE depositors into the protocol. Its higher APR attracts users seeking greater returns.</li>



<li>Peg holding during AMM switches: The ability to maintain the peg when users switch back to PENDLE on the AMM is a crucial factor. Both platforms will be evaluated based on their efficiency in this regard.</li>



<li>Native tokens for Liquidity Mining: The availability of remaining Native Tokens to use for Liquidity Mining will play a significant role in attracting users and Total Value Locked (TVL).</li>



<li>Team Experience: The development teams&#8217; experience in similar battles will be a determinant in ensuring a robust and reliable platform.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Current Status</strong></h3>



<p>As of now, both platforms hold a comparable amount of vePENDLE. PenPie, apart from its substantial vePENDLE holdings, has also established itself as a successful project on Camelot, the premier Launchpad platform on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Its token price has experienced a fivefold increase compared to the initial IDO price, adding to its allure for users.</p>



<p>Equilibria, while offering a slightly better option for compounding Pendle profits, faces stiff competition from PenPie. Both platforms have recently launched their native tokens, creating incentives to attract users, with TVL levels remaining on par.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The Pendle War is in full swing, with PenPie and Equilibria battling it out for supremacy in the yield farming landscape. PenPie&#8217;s cumulative vePENDLE holdings, higher APR, and successful track record provide a competitive edge. However, Equilibria&#8217;s unique proposition for mitigating locked assets may also resonate with some users. As the war unfolds, factors like user adoption, community support, and platform innovation will ultimately determine the winner in this highly contested arena.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Worldcoin is not available for use or purchase by US persons or companies.</em></li>



<li><em>US persons are restricted from accessing Worldcoin and services of certain countries and regions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unlike offshore exchanges, none of the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase Kraken, has Worldcoin listed. Worldcoin <a href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/tokenomics" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/tokenomics" rel="noreferrer noopener">notes </a>that WLD tokens are not available to persons or companies residing in the United States. However, World ID and TFH&#8217;s World App are still available in the United States.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1823.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1823-1024x576.png" alt="Worldcoin Takes Over The World As Its Name, Except The United States" class="wp-image-205841" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1823-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1823-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1823-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1823-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1823-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1823.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Worldcoin Takes Over The World As Its Name, Except The United States 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Worldcoin, the most widely distributed digital currency, is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. The WLD token, alongside World ID, will be used for protocol governance and form the foundation of the largest privacy-preserving identity and financial network. However, US-based cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken do not currently list Worldcoin. The WLD tokens are unavailable to US persons or companies, although World ID and TFH’s World App remain available in the United States.</p>



<p>According to the whitepaper, the majority of WLD tokens will be given to individuals simply for being unique humans. The majority of humans who are alive today will receive WLD tokens, making it the most widely distributed digital currency. This makes Worldcoin an attractive option for those who want to be part of a digital currency that is accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>Worldcoin is not intended to be available for use, purchase, or access by US persons, including US citizens, residents, or persons in the United States, or companies incorporated, located, or resident in the United States, or who have a registered agent in the United States. Worldcoin is not alone in restricting access to its services. US persons are restricted from accessing services of countries or regions such as Syria, Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, Russia, North Korea, Iran, or Cuba.</p>

<p>As interest in the LSDfi sector grows, investors and enthusiasts are closely monitoring the development potential and community support for this attractive project. This is a remarkable project and follows the current trend. Does the project have enough development potential and receive great investment from the community? Let&#8217;s find out with Coincu through this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Raft?</h2>



<p>Raft Finance is a decentralized borrowing and lending protocol on the Ethereum network, providing users with the means to optimize capital efficiency while ensuring asset stability.</p>



<p>The core concept behind Raft Finance lies in its unique approach to lending stablecoin R. Users can achieve this by staking stETH or wstETH, two innovative tokens that play a vital role in the borrowing and lending process. By staking these tokens, users gain access to stablecoin R, receiving a loan amount equivalent to the value of their staked assets. This groundbreaking mechanism empowers users to make the most of their holdings and enhance profits through efficient lending and borrowing.</p>



<p>At its heart, Raft Finance aims to establish a decentralized financial ecosystem on the Ethereum network, enabling users to effectively manage and optimize their capital in a secure and stable environment. By harnessing the power of DeFi, Raft Finance presents a solution to enhance capital efficiency for its growing user base.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<p>What sets R apart from its predecessors, SAI (Single Collateral Dai) and LUSD, is its innovative approach to stability, enhanced capital efficiency, and flexible fee structures, making it the preferred choice for borrowing against LSD collateral.</p>



<p>At the heart of R&#8217;s stability lies a unique combination of two mechanisms: the Hard Peg and the Soft Peg. Together, these mechanisms ensure that the value of R always remains fixed to the US dollar, offering a stable price between $1 and $1.20.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hard Peg: The Arbitrage Mechanism</strong></h3>



<p>The Hard Peg is the foundation upon which R maintains its stable price within the designated range. This mechanism is governed by two key features: Redemption and Over-Collateralization.</p>



<p>The Redemption feature allows users to exchange R tokens for wstETH (wrapped stETH) at a value equivalent to 1 USD. Notably, when R tokens are redeemed, they are subsequently burned, effectively reducing the circulating supply and contributing to an increase in the price of R. This ensures that even if the price of R falls below the $1 mark, users have the opportunity to redeem their tokens and help stabilize the value.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Over-Collateralization empowers users to mortgage their wstETH in order to mint R tokens. This process enables users to create R tokens at a fixed price of 1 USD, providing an opportunity for profit-making through price differences. By allowing an increase in the supply, the protocol also counterbalances situations where the price of R might surge beyond the $1.20 threshold, thereby aiding in stabilizing the coin&#8217;s value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Soft Peg: Unleashing Capital Efficiency</strong></h3>



<p>Complementing the Hard Peg, the Soft Peg mechanism optimizes capital utilization for users by leveraging price fluctuations of R tokens. This approach grants users the freedom to employ strategic tactics to predict and capitalize on the future price movements of R.</p>



<p>During instances where the price of R experiences fluctuations, the protocol incentivizes borrowers to hold onto their positions instead of immediately returning them. This encouragement to hold positions is driven by the understanding that other users may seize the opportunity for profit-making during these price swings.</p>



<p>In conclusion, R has emerged as a game-changer in the realm of stablecoins, harnessing the power of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSDs) like stETH and rETH to ensure capital efficiency on the Ethereum network. Its robust combination of the Hard Peg and Soft Peg mechanisms guarantees that the value of R remains steadfastly anchored to the US dollar while also promoting efficient and instant liquidation. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, R stands at the forefront, providing users with a reliable and innovative stablecoin solution that paves the way for a more secure and prosperous future in the decentralized financial landscape.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Products</h2>



<p>Raft primarily offers borrowing and lending products on Ethereum.</p>



<p>The core features of Raft&#8217;s revolutionary protocol are designed to cater to the financial needs of its users:</p>



<ul>
<li>Borrowing Stablecoin R: Through the process of staking stETH or wstETH, users gain access to borrowing stablecoin R. This enables them to secure a loan amount equivalent to the value they have staked, providing a seamless and efficient borrowing experience.</li>



<li>Lending and Profit: Raft protocol extends the opportunity for users to lend the borrowed R stablecoin, which they obtained through staking stETH or wstETH. By actively participating in the lending process, users can increase their overall returns on assets.</li>



<li>Efficient Asset Management: A standout advantage of the Raft protocol in its ability to assist users in managing and optimizing their capital effectively. By engaging in borrowing and lending using stETH or wstETH, individuals can unlock the full potential of their assets, leading to enhanced financial growth and stability.</li>



<li>Asset Stability: One of the paramount concerns for users engaged in trading and borrowing is asset stability. Raft addresses this by users allows to stake stETH or wstETH to borrow stablecoin R, thus safeguarding the stability of their assets throughout these processes.</li>
</ul>



<p>In essence, Raft&#8217;s decentralized lending and borrowing protocol on the Ethereum network stands as a pivotal step forward in the realm of blockchain-based finance. By granting users the ability to borrow stablecoin R through staking stETH or wstETH, the platform offers a powerful and secure means of optimizing capital efficiency and enabling asset stability in an ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>



<p>The R token economy has introduced a groundbreaking borrowing and repayment system, revolutionizing the way users interact with the token. This system requires users to create a position by depositing their LSD with a collateral rate of at least 120% for every R token borrowed. The minimum amount of R borrowed has been set at 3,000 tokens (~3,000 USD), ensuring a stable and secure borrowing process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Borrowing</strong></h3>



<p>To borrow R tokens, users must deposit their LSD as collateral, maintaining a collateral rate of at least 120%. This mechanism acts as a safety net for the lending process and protects both borrowers and lenders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Returning</strong></h3>



<p>There are three distinct methods for repaying the borrowed R tokens:</p>



<ul>
<li>Loan Repayment: Borrowers can repay the previous loan along with accrued interest to retrieve their collateral LSD token. This method encourages responsible borrowing and timely repayment.</li>



<li>Redemption: Holders of R tokens can participate in the market and acquire another borrower&#8217;s collateral LSD. This allows for greater flexibility in the ecosystem, as tokens can change hands while maintaining stability.</li>



<li>Liquidation: In case of default, a Liquidator pays off the borrower&#8217;s debt with R tokens at the Minimum Mortgage Rate (MCR) and receives the collateral LSD token along with the Liquidation Bonus from the previous borrower. This process helps maintain the liquidity and health of the overall economy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, to ensure the stability of the R token economy, the number of R tokens used in these repayment methods will be burned.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flash Mint</strong></h3>



<p>The introduction of Flash Mint has empowered users with a powerful tool that allows them to mint R tokens up to 10% of the total R supply without making any initial payments. However, there is a 0.5% Fast Mint Rate applicable, which needs to be repaid in the same transaction. Initially, the rate has been capped at 0.5%, but market efficiency can push it up to 5%.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oracle</strong></h3>



<p>The R token economy boasts a sophisticated Oracle system designed to be adaptable and maintainable in a multi-signature configuration. This setup enables participants with multisig capabilities to make necessary updates, ensuring the system remains robust and reliable even as market dynamics change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features</h2>



<p>Raft has seven features: Position, Redeem, Mint, Leverage, Liquidators, Frontend Operators, and Governance Forum.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Position</strong></h3>



<p>Raft enables users to borrow R tokens by opening a new position, with each wallet address representing one position. To borrow R tokens, users must stake stETH or wstETH with a minimum collateral rate of 120%. The borrowing process entails certain requirements, including a minimum loan amount of 3,000 Rs. Additionally, users are subject to a borrowing fee paid in R tokens, calculated based on the borrowed amount and rate, which is influenced by the frequency of redeeming the R token.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Redeem</strong></h3>



<p>The Redeem feature facilitates the exchange of R tokens for wstETH, with a conversion rate of 1:1 to USD. The feature involves two primary roles: Redeemers and Redemption Providers (RPs). Redeemers seek to convert R tokens into wstETH, while RPs offer wstETH to facilitate redemptions. Raft incorporates a spread mechanism, varying from 0.25% to 100%, to mitigate risks for Redeemers. Additionally, Redeemers are subject to a Redeem Fee, calculated based on the Redeem value and rate, with RPs earning a fee based on a percentage of the total fee.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mint</strong></h3>



<p>Raft allows users to mint up to 10% of the total supply of R tokens. Minting requires users to pay back R tokens in the same transaction, accompanied by a mint fee of 0.5%. Initially fixed at 0.5%, the mint fee is subject to adjustment based on the effective utilization of R tokens.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leverage</strong></h3>



<p>The Leverage feature empowers users to enhance their capital ratio for each trade, enabling higher profits from smaller investments through custom margin ratios. However, users should exercise caution, as leverage amplifies the risk of losses, especially during periods of intense market fluctuations. To maintain stability, Raft sets the maximum leverage at 6%.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquidator</strong></h3>



<p>The Liquidator&#8217;s role is crucial in ensuring that each R token maintains a value backed by 1 wstETH token, equivalent to 1 USD. In the event that a Minter&#8217;s collateral falls below 120%, they face liquidation. Users can participate as Liquidators, settling a Minter&#8217;s debt and receiving wstETH equivalent to the liquidated amount. Raft incentivizes users to become Liquidators through liquidation rewards, offering an additional source of income.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Frontend Operators</strong></h3>



<p>Raft extends its support to developers through the Frontend Operators feature, offering a toolkit that facilitates seamless integration with user dApps. Additionally, Frontend Operators gain marketing support through promotional campaigns, helping them maximize their potential rewards and contributions to the project.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Governance Forum</strong></h3>



<p>To maintain decentralization, Raft provides users with an opportunity to participate in the governance forum, enabling them to actively contribute to the platform&#8217;s governance. Users can voice their opinions on key areas such as the appointment of the Liquidity Committee, defining liquidity pools for the R token, treasury fund allocation, and protocol fees, including mint fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Team</h2>



<p>David Garai (Founder) is the project&#8217;s strategic, financial, and operational leader. He has worked as a lawyer in both London and Tokyo.</p>



<p>Raft&#8217;s co-founder, Ore Mijovi, is in charge of technological supervision. He formerly worked at the Ethereum Foundation as a lead developer of the Solidity compiler.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Investors &amp; Partners</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors</strong></h3>



<p>While the precise amount collected by the Raft Finance project is unknown, it is obvious that the initiative has attracted funding from renowned investment firms such as <a href="https://coincu.com/167938-jump-crypto-identified-as-third-party/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jump Crypto</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/199861-wintermute-trading-transfers-5-08m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wintermute</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), the LSDfi sector has seen remarkable innovations, with Raft Finance emerging as a notable player alongside its leading counterpart, Lybra Finance. While both projects operate within the LSDfi landscape, they boast distinctive features that set them apart.</p>



<p>One of the striking contrasts lies in their loan mechanisms. <a href="https://coincu.com/189739-lybra-finance-earn-income-from-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lybra Finance</a> stands out for its interest-free loans, offering users an attractive borrowing proposition. On the other hand, Raft Finance has opted for a conservative yet practical approach, attaching a modest 5% interest rate to its loans. This distinction signifies a choice between flexible borrowing in Lybra and a slightly costlier but stable borrowing model in Raft.</p>



<p>Collateral requirements further underscore their dissimilarities. Raft Finance necessitates a collateralization rate of 120%, while Lybra Finance sets it at 150%. This variance implies that users have more flexibility with their assets in Lybra, albeit with a higher margin to safeguard against potential risks.</p>



<p>Additionally, Lybra Finance&#8217;s user-friendly environment has garnered attention. It extends a warm welcome to users from all walks of life, allowing both large and small capital holders to secure an eUSD loan. Not imposing a minimum loan amount, Lybra Finance seeks to be inclusive and accessible to all.</p>



<p>In contrast, Raft Finance has chosen to establish a minimum borrowing threshold of Rs 3,000, implying that users need to commit to a slightly higher borrowing amount. While this approach may limit some participants, it aims to maintain stability and mitigate risks through responsible borrowing practices.</p>



<p>One intriguing aspect of Raft Finance lies in its embrace of leverage within its protocol. Encouraging users to &#8220;put their faith&#8221; in the stablecoin R, the project seeks to optimize profits for those willing to take on a calculated level of leverage. Although this approach may raise initial skepticism, it also offers potential rewards for the risk-tolerant and informed investors.</p>



<p>The project&#8217;s emphasis on creating trust around its stablecoin could be seen as a daring move, but it also reveals the team&#8217;s confidence in the stability and value proposition of their offering. This &#8220;trust-building&#8221; strategy will likely unfold over time, allowing the community to assess its effectiveness and risk implications.</p>



<p>At present, the Raft Finance project remains relatively enigmatic, with limited information available for analysis. As the community gains first-hand experience with the platform, a clearer picture will emerge, enabling us to make informed judgments about its position and potential within the LSDfi segment.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the landscape of LSDfi has seen the rise of Raft Finance, presenting itself with distinct characteristics that differentiate it from its counterparts like Lybra Finance. With its prudent interest rates, collateral requirements, and intriguing embrace of leverage, Raft Finance is carving its niche within the DeFi realm. As time unfolds, the community&#8217;s exploration and assessment will determine whether this project indeed sails smoothly in the ever-evolving LSDfi domain.</p>

<p>Accounting firm BDO has given its stamp of approval to FTX&#8217;s $376 million acquisition of Swiss start-up company Digital Assets AG (DAAG), now known as FTX Europe. BDO&#8217;s assessment asserts that the transaction reasonably represents fair value, countering FTX Trading&#8217;s recent complaint.</p>



<p>The firm faced controversy when its bankruptcy lawyers sought to recover $323 million from FTX Europe&#8217;s leadership. Allegations arose that former CEO Bankman-Fried overpaid for DAAG due to his close ties with executives Patrick Gruhn, Robin Matzke, and Brandon Williams, who are all currently facing lawsuits.</p>



<p>In contrast to <a href="https://coincu.com/203770-former-ftx-at-sino-global-capital/">FTX</a> Trading&#8217;s concerns, BDO&#8217;s independent evaluation stands firm in its belief that the acquisition price was justified and fair. It indicates that the acquisition of DAAG, now operating as Europe Branch, was executed without any issues and represents a reasonable value for the deal. Notably, BDO has recently reduced its presence in the cryptocurrency space, making their objective analysis all the more crucial in this contentious matter.</p>

<p>The controversy surrounding the firm&#8217;s acquisition of DAAG has drawn significant attention within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. As the legal proceedings continue, BDO&#8217;s endorsement could potentially have a significant impact on the case&#8217;s outcome and may help quell doubts surrounding the legitimacy of the acquisition.</p>



<p>Despite BDO&#8217;s validation, the situation remains complex, and the outcome of the legal battle initiated by the firm Trading branch continues to be closely monitored by industry observers. The cryptocurrency market&#8217;s growing prominence has put acquisitions and financial dealings under heightened scrutiny, prompting firms like BDO to provide impartial evaluations of such transactions.</p>



<p>As the story unfolds, market participants and investors will be keeping a close eye on the developments, as the resolution of this dispute could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry&#8217;s mergers and acquisitions landscape.</p>

<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>The UK&#8217;s data regulator, the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO), is launching an investigation into Worldcoin, a crypto project led by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, which offers free cryptocurrency in exchange for users&#8217; iris scans.</em></li>



<li><em>Worldcoin, which recently launched with a user base of two million from its trial phase, plans to expand its eyeball-scanning operations to 20 countries, raising concerns over potential privacy risks associated with the collection and storage of sensitive biometric data.</em></li>

<p>The project, which offers users the opportunity to receive free cryptocurrency in exchange for their iris scans, has caught the attention of the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO). The ICO spokesperson informed Reuters that they have taken notice of the recent launch of Worldcoin in the UK and have decided to initiate further inquiries into the matter. This move comes amid growing concerns over the potential implications of widespread iris scanning and the use of sensitive biometric information in a financial context.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/205302-worldcoin-token-openai-ceo-sam-altman/">Worldcoin</a>&#8216;s launch on Monday attracted a substantial user base, with two million individuals participating in the trial phase of the project. As the crypto initiative scales up its operations, it plans to conduct eyeball-scanning procedures in 20 countries, aiming for a global reach.</p>



<p>The concept of utilizing iris scans for digital identification and cryptocurrency rewards has raised eyebrows among privacy advocates and regulatory bodies alike. Critics argue that the collection and storage of biometric data on such a vast scale could pose serious privacy risks for individuals, potentially leading to identity theft and misuse of sensitive information.</p>

<p>While Worldcoin promises free cryptocurrency as an incentive for users to participate, the use of biometric data remains a contentious issue. Proponents of the project claim that it can foster financial inclusion for those without access to traditional banking systems. However, detractors argue that such benefits may not outweigh the potential dangers associated with compromising biometric data.</p>



<p>As the ICO launches its investigation, Worldcoin&#8217;s future remains uncertain. The outcome of this inquiry will likely have significant implications not only for the project itself but also for the broader crypto industry&#8217;s approach to utilizing biometrics and handling user data.</p>

<p>The total amount pilfered from Alphapo has now surged to a staggering $60 million, making it a high-profile attack in the cryptocurrency world. The heist has raised concerns over security and highlighted potential vulnerabilities within the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>As per previous <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports </a>from ZachXBT&#8217;s monitoring, it was initially reported that the Alphapo hot wallet had been breached, leading to a theft of $23 million in US dollars. In response to the attack, the Alphapo HyperDrop client took immediate action by disabling withdrawals to prevent further losses.</p>



<p>The investigation into the theft has unveiled an intricate web of transactions, revealing a sophisticated and well-coordinated operation. The stolen funds were first moved to the Ethereum network, presumably in an attempt to obfuscate the source and origin of the funds. Subsequently, they were cross-linked to the Avalanche network and Bitcoin (BTC), creating multiple layers of complexity to mask the hacker&#8217;s tracks.</p>

<p>Attributing the hack to a group with potential links to Lazarus, a notorious cybercriminal organization known for conducting large-scale attacks, has further fueled concerns about the rising threats posed by such sophisticated hacking entities in the cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>The Alphapo heist serves as a stark reminder that the cryptocurrency world is not impervious to cyberattacks, and all stakeholders must remain vigilant to combat and deter such criminal activities. Collaborative efforts between exchanges, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity experts will be essential in bringing the perpetrators to justice and restoring trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The growing popularity of <a href="https://coincu.com/205356-real-world-asset-rwa-risks-to-solve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RWAs</a> in DeFi underscores the growing importance of incorporating real-world assets into decentralized financial solutions to open up more opportunities to bring more stable assets into DeFi, making user investments safer and protocols more accessible. So why is the integration of these two areas becoming more and more important, and are there ways to bring RWA deep into the Defi market?</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1818.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="937" height="581" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1818.png" alt="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols?" class="wp-image-205781" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1818.png 937w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1818-300x186.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1818-768x476.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1818-750x465.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px" title="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols? 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Real World Assets (RWA) became a significant driver of Defi</h2>



<p>DeFi is successful in the crypto space because it benefits all participants. Cryptocurrency holders can earn passive income from their assets through mechanisms like yield farming. At the same time, borrowers can get loans in seconds on favorable terms that no other traditional financial institution can match.</p>



<p>One of the biggest drawbacks of DeFi is the requirement that borrowers over-collateralize their loans to account for price fluctuations. Most DeFi protocols require collateral that is higher than the loan&#8217;s value. This excessive collateral requirement poses a significant risk to the borrower and severely impedes access. Currently, most businesses cannot use DeFi as a source of funding because they are not allowed to use anything but cryptocurrencies as collateral.</p>



<p>Besides, the DeFi Market has grown enormously since the beginning of 2020 and reached the TVL milestone of more than $180 billion by the end of 2021. Since then, along with the market&#8217;s downtrend, the TVL on DeFi protocols has plummeted to less than $50 billion as it is now.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>As a pillar of technological progress and the driving force of the entire blockchain industry today, however, DeFi still needs to work on better tokenomics models with a high token inflation rate.</p>



<p>Some tokens lost more than 90% of their value, and even disappeared from the market, leading to a significant reduction in profits for users. The yield from DeFi is now only equivalent to TradFi (Traditional Finance).</p>



<p>Now there is a new innovation in the field of DeFi that can revolutionize the traditional way of lending/borrowing and drive DeFi adoption globally across all businesses, small and large. RWA refer to physical assets with tangible value, such as real estate, merchandise, vehicles, and collectibles. These assets are increasingly tokenized, meaning their ownership is represented by digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or traded on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Integrating Real World Assets (RWA) into decentralized finance (DeFi) has greatly expanded the range of financial opportunities and services available to users, including lending, borrowing, and trading. By making high-value, physical assets more accessible, liquid, and interoperable, tokenized real-world assets are creating opportunities for both individual investors and companies to participate in the process.</p>



<p>Currently, Real World Assets is contributing a huge part to the value of global finance. Of which, the debt market (with fixed cash flow) is already worth about $127 trillion, the real estate market is worth about $362 trillion, and the gold market capitalization is about $11,5 trillion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with TVL at just $50 billion, the DeFi market is like a tiny person compared to RWA&#8217;s capitalization. If RWA is put on the blockchain, the DeFi market will receive a richer stream of assets with more diverse profit models, thereby driving growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Ways DeFi Leverages RWA to Real Profits</h2>



<p>In recent years, the term Real World Asset (RWA) has emerged more commonly to distinguish cryptocurrencies from traditional financial assets. Compared to cryptocurrencies that only exist in digital form, physical assets (RWAs) are often tangible assets and involve physical institutions.</p>



<p>However, with the development of blockchain technology, real assets have become able to connect to DeFi. The developer uses smart contracts to generate a token that represents an RWA and provides off-chain security to ensure the token is redeemable for the underlying asset.</p>



<p>So when Real World Assets are put on the blockchain, how will they be used in DeFi?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stablecoins</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="207" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-1024x207.png" alt="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols?" class="wp-image-205763" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-1024x207.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-300x61.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-768x155.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-1536x311.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-2048x415.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-750x152.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-1140x231.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols? 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: <a href="https://defillama.com/stablecoins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DefiLlama</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Stablecoins are a perfect example of successful real-world use of assets in DeFi, with three of the top seven crypto tokens by market capitalization being stablecoins ($126 billion in total). USDT and USDC are two stablecoins that are regularly in the top 5 crypto tokens by market capitalization. What both have in common is that real assets like USD and bonds back them.</p>



<p>Currently, USDC is backed by a 1:1 peg against the USD, thanks to an asset reserve of $8.1 billion in cash and $29 billion in U.S. Treasuries. Similarly, more than 80% of USDT&#8217;s reserve assets are in cash and Treasuries, with the remainder in corporate bonds, loans, and other investments.</p>



<p>By this nature, stablecoins are an important asset of DeFi, supporting the transfer of value between the real world and the blockchain, as well as an intermediary asset to shelter from market volatility.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Synthetic tokens</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1814.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="394" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1814.png" alt="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols?" class="wp-image-205766" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1814.png 700w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1814-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols? 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another application of the synthetic token involves connecting physical assets to DeFi. This synthetic token enables on-chain trading of financial futures involving currencies, stocks, and commodities. The leading synthetic token trading platform, Synthetix, locked up to $3 billion worth of assets in its protocol during a massive bull run in 2021.</p>



<p>Synthetic tokens have many interesting uses. For example, holders of real assets such as real estate can securitize cash flows from rental operations, then tokenize that security into a synthetic token for trading on DeFi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lending Protocol</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="656" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-1024x656.png" alt="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols?" class="wp-image-205768" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-1024x656.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-300x192.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-768x492.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-1536x984.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-750x480.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-1140x730.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols? 25"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another interesting application of RWA in DeFi is related to lending protocols. Compared to primitive lending protocols that use crypto borrowing, DeFi platforms focus on RWAs to serve actual businesses that are borrowing money. This pattern offers relatively stable yields and is protected from cryptocurrency volatility.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also no surprise that lending protocols lead the DeFi space. Out of the top 10 DeFi protocols on the market, 4 are just lending deals.</p>



<p>With RWA-based crypto loans, you are providing collateral that may have an objective value lower than the amount you are borrowing. In some cases, you may not even need to put down any collateral. RWA-based loans help businesses survive and expand by allowing them to access capital without having to put up large amounts of collateral.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yield Generator</strong></h3>



<p>The DeFi lending business model provides the most cost-effective way to pool and distribute capital among many lenders and borrowers. It eliminates middlemen and automates money transfers while providing users with relative anonymity.</p>



<p>However, the focus on serving crypto investors creates significant limitations. The capital pool in DeFi needs to be more utilized, especially during bear markets. The world&#8217;s biggest borrowers don&#8217;t have access to these funds either &#8211; real world businesses don&#8217;t have crypto assets as collateral.</p>



<p>Lending protocols address these limitations by building a robust model to help businesses with real-world economic activity access DeFi capital.</p>



<p>Real Yield platforms can use RWAs as real estate (Real Estate) tokenized into NFTs as collateral for loans. Then, Yield Generator will generate profits from this lending and share profits with investors through tokens issued by the platform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain and integrating them into decentralized finance is one of the most significant potential use cases of cryptocurrencies and Web 3 technology.</p>



<p>Some of the prominent applications of RWA in DeFi are stablecoins, synthetic tokens, lending, and yield generators. These are just simple applications, so this field has a lot of potential for future growth.</p>



<p>Currently, the introduction of RWA into the Crypto market is still facing many challenges. One of them is the ability to evaluate and convert RWA value to cryptocurrency accurately. Besides, the stability of RWA value in the Crypto market is also affected by volatility and the possibility of capital loss.</p>



<p>However, the development of Blockchain technology and DeFi applications are helping to solve some of the above problems and provide new solutions for RWA trading in the Crypto market. This is attracting the interest of many investors and financial professionals in the hope of creating a connection between the Crypto market and the traditional asset market, helping to bring greater investment opportunities to investors around the globe.</p>

<p>The community-backed proposal received resounding support, with an impressive approval rate of 99.68%, signaling a decisive mandate for the merger.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/136910-ribbon-finance-offered-government-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ribbon Finance</a>, known for its innovative structured products on the blockchain, set its sights on a new path by launching the proposal to merge with <a href="https://coincu.com/187553-ribbon-finances-new-protocol-aevo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aevo</a> and undergo a comprehensive restructuring of governance and token economics. The merger entails significant changes that are set to elevate Aevo&#8217;s position as the premier venue for on-chain derivatives trading, ushering in a new era for the platform.</p>



<p>One of the key components of the merger involves the phasing out of the original Ribbon Finance token, RBN, and the introduction of a fresh token named AEVO. The migration will see RBN token holders receive a one-to-one exchange ratio for AEVO tokens, paving the way for a seamless transition.</p>



<p>Aevo&#8217;s vision revolves around becoming the ultimate destination for on-chain derivatives trading, comprising exchange-traded options, perpetual contracts, OTC derivatives, and a range of structured products, including passive and active investment options. By integrating Ribbon Finance&#8217;s offerings into Aevo&#8217;s suite of structured products, the platform aspires to evolve into a DeFi super-app, boasting a comprehensive array of perpetuals, options, and yield products under one roof.</p>

<p>The merger will enable users to navigate effortlessly between Aevo&#8217;s exchange, OTC, and structured products, enhancing the overall user experience. Furthermore, this pivotal move brings the deployment of structured products directly onto the Aevo rollup closer to reality, unlocking significant synergies between the exchange and vaults.</p>



<p>The proposal also underlines the importance of a unified brand identity for both Ribbon and Aevo. As part of this endeavor, all components of Ribbon Finance, including the user interface, visual design elements, communication channels, and governance protocols, will be seamlessly integrated under the Aevo brand umbrella. This unified approach is expected to maximize the products&#8217; success and growth while fostering confidence and alignment among long-term token holders.</p>



<p>The plan encompasses two significant changes: first, positioning Aevo as the singular brand encompassing both Ribbon Finance&#8217;s offerings and Aevo&#8217;s structured products on its exchange, and second, initiating the transition from Ribbonomics to AEVO, the novel token that will govern the Aevo protocol and chain on the Ethereum mainnet. Detailed discussions on the new AEVO tokenomics will be presented in a subsequent proposal.</p>



<p>Practically, the merger will involve strategic steps, including migrating Ribbon Finance from its existing domain (app.ribbon.finance) to Aevo&#8217;s strategies platform (strategies.aevo.xyz). Additionally, Aevo&#8217;s visual identity will be implemented across Ribbon&#8217;s structured products, and the Aevo brand will replace Ribbon Finance on all internal and external sites, communication channels, and labels.</p>



<p>With the resounding approval from the community, the merger between Ribbon Finance and Aevo is set to redefine the DeFi landscape. Aevo&#8217;s ambition to be the leading on-chain derivatives platform, along with the integration of Ribbon&#8217;s offerings, holds the promise of opening new horizons for decentralized finance, offering a more seamless and comprehensive trading experience to users worldwide.</p>
