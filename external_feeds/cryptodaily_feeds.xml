			  <description><![CDATA[<p>London, United Kingdom, June 13th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Chancer, one of the most exciting new Web3 projects of 2023 has officially launched its crypto presale today, 13th June. The project aims to disrupt the betting industry by removing the &lsquo;house&rsquo; from the picture and putting the markets firmly back in the hands of the bettors, allowing users to create their own betting markets, set their own odds, and create their own rules.</p><p>Chancer is the world&rsquo;s first decentralized predictive markets app &mdash; something co-founders and brothers Adam and Paul Kelbie believe will dramatically change how people bet, and ultimately, put the fun back into betting.</p><p>Chancer positions itself as a betting facilitator, not a betting house, allowing users to create peer-to-peer (P2P) bets. These can be small, friendly bets amongst a small group of people, or huge, viral bets such as predicting the Champions League final result or who will win Best Director at the Oscars, in which masses of people can participate. Chancer doesn&rsquo;t limit people to sport betting; bets can be made on any prediction or event, a stark contrast from most bookmakers. Its inherent appeal lies in the fact that users are in complete control of their bets and won&rsquo;t lose to a traditional bookmaker who stacks the odds against them.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re confident that we can change the way betting and gambling works,&rdquo; said Adam Kelbie, CEO of Chancer. &ldquo;The next few months are going to be very exciting, and we&rsquo;re thrilled that we can offer a new cryptocurrency in such a competitive market. We&rsquo;re doing something no one else has done, disrupting an industry that has had the odds stacked against consumers since it began. It won&rsquo;t be easy, but we&rsquo;re ready for the fight.&rdquo;</p>How CHANCER works<p>All bets and pay-outs are made in Chancer&rsquo;s native token, &lsquo;CHANCER&rsquo;, which can then be traded with stablecoins like USDT. The online betting and gambling industry is huge, standing at approximately $64 billion (as of 2022), and Chancer aims to take advantage of that and claim a dominant position within the space.</p><p>The CHANCER token will be launched on the BSC Blockchain, and is now available during its presale, which comprises of 12 stages in total.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Bank of China (BOCI) has made history by issuing tokenised securities on the Ethereum blockchain in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This revolutionary development signifies a significant stride forward in the adoption of decentralised finance and highlights Hong Kong's efforts to attract major players in the cryptocurrency industry, including Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
Tokenised Securities: Pioneering a New Era in Finance
<p>The Bank of China's decision to issue tokenized securities on the Ethereum blockchain is a bold testament to the institution's acknowledgment of the tremendous potential of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By harnessing the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum, BOCI aims to amplify the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of traditional securities. Tokenisation paves the way for fractional ownership, heightened liquidity, and streamlined settlement processes, ushering in a revolutionary approach to trading, selling, and purchasing assets.</p>
Hong Kong's Crypto-Friendly Stance
<p>Hong Kong's ambitions to establish itself as a global hub for digital assets and cryptocurrencies have taken a significant leap forward with the Bank of China's introduction of tokenised securities. This milestone aligns seamlessly with the city's concerted efforts to allure leading cryptocurrency exchanges, with Coinbase expressing its interest in expanding its footprint in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong's proactive approach to embracing digital innovation and its regulatory framework, striking a balance between investor protection and industry growth, positions it as a potential destination for companies operating in the crypto space.</p>
Unprecedented Accessibility and Enhanced Liquidity
<p>By tokenising securities on the Ethereum blockchain, the Bank of China paves the way for investors, both institutional and retail, to access traditional financial assets with newfound ease and flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenisation empowers fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy and trade smaller portions of high-value assets, thereby rendering previously illiquid investments more accessible. This democratisation of investment opportunities has the potential to revolutionise financial markets, expanding participation and fostering financial inclusion.</p>
Advancing Blockchain Adoption
<p>The Bank of China's pioneering initiative to issue tokenized securities represents a substantial stride in the adoption of blockchain technology within the conventional financial system. As a prominent financial institution, BOCI's embrace of blockchain validates its transformative potential to reshape the global financial landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This progressive move is poised to inspire other institutions to explore the utility of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, propelling further innovation and nurturing a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uwerx is positioned to be the best freelance platform for all freelancers worldwide. Through the platform&rsquo;s unique features, freelancers will have a community that hears their needs and helps them grow. Uwerx&rsquo;s presale is coming to a quick close. In this article, we discuss why Uwerxwill be your best investment.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): The Hub of Freelancing Solutions
<p>Freelancers all over the globe struggle with a plethora of challenges and obstacles on different freelancing platforms. From high flat fees to the inability to land gigs on these platforms, it has become a battle zone for freelancers seeking more gigs. Uwerx aims to solve these challenges and more.</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to solve several problems that freelancers face in the cryptocurrency industry. This is why the platform offers users a 1% flat fee, a significant reduction compared to the 10% and 20% flat fees offered by freelancing platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr. </p>
<p>Uwerx is growing beyond expectations. Within a few weeks of launching, the Uwerx platform has grown to over 6,000 signups. The social media platforms are not left out, as Uwerx&rsquo;s Twitter now has 1,627 followers, with Telegram boasting 1,456 subscribers. These numbers have only just begun to grow. With Uwerx&rsquo;s current listing on CoinSniper, and its scheduled listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, these numbers are bound to quadruple in the coming months.</p>
<p>Uwerx is here to stay. Uwerx communicates this message to its growing community by announcing a 25-year liquidity lock on its tokens. After 82.8% of Uwerx&rsquo;s users voted for the lock to happen imminently, unlike after the presale as planned, the Uwerx team will make this lock happen before the end of the presale. </p>
<p>Uwerx has already exceeded all standards of the cryptocurrency industry. The platform proves this with its successful audit undergone by InterFi Network and SolidProof, both renowned authorities in the industry. Once Uwerx is launched on centralized exchanges, the Uwerx team will be renouncing contract ownership, thus ensuring transparency with the platform and reducing taxes to zero..</p>
<p>The Uwerx Team is also taking steps to transition the platform from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform. Through the Beta platform, Uwerx users can test the platform for themselves, and they are encouraged to share all forms of feedback with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
The Uwerx (WERX) Presale is Exceeding Expectations!
<p>Due to the unexpectedly high demands for Uwerx, the Uwerx team has had to make essential token modifications to accommodate these demands. 98.2% of Uwerx users voted via a Twitter Poll for the Uwerx team to launch a Test Airdrop for the platform. This will be launched on the 31st of July, 2023. &nbsp;Uwerx itself will be launched on the 4th of August, 2023, opening freelancers and crypto investors up to a whole new world. </p>
<p>The Uwerx team has also unveiled the Uwerx Vault. Through this vault, Uwerx users can store their WERX tokens for different periods and access rewards based on the variables within the platform. </p>
<p>Uwerx&rsquo;s first presale stage was completed in only 17 days, while its second was completed within eight days. Uwerx is in its fifth presale stage, selling at $0.041 per token, with a 15% bonus on every purchase. Uwerx&rsquo;s hard-cap presale end date has been scheduled for the 31st of July, 2023.</p>
<p>Are you ready to step into the future and unlock a 15% bonus on your purchases? Click on any of these links to join the Uwerx Presale:</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uwerx is positioned to be the best freelance platform for all freelancers worldwide. Through the platform&rsquo;s unique features, freelancers will have a community that hears their needs and helps them grow. Uwerx&rsquo;s presale is coming to a quick close. In this article, we discuss why Uwerxwill be your best investment.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): The Hub of Freelancing Solutions
<p>Freelancers all over the globe struggle with a plethora of challenges and obstacles on different freelancing platforms. From high flat fees to the inability to land gigs on these platforms, it has become a battle zone for freelancers seeking more gigs. Uwerx aims to solve these challenges and more.</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to solve several problems that freelancers face in the cryptocurrency industry. This is why the platform offers users a 1% flat fee, a significant reduction compared to the 10% and 20% flat fees offered by freelancing platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr. </p>
<p>Uwerx is growing beyond expectations. Within a few weeks of launching, the Uwerx platform has grown to over 6,000 signups. The social media platforms are not left out, as Uwerx&rsquo;s Twitter now has 1,627 followers, with Telegram boasting 1,456 subscribers. These numbers have only just begun to grow. With Uwerx&rsquo;s current listing on CoinSniper, and its scheduled listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, these numbers are bound to quadruple in the coming months.</p>
<p>Uwerx is here to stay. Uwerx communicates this message to its growing community by announcing a 25-year liquidity lock on its tokens. After 82.8% of Uwerx&rsquo;s users voted for the lock to happen imminently, unlike after the presale as planned, the Uwerx team will make this lock happen before the end of the presale. </p>
<p>Uwerx has already exceeded all standards of the cryptocurrency industry. The platform proves this with its successful audit undergone by InterFi Network and SolidProof, both renowned authorities in the industry. Once Uwerx is launched on centralized exchanges, the Uwerx team will be renouncing contract ownership, thus ensuring transparency with the platform and reducing taxes to zero..</p>
<p>The Uwerx Team is also taking steps to transition the platform from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform. Through the Beta platform, Uwerx users can test the platform for themselves, and they are encouraged to share all forms of feedback with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
The Uwerx (WERX) Presale is Exceeding Expectations!
<p>Due to the unexpectedly high demands for Uwerx, the Uwerx team has had to make essential token modifications to accommodate these demands. 98.2% of Uwerx users voted via a Twitter Poll for the Uwerx team to launch a Test Airdrop for the platform. This will be launched on the 31st of July, 2023. &nbsp;Uwerx itself will be launched on the 4th of August, 2023, opening freelancers and crypto investors up to a whole new world. </p>
<p>The Uwerx team has also unveiled the Uwerx Vault. Through this vault, Uwerx users can store their WERX tokens for different periods and access rewards based on the variables within the platform. </p>
<p>Uwerx&rsquo;s first presale stage was completed in only 17 days, while its second was completed within eight days. Uwerx is in its fifth presale stage, selling at $0.041 per token, with a 15% bonus on every purchase. Uwerx&rsquo;s hard-cap presale end date has been scheduled for the 31st of July, 2023.</p>
<p>Are you ready to step into the future and unlock a 15% bonus on your purchases? Click on any of these links to join the Uwerx Presale:</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>IoTeX has made waves with the official release of W3bstream Devnet, positioning itself as the first-ever provider of comprehensive tools and infrastructure for building transformative Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) dApps.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking launch is set to speed up the DePIN sector&rsquo;s development process, slashing costs by 10x and accelerating go-to-market time for developers from two years to about two months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>W3bstream, IoTeX's flagship technology, empowers developers to quickly and easily build dynamic dApps for mobility networks, energy systems, sensor networks, AI computing frameworks, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the advent of Devnet, developers gain unprecedented access to cutting-edge features, enabling seamless connectivity between billions of smart devices and smart contracts, unlocking a world of limitless innovation and societal impact.</p>

<p>"At IoTeX, we are trailblazers in offering developers out-of-the-box services to create DePIN dApps that reward users for their actions or incentivize specific behaviors," explains Raullen Chai, CEO and Founder of IoTeX.</p>
<p>"The release of W3bstream Devnet marks a turning point for the DePIN sector, projected to become the most significant trend in the Web3 industry, akin to the rise of DeFi in recent years," he added.</p>

<p>DePIN has emerged as a driving force propelling the next wave of Web3 adoption. By addressing the limitations of centralized smart device connectivity and applications, such as security, reliability, privacy, and data ownership, the DePIN market will grow to a staggering $3 trillion by 2028.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IoTeX's W3bstream aims to reshape the smart device landscape, ushering in a new era of enhanced user experiences and improved quality of life.</p>
The Power of W3bstream Devnet
<p>Devnet is the first public implementation of W3bstream's chain and device-agnostic architecture and represents a significant milestone in IoTeX's quest to simplify DePIN network development and data-driven dApp creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devnet provides developers with a chain-agnostic environment, facilitating the seamless crowdsourcing of real-world data from smart devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These verifiable "proofs of real-world activity" trigger smart contracts, enabling the direct delivery of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), and NFTs to users.</p>
<p>Central to Devnet is the powerful W3bstream Studio, an intuitive control center equipped with an array of developer-centric features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Studio's streamlined interface, developers can effortlessly orchestrate every aspect of their DePIN projects, from data reception to application logic and seamless blockchain interaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devnet also offers essential components such as mobile Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Web Assembly (WASM), providing developers unparalleled flexibility and convenience in creating their decentralized applications.</p>
<p>IoTeX is committed to continuously expanding W3bstream's capabilities, with future Devnet releases set to introduce a range of out-of-the-box DePIN solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These include trusted token metrics for visualizing and analyzing device data on the blockchain, token proofs to validate off-chain data and facilitate token incentives, trusted location services for proof of humanity and presence, and various geo-based use cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
IoTeX's Devnet Launch Partners
<p>Numerous pioneering DePIN projects are already poised to harness W3bstream's potential. Drife, a disruptive force in the global ridesharing market, is notable among these, which has already amassed over 30,000 drivers, 100,000 registered users, and completed 250,000 rides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By utilizing W3bstream, Drife integrates verifiable mobile geo-location into its tech stack, ensuring secure tracking of routes driven and providing a trusted environment for drivers and riders alike.</p>
<p>React Network, another prominent partner, consists of thousands of connected batteries deployed across homes, businesses, and multi-family living spaces. This innovative energy network supports the power grid during times of high demand and utilizes W3bstream to effectively manage and visualize the diverse footprint of smart devices contributing to its network. The platform efficiently processes the high volume of real-time data generated by these devices, enabling a more optimized and sustainable energy grid system.</p>
<p>These partnerships exemplify the real-world applications of W3bstream and highlight the transformative potential of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks. By leveraging the power of blockchain and smart contracts, IoTeX and its partners are revolutionizing industries and empowering users with greater control over their data and participation in the machine economy.</p>
<p>As the world's first provider of DePIN infrastructure and tools, IoTeX is leading the way in unlocking the full potential of decentralized IoT. With the launch of W3bstream's Devnet, developers now have access to a comprehensive framework that simplifies the development process, reduces costs, and accelerates time-to-market for data-driven dApps. The possibilities for innovation and social impact are boundless as W3bstream connects billions of intelligent devices to smart contracts, creating a more inclusive and decentralized future.</p>
Sparking a new wave of adoption
<p>With Devnet, IoTeX is spearheading the DePIN revolution and paving the way for the next wave of Web3 adoption. By addressing the limitations of centralized IoT solutions and providing developers with the necessary tools and infrastructure, IoTeX is driving the transition toward a more secure, reliable, and privacy-preserving ecosystem.</p>
<p>The launch of W3bstream's Devnet marks a significant milestone in developing Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks. IoTeX's commitment to democratizing IoT and empowering developers is revolutionizing the machine economy and opening up endless possibilities for innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its unique features, chain-agnostic environment, and strong partnerships, W3bstream will shape the future of IoT and drive the widespread adoption of Web3 technologies.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market in 2023 shows strong signs of recovery after the uncertainty and volatility of 2022.</p>
What are NFTs?
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets on a blockchain representing anything from artwork to music to in-game items.</p>
<p>The NFT market landscape has been transformed by the emergence of new projects, platforms, and technologies and changing trends in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
How to Mint NFTs
<p>To mint an NFT, you must create a digital asset and then "mint" it or turn it into an NFT.</p>
Here are the steps on how to mint an NFT:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Choose a blockchain. Many blockchains support NFTs, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Flow. Each blockchain has its advantages and disadvantages, so you must choose one that is right for you.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Create a digital asset. This can be anything from artwork to a song to a video. The digital asset must be unique and cannot be easily copied. For example, you can create unique DUCKIES NFTs in an educational NFT minting &amp; melding game to turn common NFTs into legendary and mythic ones.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Choose an NFT marketplace. There are many different NFT marketplaces where you can mint and sell your NFTs. Some popular marketplaces include OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Connect your wallet. To mint and sell NFTs, you must connect a crypto wallet to the NFT marketplace. Some popular crypto wallets include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Mint your NFT. Once you have connected your wallet to the NFT marketplace, you can mint your NFT. The minting process will vary depending on the marketplace but typically involves paying a gas fee.</li>
</ul>
Where to Sell NFTs
<p>Once you have minted your NFT, you can sell it on an NFT marketplace. There are many different NFT marketplaces, so you must choose one that is right for you. Some factors to consider include the marketplace's fees, the number of users, and the type of NFTs typically sold.</p>
Here are some of the most popular NFT marketplaces:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">OpenSea: OpenSea is the largest NFT marketplace, with over 2 million users. It supports various NFTs, including artwork, music, and in-game items. You can host entire NFT collections. Here&rsquo;s an example of DUCKIES NFTs hosted for sale at OpenSea.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Rarible: Rarible is a popular NFT marketplace that allows users to create and sell their NFTs. It also supports a wide variety of NFTs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">SuperRare: SuperRare is a high-end NFT marketplace that focuses on high-quality artwork. It has a smaller user base than OpenSea or Rarible but also has higher prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips for Selling NFTs</p>
Here are some tips for selling NFTs:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Set a fair price. When setting a price for your NFT, it is important to consider the value of similar NFTs sold. You do not want to price your NFT too high, or it will not sell. For example, the Mythic DUCKIES are sold for over $1,000 at OpenSea.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Promote your NFT. Once you have listed your NFT for sale, you must promote it to attract buyers. You can do this by sharing it on social media, listing it on other NFT marketplaces, or joining NFT communities.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Be patient. It may take some time to sell your NFT. Do not get discouraged if it does not sell immediately. Just keep promoting it, and eventually, you will find a buyer.</li>
</ul>
Conclusion
<p>Minting and selling NFTs can be a great way to showcase your creativity and make money out of it. However, it is important to research and understand the risks involved before you start.</p>

<p>The crypto investment arm of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a16z, announced it would be opening its first overseas office in London. The firm celebrated the UK&rsquo;s welcoming embrace of the crypto industry as the motivating factor behind its decision.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the UK has established a warm climate for crypto companies as the industry battles regulatory confusion from the US.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Big news to share: @a16z is expanding to the UK 🇬🇧We plan to open our first international office in London later this year, and will host the next Crypto Startup School there in 2024.Why the UK? 👇https://t.co/PQ7GuNEn77</p>
&mdash; cdixon.eth (@cdixon) June 11, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports the new office will open later this year and will be led by Sriram Krishnan, one of the firm&rsquo;s general partners. &nbsp;</p>
<p>a16z said in a statement:</p>

<p>While there is still work to be done, we believe that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation. The UK also has deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and a strong entrepreneurial culture.</p>
<p>It is home to more &ldquo;unicorns&rdquo; than Germany, France, and Sweden combined; to some of the world&rsquo;s largest financial markets and pools of capital; and to highly-sophisticated, world-class regulators. All of these make the UK strongly positioned to lead in web3.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Sunak welcomed the firm&rsquo;s decision and underscored the UK&rsquo;s commitment to establishing the country as the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s Web3 centre.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Great news that @a16z &ndash; one of the world&rsquo;s leading tech investment firms, is opening a new base here in London.Another huge vote of confidence in the UK as a place to build and grow tech businesses of the future. https://t.co/Ey1ykALkSU pic.twitter.com/caP6nNXfow</p>
&mdash; Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 12, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we cement the UK&rsquo;s place as a science and tech superpower, we must embrace new innovations like Web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the economy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Crypto Firms Are Being Driven Offshore
<p>The US SEC recently launched severe regulatory action against two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. On June 5, the agency filed suit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for alleged securities violations. The following day, the agency filed a similar case against Coinbase. It charged the exchange with &ldquo;the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The US&rsquo;s aggressive approach led the market to spiral, with major altcoins seeing double-digit losses.</p>
UK&rsquo;s Regulatory Approach
<p>Recognising the need for regulatory guidance, crypto firms such as Coinbase have long asked the US to provide clarity regarding crypto assets. The US has, however, been reluctant to comply, which only creates further tension in the industry.</p>
<p>Crypto firms have, therefore, been testing the waters in other countries where guidance has been offered.</p>
<p>When Prime Minister Sunak was still Chancellor of the Exchequer, he made it clear that he would guide the UK into becoming a safe space for digital assets where innovation and industry development are encouraged. While the UK has been lagging in regulatory guidance compared to the European Union, it has recently published several planned regulations.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury Committee released a report in May advising the government to regulate retail crypto trading not as financial assets but as gambling instruments. The Committee said that unbacked mainstream crypto assets and their inherent volatility pose a risk to investors and threaten economic stability.</p>
<p>Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) released a set of crypto marketing rules that take effect on October 8.</p>
<p>Under its stricter marketing guidelines, the agency banned incentive bonuses, free NFTs and airdrops for promotional purposes and introduced a &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period for first-time crypto buyers.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The regulatory action against the two biggest crypto exchanges has made it clear: the SEC, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, wants to end the crypto industry. The agency&rsquo;s scare tactics may succeed in the US, but it struggles with the overall market. </p>
<p>The US SEC made its position against crypto known this week when it launched severe regulatory action against Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange, and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange by trade volume in the US. Leading the agency in its crusade is Gary Gensler, a man who has made his views of the industry no secret.</p>
<p>Following the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuits against the exchanges, the market was expected to react severely, and the prices would plunge. However, Bitcoin and the broader market held steady throughout the week.</p>
<p>However, Gensler&rsquo;s SEC made allegations in its suit against Binance, which labelled several popular cryptocurrencies unregistered securities.

<p>The agency&rsquo;s naming of these tokens as securities did, however, cause panic in the market and spurred trading platform Robinhood to delist MATIC, SOL, and ADA from its platform come June 27.</p>
Alt-Market Reacts to Robinhood Delisting
<p>Although the market did not react as much as expected during the week, it did see a dramatic plunge on Saturday.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly fuelled by Robinhood&rsquo;s delisting announcement, the crypto alt market saw significant declines. ADA was trading down by as much as 25%, while SOL and MATIC also saw double-digit losses. Amid the dire market conditions, Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com announced it would suspend its institutional exchange service for US customers.</p>
<p>Compared to the broader market, Bitcoin was only trading down only 5% to its lowest level since March and was trading hands at around $25,000.</p>

The Crypto Industry Will Prevail
<p>The SEC and all its might may continue to slap the industry with a barrage of claims, but it seems unlikely that it will manage to bring the industry down. The agency is certainly doing substantial damage to the US crypto industry, but the crypto market at large will not be taken down.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The regulatory action against the two biggest crypto exchanges has made it clear: the SEC, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, wants to end the crypto industry. The agency&rsquo;s scare tactics may succeed in the US, but it struggles with the overall market. </p>
<p>The US SEC made its position against crypto known this week when it launched severe regulatory action against Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange, and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange by trade volume in the US. Leading the agency in its crusade is Gary Gensler, a man who has made his views of the industry no secret.</p>
<p>Following the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuits against the exchanges, the market was expected to react severely, and the prices would plunge. However, Bitcoin and the broader market held steady throughout the week.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto.com announced that it would shut down its institutional exchange services customers in the United States in less than two weeks. </p>
<p>On Friday, Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com announced that it would suspend its institutional exchange service for US customers. In a statement provided to media publication Blockworks, the exchange explained that demand is drying up due to the current market conditions in the US.</p>
<p>Although it did not specifically reference the lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, it was undoubtedly the overriding factor in the exchange&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>In a statement, Crypto.com said:</p>

<p>We recently made a business decision to suspend the institutional offering of the Crypto.com Exchange in the U.S. as of 11:59 pm EDT June 21, 2023, due to &ldquo;limited demand&rdquo; from institutions in the U.S. in the &ldquo;current market landscape.&rdquo; Impacted institutional users were given advance notice to support a smooth transition.</p>

<p>The exchange explained that the closure of the US services would not affect its retail trading app, including its crypto derivative product, UpDown Options, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The company further said it could reopen the platform in the future but did not provide more details.</p>
Crypto.com Receives Major Payment Institution Licence in Singapore
<p>The exchange started the month out well after receiving a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license for Digital Payment Token (DPT) services from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p>Securing this license means the exchange can offer DPT services to Singaporean customers.</p>
Crypto.com Arena Not Affected
<p>After the exchange announced shuttering its institutional services for US customers, speculation arose that it might affect the naming rights for Crypto.com Arena. The exchange entered into a naming rights agreement with AEG, the owner and operator of the arena formerly known as the Staples Center, in 2021, Forbes reports.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Twitter and Dogecoin (DOGE), is complicit in the rise to fame of the first meme coin cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Despite the crypto markets being hit by a renewed wave of meme coin speculation in recent weeks, more investors are dumping their Dogecoin (DOGE) bags to participate in other tokens like Uwerx, which have better use cases.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out why investors are taking this ruthless path to participate in the promising presale of Uwerx and recover their lost meme coin-laden portfolio.</p>
Dogecoin (Dogecoin): A Crypto Once Loved By All
<p>Initially developed as a joke by two software engineers, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the first ever meme coin created in 2013. </p>
<p>Elon Musk, nicknamed the Doge Father, has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin (DOGE) and continues to tweet about the meme coin until many investors caught onto the revelation, sending the token&rsquo;s price jumping on many occasions.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency is currently the ninth largest cryptocurrency in the world, having a market capitalization of over $10 billion but has fallen off the good graces of the entire crypto community. Currently having a trading volume of $169.945, 370, and trading at $0.0734, less than 90% of his all-time high price of $0.7316. </p>
<p>In the recent wake of meme coin trading, even degen traders have shifted their attention off</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) to focus more on new meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu(FLOKI), which are currently making all the waves in the meme coin world. Because of this, experts predict the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) to reach a bare minimum of $0.095 in the last quarter of 2023.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): A Token Set To Ride The Wave And Establish Itself As The New Market Leader
<p>Uwerx has been in every investor&rsquo;s mouth for completing their stage 1 and stage 2 presale in a record time of 17 days and 8 days, respectively.</p>
<p>Uwerx platform is treading the least but most rewarding path of utility by offering freelancers a chance to enjoy the web3 community-first ambiance. With 5,000 registered users on the platform, they plan to expand and transform the trillion-dollar freelance economy with their hard-to-beat offerings to freelancers and clients. </p>
<p>They are doing this by offering a wide range of benefits, like flagging a service fee of 1%, which is small compared to the 15% charged by popular freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. Uwerkwill also provide more security and decentralization to the freelancers by allowing them to transact without needing a third party.</p>
<p>Not only is Uwerx focused on creating the best freelance platform there is, but they also plan on rewarding early adopters with a test airdrop of the WERX token after the end of its presale rounds on the 31st of July. After three successful presales, the WERX token sells for $0.041 per token in its stage 5 presale.</p>
<p>Uwerx contract has been certified by top auditing firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network, and its WERX token is currently listed on CoinSniper with pending listings on other platforms like Uniswap, CoinGecko, and CoinMarketCap.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Is Set To Break Into the Bull Market In Style
<p>Liquidity locking for a set period, renouncing contract ownership, reducing taxes to zero, and incentivizing holders are all markers for cryptos that plan on staying for the long term. These qualities will inevitably benefit Uwerx from the hyper-liquidity that will be deployed during the bull market.</p>
<p>Strategic positioning is one of the ways to make the most out of any crypto, starting at the presale phase. You can check out the Uwerx project and join in on the presale before the price goes parabolic with these links:</p>
