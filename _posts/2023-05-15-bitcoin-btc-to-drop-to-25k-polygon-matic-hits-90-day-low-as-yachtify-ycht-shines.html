<p class="s8">Bitcoin (BTC) Will Drop to $25K?</p>
<p class="s5">Cryptocurrency trader and analyst, Altcoin Sherpa, recently took to Twitter to predict a drop in Bitcoin's (BTC) price to $25K in the near future. Citing the $25K level as a confluent level for Bitcoin (BTC) price, the analyst's tweet comes amidst a 2.67% drop in Bitcoin (BTC) value in the last 24 hours. </p>
<p class="s5">Currently trading at $27,520.99, Bitcoin (BTC) price faces the possibility of a further downturn as Bitcoin (BTC) heads toward the key support level at $26,800. As bearish signals emerge from technical indicators, the market leader could soon reach the predicted $25K price point, potentially providing traders an opportunity to capitalize on Bitcoin (BTC) decline.</p>
<p class="s8">Polygon (MATIC) Hits 90-Day Low</p>
<p class="s5">Polygon (MATIC) price recently plunged to a 90-day low of $0.886 amid bearish market dominance. With a 3.69% drop to $0.8945 at press time, the increased volatility has attracted short-term traders to the Polygon (MATIC) market. </p>
<p class="s5">The market capitalization of Polygon (MATIC) decreased by 3.77% to $8,254,089,404, while the 24-hour trading volume rose by 15.65% to $436,899,775. The Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA) indicator reveals a bearish momentum and the Aroon down reading of 71.43% indicates a stronger selling pressure. However, the Keltner Channel bands suggest that the Polygon (MATIC) market is oversold, which may lead to an upward reversal soon.</p>
