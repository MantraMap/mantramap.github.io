<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chronos, a decentralized exchange (DEX), reached a new milestone on May 5, achieving $235.9 million in total value locked (TVL) at the time of writing, just seven days after launching on the Arbitrum blockchain.

<p>Chronos, an Arbitrum-based DEX, which started on April 27, is a (3,3) exchange that uses staking as a main resource for accumulating value to its token in order to reach store-of-value status. The (3,3) paradigm was popularized by the Ethereum-based Olympus DAO, one of the most visible initiatives during the last crypto market run.</p>

<p>Chronos now ranks tenth among the major decentralized exchanges, according to DefiLlama, based on the updated TVL data. TVL symbolizes monies owned or staked inside a protocol in DeFi.</p>



<p>The TVL milestone was reached in the early morning hours after the protocol initiated Epoch 1, which authorized CHR token emissions to liquidity pools. With the start of Epoch 1, stakers could also start collecting rewards.</p>



<p>Some Chronos liquidity pools pay up to 2,300% to liquidity providers (LP) in the form of CHR tokens, which can be used to vote on protocol changes. LPs are entities that contribute two separate tokens to the smart contracts of a decentralized exchange in return for a portion of the fees imposed by the exchange on each deal.</p>



<p>Holders of these tokens may resell them to earn more fees, keep voting power, and create a liquid marketplace for other companies looking to borrow money from Chronos. High returns are uncommon in the cryptocurrency industry, which might explain the unexpected influx of funds to Chronos.</p>

<p>Before that, after peer-to-peer testing of their native stablecoin crvUSD implementation, it was found that the current crvUSD version needs to be redeployed and that the performance will be done today. Additionally, veCRV was not billed due to an error in the deployment script.</p>

<p>The implementation marks a significant milestone in the public launch of Curve&#8217;s long-awaited stablecoin. Curve, one of the largest decentralized marketplaces focused on stablecoins, with around $5 billion in assets on the protocol, announced last year that it began developing its dollar-pegged stablecoins.</p>



<p>According to the white paper, what sets crvUSD apart from its competitors is a new loan liquidity algorithm called LLAMA, that continuously rebalances users&#8217; collateral as cryptocurrency prices fluctuate.</p>



<p>This mechanism provides a smoother, continuous liquidation process than a single, drastic event that sometimes causes chaos and massive losses to lending protocols when crypto prices fall.</p>



<p>Additionally, collateral stored in an automated market maker (AMM) pool provides liquidity for people to trade, rather than sitting in a vault or lending pool. &#8220;This makes the overall efficiency of the system high,&#8221; Dustin Teander, an analyst at crypto research firm Messari, said in a note.</p>



<p>In addition, Curve&#8217;s stablecoin will face stiff competition due to a series of problems with rival DeFi protocols that are or are in the process of developing their stablecoin to attract users and increase activity at a time when cryptocurrency trading and lending are struggling.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe&#8217;s central bank plans to sell a gold-backed digital currency to investors starting May 8th. The minimum token price will be $10 for individuals and $5,000 for corporations and other entities. The tokens will be sold in US dollars and local currency, with the latter being sold at a 20% margin above the willing-buyer willing-seller interbank mid-rate. </p>



<p>This move is the latest attempt by the southern African nation to support its local currency, which has weakened by 37% against the US dollar on the official market this year. The monetary policy committee approved this move in March, eight months after Zimbabwe introduced gold coins as a store of value to help support the local unit. In contrast, Nigeria became the first country in Africa to introduce a digital currency in 2021.</p>



<p>The announcement indicates Zimbabwe&#8217;s willingness to adopt technology to support its economy. Introducing a gold-backed digital currency could help the country attract foreign investors and stabilize the local currency. With the weakening of the Zimbabwean dollar against the US dollar this year, the government needs to take proactive steps to support its economy. While this move may not immediately solve the economic challenges the country is facing, it is a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>Digital currencies are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, with many countries exploring the possibility of issuing their digital currencies. Introducing digital currencies provides a unique opportunity to streamline financial transactions, reduce costs, and increase financial inclusion. It will be interesting to see how Zimbabwe&#8217;s gold-backed digital currency performs in the market and whether it will succeed.</p>

<p>According to yesterday&#8217;s news, Xu Mingxing said that it <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185196-okx-sui-token-problem-compensates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would compensate</a> all customers who cannot cancel orders and buy SUI for more than 1.3 USDT; OKX also gave the reason for the SUI-related trading accidents, after which OKX said the cancellation problem SUI had been fully restored, and withdrawals have been opened.</p>

<p>It is known that after the SUI call auction listing on May 3, 2023, UTC, some users could not cancel orders. OKX acted quickly, identifying and fixing the issue. However, some users&#8217; trading activities were still affected.</p>



<p>The issue resulted in some users being unable to cancel their orders. In addition, due to delayed order status updates and fund payments, some SUI orders are shown live even when executed, causing some users to miss further trading opportunities.</p>



<p>The issue has been fixed, and all user orders have been restored. At the same time, the development team will conduct a thorough autopsy to prevent similar problems from happening again.</p>



<p>The scope of user compensation is to entrust the order during the call auction period, the order cannot be canceled, and the last order has been completed successfully.</p>



<p>Specifically, some users were unable to cancel orders after the trades were made, they were unable to sell their purchased SUI before the cancellation problem was fixed, and they missed trading opportunities. OKX decided to compensate these users based on the difference between the user&#8217;s purchase price and 1.3.</p>



<p>For users with a transaction price above 1.3 USDT, the amount of compensation = the final number of transactions of the user&#8217;s collective bidding trust order × (average purchase price of the order – 1.3 ) USDT.</p>

<p>For eligible users, the exchange will deposit the difference directly into the user&#8217;s account within three business days.</p>



<p>Some users&#8217; sell orders appear to be executed at a price lower than the order price they placed during the auction period. This is caused by a system error affecting the UI screen while the user was modifying the order price, preventing the system from updating the order price data on time. This display issue should not cause any actual loss to the user.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance denied the Reuters article with the implication that the exchange allowed crypto-based terrorist financing accounts to operate.</em></li>



<li><em>To answer this question the exchange affirms that its policies and procedures meet the requirements of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.</em></li>



<li><em>Earlier, Reuters shared an article about documents showing that Israel seized Binance crypto accounts to stop ISIS.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/our-response-to-reuters-1363137884256691497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response</a> to a Reuters report today questioning Binance&#8217;s compliance policies in preventing and dealing with terrorist financing, the exchange has released an official comment. Binance alleged that a reporter from Reuters intentionally omitted important events to comply with their policy.</strong></h5>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Our policies and processes comply with AMLD5/6 anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing requirements and we have a robust compliance program that integrated sophisticated anti-money laundering and global sanctions principles and tools to detect and address suspicious activity. on our team who have focused their entire careers on counter-terrorism.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Binance says an often overlooked fact is that once a transaction is verified on the blockchain, a crypto exchange cannot block or reverse a digital asset deposit. The real measure of a crypto exchange&#8217;s compliance is that it recognizes suspicious deposits and the steps it takes to deal with them.</p>



<p>When the exchange detects bad behavior, it intervenes and takes appropriate action, including freezing funds and cooperating with law enforcement to assist with investigations. Regarding Organizations specifically, just to clarify, the bad guys don&#8217;t sign up for accounts in the name of their criminal enterprise.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;With regard to the specific organizations mentioned in the article, it&#8217;s important to clarify that bad actors don&#8217;t register accounts under the names of their criminal enterprises. This is why our team collaborates with law enforcement, and leverages information that is only available to them in order to identify individuals operating accounts for illegal organizations.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange has over 750 compliance support staff, many with prior experience in law enforcement and regulators. So far this year, the exchange has helped law enforcement freeze/seize over $1 billion. Nearly half of our compliance team is involved in sanctions control work such as anti-money laundering, name screening, Know Your Customer (KYC) referrals, and on-chain monitoring.</p>

It is known that the company is affiliated with the Islamic group Hamas.</p>



<p>On January 12, the NBCTF seized two Binance accounts and their contents, according to a document on the website of Israel&#8217;s National Agency for Combating the Financing of Terrorism (NBCTF). NBCTF said on its website that the arrest was intended to &#8220;prevent&#8221; ISIS&#8217; &#8220;activities&#8221; and &#8220;reduce their ability to achieve their goals&#8221;. The NBCTF document, which has never been previously reported, does not provide any details about the value of the seized cryptocurrencies or how the accounts are linked to the Islamic State.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>This week, average transaction fees on the Ethereum network reached levels not seen since May 2022.</em></li>



<li><em>The rise in transactions is said to be the result of the recent hype of memecoins.</em></li>



<li><em>The Shapella upgrade is also one of the factors that increase the number of transactions on the blockchain.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following the increased on-chain activity, the median average transaction fee on Ethereum has risen to its highest level since May 2022.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a Dune analytics dashboard from Hildobby, a pseudonymous data analyst at VC company Dragonfly, Ethereum network fees increased to roughly 87 gwei on May 2. Due to high trade fees, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains reached all-time highs last week.</p>

<p>BNB Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche are EVM-compatible blockchains. Transaction costs on these networks are often cheaper than those on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183471-ethereums-shanghai-unstaked-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>.</p>



<p>The latest surge of memecoins that have continued to rebel may be part of the explanation for the high transaction fee.</p>



<p>Memecoins are a new kind of digital asset that has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. These tokens are inspired by famous memes and have swiftly garnered popularity within the crypto community because to their distinct branding and marketing techniques.</p>



<p>Memecoins have lately seen a rebirth. In the last week, a boom in memecoins such as PEPE sparked speculative interest in cryptocurrencies before cooling down. Pepe&#8217;s price has risen about 38,900% since its April 14 introduction, thanks to a social media craze. Last month, the token price increased 266 times in four days.</p>



<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently revealed in a Twitter Spaces engagement that he has never understood memecoins and that listing choices are made by a different team.</p>



<p>This week, the memecoin&#8217;s market cap soared to over $500 million before plummeting back below $400 million. Many of these tokens lack liquidity or market depth, which means that traders&#8217; ability to buy and sell close to market price is limited, making coins vulnerable to sharp price swings.</p>



<p>The much-anticipated Ethereum&#8217;s Shanghai blockchain upgrade, also known as &#8220;Shapella&#8221; by diehards, is also one of the reasons for the recent spike in transactions on this blockchain.</p>

<p>According to Securitize, the new tokenized fund, which will flow into Hamilton Lane&#8217;s Senior Credit Opportunities Fund, intends to widen access to senior private credit, which has historically been a reliable approach in uncertain markets.</p>



<p>Through the Securitize feeder fund, the firm is making a portion of the Senior Credit Opportunities (SCOPE) Fund, which was launched in October, available. The feeder is the second of three tokenized funds introduced by Hamilton Lane last year. In January, the Hamilton Lane Equity Opportunities Securitize Fund V received tokenized access.</p>



<p>SCOPE&#8217;s floating-rate, senior secured loans are aimed at yield-seeking investors. The fund makes investments in privately owned corporate assets in recession-resistant industries such as health care and information technology.</p>



<p>Investors in the feeder fund may redeem their shares at the previous quarter&#8217;s net asset value (NAV) per share without incurring any transaction fees from Securitize.</p>



<p>Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Many recent technology and blockchain innovations are solutions in search of problems. Securitize is solving a major problem faced by investors, particularly in private markets: finding liquidity when they need it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He noted that smart contracts based on blockchain networks might speed up manual operations such as share redemption, remove middlemen, and cut superfluous costs.</p>



<p>Tokenization is an emerging area that promises to increase access to conventional financial products by making private market investment accessible to individuals who are neither institutional nor ultra-high net worth. In this situation, the minimum investment is reduced from $2 million to $10,000.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase&#8217;s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, reported that the Third Circuit has reacted to the SEC&#8217;s complaint about the need for clear standards for trading digital crypto assets.</em></li>



<li><em>The court has given the SEC 10 days to reply to Coinbase&#8217;s petition of mandamus.</em></li>



<li><em>The court allowed Coinbase the ability to respond to the SEC&#8217;s answer within seven days of its filing.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, said on Thursday that the Third Circuit has finally responded to the case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for failing to offer clear regulations.</strong></h5>

<p>Grewal <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1653898889311948800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in a tweet on May 3 that a Third Circuit judge issued a text-only order directing the financial regulator to prepare a response to the exchange&#8217;s mandamus lawsuit. The SEC has been given 10 days to respond to Coinbase&#8217;s legal action.</p>



<p>However, the Petitioner, Coinbase, has 7 days from the date of filing to file a response to the commission&#8217;s response. Paul Grewal expressed appreciation for the court&#8217;s thorough examination of this subject.</p>



<p>Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, sued the SEC in April, seeking a court order compelling the agency to publicly reveal its position on a petition made some months earlier. The petition demanded openness in the formulation of regulations regulating the trading and offering of securities through digital channels.</p>

<p>Coinbase has lately come under heightened regulatory scrutiny. In March, the SEC issued a <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184504-coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Well Notice</a> about certain of the exchange&#8217;s goods. A Wells Notice letter often informs a corporation that the SEC may take enforcement action against it. It stated, however, that it did not list securities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the exchange has recently launched an International exchange for institutional traders outside of the US. Analysts speculate that the move was motivated by increasing regulatory pressure on its operations in the country.</p>



<p>Previously, Coinbase and Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officers met offsite. This enigmatic meeting took place while both parties faced legal challenges from the SEC.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitget has announced the start of Blockchain4Youth, a corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative.</em></li>



<li><em>The project&#8217;s goal is to inspire and empower younger generations to utilize Web3 and crypto technologies to develop and participate in a decentralized area.</em></li>



<li><em>The CSR initiative will begin in May with a series of talks on the campuses of premier institutions in Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, and other locations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitget announced a $10 million investment over five years for an innovative corporate social responsibility initiative.</strong></h5>

<p>The initiative, dubbed Blockchain4Youth, will provide blockchain courses and certificates via Bitget Academy, as well as campus talks in collaboration with institutions throughout the globe.</p>



<p>Blockchain4Youth&#8217;s goals are consistent with the exchange&#8217;s main purpose of encouraging more people to adopt cryptocurrency. Bitget thinks that a blockchain-based future is necessary for developing better goods and solutions to assist people in advancing crypto acceptance.</p>



<p>The platform will depend on the youth to promote such ideas and will assist them in becoming proactive leaders. According to a recent survey, Millennials and Gen Z representatives are the driving force behind the construction of a crypto-friendly future, with the former accounting for 46% of crypto fans.</p>



<p>Bitget&#8217;s Managing Director, Gracy Chen, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitget-launches-blockchain4youth-project-plans-to-invest-10-million-to-support-young-talents-301815814.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Bitget aims to uplift the youth of today with valuable knowledge regarding Blockchain and Web3 information, ensuring a future where the world is blockchain-connected. Bitget&#8217;s study shows that the constantly changing demographics will have a significant impact on the adoption of cryptocurrency, and teenagers struggle to systematically understand this ever-evolving world. In light of this, Bitget aims to leverage its global reach and initiate meaningful projects to empower the younger generation.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Blockchain4Youth will be out this month with a series of Web3 campus talks at colleges in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand. Courses from Bitget Academy will also be available around the same time. According to the exchange, it is open to collaborations with educators for its new program. The exchange now has over 8 million users in over 100 countries.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Bitget intends to launch scholarships in the coming months to provide financial assistance to young people who are interested in blockchain.</p>



<p>Binance Charity, in a similar endeavor, has vowed to grant more than 30,000 scholarships by 2023. Over 82,000 applicants were interested in joining the next cohort at the time, equating to a 37% acceptance rate.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Aave community is holding a preliminary vote on how to distribute the 300,000 OPs received by Aave Grants DAO.</em></li>



<li><em>It made a proposal last year and received 300,000 OP tokens as part of Phase 0 of the incentive fund OP Stimpack, according to the proposal.</em></li>



<li><em>100,000 OP will be granted and allocated to Optimism-focused events and bounties for the current AGD quarter, with the remaining 200,000 OP held in the AGD multisig wallet for future AGD quarter awards or distributions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On May 4, the Aave community is <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe9ff93315d1ce1ee0fe746a3074b866566de096cf912d45350f35e4fe019f502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conducting</a> a temperature check vote on the proposal of &#8220;Allocation of 300k OP Received by Aave Grants DAO (AGD).&#8221;</strong></h5>

<p>According to the proposal, the Aave community created a proposal last year and managed to receive 300,000 OP tokens as part of Phase 0 of the incentive fund OP Stimpack. These tokens will be used to fund projects to help Aave grow on Optimism. This proposal aims to clarify how received OPs should be distributed and gain community support.</p>



<p>With funds from Aave DAO, AGD has funded a number of projects based on Optimism.</p>



<ul>
<li>DappLooker, Block Analitica, and Projection Finance</li>



<li>Mean Finance, Layer3, and DeFunds integrations</li>



<li>Pegasus Financial, Lyra Finance, and Cetra Finance are examples of native apps.</li>
</ul>



<p>The purpose of this proposal is to explain and get community approval for how the OP received should be divided.</p>



<p>The proposal proposes to allocate up to 100,000 OP for grants and Optimism-focused events and bounties for the current AGD quarter and to keep the remaining 200,000 OP in the AGD multisig wallet for future AGD quarters grant or distribution.</p>



<p>It offers a split of funds similar to what was indicated in the initial post on the Optimism forum for the 100,000 OP to distribute under the current AGD engagement: two-thirds to grants and one-third to events.</p>



<p>If the proposal is approved by this vote, AGD will allocate funds in the above-mentioned manner. No AIP or further governance action is required.</p>



<p>Previously, the community voted to abandon Aave V2 as part of the process of pooling liquid assets onto a single protocol.</p>
