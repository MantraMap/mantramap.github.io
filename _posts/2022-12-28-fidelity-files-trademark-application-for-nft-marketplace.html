Fidelity Cautioned Against Offering Bitcoin to Customers
<p>Fidelity was recently issued with a letter from three U.S. senators urging them to drop its 401(k) Bitcoin plan. The senators cite the fall of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX as the reason for the asset management firm to revise its Bitcoin offering to retirement savers. The letter stated:</p>

<p>Once again, we strongly urge Fidelity Investments to reconsider its decision to allow 401(k) plan sponsors to expose plan participants to Bitcoin. Adding, The recent implosion of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, has made it abundantly clear the digital asset industry has serious problems.</p>
