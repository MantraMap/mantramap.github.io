<p>According to Pantera&#8217;s newest newsletter, CIO Joey Krug, <strong>decentralized finance (DeFi) will serve as the cornerstone for the next bull market.</strong></p>



<p>Krug believes that 2022, with its numerous crypto blow-ups and falls, was the most turbulent year in crypto history.</p>



<p>However, the CIO, who helps administer the $6.9 billion fund, claims that <strong>DeFi stayed to be totally intact in 2022, despite decreased rates for top protocols.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">What’s interesting to note here, on the other hand, is that decentralized finance protocols, which lent to largely unknown counterparties, didn’t blow up. The reasoning behind why DeFi protocols managed to succeed has a couple of levels to it. The surface level is that these protocols (e.g., Compound, Aave, and Maker) force people to post collateral and enforce aggressive risk controls.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The great irony is that those risk controls are the same kind of controls centralized entities often anecdotally said were ‘too tight, just inefficient’. They’d tell us, ‘these protocols can’t monitor risk like we do’. Mere months later, one of my closest friends told me about the favorable borrowing terms one of these companies gave him — the company was taking on absurd amounts of blow-up risk. I told him something along the lines of, ‘the next cycle will likely blow up due to these centralized lender entities. They’re picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.’</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1397.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="780" height="544" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1397.png" alt="DeFi Will Drive The Next Crypto Bull Market, Says Pantera Capital In A Letter 2023" class="wp-image-162541" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1397.png 780w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1397-300x209.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1397-768x536.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1397-750x523.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" title="DeFi Will Drive The Next Crypto Bull Market, Says Pantera Capital In A Letter 2023 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Krug claims that the code that <strong>regulates <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157320-defi-a-promising-piece-p2/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/157320-defi-a-promising-piece-p2/" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi </a>protocols has shown to be superior to humans</strong> who rely on arbitrary reasoning to persuade their users to trust them.</p>



<p>According to the hedge fund CEO, <strong>DeFi must focus on three major concerns in order to succeed</strong>. These include the crypto wallet user experience, paying transaction fees in Ethereum (ETH), and its clumsy fiat onramps.</p>



<p>If those three flaws are resolved, Krug believes DeFi will drive the next crypto bull cycle.</p>

<p>Credible employs Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis method that aims to forecast future price movement by observing market players&#8217; emotions, which tend to express in waves. A bullish asset, according to the idea, <strong>goes through a five-wave uptrend, with wave three igniting the biggest advance.</strong></p>

<p>According to Credible&#8217;s chart, <strong>a wave rally may take CRV to as high as $13</strong>. He further claims that on the weekly chart, CRV&#8217;s relative strength indicator, which gauges an asset&#8217;s momentum, has never been overbought, implying that the coin&#8217;s biggest changes are still to come.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <strong>CRV is trading for</strong> <strong>$0.995</strong>, which is down nearly 7% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>As for Bitcoin, despite its impressive performance this year, Credible feels that Bitcoin (BTC) still has an opportunity to go to the upside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inflation is projected to come down significantly this year,&#8221; said the Bank Of Canada <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/01/fad-press-release-2023-01-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in its policy statement</a>. &#8220;If economic developments evolve broadly in line with the [bank&#8217;s] outlook, Governing Council expects to hold the policy rate at its current level while it assesses the impact of the cumulative interest rate increases.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), which was down for the day and experienced a general sell-off in risky assets, didn&#8217;t respond much to the BoC&#8217;s dovish announcement, but this might be a bullish move. The Bank Of Canada began a series of aggressive rate hikes in 2022, similar to the <strong>U.S. Federal Reserve, in an effort to slow down rapidly rising inflation.</strong></p>



<p>The terrible bear market for bitcoin last year, which saw the price plummet from just shy <strong>of $50,000 to roughly $15,000 before closing 2022 around $16,500</strong>, was significantly influenced by this dramatically tighter monetary policy by the<strong> Fed, BoC, and other western central banks.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to the BoC, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Fed meets the next week and is anticipated to raise interest<strong> rates by only 25 basis points (versus 50 basis points at the previous meeting and 75 prior to that)</strong>. If the FOMC pleasantly revealed that it also intended to suspend its rate hiking program, the crypto markets would be far less inclined to ignore that information.</p>

<p>Indeed, the token’s promotional message dubbed it a revolution in decentralized finance (DeFi) and asked users to purchase RBH on the Pancakeswap decentralized exchange (DEX).</p>



<p>Crypto hacks accelerated rapidly in 2022, <strong>topping a total of $3 billion in total funds loss throughout the year, <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a report</a> from Chainanalysis.</strong></p>



<p>The scammy crypto project has also yet to be verified by digital asset data aggregators, who warned users to be cautious when dealing with the RBH token.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">“Anyone can create a BEP20 token on Binance Smart Chain with any name, including creating fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that claim to represent projects that do not have a token.

<p>According to the analyst&#8217;s chart, XRP has broken over a high volume node range while still remaining above its typical true range of $0.422. Meanwhile, Coincu reported 4 days ago that <strong>Ripple’s [XRP] market value surpassed $20 billion for the first time since the FTX epidemic hit the market more than two months ago.</strong></p>



<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.426, representing a fractional rise for the day.</p>



<p>In terms of Bitcoin, the crypto expert believes that the king cryptocurrency is not yet finished surging. Additionally, market intelligence firm <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-04-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glassnode</a> indicated that<strong> Bitcoin (BTC) may soon encounter sell-side pressure from short-term holders (STHs) anxious to capitalize on the king cryptocurrency’s current price increase.</strong></p>

<p>Griffin and I are founders at heart, and we want to create another firm,&#8221; Duncan said in defense of their decision.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“When @Gemini acquired NG in 2019, Griffin and I said if everything went amazing and we loved it, we would stay for 4 years before starting another company. We ended up staying the max amount of time we originally thought possible, which shows how great this experience was!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The decision was made in the midst of a legal dispute between Genesis Global, a defunct cryptocurrency lender, and Gemini, the parent company of Nifty Gateway. Genesis Global allegedly owes $900 million to its subscribers as part of the Gemini Earn program after Genesis Global stopped withdrawals in November 2020 due to <strong>&#8220;exceptional market conditions.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gemini purchased Nifty Gateway in 2019 after it was founded in 2018</strong>. Despite challenging business conditions at the parent company, Duncan claimed that Nifty Gateway &#8220;is in good hands&#8221; and that they had &#8220;been preparing for this transition for months.&#8221; Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were &#8220;visionaries who identified the potential in NFTs well before nearly anyone else,&#8221; the author stated. </p>



<p>Nifty Gateway will prosper going forward under their direction. Eddie Ma will replace Tara Harris as the<strong> &#8220;technical leader&#8221; </strong>for Nifty Gateway during the changeover, and Tara Harris will take over as the &#8220;leader&#8221; for non-tech.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We know that transitions can create uncertainty around the future. To that end, in the coming weeks, we will publicly outline a roadmap and a plan for the future of Nifty. After we depart we will stay connected to the mission in an advisory role to ensure continuity.”</p>

<p>The co-founder of Polygon, <strong>Sandeep Nailwal</strong>, made the following observation on Fractal: &#8220;Fractal is gradually becoming a place to study possible blockchain games.&#8221; We plan to make 2023 the year that blockchain games become accessible to the general public.</p>



<p>Fractal is <strong>the primary and secondary trading market for NFTs in the blockchain game</strong> on Solana. This is a feature that Justin Kan believes has a great deal of promise but has not yet been fully exploited. <strong>The project will be released by the end of 2021</strong>. However, when the Solana network had numerous serious challenges in 2022 as a result of the collapse of the FTX market and saw a large number of other projects leave, Fractal made the decision to broaden its activities in order to hunt for other prospects.</p>



<p>A previous funding round for <strong>Fractal brought in $35 million</strong>, including participation from a16z and Animoca Brands.</p>

<p>The business previously stated that anyone can create a<strong> &#8220;base-level Doodle&#8221;</strong> with the new project and &#8220;select general features like skin tone and hair color.&#8221; The wearables in <strong>DL</strong> 2 can then be customized with &#8220;different layers of rarity.&#8221; The pictures will be<strong> &#8220;whole body or PFP&#8221; and the NFTs will be &#8220;dynamic.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>In connection with the Doodles 2 experience,<strong> the team also released enigmatic Dooplicator NFTs in May. For each Doodle holder, the equipment was provided free of charge.</strong></p>



<p>The business shared a little video on Tuesday featuring a variety of <strong>DL</strong> characters in interchangeable clothing, background music, and accessories. On January 31, current <strong>Doodles holders will have access to the first phase of the Doodles 2 experience.</strong></p>

<p>In October 2021, <strong>DL made their debut as a 10,000-edition, vibrant PFP (profile photo) effort.

<p>After 7 months, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has closed a short investment on stablecoin RAI for a $92,000 USD profit. According to on-chain statistics, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149564-vitalik-buterin-dissatisfied-coindesks-rank/">Vitalik Buterin</a> borrowed <strong>400,000 RAI in May-June 2022</strong> and sold it for <strong>1.2 million DAI</strong> &#8211; another stablecoin. The Ethereum creator terminated his investment, <strong>selling 1.13 million USD in DAI and Ether to RAI</strong>. Vitalik generated a <strong>$92,000 profit </strong>through on-chain data analytics after returning the first RAI loan.</p>



<p>Stablecoin RAI is a stablecoin created by <strong>Reflexer Labs</strong> that is completely <strong>backed by Ether</strong>. To mint stablecoin RAI, users must lock their Ether as collateral and <strong>pay a 2% charge.</strong> RAI is not a stablecoin tied to the US dollar and instead relies on algorithms to maintain exchange rate stability. However, this approach proved ineffective when the price varied somewhat within a year, <strong>falling from 3.07 USD to 2.79 USD.</strong></p>

<p>Although Vitalik&#8217;s profit in this position is small, the move is notable because it <strong>highlights weaknesses in RAI&#8217;s architecture</strong>. <strong>Ameen Soleimani,</strong> co-founder of Reflexer Labs, used an example from Vitalik&#8217;s own trading position to confirm that RAI&#8217;s current design model is flawed.</p>



<p>According to Soleimani, RAI holders receive <strong>no staking incentives for the amount of Ether locked up as collateral.</strong> This is a cost of potential. As a result, the redemption rate (RAI) that maintains the RAI is frequently negative. This implies that the mechanism that maintains RAI steady will lead the coin&#8217;s price to fall over time.</p>



<p>The entrepreneur also <strong>advised adding stETH to the list of collateral assets as a workaround</strong>. This is a liquid staking token with a recurring reward for the holder. If this proposal is adopted,<strong> the amount of collateral for RAI will always rise over time</strong>, making RAI holders more profitable and reducing the opportunity cost of not engaging in ETH staking.</p>



<p>Another noteworthy feature is that upon delivering the RAI project, the original team canceled the key. Unlike many Ethereum projects, RAI chose to &#8220;<strong>decentralize&#8221; its platform</strong>, allowing the team to modify the protocol. Soleimani was subsequently forced to accept responsibility for the project&#8217;s &#8220;<strong>ungovernability&#8221; design.</strong></p>



<p>According to Ameen Soleimani, the only method to add <strong>stETH to the collateral list is to restart the project from the beginning.</strong></p>
