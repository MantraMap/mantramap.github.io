<p>NFT whitelists refer to curated lists of individuals or addresses who are granted exclusive access to purchase or bid on limited edition non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFT projects, artists, or marketplaces often create these whitelists as a way to reward and prioritize their most dedicated supporters. Being on an NFT whitelist provides participants with early access or guaranteed opportunities to acquire highly sought-after digital collectibles before they are made available to the general public.</p>



<p>NFT whitelists operate based on specific criteria set by the NFT project or artist. These criteria can vary and are designed to identify individuals who have demonstrated active engagement, loyalty, or ownership of specific tokens. By joining an NFT whitelist, participants gain a competitive advantage in acquiring rare or exclusive NFTs, which can hold significant value within the digital art and collectibles market.</p>



<p>The requirements and processes to join an NFT whitelist differ depending on the project. Common methods of gaining whitelist access include active community engagement, token holding requirements, early supporter recognition, and VIP or influencer partnerships. Community engagement can involve participating in discussions, attending events, or contributing to the project&#8217;s growth on social media platforms. Token holding requirements may stipulate that individuals hold a certain amount of project-specific tokens in their wallets. Early supporters are often rewarded with whitelist access as a show of appreciation for their early involvement. VIP or influencer partnerships allow the followers or subscribers of influential individuals or organizations to gain access to exclusive NFT drops.</p>



<p>Joining an NFT whitelist typically involves a process of research, community engagement, following social media channels, completing KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, and potentially acquiring and holding project tokens. NFT projects communicate whitelist announcements and application processes through their official channels, and interested individuals must adhere to the instructions and deadlines provided.</p>



<p>NFT whitelists serve as a mechanism to create exclusivity and reward dedicated community members within the NFT ecosystem. They offer unique opportunities to access limited edition digital collectibles, fostering engagement and loyalty among NFT enthusiasts and collectors.</p>

<p>NFT whitelists operate based on a set of criteria established by the NFT project, artist, or marketplace. The functioning of NFT whitelists can vary depending on the specific goals and requirements of the entity managing the whitelist. Here are some key aspects that contribute to the functioning of NFT whitelists:</p>



<ol>
<li>Curated Access: NFT whitelists are curated lists that grant exclusive access to purchase or bid on limited edition NFTs. They serve as a way to prioritize and reward individuals who meet specific eligibility criteria set by the NFT project or artist. By being on the whitelist, participants gain early or guaranteed access to acquire highly coveted digital collectibles.</li>



<li>Eligibility Criteria: NFT projects or artists define the criteria for joining their whitelists. These criteria may include factors such as community engagement, token holding requirements, early supporter recognition, or VIP partnerships. The purpose is to identify individuals who have shown active involvement, loyalty, or ownership of project-specific tokens.</li>



<li>Community Engagement: Many NFT projects emphasize community engagement as a criterion for whitelist access. Active participation in community discussions, attending events, contributing insights, or sharing the project&#8217;s vision on social media platforms can increase the chances of being noticed and considered for whitelist inclusion.</li>



<li>Token Holding Requirements: Some NFT projects require individuals to hold a specific number of their native tokens to be eligible for whitelist access. This requirement incentivizes token ownership and rewards participants who have invested in the project&#8217;s ecosystem.</li>



<li>Early Supporter Recognition: Artists or creators may choose to reward their early supporters by granting them whitelist access. This recognition acknowledges the support of individuals who have shown interest and dedication from the early stages of the project&#8217;s development.</li>



<li>VIP or Influencer Partnerships: NFT projects often collaborate with influential individuals or organizations in the digital art or cryptocurrency space. Through these partnerships, they extend whitelist access to the followers or subscribers of these VIPs or influencers. This strategy helps generate buzz and expands the project&#8217;s reach to a wider audience.</li>



<li>Whitelist Application Process: NFT projects typically communicate the whitelist application process through their official channels, including websites, social media platforms, or dedicated community forums. The application process may involve submitting personal information, completing a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, or providing wallet addresses to verify token holdings.</li>



<li>Whitelist Selection: After the whitelist application period closes, the NFT project or artist reviews the applications received. The selection process may consider factors such as community engagement, token holdings, and the overall alignment of applicants with the project&#8217;s values. The project then finalizes the whitelist and notifies the selected participants.</li>



<li>Exclusive Access: Once an individual is on the NFT whitelist, they gain access to exclusive NFT drops or releases. This access can occur through private sales, auctions, or early purchase opportunities before the general public has access to these limited edition NFTs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Joining an NFT whitelist involves a series of steps and requirements set by the NFT project, artist, or marketplace managing the whitelist. While the specific process may vary, here are some general steps you can follow to increase your chances of joining an NFT whitelist:</p>



<ol>
<li>Research and Identify NFT Projects: Start by researching and identifying NFT projects that align with your interests and values. Explore their websites, social media channels, and community forums to gather information about upcoming whitelists and their eligibility criteria.</li>



<li>Engage with the Community: Active participation in the NFT project&#8217;s community can significantly increase your chances of being noticed and considered for whitelist access. Engage in discussions, share insights, provide feedback, and contribute positively to the community&#8217;s growth. This can be done through social media platforms, Discord channels, Telegram groups, or attending virtual events.</li>



<li>Follow Official Channels: Stay updated with the NFT project&#8217;s official channels, such as their Twitter accounts, Discord servers, or Telegram groups. Important whitelist announcements, eligibility requirements, and application processes are often communicated through these channels. Set up notifications or regularly check these channels to ensure you don&#8217;t miss any updates.</li>



<li>Complete KYC Verification (if required): Some NFT projects require participants to complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. This process usually involves submitting identification documents and personal information to verify your identity. If KYC is a requirement, make sure you have the necessary documents ready and follow the instructions provided by the project.</li>



<li>Hold Project Tokens (if required): If the NFT project has its native token, acquiring and holding a specified amount of tokens might be a requirement for whitelist access. This demonstrates your commitment to the project&#8217;s ecosystem and can increase your chances of being considered for the whitelist. Follow the instructions provided by the project on how to acquire and hold their tokens securely in your wallet.</li>



<li>Participate in Pre-Whitelist Events: Some NFT projects host pre-whitelist events, such as competitions, giveaways, or challenges, to reward their community members. Participating in these events not only adds to your engagement but also provides an opportunity to showcase your dedication and potentially secure whitelist access. Keep an eye on the project&#8217;s announcements and actively participate in these events, following the rules and guidelines set by the project.</li>



<li>Monitor Whitelist Announcements: Stay vigilant for whitelist announcements from the NFT project. Whitelist application periods are often communicated through official channels. Take note of the application opening and closing dates, as well as any specific instructions or requirements outlined in the announcement.</li>



<li>Submit Your Application: When the whitelist application window opens, submit your application within the specified timeframe. Ensure that you provide accurate information and follow the instructions precisely. Depending on the project, the application process may involve filling out a form, providing relevant details about yourself, your engagement with the project, and any other information required.</li>



<li>Await Confirmation: After submitting your application, patiently await confirmation from the NFT project. Whitelist selection processes can take time as projects often receive a large number of applications. If you are selected, you will receive instructions on how to participate in the exclusive NFT drops or releases.</li>
</ol>



<p>Remember that each NFT project may have specific requirements and processes for joining their whitelist. It&#8217;s essential to thoroughly review the project&#8217;s instructions and guidelines to ensure you meet all the necessary criteria. Being active, engaged, and supportive of the project&#8217;s community can significantly increase your chances of being considered for whitelist access.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion </h2>



<p>NFT whitelists offer individuals an opportunity to access limited edition digital collectibles before they become available to the general public. By understanding how NFT whitelists function and the steps one can take to join them, individuals can enhance their chances of participating in exclusive NFT drops and connecting with their favorite artists and projects. As the NFT market continues to evolve, whitelists will likely remain a key element in building engaged communities and rewarding loyal supporters within the digital collectibles ecosystem.</p>

<p>These companies raised a significant amount of funds, which they will likely use for the development and growth of their respective projects. Each company has its unique focus, from creating a global identification system using iris scanning technology to developing cutting-edge technologies like privacy, zero-knowledge proofs, and artificial intelligence.

<p>Huobi, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, is shrouded in mystery when it comes to its ownership. In October 2022, Hong Kong-based investment firm, About Capital Management announced that it had acquired Huobi. However, it soon became clear that the mysterious party responsible for acquiring the exchange was none other than TRON and Poloniex founder Justin Sun. Despite persistent tweeting about the company and his appointment to the Huobi Global Advisory Board, Sun denies controlling ownership of the exchange.</p>



<p>According to PROTOS, About Capital Management, which announced the acquisition of Huobi in October 2022, said in May of the following year that it was &#8220;no longer involved with Huobi in any way.&#8221; The company refused to elaborate further.</p>

The Need For Clarity In The Cryptocurrency Industry 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Hong Kong corporate documents for numerous Huobi and Justin Sun-related entities, along with information about ACM, were obtained by Protos. The documents do not point to who or what entity currently holds a controlling interest in the company. In February, a new director was appointed to HBIT, representing Huobi under its FINCEN registration. </p>



<p>The individual in question, Wang Shuchi, appears to be the director of numerous shell companies and the owner of Huobi Digital Limited. Additionally, Li Qi was appointed as a director of &#8220;New Huo Technology Holdings Limited&#8221; in March of the same year.</p>



<p>The need for more transparency regarding Huobi&#8217;s ownership raises concerns about the exchange&#8217;s credibility and trustworthiness. Customers may be hesitant to trade on an exchange with unknown ownership and may choose to take their business elsewhere. The current situation also highlights the importance of transparency in the cryptocurrency industry and the need for regulation to protect investors and consumers.</p>



<p>As of writing, it remains to be seen who owns Huobi and what the future holds for the exchange. Nevertheless, the situation highlights the need for transparency and regulation in the cryptocurrency industry to protect investors and consumers.</p>

<p>Swan Bitcoin is an online platform that facilitates Bitcoin investment in a simple and systematic manner.

<p>The platform&#8217;s main objective is to provide a user-friendly and hassle-free experience for individuals looking to invest in Bitcoin. It simplifies the investment process and encourages a long-term investment strategy. Swan Bitcoin allows users to accumulate Bitcoin gradually over time through automatic recurring purchases, also known as &#8220;stacking sats&#8221; (stacking Satoshis). Satoshis are the smallest units of Bitcoin, and Swan Bitcoin enables users to automatically purchase a specified amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals, such as weekly or monthly.</p>



<p>Swan Bitcoin distinguishes itself through its commitment to low fees, transparency, security, and education. The platform charges a competitive fee of 0.99% on all Bitcoin purchases, making it cost-effective for users to accumulate Bitcoin without excessive charges. It prioritizes user autonomy by allowing investors to withdraw their Bitcoin holdings to an external wallet at any time, ensuring full control over their assets. Swan Bitcoin employs robust security measures, including cold storage and multi-signature wallets, to safeguard user funds. Additionally, the platform provides educational resources such as articles and videos to help users understand Bitcoin and make informed investment decisions.</p>



<p>Swan Bitcoin is a platform designed to simplify the process of investing in Bitcoin. It aims to make Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience, promote a disciplined investment approach, and provide a secure and user-friendly experience for individuals interested in the world of digital currency.</p>

<p>Swan Bitcoin&#8217;s investment process is straightforward and designed to be hassle-free. To begin, users must sign up on the platform and complete a verification process, which includes identity verification and bank account linking. Once the account is verified, investors can set up recurring purchases or make one-time purchases of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Swan Bitcoin stands out for its unique approach to purchasing Bitcoin. Instead of executing immediate market orders, the platform employs a technique called &#8220;stacking sats&#8221; (short for &#8220;stacking Satoshis&#8221;). Satoshis are the smallest units of Bitcoin, and Swan Bitcoin allows users to automatically purchase a specified amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals, such as weekly or monthly. This approach encourages a disciplined and long-term investment strategy, enabling users to accumulate Bitcoin gradually over time.</p>



<p>The process of investing with Swan Bitcoin is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Here is a step-by-step guide to investing with Swan Bitcoin:</p>



<ol>
<li>Sign Up: Visit the Swan Bitcoin website (swanbitcoin.com) and click on the &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button to create an account. Provide the required information, including your name, email address, and password.</li>



<li>Verification: After signing up, you will need to go through a verification process. This typically involves providing identification documents and verifying your identity. Swan Bitcoin follows strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to ensure the security and legitimacy of transactions.</li>



<li>Bank Account Linking: Once your account is verified, you will need to link your bank account to your Swan Bitcoin account. This step allows you to fund your Bitcoin purchases directly from your bank account.</li>



<li>Set Up Recurring Purchases (Optional): Swan Bitcoin offers the option to set up recurring purchases, which allows you to automatically buy Bitcoin at regular intervals. You can choose the frequency of purchases (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) and the amount you want to invest each time. This feature encourages a disciplined investment approach and helps you accumulate Bitcoin over time.</li>



<li>One-Time Purchases: In addition to recurring purchases, Swan Bitcoin also enables users to make one-time purchases of Bitcoin. You can manually specify the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy and proceed with the purchase.</li>



<li>Fiat-to-Bitcoin Conversion: Once you have set up your recurring or one-time purchase, Swan Bitcoin will convert the specified amount of fiat currency (e.g., US dollars) into Bitcoin at the prevailing market rate. The converted Bitcoin will be credited to your Swan Bitcoin account.</li>



<li>Bitcoin Storage: SB provides secure storage for your Bitcoin holdings. By default, your Bitcoin is stored in a Swan Bitcoin custodial wallet. However, the platform also offers the flexibility to withdraw your Bitcoin to an external wallet of your choice if you prefer to have full control over your funds.</li>



<li>Monitoring and Managing Investments: You can track your Bitcoin holdings and monitor the performance of your investments through your Swan Bitcoin account. The platform provides an intuitive interface that displays your portfolio value and transaction history.</li>

<p>Although support for a fee outweighs opposition for a charge (55% vs. 45%), no individual category has received greater support than the &#8220;free&#8221;. If protocol fee advocates can link together after a certain percentage of fees, they can win.</p>



<p>Devin Walsh, executive director of the Uniswap Foundation, said on Twitter that the poll was published for feedback and was not part of a formal governance process.</p>

<p>These results will not necessarily prevent further votes on the proposal. The polling site suggests that the poll data will be used to prepare for a more formal &#8220;temperature check&#8221; vote. However, the opposition to a fee is substantial.</p>



<p>As per previous news, GFX Labs <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186644-uniswap-to-charge-liquidity-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has launched</a> a proposal in the Uniswap community to &#8220;implement liquidity pool fees&#8221;, proposing that all Uniswap v3 pools implement agreement fees equal to 20% of pool fees and open charge conversion for Uniswap v2.</p>



<p>The proposal&#8217;s scope is to implement fees on the Uniswap liquidity pool, implement a fee-for-earning system, and sell designated assets to the UNI community in a trustless manner. In subsequent proposals, the UNI community can decide how to manage, distribute or use the assets to be credited to the treasury.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-86-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-86-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Asks Canadian Regulators To Recall Securities Violation Investigation" class="wp-image-191590" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-86-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-86-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-86-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-86-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-86-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-86.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Asks Canadian Regulators To Recall Securities Violation Investigation 26"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to a document filed with the Capital Markets Court, the Securities Commission of Ontario, Canada, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191286-binance-pressured-by-canadian-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> an investigative order against Binance last month, and Binance will be investigated to determine if it is intentionally circumventing securities laws.</p>



<p>According to the petition, the OSC&#8217;s submission requested a particularly extensive examination of whether the exchange may have attempted to evade Ontario securities laws and compliance procedures related to Binance.com or engaged in conduct contrary to Ontario securities laws or the public interest.</p>



<p>A few days later, Binance announced it was leaving the country due to &#8220;new guidance regarding stablecoins and investor restrictions.&#8221; When asked why it chose to leave the Canadian market, its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), a Canadian citizen, said in a Twitter post that he no longer thinks running a company has interest there is possible due to the new regulations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png" alt="Binance Asks Canadian Regulators To Recall Securities Violation Investigation" class="wp-image-191591" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Binance Asks Canadian Regulators To Recall Securities Violation Investigation 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Binance subsequently asked the Ontario Securities Commission to drop its investigation, arguing that it was &#8220;extremely broad&#8221; and &#8220;not based on any factual facts.&#8221; Binance added in its May 18 filing that the &#8220;investigation order has no legitimate purpose&#8221; and that the exchange has withdrawn from Ontario and Canada.</p>



<p>According to Capital Markets Court filings,<a href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/sites/default/files/2023-05/rad_20230529_binance-holdings-ltd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a hearing</a> on whether to drop the investigation is set for June 2.</p>



<p>Binance isn&#8217;t the only crypto company that finds Canada a difficult place to do business. After, digital asset exchange Bybit said it was leaving the country, and OKX in March announced their withdrawal, citing the inability to withstand the new regulations.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Introduction</h1>



<p>The past decade has witnessed a tumultuous journey for the financial industry, with the collapse of large financial institutions and the concentration of decision-making power in the hands of a few individuals. These challenges have highlighted the risks associated with centralized systems. However, amidst the turbulence, decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a beacon of hope, offering new opportunities and empowering investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:28px"><strong>DEX vs CEX</strong></h2>



<p>Following the centralized exchange FTX collapse in November 2022, DEX trading volume surged, indicating a significant shift in investor preference towards decentralized platforms. The ongoing debate between centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) is a pivotal discussion in the crypto community:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:28px"><strong>Bitcoin Halving Event</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, set to take place on April 28, 2024, is a significant milestone in the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly within the Trendy DeFi ecosystem. Occurring approximately every four years, the halving event involves a reduction of the block reward given to miners by half. As these halvings progress, the creation of new Bitcoin decreases, ultimately leading to the attainment of the maximum supply.</p>



<p>Within the Trendy DeFi pool, this reduction in new Bitcoin creation has an impact on the price of MATIC. Consequently, it fulfills one of the conditions of the investment pool, enabling participants to exercise their voting rights. Through the implementation of a DAO mechanism, investors can vote on whether to close the pool or determine the monthly profit. In cases where the voting rate surpasses 51% agreement among the investors, the development team will adjust the interest rate percentage accordingly.</p>



<p>As of July 2019, there have only been <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184664-365-days-bitcoin-halving-the-block-reward/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/184664-365-days-bitcoin-halving-the-block-reward/" rel="noreferrer noopener">two previous </a>Bitcoin halving events. These occurred on the 28th of November, 2012, and the 9th of July, 2016. At the time of the first halving event, the price of Bitcoin was $12.31, and at the time of the second halving event, the price of Bitcoin was $650.63.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/halving" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://academy.binance.com/en/halving" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance Academy</a>, the Bitcoin halvings timer is calculated using the following formula:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(Halving block – Next block height) * Average time between blocks – estimated time until the next block.</code></pre>

<p>Trendy DeFi distinguishes itself from traditional financial projects by embracing the principles of DeFi and empowering investors. Unlike projects where decision-making power is centralized, and funds can be misused, Trendy DeFi prioritizes transparency, fairness, and user control. The platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem where users can engage in buying, depositing, exchanging, and, most importantly, earning monthly passive income based on investors&#8217; voting percentages.</p>



<p>At the core of Trendy DeFi is a shared wallet system built on Smart Contract technology, ensuring the security of funds and preventing unauthorized transfers. The platform operates as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling all participating members to make decisions through voting collectively. This decentralized governance model eliminates centralized control and empowers investors to shape the project&#8217;s future. The system&#8217;s funds can only be used to adjust interest rates through voting, and any modifications require a 51% majority agreement from members through vote.</p>

<p>As a Polygon-based platform, Trendy DeFi leverages MATIC as the staking token in its investment pools. MATIC, listed on numerous exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, offers stability during market downturns and exhibits steady growth during market upswings. With more than <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-crosses-53-000-dapps-mark-in-a-major-adoption-milestone" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-crosses-53-000-dapps-mark-in-a-major-adoption-milestone" rel="noreferrer noopener">53,000 active DApps</a> on the MATIC platform, it serves as a robust foundation for developing decentralized applications, making it an ideal choice for Trendy DeFi&#8217;s technology stack.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Use $MATIC deposit token to invest 25% to pay system commission, 75% push to pool.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trendy DeFi ensures appropriate and safe interest rates for its users, ranging from 7% to 10.5%. The combination of market dynamics, the investor community, and the AUTO DCA (Cost Averaging) feature guarantees the safety of the investment pool. The project provides a clear roadmap for investors, outlining entry and exit points, profit rates, and risk management strategies. </p>



<p>Additionally, the condition-based approach ensures that investors receive interest for a defined period and allows voting to close the pool if specific criteria are met:</p>



<ul>
<li>Condition 1: Investors receive 7 &#8211; 10.5% interest over 2 years.</li>



<li>Condition 2: Once the price of Matic reaches $1.6, all system members will receive a voting notification to determine the pool&#8217;s closure. If a majority of 51% or more votes agree to end the pool, it will be officially closed. In such a scenario, the development team will collaborate to adjust the interest rate, ensuring investors can claim the remaining benefits from their investments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:28px"><strong>Staking</strong></h2>



<p>Trendy DeFi provides the potential to earn an annualized rate of return (ARP) ranging from 85.1% up to 127.75% for staking MATIC. All funds belonging to members are held within the Staking Pool, which is meticulously crafted using a Smart Contract. To instill an additional layer of trust, the Staking Pool undergoes a comprehensive audit by Certik, a reputable auditing firm.</p>



<p>Additionally, Trendy DeFi offers pool ranking rewards for those who meet the minimum requirements. Since active members staked a certain amount of tokens, they can earn additional rewards and move up in the pool rankings as table below:</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A MakerDAO vote ending Thursday approved the proposal to invest up to $1.28 billion in US Treasuries.</strong></h5>



<p>Following the proposal submitted on the MakerDAO governance forum earlier this month, the Andromeda Project was launched by Blocktower Capital Advisors LP under MIP90. According to the asset purchase schedule posted on the admin forum, 1/6 (16.67%) of the total DAI stock will be allocated to the US Treasury in 0-1 month. Equal allocations have been listed for 1-2 month bonds, 2-3 month bonds, etc.</p>



<p>MakerDAO Governance will instruct trading parties to mint Dai, exchange Dai for other stablecoins held in PSM, and buy US Treasury bonds evenly over maturities ranging from 0 to 6 months.</p>



<p>Voters unanimously supported opening a new real-world asset vault (RWA) called BlockTower Andromeda. MakerDAO will pay a 0.15% sorting fee to BlockTower, which amounts to over $1.9 million. Celadon Financial Group will act as the broker, and Wedbush Securities will custody the assets.</p>

<p>The approval to buy $1.28 billion worth of US Treasury bonds comes just months after the Maker community approved a proposal to<a href="https://news.coincu.com/174264-makerdao-approved-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> increase</a> its US Treasury bond portfolio holdings to 150%, from $500 million to $1.25 billion.

<p>The Federal Reserve Board of Governors<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20230601a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announced</a> the order on Wednesday as part of Silvergate&#8217;s shutdown process. Although the bank voluntarily declared liquidation with a plan of &#8220;full refund of all deposits.&#8221; Banks must preserve cash and other resources to compensate depositors.</p>



<p>The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation must approve Silvergate&#8217;s plan to liquidate assets. This bank announced it would be shutting down in March of this year.</p>



<p>The Fed&#8217;s order notes that recent Silvergate audits by state regulators and officials from the San Francisco Fed &#8220;discovered many deficiencies in its safety, soundness, and compliance. &#8220;It linked the bank&#8217;s failure to its transactions with the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX.</p>



<p>Fed said the failure of FTX and Alameda, combined with Silvergate&#8217;s business strategy tied to the digital asset industry and a banking run prelude to similar higher-impact operations in the Valley Silicon and Signature Bank &#8220;has led to the funding and liquidity stress for the bank and a decline in processes that are the primary source of revenue.</p>



<p>The Fed statement noted that Silvergate executives voluntarily consented to all elements of the enforcement action. The regulator must approve any bonuses, promotions, or severance packages for executives as part of the order.</p>

<p>Silvergate was the first central crypto-friendly bank to close operations, followed by Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Many digital asset companies – including Coinbase, Paxos, Gemini, Bitstamp, and Galaxy Digital – previously had financial ties to Silvergate but announced that they would be leaving following allegations that the bank was involved in the collapse of FTX.</p>

<p>The new crypto offerings come less than a year after the derivatives exchange launched its nano Bitcoin and nano Ether derivatives. In addition to lower exchange fees, eligible institutions may qualify for various incentive programs if they are early adopters of these contracts.</p>



<p>The new derivatives will be offered in the form of USD-settled index futures and will expire every month. Each BTI and ETI contract represents 1 Bitcoin and Ether, respectively. In June 2022, Coinbase Derivatives Exchange launched Bitcoin nano futures contracts for its retail clients. Followed by the launch of nano Ether futures in August 2022.</p>
