<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cardano coin is currently in phase whether the excessive selling is getting countered by the buyers accumulated at a discounted price.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the ADA coin is $336.5 Million, indicating a 19.6% gain</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/">Cardano coin price</a> witnessed a massive downfall, which showcased a breakdown attempt from the $0.24 support. However, this attempt was undermined by coin buyers immediately and pushed the prices above the $0.266 level.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, over the past three days, the coin price has been trading sideways between the $0.3 and $0.266 marks. The indecisive candles displayed within the range suggest uncertainty among market participants.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, after this aggressive downfall, a temporary recovery is reasonable to absorb the buying pressure building up on the discounted value of ADA price. Therefore, the coin price could see a minor relief rally to $0.3 or $0.324.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">WIll Cardano Coin Reclaim $0.3 Mark?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the overall market trend still bearish, the Cardano price is less likely to make an immediate recovery above $0.3. However, as mentioned, the price could witness a temporary bounce between the $0.3 and $0.324 mark to check their resistance strength after the recent breakdown.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> wavering in the oversold region reflects an unhealthy amount of swelling which will be addressed by some buying pressure to manage a sustained trend.</span></li>

<h2>Ripple CTO Performs Autopsy Of Hinman Speech</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Director, Bill Hinman gave a disputed speech related to crypto asset securities. He declared that a token is not a security once it becomes “sufficiently decentralized”. However, it&#8217;s been 5 years and 7 court orders since Hinman delivered the controversial speech.</p>
<p>Stuart Alderoty, Ripple Chief Legal Officer <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601225418543109" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that emails and drafts of the speech depict that Hinman ignored multiple warnings given by the internal staff. He added that the former executive’s speech contained made up analysis with no basis in law, breached by the Howey Factors and exposed regulatory gaps.</p>
<p>He added that Hinman’s speech created not just confusion but greater confusion in the market. However, the former SEC director claimed that the speech was his personal view, while the commission touted it as guidance. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Ripple News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<h2>Trading And Market&#8217;s Head Flagged Risk</h2>
<p>Alderoty highlighted that then SEC Chair Jay Clayton publicly pointed to it. However, the commission repeatedly flip flopping on the importance of the speech in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>As per the documents, the Head of Trading and Markets (T&amp;M) stated that the list of factors is so extensive, while it appears to include things that go beyond the typical Howey analysis. It added they have concerns this speech may lead to greater confusion on what is a security.</p>
<p>However, the Trading and Market Head asked Hinman to tie his newly invented factors more closely and explicitly to the Howey analysis.</p>

This article explores the top three undervalued <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoins</a> that have reached crucial support levels, presenting excellent return on investment prospects.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-crypto-idos/">Top Crypto IDOs To Invest 2023</a></p>
<h2><b>Zilliqa (ZIL) Price Analysis: Offers Bottom Fishing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/mFLp5KO0.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source: Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid increasing selling pressure in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/zilliqa/">ZIL price</a> plummeted to a monthly low of $0.0155. The long lower price rejection observed in the daily chart indicates that buyers have begun accumulating at this support level, hinting at the potential for a bullish reversal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the weekly <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> exhibits a slight rise, suggesting an underlying bullish momentum that provides additional confidence to buyers. However, on the flip side, the technical chart reveals a downsloping trendline that has hindered buyers from gaining control over the past ten months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Therefore, traders seeking a safer entry point should wait for a breakout above the overhead trendline. A post-breakout rally has the potential to drive the price back to the psychological mark of $0.05.</span></p>
<h2><b>Stacks (STX) Price Analysis: Stands at Crucial Support</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/Seh5SVkm.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source: Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/stacks/">Stacks price</a> demonstrated a remarkable bull counter-attack, with a rejection candle featuring a long tail at the combined support of the ascending trendline and $0.467. This candle indicates that buyers were able to recover the majority of the day&#8217;s losses and are strongly defending this support level. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a 1.68% intraday loss, the STX price might retest the long-anticipated support to confirm its sustainability above it. A potential reversal from this support level will empower buyers to challenge the overhead trendline.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A breakout above the resistance trendline would serve as an early sign of a trend reversal and could propel the Stacks price back to the $1 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MultiversX (EGLD) Price Analysis: Bullish Pattern Setup</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/4FR205Ep.png" alt="TradingView Chart" /></span></p>
<p>Source-tradingview</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time chart, the EGLD price exemplifies a textbook <a href="https://coingape.com/education/falling-wedge-pattern-what-to-do-if-it-appears-on-a-crypto-chart/">falling wedge pattern</a>. In theory, this pattern is a well-known bullish continuation pattern that offers a long entry opportunity for traders upon a breakout above the overhead trendline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, due to the recent market sell-off, the EGLD price has reached the bottom trend of the pattern. The lower price rejection at this support level, combined with an oversold signal from the momentum indicator, suggests a possibility of a bullish reversal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reversal would initiate the bull cycle within the pattern and could propel the MultiversX coin to the initial target of $40, thereby challenging the overhead trendline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tweet from Grewal contained the screenshot of a portion of the documents that highlighted a “regulatory gap” in which an asset can be excused from being tagged as a security if there’s no controlling entity to hold onto in the case of a decentralized entity and is still required to register to fulfill an obligation to protect investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grewal noted that the clause underpinning the regulatory gap is what the trading platform had been telling the US SEC, Congress and the Third Circuit Court respectively. John Deaton, known for his insightful commentary on the case noted that the regulatory gap can help the fair notice defense on the part of Coinbase, Ripple and other digital currencies the SEC might be going after.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Hinman emails help <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@coinbase</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ETH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ETH</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Ripple</a>’s fair notice defense. How much it helps anyone in a courtroom is yet to be seen. But in the Court of Public Opinion and in Congress, the emails should help drive attention to how hypocritical and reckless the SEC is being. <a href="https://t.co/kdYOSsh2RX">https://t.co/kdYOSsh2RX</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1668644872956309506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The use of fair notice defense is centered around an argument that the defendants which in this case is Coinbase operated its products and lacked fair notice from the SEC to show its alleged services, like staking violates the securities law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recall that Coinbase exchange was </span><a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the SEC last week as the regulator alleged that it supported the trading of unregistered securities while also offering its staking product that is deemed a security.</span></p>
<h2><b>Crypto Lawyer on the Court of Public Opinion</b></h2>

In a shocking discovery in the documents, Hinman wrote that he didn’t see a need to regulate Ethereum (ETH) as a security and that he would consult Ethereum cofounder <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/vitalik-buterin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin</a> later that week to confirm mutual understanding about the same. During the same time period, Ripple and its executives were subjected to the lawsuit, in which the SEC argued that XRP tokens were sold as unregistered securities.</p>

<p>In this context, it will be interesting to see how Judge Analisa Torres, who is overseeing the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit, will react to the Hinman documents. The part about Ethereum not being a security may be closely looked at.</p>
<h2>Ripple CEO: SEC May Have Bluffed All Through</h2>
<p>Considering the SEC’s enforcement actions on crypto businesses despite lack of regulatory clarity, the agency, according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse might have bluffed about its calls to come and register all through. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1668601653174611968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the agency&#8217;s open invitations to come forward and register crypto tokens may have been a lie.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Seeing the depth to which the SEC has essentially weaponized the lack of regulatory clarity through enforcement actions since this speech was given – it’s no surprise that we can call bluff on their claims to “just come in and register” as nothing but in bad faith.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, it remains to be seen when Judge Torres will deliver the Summary Judgement, now that the Hinman emails are revealed.</p>

The market is currently paring off its gains with Ethereum (ETH) now in the spotlight after </span><a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shedding off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 1.2% of its price to $1,734.13 over the past 24 hours at the time of writing.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will These Discovery Impact ETH Price?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For what it’s worth, Ethereum is the second largest digital currency by market capitalization after Bitcoin and the current hint of selloffs is quite mild to fuel a remarkable dent in the valuation of the asset.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing selloff can be tagged a knee jerk reaction from the market and as soon as many understand that the documents does not implicate Ethereum beyond the regular dissent among American regulators, we may then record a market rebalancing.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are additional discoveries being made on the Hinman documents which are being pored on by experts in the crypto community. For many, the only issue is the lack of clarity on the part of the SEC and other regulators and the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/gary-gensler-hearing-crypto-firms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discrepancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between the tag for Ethereum and XRP might help fuel the long sought correction.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Ethereum Price Down By 8% WoW</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the perceived loss can be said to be mild, it becomes significant when we factor in the fact that ETH has been on a bullish run earlier in the day. The selloff is currently encroaching with total trading volume in the past 24 hours coming in at $7 billion per data from CoinGape price chart.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-151651" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/13232349/Screen-Shot-2023-06-13-at-11.23.29-PM.png" alt="Ethereum price" width="719" height="506" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: Coinmarketcap</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bearish sentiment Ethereum is exhibiting today might stem from the mention it got as a favored digital currency in the released Hinman Emails. As </span><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-eth-hinman-sec-ripple/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Coingape, the Emails show an indication that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) favored Ethereum over other digital currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SEC through the Hinman Speech tagged Ethereum as a non-security even though it was launched through the process of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) like XRP. The question now lies in why the markets regulator named Ethereum alongside Bitcoin (BTC) but left out XRP in its classification of what was a security at the time.</span></p>

Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse is one of those that have </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1668616928003497984?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400">shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> his thoughts on the released documents noting that he will not necessarily tag them as ‘fraud’ as many in the industry might be pushed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Garlinghouse’s comment was in response to a tweet shared by media personality Charles Gasparino who noted that the knee jerk reaction from members of the XRP community is to tag the document and the basis for their design as fraud within the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Garlinghouse said he will not tag it as a fraud because he is not a lawyer and as such do not know the precise legal threshold surrounding the documents. He however, said that everyone can agree that the government is required to act with integrity.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I won&#39;t use the &#39;fraud&#39; word (I&#39;m not a lawyer and I don&#39;t know the precise legal threshold) but I think we can all agree that our government should act with integrity. The SEC &#8211; despite the industry asking for clarity &#8211; is actively approaching crypto in bad faith.</p>
<p>&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1668616928003497984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He made additional comments on the fact that the markets regulator has been approaching the crypto industry in bad faith despite the unending call for regulatory clarity. One of the exchanges the regulator sued recently, Coinbase Global Inc has even gone as far as </span><a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-files-mandamus-petition/"><span style="font-weight: 400">suing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the commission for failure to provide the clarity it has been calling on the regulator for for months.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ripple vs SEC: Does Hinman Emails Make a Difference?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Hinman Emails were finally released to the public after more than 5 court orders to compel the SEC to do so. While the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-eth-hinman-sec-ripple/"><span style="font-weight: 400">discovery in the emails</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> might be surprising to many, they will not make a difference in the ongoing case as Ripple’s counsel has been allowed access to the documents a while back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The release of the document is just in the interest of freedom of information and transparency as the public interest in the ongoing legal brawl between the SEC and Ripple is very high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With more understanding now in the hands of the XRP community, the outcome of the case is now more important than ever as the summary judgment on the suit is expected anytime from now. Prior to this point, experts who have been analyzing the merits of the arguments from both the SEC and Ripple have </span><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-ripple-crypto-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400">tipped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the latter to come out largely victorious.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decreased volume throughout the two-month correction phase indicates that this downfall is temporary.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sideways Action and Breakout Opportunity:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past six days, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/#:~:text=The%20live%20Bitcoin%20price%20today,at%20Coingape%20Crypto%20Price%20Page.">Bitcoin price</a> has showcased several short-bodied candles with long-rejection wicks on either side. These candles of uncertainty reflect no clear dominance from buyers or sellers, suggesting that coin holders could witness high volatility in the coming days.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While prices may continue the sideways action for a week or two, the wedge pattern&#8217;s trendlines are gradually converging, indicating that the narrow space will soon trigger a breakout opportunity. In theory, the wedge pattern is a continuation pattern, and therefore, the Bitcoin price is likely to break the overhead trendline.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The potential breakout will accelerate the bullish momentum and may offer entry opportunities to traders, with the post-breakout setting the BTC price to shoot above $30,000.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Bitcoin Price Hit $20,000?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The support trendline of the wedge pattern has prevented the Bitcoin price from experiencing excessive downfall despite increased bearishness in the crypto market. Therefore, the coin uses this level as a key support to maintain a bullish outlook. Until that trendline is intact, the Bitcoin price is less likely to go below $25,000.</span><span id="more-151637"></span></p>

<p>According to the GitHub <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://github.com/classic-terra/core/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a>, L1TF developers <strong>Till Ziegler or &#8220;fragwuerdig&#8221;</strong> and <strong>The Vinh Nguyen</strong> have made 19 additions and 9 deletions to some files. This includes fixing missing labels in the wasm client and changing logs. Two major changes with the upgrade are wasmvm will be upgraded to v1.1.2 and the minimum 5% validator commission for all validators.</p>

<p>With <strong>Proposal 11561</strong> “Upgrade to v2.1.0” officially passed by the Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) community, the Terra Classic <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain’s</a> biggest v2.1.1 parity upgrade will happen on June 14. The upgrade is scheduled at block height <strong>13215800</strong> at approximately 14:00 UTC, as per the StakeBin <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://terraclassic.stakebin.io/terra/tools" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">countdown timer</a>.</p>
<p>Joint L1 Task Force project manager <strong>LuncBurnArmy</strong> announced that the team is all prepared for the v2.1.1 upgrade. The upgrade will bring Terra Classic to parity with other blockchains such as Terra 2.0 and other Cosmos chains. Thus, allowing projects and developers to once again build and bring <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dApps</a> on the Terra Classic chain.</p>
<p>The parity is also essential for introducing <strong>Interchain Accounts (ICA)</strong> into Terra Classic (LUNC), as professor and core developer <strong>Edward Kim</strong> <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/edk208/status/1652381317147836419" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>. ICA will <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-dev-l1tf-unveils-edward-kim-ai-chain-block-entropy-lunc-price-to-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring AI app chain</a> <strong>Block Entropy</strong> to the Terra Classic chain. Meanwhile, the community can obtain the Testnet tokens from the Block Entropy TestNet Faucet.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Rally Ahead of Parity Upgrade</h2>
<p>LUNC price jumped 15% in the last 24 hours, with price currently trading at $0.000096. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000086 and $0.000100, respectively. However, the LUNC price is likely to rebound after the Parity upgrade on June 14. Furthermore, the trading volume has also increased 120% in the last 24 hours, indicating an increase in interest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) staking has <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-luna-classic-staking-officially-hits-1-trillion-lunc-burn-63-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially reached 1 trillion</a>, a historic milestone ahead of the major Parity upgrade.

The crypto community is going through each and every page of it, however, an overview of it suggests that the Commission favored <a href="https://coingape.com/category/ethereum-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> ahead of all other digital assets.</p>

<h2>Why ETH Not XRP?</h2>
<p>The crucial documents revealed why then SEC Director Bill Hinman mentioned Bitcoin and Ethereum and let the XRP out of this category. However, Hinman’s speech indicated that a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, change into something other than a security. It highlighted that Ether was not a security even though it was launched through an initial coin offering (ICO).</p>
<p>It is mentioned that the internal departments had some second thoughts about stating Ethereum in the speech. Hinman drew opposition for the reason that he included Ether in the speech draft. However, he stated they have a call scheduled with Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Founder, later that week in order to confirm the understanding of ETH foundations operations. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>The comments from the Trading and Markets Department in response to Hinman’s speech draft stated that the speech is what the market participants were asking for and they are very supportive of the speech and what it is communicating to the general public.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the SEC&#8217;s Office of General Counsel (OGC) turned out to have concerns with the draft’s language about Ether. It also issued a proposal to remove it from the draft and even from the final version of the controversial speech. It added that it might become difficult for the agency to take a different position on Ether ahead.</p>

With this sell-off, the coin price breached yearly support of $0.687 and reached a low of $0.518. While the support breakdown reflected aggressive selling pressure in the market, the buyers defending the $0.518 level indicates, the coin price is less likely to breach this support in the near future.</span></p>

<h2><strong>MATIC Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MATIC price is like to witness a bullish upswing to $0.75</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A downsloping resistance trendline carries the current downtrend</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent rebound from the $0.518 level indicates a period of accumulation as buyers seize the opportunity to acquire their favorite altcoins at discounted prices. As a result, the MATIC price surged by 28% gain and reached the current trading value of the $0.663 mark.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this reversal does not confirm a considerable recovery but can offer a temporary bounce in the current downtrend. With sustained buying, the altcoin could breach the $0.687 local resistance and surge to the $0.75 psychological barrier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above resistance aligned with a long-coming resistance which could recuperate the selling pressure and resume the prevailing downtrend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Will MATIC Price Revisit $0.518</strong>?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consecutive three-day rally in MATIC price is accompanied by a decreasing volume, raising concerns about the commitment behind a sustained recovery. This bullish upswing may rechallenge the overhead trend in the near future, but any reversal sign from it plunges the price back to $0.518.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Average Directional Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A high value of ADX(38) slope reflects the instability of the current downtrend.</span></li>

The department <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> that in May, the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers increased 0.1%, seasonally adjusted, and rose 4% over the last 12 months, not seasonally adjusted. Hence, the inflation data for the month came in as expected, while the 4% annual inflation rate is the lowest in about two years.</p>
<p>The market participants had expected the CPI data to show signs of easing inflation, with prices expected to have risen 0.1%, compared to the 0.4% rise in April 2023. On the other hand, the market participants are anticipating a rate hike pause decision from the June 14, 2023 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price Rises Over News Of Cooling Inflation</h2>
<p>The CPI Index, also called inflation numbers, measures the average change over time in the costs paid by urban consumers for goods and services. In the lead up to the CPI data release, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> saw a jump over the last 24 hours, leading it to the $26,000 range. After the data release, the BTC price registered a 3% jump compared to the daily low of $25,700 level, followed by some correction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the news of easing inflation and the lowest annual inflation rate recorded in two years could mean additional confidence for the US Federal Reserve officials in deciding to initiate yet another rate hike pause. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CME FedWatch Tool</a>, which gauges the likelihood that the Fed will change the Federal target rate, currently shows a 100% probability of a rate hike pause in the upcoming meeting.</p>

In terms of whale activity, <strong>&#8220;0x06cD,&#8221; the 8th largest holder of BLUR</strong>, has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x5283d291dbcf85356a21ba090e6db59121208b44?a=0x011d19410fc79f140c08ffa8301e4153f17f4e27" rel="nofollow">withdrawn</a> 10.5 million tokens ($3.36 million) from OKX since April 4th, with the most recent withdrawal occurring two days ago.

<h3>Whale Activity and Trader Insights</h3>
<p>Oilysirs.eth, a prominent trader, recently purchased 100,000 BLUR at $0.35, investing 20 ETH ($35,000). This move proved profitable as the trader gained 455 ETH ($792,000) from BLUR&#8217;s price appreciation. Additionally, oilysirs.eth bought 1 million tokens at $0.46 on February 15th, sold it for 757 ETH ($1.26 million) at a price of $1.23 on February 16th and 19th.</p>
<p>Address &#8220;0xfcef&#8221; removed 1.9 million BLUR from liquidity and sold all the tokens at $0.31. This action followed the receipt of BLUR from SmartMoney address &#8220;0x8129.&#8221; SmartMoney &#8220;0x8129&#8221; has a track record of making approximately 587,000 from it, consistently buying at low prices and selling at high prices.</p>

Amid the intense sell-off on June 5th and 10th, the falling altcoin shows a sharp reversal at the same level of $0.486, indicating buyers are not allowing the price to fall below this level. Thus, the $0.486 level stands as a crucial level to sustain recovery sentiment among market participants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a fortnight, the XRP price rebounded twice from the $0.486 support level. These two reversals show the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a> in the daily time frame chart. This chart formation is a sign of strong accumulation from buyers at particular support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last reversal from the $0.486 mark has surged the prices by 15.6% where it currently trades at the $0.558 mark. This rally shows a breakout attempt from the $0.55 neckline resistance, offering an entry opportunity to traders.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the $0.55 is a multi-month barrier that undermined several attempts from buyers to start a sustained bullish run. A potential breakout above this forbidden barrier with daily candle closing is needed to intensify the buying momentum that may push the price above $0.6</span></p>
<h2><b>Will XRP Price Reach $0.6?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price impressively withstand the recent sell-offs in the crypto market and held its ground at crucial support. In addition, the bullish pattern formation could bolster buyers to breach the $0.55 resistance, setting a potential rally to the $0.6 psychological barrier. However, in case the buyers failed to do so, the XRP price could prolong its current consolidation phase for a few more days.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Vortex Indicator: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VI+ and VI- slope prevented a bearish crossover despite the increased bearishness in the market, indicating the overall sentiment among trades remains bullish.</span></li>

Top cryptocurrencies <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and <strong>Ethereum</strong> are likely to rebound from the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-crash-heres-why-bitcoin-ethereum-altcoins-are-falling-sharply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market crash</a> last week.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>US Bureau of Labor Statistics</strong>, the annual CPI inflation <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/BLS_gov/status/1668597838169645067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooled</a> to 4% in May from 4.9% in April and 5% in March. It is the lowest CPI inflation rate since March 2021. Meanwhile, core inflation also cooled to 5.3% from 5.5%.</p>

<p>Analysts believe the inflation in the US is set for historic drops over the next two months. Investors brace for the big week with key other events, including the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Federal Reserve’s</a> monetary policy decision, as well as interest rate decisions by the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, US treasury yields and the US dollar dip further ahead of key CPI data and Fed monetary policy decision, making crypto bullish.

<h2>Hinman Drew Consultation From ETH&#8217;s Vitalik</h2>
<p>Many crucial documents linked to Hinman documents and speech including Ripple&#8217;s Rule 56.1 statement finally being made available for public view. The document revealed that the SEC took a consultation from <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/vitalik-buterin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin</a> in the process leading to the controversial speech.</p>
<p>An extract from the document released states that, on May 31, 2018, opposition to the recommendation grew within the US SEC against including Ether with Bitcoin as examples of digital assets which are no longer a “security”.</p>
<p>However, on June 4, then SEC director, Hinman shared a draft of the speech with the commission division heads. The doc mentions that he stated that there is a call with Buterin later in that week in order to confirm the US SEC’s understanding of how the Ethereum Foundation operates. It added that this move would suggest that the draft did not reflect Hinman’s understanding of how Ether works. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP Lawsuit News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<h2>Office of General Counsel Didn&#8217;t Wanted To Add ETH</h2>
<p>It is important to note that the SEC&#8217;s Office of General Counsel (OGC) suggested deleting the draft’s language around ETH. The OGC was concerned about the difficulty it would have to face in taking a different position on Ether in the future.</p>

He said the Indian government ordered Twitter to block accounts and remove posts related to farmer&#8217;s protests, or else, the social media platform to face a shut down and raids of Twitter India employees&#8217; homes.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Indian Govt. Said We Will Shut Down Twitter&#8221;</h2>
<p>However, the Indian government completely denied these allegations, calling it an &#8220;outright lie.&#8221; According to the Indian government, Jack Dorsey and his Twitter team repeatedly violated Indian laws and failed to comply from 2020 to 2022. Misinformation and fake news on social media platforms like Twitter ignited violence during the protests.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO alleges that during the farmer protest Indian govt pressurized us(Twitter) and said we will shut down Twitter in India, raid the homes of your employees if you don’t listen to us. <a href="https://t.co/tnNYta5G20">pic.twitter.com/tnNYta5G20</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the time, Twitter didn&#8217;t comply with Indian laws. It is clear that all social media platforms are respected in India but they have to abide by the law of the land.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar slams Jack Dorsey, revealing no one was raided or sent to jail. Twitter operated normally and was never shut down. The social media platform only complied in June 2022 after similar events happened in the U.S.</p>
<p>Twitter restored blocked accounts after a few hours, claiming block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists, and politicians violates their fundamental right to free expression.</p>
<h2>Freedom of Speech on Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter under Elon Musk aims to promote and protect free speech and the rights of people. Elon Musk said Twitter can&#8217;t uphold freedom of speech in India. On Monday, Twitter&#8217;s new CEO Linda Yaccarino made her first public comment, laying out her focus on freedom of speech.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter is on a mission to become the world’s most accurate real-time information source and a global town square for communication. That&#39;s not an empty promise. </p>
<p>That’s OUR reality.</p>
<p>&mdash; Linda Yaccarino (@lindayacc) <a href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1668300598528339968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, Twitter has taken some crucial steps to ensure privacy and content moderation. Twitter under Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey is completely different. Jack Dorsey&#8217;s allegations have caused a debate on freedom of speech in India.</p>

The upgrade name is changed to v2.1.1 from v2.1.0 after a few significant changes.</p>
<p>With the proposal now passed, the L1TF will upgrade the chain on June 14 to bring many significant changes to Terra Classic. Primarily, it will bring Terra Classic to parity with other blockchains such as Terra 2.0 and other Cosmos chains. Thus, allowing projects and developers to once again build on the Terra Classic chain.</p>
<p>It is one of the biggest upgrades since the Terra Classic community took charge of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> after the Terra-LUNA crisis in May last year.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community Officially Passes v2.1.1 Parity Upgrade Proposal</h2>
<p>Joint L1 Task Force project manager <strong>LuncBurnArmy </strong>announced June 14 as the official date of the <strong>CosmWasm parity upgrade</strong> and how the decision of <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-announces-official-date-of-parity-upgrade-lunc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delaying, testing, and preparing</a> for the groundbreaking upgrade was taken.</p>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://terraclassic.stakebin.io/terra/tools" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">countdown timer</a>, the Terra Classic will undergo the v2.1.1 software upgrade at block height <strong>13215800</strong>, expected at 14:00 UTC on June 14. The block height and time of upgrade are subject to change.</p>
<p>Nodes and validators are required to install the v2.1.1 release before the upgrade. Dapps and smart contracts providers can reach out to developers <strong>Fragwuerdig</strong> and <strong>The Vinh Nguyen</strong> for assistance on the upgrade and migration. Projects with ‘sealed’ smart contracts must also contract L1TF or its developers.</p>
<p>The v2.1.1 upgrade mainly contains features including minimum 5% commission for validators, CosmWasm v1.1.x, and two security updates. Other changes include WasmVM upgrade to v1.1.2, Wasmd upgrade for multichain capability, IBC go v4.3.1, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>The team successfully completed testing for v2.1.0 on rebel-2 testnet, Bajor-1 smart contract, Cosmwasm v1.1.0, and 5% minimum commission.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-terra-classic-officially-releases-its-biggest-v2-1-0-parity-upgrade-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinGape Media also detailed</a> why the Parity upgrade is crucial for professor Edward Kim&#8217;s AI app chain<strong> &#8220;Block Entropy.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proposal 11561</strong> &#8220;Upgrade to v2.1.0&#8221; received 99.99% votes in favor, while only 0.01% &#8220;No&#8221; votes. The proposal received almost zero “Abstain” and “No with veto” votes. Many validators including Allnodes, Orion, Coinpayu, Interstake One, StakeBin, and other top validators voted to support the proposal.</p>

This surge comes at a time when FLOKI has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/RealFlokiInu/status/1668204706932350977?s=20">unveiled</a> exciting plans for the future, including the launch of a crypto education platform.</p>
<h2>FLOKI New Developments</h2>
<p>FLOKI made waves in the crypto community with its recent tweet, announcing its intentions to release a crypto education platform. The platform, known as the University Of Floki, aims to cater to the rapidly growing crypto user base projected to reach one billion by 2025. This initiative demonstrates FLOKI&#8217;s commitment to accelerating utility and awareness for its native token, $FLOKI, and its broader ecosystem</p>
<p>Another factor contributing to FLOKI&#8217;s recent surge is the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1668504417300283392?s=20">addition of new trading pairs</a> on the Crypto.com App. This development opens up opportunities for investors to trade FLOKI alongside other popular cryptocurrencies, including RDNT, ACH, DAR, and ZRX. The availability of these trading pairs enhances liquidity and accessibility, potentially attracting more traders and investors to the FLOKI ecosystem.</p>
<p>Floki Inu has recently unveiled a strategic partnership with Binance Pay, even Binance.US which is under scrutiny also <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-us-adds-shiba-inu-doge-and-floki-gifting-options/">allowed FLOKI in its gifting options.</a></p>

<h3>Price Movement Analysis</h3>
<p>To put FLOKI&#8217;s recent performance into perspective, let&#8217;s compare it to the price movements of its rival, Shiba Inu. On <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/">CoinMarketCap</a>, Shiba Inu currently stands at a price of $0.00006732, with a modest increase of 0.12% in the past hour and 2.77% over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>In contrast, FLOKI boasts a price of $0.0002278, exhibiting a more impressive 2.29% increase in the past hour and a remarkable 8.00% surge over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>FLOKI currently lags behind Shiba Inu&#8217;s price by approximately 66%. As the market continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how FLOKI and Shiba Inu, along with other emerging players, compete and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrencies.</p>

In a video shared widely across social media, the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Gary Gensler says that the two most prominent cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are not securities.</p>
<h2>Evaluating Ethereum Price Profitability This Week</h2>
<p>Ethereum, like many of its peers, started the week while consolidating losses after a gruesome week in the wake of the intensified crackdown on the crypto market by the US SEC. As <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-defies-us-sec-bitcoin-ethereum-and-coinbase-coin-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase, Binance</a>, and the foundations of selected cryptos like ADA, SOL, and MATIC start their respective legal battles, investors may want to know how to adjust their crypto portfolios.</p>
<figure id="attachment_151558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151558" style="width: 1142px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/13130343/ETHUSD_2023-06-13_10-13-39.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-151558" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/13130343/ETHUSD_2023-06-13_10-13-39.png" alt="Ethereum price prediction" width="1142" height="597" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-151558" class="wp-caption-text">ETH/USD four-hour chart | Source Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, Ethereum price must first deal with resistance at $1,760 to close the gap to $1,800. On the bright side, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator dons a vivid buy signal.</p>
<blockquote><p>Traders eyeing new long positions in <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum price</a> would be encouraged to activate their orders as long as the MACD line in blue holds above the signal line in red.</p></blockquote>
<p>Insights from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment suggest that the crypto market could start to rise, now that the <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-us-hires-former-sec-director-in-defence-to-fraud-and-manipulation-charges/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dust lifted by the SEC going after Binance and Coinbase has settled</a>. The rebound is expected to continue “until the next development with the lawsuits.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f468-200d-2696-fe0f.png" alt="👨‍⚖️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> With traders still very much aware of the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#SEC</a> going after <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Binance</a> and <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Coinbase?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Coinbase</a>, the mass hysteria has at least settled down. Until the next developments with the lawsuits, we could see some gradual rising of prices back to pre-crash levels. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://t.co/Za7tchgeUx" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/Za7tchgeUx</a> <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://t.co/BSZEHrjQNP" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/BSZEHrjQNP</a></p>

<p>Moreover, most altcoins experienced extreme capitulation last week, leaving many traders and investors in losses. The sharp price drop will likely trigger increased accumulation among whales. If this accumulation trend continues, “there is reason to believe a strong rebound can occur,” <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1667785187172966401" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Santiment states</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Old Video Shows Gary Gensler Declare, $BTC And $ETH Are Not Securities</strong></h2>
<p>According to a related report by Cointelegraph, back then, Gary Gensler held a faculty position at the esteemed Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The footage dates back nearly two years prior to his eventual ascension to the Chair of the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-lawsuit-sec-hinman-docs/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>.</p>
<p>In a stark juxtaposition to his previous stance, Gensler’s subsequent actions at the SEC paint a different picture. The recent months have witnessed the regulatory body plunge into a wave of enforcement initiatives within the cryptosphere.</p>
<p>Last week, Gensler listed 68 cryptos as securities, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) in the most recent lawsuits. Moreover, the regulatory chair once declared that all cryptocurrencies apart from <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-at-a-crossroads-despite-bear-market-stability-us-sec-triggers-altcoins-uncertainty/?utm_source=24hrsupdatebitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin are securities</a>, which contradicts his statement in the 2018 video.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>“Bitcoin. Ether. Litecoin. Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They’re not securities.”</p>
