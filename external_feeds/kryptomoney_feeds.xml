<p>According to a new emergency motion filed in federal court, Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/skye_witley/status/1608235756597936128?s=46&amp;t=SohrjdvHf-psfQMCvj9pow">clients</a> are refusing to release their account information, stalling progress toward moving their claim to arbitration. A recent application in federal court indicated that the plaintiffs would provide the required information in exchange for a protective order.<br /><br />A recent application in federal court indicated that the plaintiffs would provide the required information in exchange for a protective order.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-reveals-over-33000000000-worth-of-bitcoin-in-its-reserves/">Coinbase</a> objected to the agreement and sought a provision in the protective order that would allow the firm to seek arbitration for the dispute.<br /><br />Coinbase was unable to reconcile consumers to their separate arbitration agreements while this issue was still being resolved. Coinbase requested a hearing in response to the latest emergency motion.<br /><br />The lawsuit claims that Coinbase failed to secure its users&#8217; accounts, leaving them vulnerable to theft and unlawful transfers. It also accused Coinbase of causing financial harm to users by locking them out of their accounts, either permanently or temporarily, as well as failing to comply with federal requirements by listing securities on its trading platform.<br /><br />The dispute has laid bare previously unknown vulnerabilities with cryptocurrency firms&#8217; inadequate cybersecurity practices. The crypto exchange has previously filed various arbitration cases with the United States Supreme Court.</p>

<li>Expectations abound for a possible crypto recovery in 2023</li>
<li>At the time of writing, Tezos (XTZ) is down 2.00% in 24 hours at $0.740</li>
<li>Binance US has announced that its customers will now be able to stake Tezos (XTZ) and earn up to 7% APY at inception</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/three-catalysts-that-might-propel-shib-in-2023-helium-migrating-to-solana-in-q1-next-year/">year 2022</a> is drawing to a close. Following a bearish year all around, expectations abound for a possible crypto recovery in 2023. At the time of writing, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xtz-price-analysis-striking-rally-holds-back-beneath-4-43-on-xtz-usd-tezos-q2-growth-remains-positive-on-etoro/">Tezos (XTZ)</a> is down 2.00% in 24 hours at $0.740. Binance US, a subsidiary of the Binance crypto exchange, has announced that its customers will now be able to stake Tezos (XTZ) and earn up to 7% APY at inception. Customers would now be able to buy, sell, convert, or stake XTZ in minutes on Binance US, a major staking provider. Also, advanced trading is available on the XTZ/USD, XTZ/BUSD, and XTZ/BTC pairs. XTZ is the native asset of the Tezos network. The token is required to participate in the blockchain’s proof of stake consensus mechanism, pay transaction fees, or participate in governance, and is also used as a unit of exchange across the network. While Tezos has a similar target audience as Ethereum, the network sets itself apart via its consensus mechanism and its self-amendment capabilities, which allow the network to implement major upgrades without the need for a hard fork. Like Ethereum, the Tezos network can be used to create a token, dApps, games, and NFT projects.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $2.00, $1.50, $1.00<br />Support Levels: $0.725, $0.45, $0.30</p>
<h4>XTZ/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63720 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">XTZ/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xtz-price-analysis-amid-crypto-market-slump-xtz-usd-upswings-to-3-07-on-tezos-kalamint-mainnet-launch/">XTZ/USD</a> declined as low as $0.726, suggesting that some selling occurred beneath the consolidative floor of $0.80. The RSI has yet to show any signs of improvement as it approaches 25. In the upcoming sessions, it&#8217;s important to pay special attention to how the moving averages are converging. It will be encouraging for the XTZ/USD pair if the MA 50 bearish stance wanes.<br /><br />However, if the price gains momentum and breaks through the convergent barrier of the MAs at approximately $1.0, early upside restrictions could develop from the $1.15 level before the $1.50 level, which marks the consolidation&#8217;s ceiling. XTZ&#8217;s price could move in the direction of the resistance band of $1.50-$2.00 if this barrier is broken. Otherwise, bears could test sellers’ efforts to steer XTZ&#8217;s price back lower.</p>
<h4>XTZ/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63721 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">XTZ/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>XTZ/USD 4-Hour chart might return to the upside on oversold RSI, where the price can try to reach the MA 50 at the $0.785 resistance zone, which if broken would pave the way for the $0.800 level. If investors choose to keep dumping off the asset below the current price at $0.739, support might then move in the direction of the $0.720 range before reaching the $0.700 level.<br /><br />However, near the MA 50, at the $0.785 level, a bullish reversal may find instant support. The $0.800-$0.850 range, marked by the most recent consolidation, could represent the next objective if these bears fail to swing lower. Overall, if positive price activity is unable to sustain an ascent past the moving averages, XTZ&#8217;s consolidation pattern might continue.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-to-step-down-from-his-official-role/">Kraken</a> will discontinue operations in Japan on January 31, just one month after laying off 30% of its employees. According to a <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/post/16923/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E6%9A%97%E5%8F%B7%E8%B3%87%E7%94%A3%E4%BA%A4%E6%8F%9B%E6%A5%AD%E3%81%AE%E5%BB%83%E6%AD%A2%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8A%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%89%E3%81%9B/">blog post</a> by the firm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Current market conditions in Japan in combination with a weak crypto market globally mean the resources needed to further grow our business in Japan aren’t justified at this time,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The decision is part of Kraken’s efforts to prioritize resources and investments in those areas that align with our strategy and will best position Kraken for long term success.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kraken has decided to leave Japan. The crypto exchange will suspend operations, one month after laying off 30% of its personnel. Kraken stated that it is fully funded and that all concerned clients can withdraw money as soon as possible. Users can withdraw their crypto assets to a third-party wallet or liquidate their funds and move them to a domestic bank account.</p>
<p><em>The firm disclosed:</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Funds currently staked with Kraken can be unstaked and transferred or converted as desired,&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;Kraken will soon be distributing additional info regarding the ETH unstaking process shortly.&#8221;</em><br /><br />From 2014 to 2018, the same subsidiary firm operated in Japan until withdrawing in April 2018 to better focus its resources on expansion in <em>&#8220;other geographical areas.&#8221;</em> Exchange volumes, like <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cryptocurrency-market-recoups-1-trillion-mark-as-btc-surpasses-24000/">cryptocurrency</a> values, have been declining since 2021.<br /><br />The subsidiary decided to relaunch with a headquarters in Tokyo in October 2020, offering spot trading on five key assets with intentions to expand. The second iteration has already concluded, with Kraken promising that all affected clients would be able to withdraw their cash from the exchange by January 31, 2023, at the latest.</p>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-8-k-12-28-2022.pdf">regulatory filing</a>, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy recently reported that it had acquired roughly 2,395 Bitcoins for a transaction price of approximately $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. This puts their total number of coins held at around 132,500, with a cumulative purchase price of nearly $4 billion and an average cost per coin of around $30,000.<br /><br />Notably, the corporation also sold 704 bitcoins on December 22 at a loss of around $11.8 million to receive a tax benefit. This is the company&#8217;s first Bitcoin transaction and it comes after former CEO Michael Saylor stated earlier this year that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/microstrategy-posts-3-4-billion-losses-on-btc-holdings-here-is-what-to-know-about-the-progress-of-doge-1-to-the-moon/">MicroStrategy</a> would never sell its stock.<br /><br />In August 2020, MicroStrategy began <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/microstrategy-bitcoin-never-sell-5-bln-crypto-stash-michael-saylor-2022-1">investing</a> in Bitcoin for the first time. MicroStrategy indicated at the time that it sees Bitcoin as a reliable store of value that is more suited to conserving wealth over time than cash and other financial alternatives. <br /><br />Furthermore, they believed that the continued development of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-altcoins-j-p-morgan-gives-an-indication-of-what-the-second-half-of-2022-might-hold-for-cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a> could generate larger returns than more traditional investments such as government bonds and stocks.<br /><br />Also regarded as a triumph, MicroStrategy suffered a massive failure with its large Bitcoin bet in 2022. The firm is now sitting on $1 billion in Bitcoin-related paper losses. Saylor, as previously reported, stepped down as CEO of the firm in August. Even though his gamble backfired, he remains a staunch supporter of Bitcoin.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-how-high-will-the-new-robinhood-listing-and-upcoming-vasil-fork-take-cardano-ada-price/">Cardano (ADA)</a> trades at $0.252, down 1.61% in the last 24 hours. On-chain analytics firm Messari has issued a study highlighting Cardano&#8217;s accomplishments in 2022. Cardano hosts nearly 8,000 NFT projects and 15 marketplaces, yet its monthly volume is only around $6.8 million. In the third quarter of 2022, JPG.Store attained over 90% of the market share. The top collection in space, SpaceBudz, has done over 40 million ADA in volume. In June 2022, IOG released the Cardano EVM Sidechain in alpha, allowing Solidity developers to quickly transfer apps into the Cardano ecosystem. Despite a late entry into the DeFi space, Cardano&#8217;s TVL is ranked 30th. Cardano&#8217;s expanding ecosystem comprises DEXs, lending and borrowing protocols, decentralized stablecoin providers, and any other necessary DeFi infrastructure. The DeFi ecosystem has Minswap, WingRiders, and SundaeSwap with 52%, 20%, and 19% of market share dominance, respectively. According to Santiment data, Cardano ranks as the foremost blockchain in terms of development activity in the last 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.385, $0.300, $0.275<br />Support Levels: $0.250, $0.200, $0.150</p>
<h4>ADA/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63706 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ADA/USD Daily Chart </span></em></h6>
<p>Following its continuous consolidation along the low of $0.25, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-cardano-touts-massive-on-chain-growth-in-2022-whats-next-for-ada-price/">ADA/USD</a> pair has struggled to raise bids above $0.275. The break below the psychological level of $0.30 led buyers to flee, exacerbating pessimistic sentiment. In the event of a rebound, the $0.275 and $0.30 levels have now been designated as new areas of resistance.<br /><br />On the daily chart, a bearish moving average (MA 50) and moving average (MA 200) are forming, implying that the downward acceleration may not recede at the moment. The pair is headed for lows in the $0.20 support area. A rebound may occur as a result of an oversold relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<h4>ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63707 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The relative strength index is almost oversold on the 4-hours chart, which may pique the curiosity of buyers. The projected comeback in ADA/USD, on the other hand, may give trend followers opportunities to sell into strength. ADA/USD remains bearish below $0.30, falling below the 4-hour moving average (MA 50).<br /><br />If the bulls want another shot, they must break through the $0.30 barrier. A drop below $0.25 would trigger a new round of selling below the December support level of $0.247. If the pair breaks down, it might continue to fall toward the $0.20 level.</p>

Among its significant achievements is the expansion of the XLM network in size and quality, the expansion of partnerships, particularly with MoneyGram, and the launch of new initiatives.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/ SDF CEO and Executive Director <a href="https://twitter.com/DenelleDixon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@denelledixon</a> wraps up 2022 by reporting on end-of-year metrics, milestone achievements, and more.</p>

<p>Recalling how Stellar arose as a decentralized open-source alternative to Ripple after one of its inventors, Jed McCaleb, became dissatisfied with the development route.<br /><br />The Stellar network is believed to have seen a 176% growth in the number of payments completed, reaching 345.9 million in total. The number of XLM accounts has also increased by 17%, reaching 7.37 million. To date, the Stellar protocol has handled 3.6 billion operations, an increase of 92% year on year.<br /><br />Stellar also introduced Soroban this year, a platform for generating smart contracts that are now live on the Futurenet testnet. The group also formed a $100 million investment fund at the same time as Soroban.<br /><br />The Stellar Development Foundation report also mentions the launch of MoneyGram Access in collaboration with the same-named payment business.<br /><br />Furthermore, the humanitarian service Stellar Aid Assist was developed with this solution, which is a global on/off-ramp, allowing those in need to get USDC swiftly and later cash it out.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-price-analysis-xrp-jumps-13-ripple-sees-backing-from-another-major-player-in-lawsuit/">XRP</a> was a top gainer among the top ten cryptocurrencies on December 26 as its price suddenly jumped 8%. At the time of publication, XRP was up 6.89% in the last 24 hours at $0.368. The cross-border token was likewise up 9% over the last seven days. According to the onchain analytics firm Santiment, millionaire XRP whales are rapidly filling their bags in preparation for the 2022 closure. It observes that XRP’s whale and shark addresses that make up the 1 million to 10 million XRP tier have been rapidly accumulating to end 2022. The onchain analytics firm noted that in December, both the number of these large addresses (1,617) and their percentage of supply held (7.23%) hit an all-time high. In other news, Matt Hamilton, Ex-Ripple developer, announced upcoming developments on XRP Ledger. He revealed that the blockchain will soon introduce smart contracts, which are currently in the &#8220;development process.&#8221; Likewise, SEC General Counsel Dan Berkovitz will depart the agency, effective January 31, 2023, with Megan Barbero, appointed subsequently.</p>

The price of the pair has increased to an intraday high of $0.3698 after falling to a low of $0.3324 on December 19. The rebound is being driven by a desire to hold onto recent gains. After the RSI retreated below its midlines, buyers saw the retracement as a chance to purchase the dip.<br /><br />Even the most positive analyst expectations haven&#8217;t been able to match XRP gains, which started the day around the $0.3457 mark. The daily chart&#8217;s bullish recovery suggests that the surge might be gaining momentum. When momentum returns, the next target would be above $0.3750 and the next high of $0.3923.</p>

<p>XRP price is within the short-term moving averages (MA 50 and MA 200), with a rise on the 4-hour chart becoming well-pronounced. The bears are now on the back foot despite the recent decline to a low of $0.3324. After the relative strength index showed overextension into the overbought zone, intraday traders look to book profit. The recent rebound may present a chance for the bulls to reorganize.<br /><br />A crucial level supporting the upswing is the demand region at $0.3510. The nearest barrier on the upside is found around $0.3750 before the moving average (MA 200). And if it is breached, a larger rally toward the high of $0.4000 may begin. A closure above the immediate resistance level of $0.3750 would indicate that the short-term trend is now ranging.</p>

<p>After a $72 million bailout offer from creditors, fears have been expressed regarding the overall sustainability of the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-more-than-18-million-btc-now-removed-from-exchanges/"> Bitcoin</a> trading community amid a lengthy bear market in light of Basic Scientific&#8217;s recent bankruptcy proceedings. To get out of their unsustainable high debt levels, it turns out that public Bitcoin users have obligations of about $4 billion.<br /><br />During the bull market of 2021, the Bitcoin mining industry racked up a huge debt load, which negatively impacted their financial situation during the ensuing bear market. According to predictive analytics by Hashrate Index, the top 10 crypto mining debtors collectively owe more than $2.6 billion.<br /><br />The largest debtor in the group, Core Scientific, has applied for Chapter 11 insolvency protection in Texas due to dropping sales and <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-is-at-bottom-of-current-cycle-as-large-scale-bitcoin-liquidations-end/">BTC prices</a>. As of September 30th, Core Scientific had $1.3 bn in commitments on its income statement. Marathon, the second-largest debtor, is the primary owner of the $851 million in convertible note liabilities. Marathon avoids bankruptcy by allowing the debtors to convert the convertible notes into equity.<br /><br />The bulk of Bitcoin miners is going through a restructuring process to pay off debt, including Greenidge, the third biggest debtor. Publicly listed bitcoin mining companies have a high debt-to-equity ratio, which points to a significant risk for the industry.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoins-hashrate-now-at-an-all-time-high/">Hashrate</a> Index indicates that most industries consider a debt-to-equity ratio of two or above to be risky. The graph below shows how some of the more well-known Bitcoin miners currently have exceptionally high debt-to-equity ratios. Given that more than 50% of the 25 publicly traded bitcoin miners display extraordinarily high debt-to-equity ratios, the mining industry may suffer possible restructurings as well as bankruptcy procedures unless the bulls mount a comeback.<br /><br />While some companies may stop or reduce operations to save money, this will allow sustainable miners to extend their footprint by acquiring the properties and machinery of competing businesses.<br /><br />The banking institution <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/nydig-survey-46-million-americans-hold-bitcoin/">NYDIG</a>, which focuses on Bitcoin, and Greenidge reached an agreement to restructure $74 million in debt on December 20.<br /><br />As per the conditions of the NYDIG deal, a mining capacity of 2.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) or more would be obtained. The mining company would receive a debt reduction worth between $57M and $68M in exchange.</p>

<p>The Japanese government approved a measure in June <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-03/japan-passes-stablecoin-bill-that-enshrines-investor-protection#xj4y7vzkg">recognizing</a> stablecoins as digital currency. As a result, Japan established one of the first significant legal frameworks for stablecoins.<br /><br />However, they had to be backed by the fiat yen of Japan or some other kind of legal money that permitted holders to use them at face value. However, the bill did not mention foreign <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stablecoins-were-knocked-off-their-pegs-due-to-crypto-volatility/">stablecoins</a> backed by assets like Tether.<br /><br />According to a recent development, the Japanese Financial Services Agency [FSA] may decide to lift the restriction on the circulation of stablecoins like Tether and USDC per a recent <a href="https://coinpost.jp/?p=419032">CoinsPaid</a> article in English.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In 2023, the Financial Services Agency will lift the ban on domestic distribution of stablecoins issued overseas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remittance cap will be set at 1 million yen ($7500) for each transaction, according to the newspaper.<br /><br />Issuers will need to gather collateral assets for domestically created stablecoins. Banks, trust corporations, and companies offering fund transfers are the only issuers allowed.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/japanese-fsa-cautious-about-crypto-based-etfs-cites-volatility/">FSA</a> will also require stablecoin distributors to record transaction information like user identities as a money laundering prevention tool. According to CoinsPaid, the agency will begin soliciting feedback on the proposed stablecoin criteria from January 26.<br /><br />Japan&#8217;s position on cryptocurrencies has significantly softened over time. The <em>&#8220;New Capitalism&#8221;</em> philosophy of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida aims to strengthen Japan&#8217;s economy. The nation just made public its entry into the NFT, Metaverse space. In parallel, the government is attempting to relax cryptocurrency tax laws.</p>
