<p>For millions of businesses and their employees globally, remote work is the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo;. Over the last three years, the migration to this working style has revealed numerous benefits on both sides, such as happier and more productive workforces, as well as employees who enjoy greater flexibility and the death of the commute. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not all rosy. The transition to remote work has created untold challenges for the cybersecurity industry, IT departments, and distributed teams, particularly regarding private and secure communications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With so much work now being done from home, co-working spaces, temporary accommodation, and caf&eacute;s, the line between personal and professional life has become increasingly blurred. With the same devices often being used for all digital work and leisure activities, it leaves individuals vulnerable to potential privacy breaches. The privacy landscape has evolved and mutated, with newer and uglier threats. Now, it is undeniably more important than ever to prioritize individual sovereignty when maintaining privacy in order to mitigate the potential risks, such as cyberattacks, data breaches, and spying (employee surveillance) that are associated with remote work.</p>
<p>One of the most significant video communication breaches in recent times was the Zoom security incident in 2020. The incident involved unauthorized access to Zoom meetings and the stealing of user credentials. Another notable breach was the Microsoft Teams breach in 2021, where hackers could gain access to user accounts via a single sign-on (SSO) system.</p>
Insight &amp; Guidance on Personal Privacy for Remote Workers
<p>Maintaining privacy and security while working remotely, whether in your own country or abroad as a Digital Nomad (as they are commonly referred to), requires a great deal of awareness and practical strategies to combat malicious digital entities. You need to think about three things: your data, your communications, and your activities. These are the three most poignant areas that leave you exposed, especially in a remote work environment where you are theoretically changing wi-fi networks more frequently (if using caf&eacute;s, temporary accommodation, and co-working spaces).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how can you effectively navigate the privacy landscape? It all starts with self-awareness and understanding the privacy risks and potential threats. Once you understand the risks, you&rsquo;re more likely to take actions to protect yourself, such as the use of end-to-end encryption tools. Apps such as Telegram or Signal for messaging, Relayz for video calls, and ProtonMail for emails are all leveraging end-to-end encryption to protect their users.</p>
<p>With the right knowledge and tools in place, you should next consider some of the low-hanging fruit for personal privacy and protection, such as strong passwords and two-factor authentication. These, typically used in tandem, can stop unwanted or unauthorized access to your accounts. You&rsquo;ll want to secure your home network too, keep any hardware or software up to date, make the password impossible to guess, and, depending on the nature of your work and activities, make use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) too. If you are constantly on the move as a nomadic remote worker, you might want to look at portable hardware for guaranteeing a secure internet connection, instead of trusting potentially harmful and compromised public wi-fi networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final piece of guidance seems like common sense, but in fact, it&rsquo;s the way that people most frequently get hacked or have their privacy compromised. Be cautious about what you share online. Personal details, your home address, bank account information, your passport or ID cards - they can all be used against you. Oversharing is one of the most common ways for your accounts and privacy to be compromised. Your social media accounts are a treasure trove of information.&nbsp;</p>
Ultimate Borderless Communications
<p>Remote workers, many of whom have the liberty to travel as they work, come to realize that they need borderless solutions with end-to-end encryption. This is especially true for video communications, due to the way in which video is now commonly used by distributed teams to keep in touch regarding work and projects. Video calls have become particularly vulnerable to privacy breaches, with the major comms providers simply not doing enough to guarantee user safety. Fortunately, Relayz uses end-to-end encryption to prioritize privacy, security, and user experience in its communications solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relayz is a decentralized communication platform designed for the Web3 era, offering hyper-secure and privacy-preserving video conferencing for the masses. Built on blockchain technology, Relayz delivers quantum-resistant end-to-end encryption and industry-leading HD video quality, all wrapped up in a user-friendly interface. Relayz was created by a team of industry experts and developers who recognized the shortcomings of traditional video communication products and developed a blockchain-based rival technology that overcomes them.</p>
<p>For remote workers and digital nomads, Relayz appears to provide the privacy, security, and convenience needed for confident and confidential communications. Conversations and data are protected from potential privacy breaches, while user experience and interface are constantly being optimized for maximum usability. The video communications market has a new major player.</p>
Don&rsquo;t Panic, Simply Prioritize Privacy Solutions
<p>In an increasingly digital world, privacy and security are paramount, especially for the growing number of remote workers and digital nomads. By understanding the risks, utilizing best practices, and leveraging technology solutions like Relayz, it's possible to safeguard personal information and protect sensitive data from prying eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you're communicating with colleagues or conducting business on the go, secure end-to-end encrypted video calls, secure wi-fi networks, and strong passwords should be a fundamental part of your work toolkit. So, the question remains: are you doing enough to protect your privacy as a remote worker? As the world of work continues to evolve, it's up to each individual to take responsibility for their own privacy and security, to ensure they can work confidently and securely, no matter where they are.</p>
