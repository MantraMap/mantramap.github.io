Hamburg-based Berenberg Capital Markets recently highlighted the upcoming Bitcoin halving event as a potential trigger for the bullish case of Microstrategy, a United States-based software firm, in a recent research note. The research note emphasized that Microstrategy, with a bullish price target of $430, primarily derives its value from its substantial holdings of over 150,000 BTC. And Berenberg expects the historical trend of Bitcoin rallying after each halving to repeat. Halving Events And Bitcoin&#8217;s Market Impact Halving events are significant occurrences in the Bitcoin network that happen approximately every four years. During these events, the rate of new coin issuance is reduced by 50%, resulting in a slower influx of new Bitcoins into the market. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 26, 2024, is expected to follow this pattern.

If this rally follows a similar trajectory to previous halvings. It could persist until approximately October 2025, according to the research note. Berenberg noted: If the historical pattern established by the first three Bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now. If a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025. Correlation Between Bitcoin And Microstrategy&#8217;s Stock According to the research note, there is a strong correlation between Microstrategy&#8217;s stock price and the price of Bitcoin, estimated to be around 0.90. If the fourth bitcoin halving triggers a significant rally in the price of the cryptocurrency, it is likely that Microstrategy&#8217;s stock will follow suit. This forecast is due to the positive outlook for Bitcoin&#8217;s post-halving performance contributing to the anticipation of a potential rally in Microstrategy&#8217;s stock price. Following the release of Berenberg&#8217;s research note, Microstrategy&#8217;s stock, with the ticker symbol MSTR, has already witnessed a notable surge of 7% in the past day. The stock, which was trading below its current price range in the previous month, is now valued at $407. The market&#8217;s positive response reflects the optimism surrounding the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event on Microstrategy&#8217;s performance. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the concept of halving has since been associated with significant market movements in the past. And investors closely monitor these events for potential opportunities.
