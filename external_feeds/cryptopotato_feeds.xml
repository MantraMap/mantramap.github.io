			            <description><![CDATA[SEC chair Gary Gensler has spoken out for the first time since Ripple‚Äôs landmark partial victory against the regulator last week, and he‚Äôs not happy.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 17, Gary Gensler said he was ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù with the judge‚Äôs ruling that Ripple‚Äôs XRP token was not a security when it was sold to retail investors on exchanges.</p>
<p>The ruling was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-victory-over-sec-is-a-win-for-the-entire-crypto-space-says-brad-garlinghouse/" data-wpel-link="internal">celebrated</a> as good news for the wider crypto industry and retail investors, but Gensler doesn‚Äôt agree.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="üö®" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />BREAKING: <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@GaryGensler</a> addresses the <a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@Ripple</a> Summary Judgment decision for the first time since last week‚Äôs ruling:</p>
<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶And while we‚Äôre disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we&#8217;re still looking at it, and assessing that.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1680997005944934401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Crackdown on Crypto Will Continue</h2>
<p>However, Gensler said he was ‚Äúpleased‚Äù about the decision recognizing the ‚Äúprotection of institutional investors‚Äù before adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhile disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we‚Äôre still looking at it and assessing that opinion.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>The speech was stuttered, and Gensler appeared simply lost for words at times. The fragmented comments came at an event at the National Press Club on July 17.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he added that the war on crypto will continue despite this loss.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to continue to try to bring firms that may not be in compliance into compliance ‚Äî without prejudging any one of them ‚Äî and try to ensure that we protect the investing public,‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>The ruling that XRP sales to retail traders did not constitute securities transactions is good news for other crypto assets that Gensler and crew alleged were investment contracts.</p>
<p>In 2020, the SEC accused Ripple of illegally raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities sale of XRP. However, Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP was not a security in the secondary market sale.</p>
<p>She said Ripple‚Äôs algorithmic sales system for XRP on exchanges and trading platforms was not a securities offering (which is similar to a stock offering). Buyers ‚Äúcould not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple,‚Äù she said.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Outlook</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">XRP prices</a> skyrocketed more than 80% late last week but have settled in the mid-$0.70 area. The token has lost 2.5% on the day, however, in a fall to $0.738 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>XRP hit its highest level since March 2022 but remains down 78% from its 2018 all-time high of $3.40.</p>
<p>The ruling also boosted several other crypto assets, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-stellar-lumens-price-rally-cools-off-but-ypredict-is-rising/" data-wpel-link="internal">Stellar Lumens</a> (XLM). All of these have also been <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-does-ripples-victory-over-sec-mean-for-sol-ada-and-other-alleged-security-tokens/" data-wpel-link="internal">labeled securities</a> by the SEC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin's Lightning Network enable faster, cheaper, and more scalable transactions by allowing users to create off-chain transaction channels.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Binance announced it has completed the integration of Bitcoin on the Lightning Network (LN).</p>
<p>The move will enable Binance users to leverage the scaling solution for Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. When depositing BTC, users will have the additional option of &#8220;BTC-Lightning&#8221; alongside the standard choices of Bitcoin, BEP20, SegWit, and others.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the latest <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-integration-of-bitcoin-btc-on-lightning-network-opens-deposits-and-withdrawals-eefbfae2c0ae472d9e1e36f1a30bf340?ref=AZTKZ9XS&amp;utm_source=BinanceTwitter&amp;utm_medium=GlobalSocial&amp;utm_campaign=GlobalSocial" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">integration</a>, Binance now stands alongside other prominent players such as Kraken, OKX, Bitfinex, and River Financial to adopt the layer 2 scaling solution.</li>
<li>Binance initially indicated its intention to integrate the Lightning Network in May, prompted by the temporary suspension of BTC withdrawals due to an influx of pending transactions <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-fees-explode-amid-brc-20-memecoin-mania-miners-benefit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">caused</a> by the significant <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/over-75-of-daily-bitcoin-on-chain-transactions-used-taproot-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">upsurge</a> in BTC network gas fees.</li>
<li>In June, the crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/keep-building-binance-starts-running-bitcoin-lightning-network-nodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">began</a> running multiple nodes on the Lightning Network in a bid to enable cheaper BTC deposits and withdrawals on its platform.</li>
<li>After a slow start, LN&#8217;s adoption was boosted by several notable partners, including the decentralized social media platform Nostr.</li>
<li>LN&#8217;s capacity surpassed an all-time high of 5,000 BTC earlier this year.</li>
<li>A recent <a href="https://valkyrieinvest.com/daily-market-brief/the-valkyrie-market-brief-02-06-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> by Valkyrie Investments stated that the adoption of the Lightning Network is rapidly gaining momentum in emerging markets such as South America and Africa, largely driven by the initiatives of the LN mobile payment application Strike.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the company behind LN &#8211; Lightning Labs &#8211; recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/lightning-labs-unveils-toolkit-to-enable-ai-transact-in-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">released</a> a new toolkit that assists AI applications such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT to interact with the Bitcoin network to send, receive, and hold the crypto-asset</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Akil Heywood has also purportedly threatened a bankruptcy trustee Rob Stelzer to force him to pay $2 million in digital currencies. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Canadian law enforcement agents have reportedly arrested the 39-year-old Akil Heywood over allegations that he kidnapped, threatened, and beat Aiden Pleterski in December 2022. The latter supposedly orchestrated a crypto scam, draining over $40 million from investors. Records show that Heywood invested $740,000 with Pleterski, making him one of the countless victims.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The alleged fraudster apologized in a recent video, vowing to &#8220;live on the bare minimum&#8221; to repay the conned investors.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Brutal Way to Get Revenge?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/investor-lost-money-among-5-men-charged-kidnapping-ontario-crypto-king-1.6907548" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†by CBC, Heywood is among the five people facing charges connected to the kidnapping and assault of the self-proclaimed &#8220;Crypto King&#8221; Aiden Pleterski at the end of last year. The former was supposedly one of the individuals lured into a cryptocurrency scheme run by the latter and served as an inspector in the case&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen a bankruptcy proceeding where an inspector is charged in a kidnapping and a forcible confinement related to recovering money in a bankruptcy,&#8221; said fraud recovery lawyer Norman Groot.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A spokesperson for Grant Thornton informed that Heywood resigned as an inspector on July 7. Apart from the alleged kidnapping, the 39-year-old Chairman of Atlantic Mas Camp supposedly threatened a bankruptcy trustee Rob Stelzer to induce him to pay $2 million in cryptocurrency (a sum much higher than the $740,000 he lost investing with the &#8220;Crypto King&#8221;). While the investigation is ongoing, the Canadian authorities have released Heywood on bail.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pleterski&#8217;s lawyer &#8211; Micheal Simaan &#8211; said his client &#8220;is grateful for the work of the Toronto Police in apprehending those involved in his kidnapping and assault.&#8221;¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that Pleterski warned about Heywood&#8217;s aggressive behavior two weeks before the abduction. He said during an interview that the accused kidnapper &#8220;is still, by the way, uttering threats, and very dangerous, violent threats, to me over Instagram comment sections and text messages.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The four other men accused of Pleterski&#8217;s kidnapping face additional charges, such as pointing a firearm at him. None of the claims have so far been tested in court.¬†</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">From a &#8216;Crypto King&#8217; to a Man Begging for Forgiveness</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Besides informing about the kidnapping and the related suspects, the media outlet <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2245735491709" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">published</a> a video showing how Pleterski regrets the losses he caused to the investors. The visibly beaten man explained that he started dealing with digital currencies in 2020, whereas, in the following months, he offered his services to family, friends, and other individuals.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And while the scheme worked perfectly during the crypto bull market, &#8220;everything went downhill&#8221; when prices started nosediving.¬†</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;When the crypto market started to tank in November of 2021, I should have been honest with everybody. I lost enough to where my debts outweighed my assets ‚Ä¶ I lost close to $45 million strictly alone in the crypto market within one month,&#8221; Pleterski said.¬†</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a bankruptcy report seen by CBC, the &#8220;Crypto King&#8221; used only $670,700 of the aforementioned sum as intended, whereas he spent approximately $16 million to fund his lavish lifestyle (going on vacations, renting private jets, and purchasing luxurious cars).¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pleterski admitted employing some investor deposits toward car payments, food expenses, and house settlements. He said he felt &#8220;very humiliated&#8221; and &#8220;embarrassed,&#8221; promising to work around the clock to reimburse victims:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do it before I go and buy myself another car before I go and buy myself another watch before I go and buy myself expensive clothing or anything. I&#8217;m going to live on the bare minimum until every last soul is paid back.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, Pleterski&#8217;s lawyer claimed that the information from the video should not be taken for granted as his client might have been forced to say those things by his kidnappers. Moreover, the alleged crypto scammer has insisted he is innocent.¬†</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Lens Protocol's latest version has introduced a blocking feature for its users. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aave Companies announced the launch of the second iteration of Lens Protocol on July 17th, designed to serve as a social layer for Web3. The new version aims to bring even greater control to builders and integrators as well as people exploring Web3-powered experiences.</p>
<p>The first version of Lens Protocol was purposely built and launched without a user interface. The V2, on the other hand, comes with a codebase that&#8217;s entirely rewritten, refactored, and optimized.</p>
<h2>Lens V2: Spotlight on Monetization</h2>
<p>The main goal of such a move is to allow easy composability and configurability that delivers an improved user experience, support new social use cases, and shared monetization opportunities that benefit all Web3 social networking stakeholders be it users, creatives, applications, and algorithms, not just individually but collectively as a ecosystem.</p>
<p>The monetization layer now expands to encompass all Web3 applications and profiles, creating opportunities among individuals, applications, algorithms, and protocols. Users, applications, and algorithms are now integral components of the monetization chain, allowing them to mutually reward and incentivize collaborative work, fostering the spirit of collaboration within web3.</p>
<p>Following the development, Stani Kulechov, Founder of Lens Protocol, commented,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Lens Protocol V2 takes decentralized social media and monetization opportunities to a new level. Providing maximum flexibility for builders, V2 enables new types of social engagements and monetization relationships, where all stakeholders can share in the value of social networks ‚Äì both individually and collectively as an ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Other Features</h2>
<p>In terms of new features, V2 will introduce &#8216;open actions&#8217; that seek to enable developers to deploy new activities on Lens, expanding the different ways that people can interact with content and creators in Web3. These actions can be integrated into both existing and future consumer-facing applications.</p>
<p>Lens Protocol V2 adopts an open model, rewarding valuable actions at each stage of the value chain to establish a sustainable ecosystem for content creators, applications, algorithms, and even external protocols.</p>
<p>The latest iteration has also implemented a new standard known as ERC-6551 for user profiles. This standard allows Lens profiles to possess their own wallets, housing ERC-721 tokens and other non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Consequently, ERC-6551-powered Lens profiles enable NFTs the capability to execute actions.</p>
<p>In a bid to ensure trust and security, V2 will let users block a profile from commenting, mirroring, collecting, or conducting any open action.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Major altcoins saw another strong correction as the global crypto market cap shrank by 0.5% over the past day. Solana plunged 4% over the past 24 hours, while Cardano fell close to 2% over the same period.</p>
<p>The crypto market is facing a choppy week ahead as the threat of an SEC appeal against the recent Ripple ruling becomes more likely.</p>
<p>Despite the bearish conditions, several tokens remain bullish due to their high utility. Launchpad XYZ is one such project that has recently surpassed the $1 million mark in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261052" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="307" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Solana and Cardano Plummet As Ripple‚Äôs Post-Win Enthusiasm Dampens</strong></h2>
<p>Ripple‚Äôs landmark win against the SEC provided a strong bullish boost to the entire crypto market.</p>
<p>In a watershed ruling, district judge Analisa Torres stated that Ripple‚Äôs programmatic sales of XRP tokens did not meet the criteria set by the Howey test and thus did not make the token a security.</p>
<p>The decision resulted in a close to 100% surge for XRP, with the token trading as high as $0.95 at one point &#8211; it has since corrected to $0.738.</p>
<p>The ruling also resulted in double-digit pumps in other major altcoins that have been labelled as securities in the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<p>Solana in particular reached its highest price mark since the disastrous FTX bankruptcy in November of last year. The token is currently trading at $26.9 and is up 30% over the past week, bringing its total gains to 70% over the last month.</p>

<p>Similarly, Cardano is also up 10% in the weekly time frame as the ADA token is trading at $0.31.</p>

<p>Cardano and Solana‚Äôs surge can be attributed to the widespread belief that Ripple‚Äôs victory will make it easier for other tokens to prove their non-security status. Expert crypto analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/thecryptolark/status/1679602044473311236?s=46" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lark Davis</a> believes that if XRP is not a security, then most other major altcoins aren‚Äôt as well.</p>
<p>However, several legal experts now believe that this celebration may have been premature. Both ConsenSys lawyer Bill Hughes and litigator Bryan Jacotout are of the opinion that the <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanjacoutot/status/1679539619312853028?s=46" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SEC will likely appeal the district court‚Äôs ruling</a>.</p>
<p>Other experts are also noting that the recent ruling did find that <a href="https://twitter.com/jvallee2000/status/1679978131908890626?s=46" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ripple violated the Securities Act</a> when they sold the tokens to institutional investors.</p>
<p>Even in the case of programmatic sales, Ripple won because Judge Torres factored in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-13/what-does-ripple-xrp-ruling-in-sec-case-mean-for-crypto" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lack of mainstream knowledge</a> of the crypto market in the early days of XRP. Several other newer tokens may not receive such a benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2><strong>Which Tokens Can Outperform The Crypto Market?</strong></h2>
<p>The crypto market remains in the doldrums, and an SEC appeal can result in strong downward pressure.</p>
<p>Investors are now looking for presale tokens that can display bullish price surges despite the bearish sentiment. Launchpad XYZ is emerging as a top contender it has raised over $1.1m and continues to rise.</p>
<h2><strong>New Web3 Portal Launchpad XYZ Turns Heads as Token Nears $1.5 Million</strong></h2>
<p>The crypto market is extremely volatile and can be overwhelming for newbies and natives alike. However, the <a href="https://bs_010f7b2f.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=solana-and-cardano-prices-slide-but-launchpad-xyz-raises-1-million" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ</a> ecosystem is offering a suite of powerful trading products that can help users combat the complexities of the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261055" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="359" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15-300x179.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Investors have been quick to recognize the project‚Äôs high real-world utility as it has already raised $1.1 million in the presale and is well on its way to hitting the $1.5 million mark.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ is carefully designed to help users succeed in crypto trading while also offering them maximum learning opportunities. For example, the Terminal Edge platform will help them gain valuable market insights with the help of sentiment analysis and the latest crypto news. Beginners can also get to know the trading setup of other expert traders.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Launchpad Quotient will make sure users do not miss out on the next big investment opportunity by ranking crypto assets across 400 data points.</p>
<p>The all-in-one Web3 portal also offers other tools such as its own Web3 wallet, premium NFT marketplace, a decentralized exchange, a sophisticated Terminal trading engine, etc.</p>
<p>The $LPX token is currently priced at $0.0445 but will surge significantly to $0.0565 at listing. Investors can purchase the token through bank cards or by swapping ETH or USDT tokens.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin investment products have pulled in $742 million in the past month.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investment products offering crypto exposure have surged in popularity since last month, attracting net inflows of $137 million over the last week alone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, trading volumes for such products have soared beyond their yearly average, totalling $2.3 billion last week.</p>
<h2>Investors Return to Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Per Coinshares‚Äô <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-140-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-9f970fceec21" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">weekly report</a>, inflows into digital asset investment products totalled $742 million over the past 4 weeks.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the greatest investment rush into the sector since Q4 2021 &#8211; when Bitcoin (BTC) tapped its all-time high of $69,000. Indeed, virtually all investment interest appears to be in Bitcoin specifically, which absorbed $140 million of inflows last week.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBitcoin saw inflows totalling US$140m, comprising 99% of all inflows,‚Äù read the report. ‚ÄúShort bitcoin investment products saw a 12th week of outflows of US$3.2m.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bitcoin has traded above $30,000 since last month after <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-can-transcend-the-dollar-and-other-currencies-blackrock-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock</a> ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest asset manager ‚Äì entered the race to list a Bitcoin spot ETF in the United States. The move not only signalled legitimacy for an oft-criticized asset class but gave investors hope that such a product might actually get approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Many investors are bullish that an ETF for Bitcoin could attract a wave of capital into the asset from investors unable or unwilling to purchase actual coins on an exchange. According to CoinShares, most capital going to crypto investment funds last week went to ProShares ETFs ‚Äì funds backed by crypto futures contracts, rather than real coins or tokens.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRegionally, the inflows were focussed almost solely on North America, with inflows of US$109m and US$28m in the US and Canada respectively,‚Äù the report stated. ‚ÄúWhile minor outflows were seen in Europe with the exception of minor inflows in Switzerland.‚Äù</p>
<p>Canada was the first country in the world to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF. Lawmakers in the region recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/canadian-lawmakers-publish-report-defending-and-supporting-crypto-coinbase-approves/" data-wpel-link="internal">published</a> a set of digital asset policy recommendations calling for the protection of the users‚Äô right to hold their own crypto.</p>
<h2>Altcoin Interest Still Flat</h2>
<p>While Ether (ETH) rose alongside Bitcoin since last month, institutional interest in the asset isn‚Äôt quite visible. In fact, the crypto suffered minor outflows of $2 million last week from digital asset funds, making it the asset with the most outflows year-to-date.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAltcoins, Solana, Polygon and Litecoin saw minor inflows of between US$0.5m, US$0.5m and US$.3m respectively,‚Äù the report added</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) suffered last month after the SEC alleged that both assets were unregistered securities in its lawsuit against Coinbase. However, a positive outcome for <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-surpasses-bitcoin-in-terms-of-trading-volume-following-ripple-v-sec-win/" data-wpel-link="internal">XRP</a> in Ripple‚Äôs lawsuit with the SEC last week has such coins making a comeback.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[ZachXBT has exposed another remorseless crypto and NFT scammer and is sharing information with victims to take possible legal action against the culprit.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular on-chain sleuth ZachXBT has unmasked another crypto scammer responsible for stealing millions of dollars in digital assets using sophisticated phishing attacks.</p>
<p>The thief‚Äôs targets included the discord services for DeFi projects such as Orbiter Finance and Pika Protocol.</p>
<h2>Impersonation and Confiscation</h2>
<p>In a Twitter thread <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1680918931442368515" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">published</a> on Monday, ZachXBT explained that the attacker, Soup (aka Dan) enacted his scam by impersonating Luke Hamlton ‚Äì an employee for the crypto media outlet Decrypt.</p>
<p>In collaboration with other Scammers, Soup lured members of various crypto project teams into joining a fake Decrypt Discord server. He then tricked them into submitting KYC information as part of a fake application and interview process, only to later embed phishing attack in an ‚Äúelaborate attempt to steal their Discord token.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ Soup creates fake <a href="https://twitter.com/decryptmedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@decryptmedia</a> websites and poses as Luke Hamilton (a real Decrypt employee)</p>
<p>He works with other scammers to approach team members of crypto projects to trick them into joining a fake Decrypt Discord server in an elaborate attempt to steal their Discord token <a href="https://t.co/Oe6mX2zFk1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/Oe6mX2zFk1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1680918940019556353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A Discord token is an alphanumeric string acting representing a user‚Äôs login credentials, giving them access to any servers they own or are a part of.</p>
<p>The scammer compromised the Pika Protocol Discord server on May 30, 2023, posting a malicious link in the announcements channel, allowing them to <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2162b6caa174b90416090bd4a87e7d08f7027c48" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">steal</a> $220,000 in crypto. In a private DM, Dan admitted to receiving 15% of the scammers‚Äô profits.</p>
<p>The following day, the scammers attacked Orbiter Finance, using a malicious link to steal another $760,000. Soup confessed to receiving 30% of the stolen funds, of which 7.5 ETH was identified in one of his <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2162b6caa174b90416090bd4a87e7d08f7027c48" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">known addresses</a>.</p>
<p>Soup spent some of the proceeds from his crimes on exclusive five-figure Roblox items.</p>
<p>ZachXBT added that Soup was involved in the theft of Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC NFT #21080 last year. In collaboration with his scamming partner, Faint, the two minted a fake MAYC and offered to trade it to a victim for the real MAYC, which the victim <a href="https://twitter.com/LakeShowTJ/status/1571506608861249538" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">accepted</a>.</p>
<p>Soup also stole Cryptopunk #6983 in January of this year.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúSoup admits to having profited $1M himself while his partners have profited even more,‚Äù wrote ZachXBT. ‚ÄúHe seems to show little remorse for his actions after financially harming projects and people.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<h2>Connection to Blue</h2>
<p>ZachXBT was able to track down one of Soup‚Äôs addresses after the scammer accidentally revealed it when proving that the ENS address purplelobster.eth was controlled by Blue ‚Äì another scammer <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/youtuber-turned-nft-scammer-on-chain-sleuth-investigates-1-5-million-crypto-thief/" data-wpel-link="internal">exposed</a> by ZachXBT last week. Blue sent soup $25 worth of ETH at the time.</p>
<p>Blue, a former YouTuber turned NFT scammer, also had connections to Monkey Drainer, known for stealing over $24 million in digital collectibles and boasting about his thefts online. In some of his recent phishing attacks, Blue took, over $200,000 in crypto and NFTs from addresses yancy.eth and LoveMake.eth.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disgusting to see these phishing scammers show zero remorse and spend the funds on tasteless items,‚Äù said ZachXBT at the time.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto miners pivot to AI to ensure survival but challenges lie ahead. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous, making its presence felt across various sectors. Gradually infiltrating every aspect of human activity, this buzzword, although not entirely new, has captivated the minds of both seasoned tech gurus and novices alike.</p>
<p>The integration of the digital asset space and AI was inevitable. Industry players are actively exploring innovative approaches to integrate these two technologies. Hence, the pivot of crypto miners to this newfound tech darling is not surprising.</p>
<p>Miners have realized that AI-powered solutions hold the promise of addressing some of our most critical challenges. As we enter the next decade, it is abundantly clear that the digital future and AI are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>The ongoing AI boom is revitalizing the prospects of cryptocurrency miners, which have been reeling from the humbling market crash last year. This strategic shift has garnered its unique moniker: Mining 2.0</p>
<h2>Crypto Miners Riding the AI Wave</h2>
<p>Prominent players in the crypto mining industry are actively <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-says-artificial-intelligence-ai-is-a-mega-force-in-todays-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">seeking</a> greener pastures in the AI sector. One such is Hut8 which is expanding its horizon by venturing into non-mining services while simultaneously investing in high-performance data centers to cater to the growing demands of AI and computing requirements.</p>
<p>In a conversation with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, Hut8‚Äôs Erin Dermer said the company is ‚Äúuniquely qualified to deliver on AI clients‚Äô intensive workloads.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hut8 purchased five traditional high-performance computing data centers last year. Shortly thereafter, it moved some of its GPUs and supporting servers, previously mining Ethereum, into those data centers to perform VFX rendering and machine learning for its customers, primarily in the gaming and entertainment industries. Hut8 also revealed with clients, including XYZ AI, to deliver the computing power to support their text-to-graphic generative AI requirements.</p>
<p>Dermer said,</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWe are very excited by the promise of AI and have been providing the computing infrastructure to deliver these high-demand computing services for some time. While we are still in the early days of AI adoption, we believe that whether we are mining Bitcoin or providing high-performance computing services, the common thread is in the computing infrastructure, and Hut 8 is actively pursuing both lines of business.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>As lucrative as it seems, it&#8217;s important to note that AI and crypto mining have distinct sets of requirements.</p>
<p>While crypto mining primarily relies on powerful computational resources and specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical problems, that&#8217;s not the case with AI, which typically emphasizes data processing, machine learning algorithms, and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>Therefore, although both fields can be profitable, it&#8217;s crucial to recognize and address the unique demands and challenges associated with each, including the need for tailored infrastructure, expertise, and investment strategies.</p>
<p>According to Bitcoin miner Xive‚Äôs CEO and co-founder, Didar Bekbauov, &#8220;only altcoin miners can switch to AI computations now&#8221; because they use GPUs &#8211; which not only help in crypto mining but can also be used for the computational workloads needed to train generative AI systems.</p>
<p>While speaking with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, Bekbauov shed some light on the subject and said,</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúAlmost 99% of all crypto mining is Bitcoin mining, where we use application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners. They can‚Äôt be used for any other purpose, only mining Bitcoin. However, the technology behind data center construction and management both for crypto mining and AI are the same. So any large-scale miner potentially can build a data center for AI operations.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>The real challenge, however, is to determine the demand for computing power, Bekbauov explained.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWith Bitcoin mining, it‚Äôs easy, because all mined coins can be sold on exchanges whenever miners have needs. But with AI computing you need to find buyers of computing power to generate revenue, which can be hard.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>The Xive executive further added that Bitcoin miners can diversify their strategy by building out large facilities for AI data centers since miners already have experience in &#8220;connecting all the dots&#8221; in terms of &#8220;finding electricity capacities, building electrical and cooling infrastructure, supplying GPUs, maintaining data centers, etc.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Opportunity</h2>
<p>Bekbauov highlighted the opportunity for miners to participate in the global need for computational power, which, according to the exec, has emerged as the world&#8217;s most important resource in the information age. The Xive co-founder, however, said the industry requires more transparency in terms of needs from AI companies, who can be perfect customers for data centers.</p>
<p>While the software side of AI is progressing faster on the front, the same can‚Äôt be said for the hardware side of things, which cannot catch up with the pace of AI developments.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúUsers need to wait from 5 minutes to a couple of days to get their responses for prompts, especially with pictures and videos. Number of users is growing exponentially. But we can‚Äôt say the same for hardware which is used for supplying computing power to work on all of the demand.‚Äù</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has exhibited significant volatility recently, surpassing its previous minor swing high while simultaneously encountering substantial rejection. Nonetheless, the price is approaching a crucial area, with the overall price action signalling a bearish outlook.</p>
<h1>Technical Analysis</h1>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>A thorough analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s daily chart reveals the formation of an evident bearish double-top pattern near the major resistance region of $30K. Additionally, the price is facing significant dynamic resistance from the middle-trendline of the ascending channel. It is worth noting that this robust dynamic level has been hindering further price appreciation for several months.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a noticeable divergence between the price and the RSI indicator indicates a shift in the market condition from an uptrend state to a possible downtrend. In case the selling pressure dominates the market, Bitcoin&#8217;s next target would be the 100-day moving average situated around the $28K level.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it seems likely that a rejection from the substantial resistance at $30K is imminent based on Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price action.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>The 4-hour chart demonstrates that Bitcoin&#8217;s price has entered an extended consolidation range following its arrival at the important price zone of $30K. Notably, this critical price range aligns with Bitcoin&#8217;s previous significant swing high, developed on April 14th, which has served as strong resistance due to increased supply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the price has formed an ascending wedge pattern, typically indicating a potential reversal. Most recently, the price experienced a sharp surge, reaching the upper boundary of the wedge, only to face rejection and undergo a rapid decline. However, a break below the lower edge of the wedge suggests the possibility of a mid-term reversal.</p>
<p>Ultimately, in the event of a rejection, Bitcoin&#8217;s next target would be the static support region around $28K.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been volatile, especially after a significant upward surge that brought it close to the crucial resistance level of $30K. This surge has sparked substantial speculation regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to successfully break through this resistance barrier. It is advisable to closely examine the futures market to gain valuable insights into the overall market sentiment.</p>
<p>The provided chart illustrates the Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio, which serves as an essential indicator of the intensity of long and short positions.</p>
<p>Lately, this particular metric has been fluctuating consistently below 1, following a sharp decline. However, there have been no signs of recovery thus far. This signifies that futures traders predominantly maintain a pessimistic outlook on Bitcoin, with their short positions potentially pushing downward pressure on the price in the short term.</p>
