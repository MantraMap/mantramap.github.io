Google Bard Estimates that Tradecurve Can Explode in Value
<p>Amidst this market rally, alongside Litecoin and Chainlink, another cryptocurrency grabbed attention from the market and grew by 80% since its beginning its Tradecurve, in the last week alone, it went up in value by 20%. Now, at Stage 4 of its presale, Tradecurve trades at $0.018, and at Stage 5 next week, it will climb by 40% to $0.025.</p>
<p>This growth has been fueled due to the array of unique features and the promising roadmap it has. What helps Tradecurve stand out from competitors such as Binance and Kraken, according to Google Bard, is that it will not require any sign-up KYC checks, which will make it inclusive for anyone from anywhere in the world. KYC procedures can be time-consuming and can involve manual verification, delaying the account creation process and removing anonymity completely.</p>
<p>Google Bard also noted how users can trade immediately just by making a deposit in crypto, which will be used as collateral on top of the platform. This fact, combined with the privacy provided by Tradecurve, will make it the most desirable trading platform for those who are conscious about their information and want to avoid it getting leaked from platforms that are heavily centralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other features behind Tradecurve that can help it grow in value, according to Google Bard, include high leverage starting at 500:1, a VIP account system, negative balance protection, and the implementation of Proof of Reserves (PoR) alongside Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as a security measurement.</p>
<p>So far, the team has raised $2.8 million, and 12,500 users have signed up. The team predicts that they will be able to raise $20 million and that they can onboard 100,000 users during the first three months of operation. According to Google Bard, due to all of these aspects, Tradecurve can climb to $1.8 by the end of Q4 2023.</p>
