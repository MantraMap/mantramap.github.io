					<description><![CDATA[Recent data from CryptoQuant on August 7 shows that few Bitcoin holders are moving coins away from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Despite BTC prices increasing in recent weeks and teetering close to the $30,000 psychological level, this observation is accurate.  More Bitcoin Held in Exchanges As of July 28, there were 30,663 addresses withdrawing coins from exchanges though prices were relatively higher, trading around $28,000, up from around $25,000 registered on June 14 when 39,311 addresses moved coins. On April 14, when BTC changed hands at around $30,000, 132,237 addresses withdrew the coin from exchanges. The drop in the number of exchange addresses moving coins to external, often non-custodial wallets can be a concern, significantly if prices are rising.  The shift also raises important questions about why more Bitcoin holders opt to store coins in exchanges despite these ramps being targets by hackers. Usually, when fewer people transfer their Bitcoin to external, often non-custodial wallets, it might mean they&#8217;re unsure about the uptrend. As such, they keep their coins on exchanges to quickly sell for USDT or traditional currencies like USD or Euro if needed.  Optimism Abound Even with this change, the broader Bitcoin community remains positive about the coin&#8217;s potential in the coming months. This optimism comes partly from recent classifications from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) that expressly endorse Bitcoin as a commodity subject to capital gains tax.  Related Reading: Solana Products See Strong Inflows, Bitcoin And Crypto Lose $107 Million Other digital assets like ETH have not been categorized as such, sowing doubts among some Ethereum holders that US regulators can classify the second most valuable coin as a security. Because of this positive outlook on the world&#8217;s most valuable coin, advanced derivatives, like BlackRock&#8217;s planned launch (if approved) of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), are being developed. Complex Bitcoin trading products are already live in Canada and other parts of the world. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts say that the odds of a Bitcoin ETF getting approved by the SEC are 65%. The increase is partly due to bullish progress, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s comments on Bitcoin, the regulator&#8217;s reportedly insisting that BTC is the only commodity before Coinbase was sued, and the agency accepting re-filing from BlackRock&#8217;s ETF.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has been no stranger to dramatic price swings in the volatile cryptocurrency world. As September approaches, market analysts closely monitor BTC&#8217;s possibility of plunging below the $25,000 mark.  However, history has shown that September&#8217;s struggles often pave the way for a resurgence in October, with massive rallies that rekindle investor optimism.  Potential For BTC To Drop Below $25,000 Before A Promising October When examining Bitcoin&#8217;s historical performance during September, it becomes evident that the month has posed challenges for the world&#8217;s most renowned cryptocurrency.  Related Reading: BREAKING: Did Solana Miss A Golden Opportunity To Collaborate With PayPal’s PYUSD Stablecoin? Previous September has witnessed BTC experiencing declines of up to 13%. This downward trend has undoubtedly concerned traders and investors, raising questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum. According to Timothy Peterson, market analyst and investment Manager, based on current market analysis, there is a 50% probability that Bitcoin&#8217;s price will dip below the $25,000 threshold before September concludes.  While a potential drop below $25,000 might cause temporary unease among Bitcoin enthusiasts, historical patterns suggest that October could be the month to look forward to.  In the past, September&#8217;s price declines have often catalyzed significant rallies in the subsequent month. Observing the heatmap above, Peterson identified instances where Bitcoin rebounded with gains as high as 48% following sharp declines in September. If Bitcoin does indeed experience a dip below $25,000 in September, it may mark the final significant correction before the commencement of a new bull run cycle.  On this note, Peterson believes that such a dip, coupled with the subsequent recovery and October&#8217;s potential rally, could set the stage for substantial gains in the coming months. Bitcoin Bullish Divergence As BTC experienced a drop from $32,000 to $29,000, trader Ali Martinez highlighted a significant trend; the number of new Bitcoin addresses continued to rise steadily.  Related Reading: Ripple Is Now A Member Of Trade Organization That Hosts The Likes Of BlackRock This intriguing divergence between price and network growth provides insights into BTC&#8217;s potentially stable long-term uptrend.  While Bitcoin&#8217;s price exhibited a downward trajectory, the number of newly created Bitcoin addresses has consistently grown.  This divergence is noteworthy, suggesting that despite short-term price fluctuations, the network&#8217;s expansion remains robust. It signifies a growing interest in Bitcoin adoption and usage, which, in turn, supports the notion of a stable and sustainable long-term uptrend. Conversely, Bitcoin remains trapped within a price range of $29,200 and $28,900, a pattern that has persisted since the start of August. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $28,960, reflecting a 0.5% decrease in the last 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Yield Guild Games (YGG) token recently surged, rising by 580% in less than a week before crashing, as visible in the daily chart. YGG is currently changing hands at $0.37 with a market capitalization of over $101 million when writing on August 7.  Prices have since retraced from the $0.99 recorded earlier today as the token fell by over 60%. The recent spike and general volatility have seen trading volumes soar as trading activity is concentrated on Binance and KuCoin. YGG Whales Dumping Amidst the notable growth, there are reports of venture capital (VC) companies that initially backed the project, backing off and reportedly selling the token primarily on Binance. For instance, Lookonchain data on August 7 shows that Bitkraft Ventures and DWF Labs have moved their YGG to Binance and will likely sell.  Last year, DWF Labs received 29.13 million YGG from Yield Guild Games Treasury. However, on-chain data shows that most of these tokens have since been moved to exchanges.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees 10% Pullback, But Here’s Why Rally Can Still Continue Bitkraft used Wintermute and FalconX to move coins to Binance. Trackers show that the official Wintermute Trading wallet has deposited 11.1 million YGG to exchanges over the past four days. The crypto market maker still holds 2.5 million YGG.  Youbi Capital has also deposited 1 million YGG to Binance. Currently, it holds 11.6 million YGG. Sfermion is also joining the selling bandwagon, which initially claimed 1.2 million YGG. It used FalconX, a provider serving crypto whales, to deposit the token to Binance. Partnership With Axie Infinity Developer Yield Guild Games is a gaming guild primarily focusing on play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain games. As a community, the platform uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and has created a collaborative network of players and investors to navigate NFT gaming.  In mid-July, YGG partnered with Axie Infinity&#8217;s developer to release SUPERQUESTS. The feature, Yield Guild Games said, aims to enable guild members to engage in web3 games and earn enhanced in-game rewards. They added that this initiative was a significant step towards improving the web3 gaming experience for members.   Related Reading: Ripple Is Now A Member Of Trade Organization That Hosts The Likes Of BlackRock Over the months, NFT, metaverse, and blockchain gaming activity have rapidly contracted as token asset prices fell throughout 2022.

<p>In mid-July, YGG <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://medium.com/yield-guild-games/ygg-launches-first-superquest-with-axie-infinity-8425b3911a02" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">partnered</a> with Axie Infinity&#8217;s developer to release SUPERQUESTS. The feature, Yield Guild Games said, aims to enable guild members to engage in web3 games and earn enhanced in-game rewards. They added that this initiative was a significant step towards improving the web3 gaming experience for members.  </p>

<p>Over the months, NFT, metaverse, and blockchain gaming activity have rapidly contracted as token asset prices fell throughout 2022. Furthermore, fears of regulatory crackdown appear to be discouraging developers. In June, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cited AXS by Axie Infinity as an example of unregistered security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Litecoin hashrate has been going up steadily over the last year. This was mainly driven by the anticipation leading up to the Litecoin halving that was slated to take place in August. Now that the halving event has come and gone, the hashrate has risen to a new all-time high, but the question is, whether the price of LTC will follow suit. Litecoin Hashrate Taps New ATH Of 1.03 PH/s The steady rise in the Litecoin hashrate is a testament to the growing interest in the network. The hashrate points to the fact that there are more miners on the blockchain trying to guess the correct answers to each block. And this translates to better security overall for the Litecoin network. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Break Above $2,000 If This Happens Interestingly, this increase in hashrate has seen the network hit not only a new all-time high but a significant milestone. According to data from CoinWarz, the Litecoin hashrate rose as high as 1.03 pentahashes per second (PH/s) on August 4. This means that for the first time, LTC’s hashrate has left the terahashes per second (TH/s) territory and crossed into the pentahashes per second (PH/s) territory. Although it is still a long way from Bitcoin’s exahashes per second (EH/s), it is a testament to how much the Litecoin network has grown. The Litecoin hashrate has since retraced back into the TH/s territory, now sitting at 739.88 TH/s as of Monday, August 7. But a look over the last year’s hashrate chart shows that even this is a high level for the blockchain’s hashrate. LTC hashrate remains high compared to 2022 &#124; Source: CoinWarz Will LTC’s Price Follow The Hashrate? Since the Litecoin hashrate hit its new all-time high, the price of LTC has been more volatile than normal. This is not out of the ordinary though as the altcoin has been following the general market trend and LTC’s is a testament to that trend. So far though, it doesn’t seem like LTC has made any effort to break out of this trend. If anything, it has suffered more declines than recoveries, even dipping to as low as $$80.65 on August 4. This decline shows that the new hashrate ATH has not moved investors to invest more in the coin.

Otherwise, LTC will likely continue to toe the $82 line for the better part of the week. At the time of writing, LTC price is trading at $82.80, down 0.47% in the last day and 11.67% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent development, Justin Sun, founder of popular blockchain Tron, has urged people to disregard speculations that the crypto exchange Huobi is facing severe challenges following news of the alleged detention of some of the platform&#8217;s officials.  The rumors appear to be a major contributing factor to why the firm experienced multi-million withdrawals during the weekend, while Tron’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has fallen below $2.5 billion.  Trouble In Paradise? Over the past weekend, cryptocurrency exchange Huobi experienced massive outflows worth about $64 million amid reports that Chinese authorities were investigating its executives and the likelihood of insolvency. There were speculations that the platform’s leaders were arrested on the 5th of August in China. According to popular Chinese reporter Colin Wu, the arrest was due to Huobi’s involvement with gambling websites. One top official of the exchange also recently left the company, though it remains unclear if that was connected to the ongoing investigations by Chinese authorities.

The rumors were so rife that the withdrawals triggered serious volatility in HT’s price and the token fluctuated during the weekend before settling at its present level of about $2.66. Furthermore, there are also rumors that the exchange is undergoing protracted financial challenges. According to Adam Cochran, an angel investor and fintech executive, there are some discrepancies in the platform’s Tether (USDT) holding.  Based on on-chain data, Huobi held less than $90 million of assets on the 5th of August.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows two Bitcoin indicators are currently retesting levels that have historically been relevant for the market&#8217;s course. Bitcoin NUPL For Both Short-Term &#38; Mid-Term Holders Is Neutral Currently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC NUPL has been retesting crucial levels recently. The &#8220;Net Unrealized Profit/Loss&#8221; (NUPL) is a metric that keeps track of the net amount of profit or loss that investors are holding currently. This indicator works by looking through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous transfer price for any coin was less than the current spot price of Bitcoin, then that particular coin is holding a profit right now. The NUPL counts this profit that the coin is holding in the unrealized profit. Similarly, the loss that underwater coins are holding gets included in the unrealized loss. The metric then takes the difference between these two numbers to find the net profit/loss status of the entire market. In the context of the current discussion, the entire market isn&#8217;t of interest, however, only specific sections of it are. In particular, two BTC cohorts called the &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs) and the &#8220;mid-term holders&#8221; (MTHs) are of relevance. The STHs include all investors who bought their coins within the last six months, while the MTHs are those who have been holding their coins since at least six months ago and at most 2 years ago. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL specifically for the STHs: Looks like the value of the metric has approached zero recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH NUPL has been positive throughout this rally that first started back in January of this year. Generally, this is the case in bullish trends, as the STHs are those who bought relatively recently, so any price rises immediately reflect on their profit/loss status. What&#8217;s more significant, however, is the indicator&#8217;s relationship with the zero mark. At this line, the STHs as a whole are neutral, meaning that their unrealized losses equal their unrealized profits. Usually, whenever the metric retests this line from above during bullish trends, it finds support and the price feels a bullish effect. This could be seen working in action during this rally alone, as the rebounds in March and June both occurred when the STH NUPL approached this line. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Shows Bearish Crossover, Price Drop Incoming? From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the metric has once again fallen to this line recently. This retest may be quite important, as a plunge below could mean a reversal back toward a bearish regime. In the below graph, it&#8217;s also visible that the MTH NUPL is retesting the same line, although this indicator is approaching it from the negative zone. The metric is retesting the break-even line &#124; Source: CryptoQuant The MTHs had been sitting in losses until now, but they are on the verge of transitioning back into profits currently. If the metric can manage to break through the level, then it would be a positive sign for the rally, as the bullish trend has historically continued whenever these investors have come back above water. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound Anytime Soon? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says The break-even line providing resistance to Bitcoin, however, is also a possibility, in which case the asset would feel a bearish effect. It now remains to be seen how this retest, as well as the one of the STH NUPL, would pan out in the coming days.

This time, it is the action of a particular Ethereum whale that has caught attention, one that has the ETH community in shock as to the reasons for such action.  The mysterious whale in question with the Ethereum address ‘nd4.eth’ sent $4.5 million worth of Ether (2,500 ETH) to a ‘burn’ address, in a move that removes these tokens from circulation forever. This interesting event, which occurred on July 26, has led to a burning question on the lips of everyone &#8211; who is this mysterious whale? Who Is The Mysterious Ethereum Whale? Although there is currently limited information on the mysterious whale, Crypto Twitter has been able to dig up some information as to who this person might be.

According to information gotten from Web3 portfolio tracker DeBank, the “nd4.eth’ address had previously sent Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) to another burn address many times, with these transactions amounting to approximately $8,000 in total. The address still has a huge portfolio though, with close to $3.57 million staked on GMX and GNS. ETH price plunges to $1,823 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Contributing To The Growth Of ETH While the crypto community continues to speculate the reasons for the ‘$4.5 million burn,’ there is no doubt that the ‘nd4.eth’ address has, for whatever reason, contributed to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystems.  His actions also further fuel the Ethereum as an ‘ultra-sound money’ narrative. Laurence Day, the creator of the Wildcat Protocol, jokingly commended the individual when he stated: “If you didn’t wake up this morning and say thank you to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I want you to have a long, hard think about what you’re trying to achieve here.” Related Reading: Crypto Funds Vs Bitcoin Holders: Who Was The Better Performer In H1 2023 True to it, the burning of tokens makes it deflationary and is usually done to decrease the token’s circulating supply and help boost demand and increase its market value.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market has been downward over the past 24 hours, with top coins like Bitcoin dancing in tune with the bearish trend. But while top coins lost the past week&#8217;s gains, XDC Network holds over 16% of its gains. XDC now trades at $0.068, a price 16.75% higher than its value seven days ago. However, despite the token’s resilience, the bulls are about to capitulate, with nearly 4% lost in the last 24 hours. XDC Network Price Performance In The Last Week XDC&#8217;s market situation today is similar to a water lily, with roots buried in the water while shooting out flourishing leaves above, looking for more opportunities to rally. XDC&#8217;s partial bullish momentum sustains the token&#8217;s weekly gains, while others have completely succumbed to bearish pressure. Related Reading: When Will Polygon (MATIC) Rebound? Analyzing This Month’s Recovery Potential XDC’s current price is still over 126% higher than its value 30 days ago, suggesting the bulls are still determined to withstand the fluctuations. The slight 0.55% decline in its 24-hour trading volume confirmed this assumption. XDC Social Sentiment Bullish As Community Awaits Upcoming Ecosystem Events Anticipation for the ETHToronto Hackathon slated to hold from August 15-16, 2023, remains high, with the XDC community at the center. According to an August 4 announcement by the XinFin Network, the XDC Network is the official Tera Byte sponsor of this event.  This event provides an incredible opportunity for blockchain and crypto enthusiasts to connect, collaborate, and explore the future of blockchain technology. The anticipation has increased XDC&#8217;s social sentiment as several people are already trying to purchase the token. Moreover, the event could also increase XDC’s exposure, potentially increasing its usability, user base, and trading volume.  In another announcement, the XinFin Network announced that the XDC Foundation will be the platinum sponsor of the Trade Finance Investor Day 2023. The event, organized by the Trade Finance Distribution Initiative (TFDi), will hold on October 19-20 at the five-star Grove Golf and Country Club, Hertfordshire, UK. The initiative aims to help many investors access trade assets at the lowest possible cost. At the event, XinFin USA, the company behind the XDC Network, will showcase the benefits of the XDC Network to banks, secondary market investors, and industry experts. These collaborative efforts are boosting the network’s market presence, reflected in the token&#8217;s price performance over the past week. XDC Market Outlook; What’s Next? Meanwhile, the bears are active in XDC’s market today, actively trying to push the token off the $0.07 price level. The daily chart shows the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence is below the signal line, with red candlesticks. Also, the RSI is at 45, approaching the oversold area. Related Reading: Behind The Quiet: Low Bitcoin Volatility Masks Underlying Market Dynamics XDC now approaches the $0.6 support zone, a point that might empower the bears for more downtrends. XDC could dip lower in the next few hours if the bulls fail to regain momentum.  The token reached a day peak of $0.08028 on August 6 before gradually receding to the bears. As of the time of writing, the token has slipped off its peak and now trades at a low of $0.06872. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency payments have been increasingly widespread in recent years, with their use spreading to nearly every market. A use case of cryptocurrencies that has seen particular growth is in crypto donations and the Singapore Red Cross has now taken the plunge. Singapore Red Cross Taking Crypto Donations The Singapore Red Cross is the latest to jump on the crypto bandwagon as the homegrown humanitarian organization recently partnered with Triple-A, allowing donors to contribute Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC).  The country&#8217;s Red Cross Society is looking to capitalize on crypto adoptions by partnering with Triple-A, the first crypto payment gateway licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  Related Reading: Curve Finance Announces $1.85 Million Bounty For Stable Pool Exploiter The Singapore Red Cross received more than $4.5 million in donations in 2022. However, by accepting BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC, the humanitarian organization is opening itself up to donations from people across the globe.  “By accepting digital currencies, we open our doors to a new segment of donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets,” said Benjamin William, Secretary General and CEO of the Singapore Red Cross. “Enabling cryptocurrency donations also opens more opportunities for the new generation of donors who are au fait with digital currencies to consider philanthropy and helping the vulnerable.” This is not the first time a Red Cross society will accept cryptocurrency donations, as the American and British counterparts already accept crypto donations. However, unlike US donors, donors to the Singapore Red Cross do not receive tax deductions, and all donations received will be converted to fiat currency within one business day. Total market cap falls to $1.121 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Crypto adoption in Singapore is one of the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. According to a report, over half of Singapore&#8217;s Gen X members invest in cryptocurrencies. Another similar study done by Statista showed that around 19% of people in Singapore own crypto, higher than the global average of 15%. More than 31% of respondents also indicated that they owned Bitcoin, one of the highest in the world. The Rise of Crypto Philanthropy Crypto philanthropy has steadily grown over the past few years.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency payments have been increasingly widespread in recent years, with their use spreading to nearly every market. A use case of cryptocurrencies that has seen particular growth is in crypto donations and the Singapore Red Cross has now taken the plunge.</p>
<h2>Singapore Red Cross Taking Crypto Donations</h2>
<p>The Singapore Red Cross is the latest to jump on the crypto bandwagon as the homegrown humanitarian organization recently partnered with Triple-A, allowing donors to contribute Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). </p>
<p>The country&#8217;s Red Cross Society is looking to capitalize on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/a-catholic-church-in-washington-now-accepts-crypto-donations-why-it-matters/">crypto adoptions</a> by partnering with Triple-A, the first crypto payment gateway licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). </p>

<p>The Singapore Red Cross received more than $4.5 million in donations in 2022. However, by accepting BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC, the humanitarian organization is opening itself up to donations from people across the globe. </p>
<p>“By accepting digital currencies, we open our doors to a new segment of donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets,” said Benjamin William, Secretary General and CEO of the Singapore Red Cross. “Enabling cryptocurrency donations also opens more opportunities for the new generation of donors who are au fait with digital currencies to consider philanthropy and helping the vulnerable.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time a Red Cross society will accept cryptocurrency donations, as the American and British counterparts already accept crypto donations. However, unlike US donors, donors to the Singapore Red Cross do not receive tax deductions, and all donations received will be converted to fiat currency within one business day.</p>

<p>Crypto adoption in Singapore is one of the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. According to a <a href="https://www.independentreserve.com/blog/news/independent-reserve-cryptocurrency-index-irci-singapore-2023?utm_source=coinspaidmedia&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow">report</a>, over half of Singapore&#8217;s Gen X members invest in cryptocurrencies. Another similar <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294071/singapore-cryptocurrency-ownership-by-coin/" rel="nofollow">study </a>done by Statista showed that around 19% of people in Singapore own crypto, higher than the global average of 15%. More than 31% of respondents also indicated that they owned Bitcoin, one of the highest in the world.</p>

<p>Crypto philanthropy has steadily grown over the past few years. Major organizations like the American Red Cross, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital now take crypto donations.
