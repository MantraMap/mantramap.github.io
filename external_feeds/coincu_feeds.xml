<p>Cryptocurrency investors often face the dilemma of needing a loan but being apprehensive about the possibility of spending borrowed funds unwisely, leading to the risk of their assets being liquidated. Alchemix presents a transformative solution to this problem with its unique lending protocol that offers unparalleled peace of mind. In this article, Coincu will delve into this innovative project to shed light on how it works and what makes it exceptional.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Alchemix?</h2>



<p>Alchemix, the brainchild of innovative developers, introduces a novel concept of Synthetic Assets backed by future returns, offering users unprecedented opportunities to earn profits through sophisticated mechanisms.</p>



<p>At its core, Alchemix is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum, providing users with the ability to borrow cryptocurrency. The platform&#8217;s native token, ALCX, serves as a store of Synthetic Assets, representing a claim to any collateral in the Alchemix protocol. This ingenious approach to asset representation has garnered support from major enterprises, indicating its potential to shape the future of tokenization.</p>



<p>One of the key features of Alchemix is its unique staking mechanism, allowing users to stake their tokens and coins for profitable mining. As a result, the platform issues a token equivalent to the collateralized debt, effectively creating a Synthetix synthetic asset for liquidity providers (LPs) in the DeFi ecosystem. These LP tokens can then be traded for profit on derivatives, presenting users with a double profit mechanism.</p>



<p>The platform&#8217;s success is not solely tied to DeFi activities, as Alchemix incorporates an arbitrage mechanism that leverages the value of Synthetix synthetic assets received through trading transactions. This creates an additional avenue for users to capitalize on the value differentials, further enhancing their profitability.</p>



<p>Alchemix&#8217;s seamless process involves the issuance of tokens corresponding to the debt that users mortgage when staking their tokens. Simultaneously, users have the flexibility to instantly recover the encrypted value of stablecoins. This mutually beneficial arrangement automates electronic debt payments, ensuring a smooth experience for both lenders and borrowers.</p>



<p>To finance the repayment process, Alchemix utilizes profits earned from funds flowing into the platform. Consequently, users not only benefit from their DeFi activities but also earn money based on the aggregated assets&#8217; differential value. This all-encompassing approach truly positions Alchemix as a platform offering a double profit mechanism.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<p>Traditionally, farming involves staking assets in a protocol and waiting for rewards. However, Alchemix aims to be more than just another farming platform. It serves as an innovative ecosystem that allows users to deploy their LP tokens in various ways, transcending the conventional limitations of traditional farming protocols.</p>



<p>Instead of merely earning regular LP tokens, users who choose Alchemix can now receive Synthetic tokens in return for their staked assets. Alchemix currently supports alUSD, a synthetic token minted from DAI, with plans to expand support to other stablecoins in the future. These synthetic tokens are tradable and subject to price fluctuations like any other standard cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The core focus of the Alchemix project is centered around upgrading LP tokens, creating a new dimension for users&#8217; assets. Rather than staking their assets in protocols directly, users can now deposit them directly into Alchemix. Once there, the project harnesses these assets for farming purposes, generating yield on behalf of the users. As a result, users receive synthetic tokens as a representation of their stake in Alchemix, opening up new possibilities for their assets.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1788-1024x101.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="101" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1788-1024x101.png" alt="Alchemix Review: Pioneering A Revolution In DeFi With Multi-Chain Stability" class="wp-image-205696" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1788-1024x101.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1788-300x30.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1788-768x76.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1788-750x74.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1788-1140x113.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1788.png 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Alchemix Review: Pioneering A Revolution In DeFi With Multi-Chain Stability 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The flexibility of Alchemix is a major advantage, as it can accommodate virtually any token that is involved in farming or has a vault mechanism within its native protocol. Whether it&#8217;s yvDAI Vault, aLINK Vault, or any other farming mechanism, Alchemix welcomes a diverse array of tokens to join its ecosystem.</p>



<p>One of the most attractive features of Alchemix is its user-friendly debt repayment mechanism. Interest earned from transactions is automatically directed towards repaying the users&#8217; debts. This not only reduces the risk of users forgetting about their debts but also grants them the freedom to withdraw profits and utilize them at their discretion.</p>



<p>For those who often find it challenging to keep track of debts and repayments, Alchemix offers a reliable solution. With this seamless automation, users can rest assured that their debts are being settled, while they can focus on making the most of their earnings.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve rapidly, Alchemix stands out as a pioneering platform that adds a new layer of functionality to LP tokens. By offering a diversified range of options for farming and yield generation, the project caters to both seasoned farmers and newcomers seeking innovative opportunities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>By depositing assets into the platform, users are granted access to an innovative and powerful financial ecosystem backed by Alchemix&#8217;s smart contract technology, resulting in the issuance of unique tokens called al-Tokens.</p>



<p>The core feature of Alchemix lies in its novel approach to creating synthetic assets, which necessitates a stable price mechanism, such as stablecoins or ERC20 tokens with on-chain profit-generating capabilities. Examples of compatible protocols include Compound, AAVE, and vault-like products like yDAI Vault or aLINK Vault.</p>



<p>Initially, Alchemix supports exchange rate stable tokens, paving the way for the issuance of alUSD tokens (where &#8220;al&#8221; denotes Alchemix platform). While the original plan encompassed multiple stablecoins, the protocol decided to start with DAI support. Nevertheless, the examples and principles applied to alUSD extend to other al-Tokens as well.</p>



<p>The Alchemix decentralized application (DApp) comprises several essential components, namely:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vaults</strong>: These act as hubs for profit generation, akin to MakerDAO and AAVE. In its initial phase, the protocol accepts DAI as the first collateral type.</li>



<li><strong>Transmuter</strong>: The Transmuter component enables users to stake synthetic assets, converting them back into the original assets over time.</li>



<li><strong>Farming</strong>: Alchemix also features a farming mechanism, encouraging active participation and providing rewards for users.</li>



<li><strong>Treasury</strong>: The Treasury is governed by the Alchemix DAO, a community-driven management system that guides the platform&#8217;s decisions and future development.</li>
</ul>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at how the Alchemix platform works. Users begin by staking DAI into the Vaults pool contract. The staked DAI is then deployed by the Alchemix contract, generating profits within the Yearn yvDAI Vault. Here&#8217;s where the magic happens: users can borrow up to 50% of the DAI they deposited. For example, if a user deposits 1000 DAI, they can generate up to 500 alUSD.</p>



<p>As profits accrue in the yvDAI Vault pool, the protocol automatically reduces the alUSD debt. Given enough time, this debt will eventually be paid off by the Alchemix platform itself. This unique feature essentially allows users to repay their loans passively while retaining a portion of the initial collateral, providing them with additional financial flexibility.</p>



<p>Users are granted various options to manage their Vaults once they are open. For instance, if the collateral ratio exceeds 200%, users can immediately withdraw DAI or alUSD until their vault reaches a 200% collateral ratio. During the staking period, Alchemix automatically repays the earned profit, allowing users to withdraw more DAI or alUSD as desired.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="676" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787-1024x676.png" alt="Alchemix Review: Pioneering A Revolution In DeFi With Multi-Chain Stability" class="wp-image-205695" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787-1024x676.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787-300x198.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787-768x507.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787-1536x1014.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787-750x495.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787-1140x753.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1787.png 1778w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Alchemix Review: Pioneering A Revolution In DeFi With Multi-Chain Stability 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, users have complete control over the staking period. They can choose when to withdraw and repay with either DAI or alUSD at their discretion. Notably, the protocol treats alUSD and DAI equally, enabling users to repay a debt of 1000 alUSD with either 1000 alUSD, 1000 DAI, or a combination of both.</p>



<p>In the event that a user lacks sufficient funds to repay their loan, they have the option to liquidate their collateral to settle the debt. Upon clearing the alUSD debt entirely, users are free to withdraw all the collateral they initially deposited. Moreover, if users forget to withdraw their collateral, they will continue to be credited with alUSD along with the interest generated for that period until they eventually withdraw.</p>



<p>Alchemix Vaults offer versatility by providing powerful immobilization mechanisms. As the alUSD debt can be repaid in alUSD and/or DAI, users can strategically leverage market dynamics. For instance, if alUSD falls below the DAI peg, users can buy it from the market at a discounted price to repay the debt. Conversely, if alUSD exceeds the anchor level, users can mint and sell alUSD for a profit or repay the debt in DAI.</p>



<p>Moreover, Alchemix users can exploit arbitrage opportunities in stablecoin prices when dealing with alUSD backed by multiple assets. They can &#8220;mine&#8221; alUSD with the cheaper stablecoin, thereby repaying the debt generated from a more expensive stablecoin. This approach, when adopted by many users, helps maintain stability and ensures that backed stablecoins stay closer in value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features</h2>



<p>The platform&#8217;s key features include Vaults, Transmuter, Treasury, and the Alchemix DAO, each contributing to the ecosystem&#8217;s success and stability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vaults &#8211; Generating Profits Made Simple</strong></h3>



<p>At the heart of Alchemix lies its Vaults feature, which operates similarly to established lending platforms like AAVE and MakerDAO. Users can deposit DAI into the Vaults contracts, using it as collateral. The deposited DAI is then deployed by the Alchemix Smart Contract to generate profits in Yearn yvDAI Vault, offering users an opportunity to earn returns on their holdings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transmuter &#8211; Ensuring Stability and Flexibility</strong></h3>



<p>Alchemix&#8217;s Transmuter serves as the main anchor for the platform&#8217;s synthetic tokens. A unique mechanism guarantees that all participants can seamlessly exchange alUSD for DAI tokens at a fixed ratio of 1:1. When users deposit alUSD into the Transmuter, profits are credited proportionally to DAI holders based on their deposit amounts. Conversely, when DAI is withdrawn, an equivalent amount of alUSD is &#8220;burned,&#8221; ensuring a balanced and stable system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treasury &#8211; Empowering the Community</strong></h3>



<p>A standout feature of Alchemix&#8217;s vault is its commitment to community involvement. A well-thought-out mechanism directs 90% of the platform&#8217;s profits to Vaults and Transmuter, while the remaining 10% flows into the Treasury. This setup ensures that the community benefits significantly from the platform&#8217;s success.</p>



<p>Profit distribution within the Treasury operates as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>60% of ALCX tokens, Alchemix&#8217;s native governance token, are distributed among the community.</li>



<li>15% of the supply is community-controlled and allocated to the Alchemix DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), giving token holders a say in protocol decisions and treasury management.</li>



<li>5% of the supply is dedicated to bounty rewards for those who discover and report platform bugs, further fostering community participation.</li>



<li>The remaining allocation is utilized for farming initiatives, bolstering the ecosystem&#8217;s growth and sustainability.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Alchemix DAO &#8211; Empowering Governance</strong></h3>



<p>The Alchemix DAO serves as a developer of Multisig and facilitates decision-making through the Snapshot app. Holders of the ALCX token are granted administrative rights to influence protocol decisions and determine the efficient usage of the treasury, solidifying Alchemix&#8217;s commitment to decentralized governance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">ALCX token</h2>

<li><em>South Korean prosecutors bring 49 suspects to trial for illegal foreign exchange outflows and $305 million in profits from virtual asset speculation using the &#8220;Kimchi Premium.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>Speculators exploited the Kimchi Premium phenomenon, with domestic virtual asset prices exceeding overseas markets, leading to unfair gains.</em></li>



<li><em>Financial firms and employees are implicated in condoning illicit foreign exchange outflows as authorities intensify efforts to prevent wealth outflow and protect investors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a bid to curb illegal foreign exchange outflows and combat virtual asset speculation, South Korean prosecutors have brought 49 suspects to trial. The suspects are believed to have profited a staggering 390 billion won (approximately $305 million) by exploiting the so-called &#8220;Kimchi Premium,&#8221; <em>News1</em> <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/?5119578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>The crackdown, which began in August 2022, has been a joint effort by the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Customs Office, and the Financial Supervisory Service. Their main target has been speculators who took advantage of the <a href="https://coincu.com/155933-seoul-prosecutors-kimchi-premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kimchi Premium</a> phenomenon, wherein the domestic virtual asset market price surpassed that of overseas markets. This trend emerged amid a surge in domestic virtual asset investments.</p>



<p>Prosecutors uncovered a sophisticated scheme employed by the speculators. They allegedly sent foreign virtual assets to domestic paper companies for sale, subsequently remitting 13 trillion won (approximately $10 million) of false trade proceeds overseas. This maneuver allowed them to capitalize on the Kimchi Premium and reap substantial transaction profits. Based on Bitcoin&#8217;s historical Kimchi Premium average of 3-5% over the past two years, these speculators managed to amass at least $305 million in illicit gains.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the prosecution brought seven employees from a financial firm to trial for their involvement in facilitating these illicit foreign exchange outflows. Despite being aware of the speculators&#8217; falsified data, the employees reportedly continued to leak large amounts of foreign currency in exchange for cash and luxury watches, enabling the illegal activities to persist.</p>



<p>Additionally, two financial companies found guilty of failing to monitor and prevent the illegal outflow of foreign exchange, ranging from tens of millions to trillions of won, also faced legal consequences under the penalty clause.</p>

<p>The prosecution, in its announcement on the matter, emphasized its commitment to taking stringent measures against speculative trading of virtual assets that lead to the outflow of national wealth and harm honest investors. By holding the suspects accountable and pursuing justice, authorities aim to send a clear message that such exploitative practices will not be tolerated in the country.</p>

<li><em>Attack did not affect client data but resulted in data theft of over 500GB.</em></li>



<li><em>Attack highlights increasing threat of cybercrime faced by businesses worldwide.</em></li>

<p>The attack did not result in any harm to the data of its clients. According to reports by Israeli hacking monitoring startup, DarkFeed, the attack was orchestrated by BlackCat, the same ransomware group that had previously stolen significant amounts of data from the state-owned Italian energy services firm GSE in September. The attack on Azimut was carried out on July 21 and was listed as one of BlackCat&#8217;s 477 victims. However, the company had no immediate comment on the attack.</p>

<p>BlackCat, also known as ALPHV, first emerged in late 2021 and has since launched sophisticated attacks on many companies in the US and Europe. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, a Californian cybersecurity firm, also confirmed that BlackCat was behind the attack on Azimut. According to Palo Alto, the hackers claimed to have stolen more than 500GB of confidential data from Azimut. The attack on Azimut is one of 23 similar attacks that occurred in July alone.</p>



<p>Based on its leak site tracking, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 revealed that BlackCat is the second most active multi-extortion ransomware group after LockBit. The hackers have targeted a variety of industries, including law firms, engineering firms, health care systems, and manufacturing, among others.</p>



<p>In a statement, Azimut reassured its clients that the attack did not compromise their personal data or information that could allow access to their financial position or the execution of unauthorized transactions. The company has reported the unauthorized access to its IT systems to the relevant authorities and has successfully limited the impact of the attack through its internal safety procedures.</p>

<p>Despite the company&#8217;s proactive measures, the attack on Azimut highlights the increasing threat of cybercrime faced by businesses worldwide. Companies must remain vigilant and take appropriate measures to protect their systems and data from potential cyber threats.</p>

<p>This unprecedented initiative, developed in partnership with SaaSy Labs, a leading blockchain-based legal contract solutions developer, promises to revolutionize the NFT space with its on-chain record and identification functionalities, including BAYC authenticity verification.</p>



<p>The official announcement made by BAYC on their Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC/status/1683594162908610560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> the world to this game-changing platform. By leveraging the capabilities of Made by Apes, NFT creators and users alike can now effortlessly obtain licenses via the application page.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to introduce this first-of-its-kind on-chain licensing for a club full of builders, done in partnership with SaaSy Labs,&#8221; the announcement stated with enthusiasm.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the launch of Made by Apes, BAYC Apes can now request licenses to register their businesses or products, each assigned a unique license number. Beyond merely being an on-chain license, this novel approach serves as a unifying mark, effectively verifying and distinguishing genuine products made by BAYC &amp; MAYC (Mutant Ape Yacht Club) holders.</p>



<p>The BAYC community has undoubtedly been the driving force behind its monumental success, and the introduction of Made by Apes serves as a testament to the collective power of its builders. Over the past two years, the community has witnessed an astounding number of projects featuring Ape intellectual property, reinforcing the club&#8217;s position as a trailblazer in the NFT domain.</p>

<p>Aiming to create a versatile and inclusive tool, BAYC collaborated with several community brands at the forefront of the NFT industry to pressure test the program. These launch partners played a pivotal role in establishing the standards for commercial rights usage on the platform.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We wanted to build a tool that meets the needs of the whole community, across categories and uses. To do this, we partnered with a handful of community brands that have been pushing the space forward to pressure test this program,&#8221; the BAYC team expressed their gratitude to the launch partners in their statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Highlighting the immense potential of the Made by Apes platform, the announcement also mentioned the forthcoming launch of &#8220;The Bodega,&#8221; which will prominently display all active Made by Ape licenses on the BAYC website. This feature is set to further amplify the exposure of community products and expand the reach of licensed creations.</p>

<p>Analyzing the whale&#8217;s historical patterns, it becomes evident that their previous modus operandi involved strategic buying in batches, followed by a sweeping sell-off of all acquired ETH to Binance, ultimately completing one ETH band. Such a systematic approach has served the investor well, bolstering their reputation as a formidable player in the crypto arena.</p>



<p>At present, the whale retains a substantial holding of 22340 ETH, valued at a staggering $41.25 million. This vast cryptocurrency reserve has captured the attention of the crypto community, keen to witness the investor&#8217;s next moves, eagerly speculating whether this figure will continue to be invincible in their strategic maneuvers.</p>

<p>The whale&#8217;s actions have become a subject of intense scrutiny, and many market observers are closely monitoring their follow-up operations. Their latest transfer into Binance could be indicative of a potential withdrawal strategy, a move that could significantly impact the market and other participants.</p>



<p>As the investor&#8217;s previous patterns hinted at strategic selling and an affinity for completing ETH bands, the community eagerly awaits their next moves. With a substantial holding of 22340 ETH, valued at $41.25 million, the actions have the potential to reverberate across the market, making it crucial for traders to remain attentive and responsive.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Developers across the Optimism ecosystem are starting to build OP Stack&#8217;s first Fault Proof.</em></li>



<li><em>The Fault Proof System will showcase the power of the OP Stack&#8217;s modularity, making it easy for ecosystem builders to design custom Fault Proof components.</em></li>



<li><em>It also paves the way for adding zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to the OP Stack.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>OP Stack&#8217;s first Fault Proof has been <a href="https://blog.oplabs.co/building-a-fault-proof-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a>. It will allow Collective to make significant progress toward the next level of engineering decentralization and customization available to the Bug Resistant System thanks to the <a href="https://coincu.com/189427-op-stack-brings-optimism-to-superchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OP Stack</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>The developers of the Optimism ecosystem are developing the Fault Proof System, which includes the error-proof Program (FPP), the fault-proof virtual machine (FPVM), the Dispute Game, and other components of the fault-proof system to demonstrate the powerful modularity of the OP stack.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/karl_dot_tech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@karl_dot_tech</a> just dropped. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>Developers across the Optimism ecosystem are heads down building the OP Stack’s first Fault Proof System. Read the full technical decentralization update here:<a href="https://t.co/NDJst0x0T7" target="_blank">https://t.co/NDJst0x0T7</a></p>&mdash; OP Labs (@OPLabsPBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/OPLabsPBC/status/1683582821103816704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the official documentation, the Fault Proof System is the key to enabling protocol decentralization. It will allow secure connections without centralized redundancy. In fact, its open-source nature and minimal, standard implementation differences make it easy to implement multiple protocols.</p>



<p>This way, ecosystem builders can easily design custom OP Stack proof-of-fault components, from proof-of-concept diagrams to virtual machines and even unique Dispute Games. The separation of FPP and FPVM allows the same operator to run in both FPVM and ZKVM.</p>



<p>With the Modular Error Protection Program (FPP) and Fault Resistant Virtual Machine (FPVM), each component can be improved in parallel, enhancing system performance and innovation.</p>



<p>As the network asserts, the OP Stack is critical to ensuring that the Superchain infrastructure, including the Fault Proof System, is composable, resilient, and future-proof. The Fault Proof System represents an important step toward a more efficient and decentralized Superchain.</p>

<p>Earlier, On the official Twitter, Optimism shared a status line introducing this new solution, aiming to make the platform a &#8220;Superchain&#8221;.</p>



<p>Also, in the blog post, Optimism said that OP Stack is a modular source code with high extensibility. This is not just a &#8220;rollup or an optimistic solution.&#8221; This set of solutions shared by Optimism will be the foundation of a development roadmap to Modular Blockchain.</p>



<p>In addition, a feature that OP Stack will be the foundation to support is atomic cross-chain interaction. Accordingly, different chains can be easily compatible with the toolkit, supporting inter-blocking activities.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has released a report calling for more regulation in blockchain finance, focusing on crypto asset trading platforms and stablecoins.</em></li>



<li><em>The GAO recommends designating a federal regulator to ensure comprehensive oversight and address the lack of coordination between existing regulatory agencies.</em></li>



<li><em>The report also acknowledges blockchain&#8217;s potential to improve government processes, citing the Small Business Administration (SBA) as an example where blockchain integration could resolve data collection and analysis delays.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog agency, has recently <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105346.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a comprehensive 77-page report urging the need for more regulation in the use of blockchain technology within the finance sector.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1024x576.png" alt="US GAO Urges Stronger Oversight: New Report Calls For Enhanced Regulation In Blockchain" class="wp-image-205631" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US GAO Urges Stronger Oversight: New Report Calls For Enhanced Regulation In Blockchain 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>The report, which was requested before the midterm elections by <a href="https://coincu.com/151496-waters-disappointed-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reps. Maxine Waters</a> and Stephen Lynch highlight the lack of adequate regulation for crypto asset trading platforms and stablecoins. As a result, the GAO recommends designating a federal regulator to ensure comprehensive oversight.</p>



<p>The report sheds light on the regulatory gaps surrounding crypto asset trading platforms and stablecoins, pointing out that they currently lack the robust regulation enjoyed by traditional assets. While some limited oversight is provided by agencies like the Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and state money transmitter licensing, it falls short of providing consistent and comprehensive prudential regulation and oversight.</p>



<p>Stablecoins, in particular, require attention regarding the composition of their reserves, auditing, disclosures, and redemption rights. The current regulatory landscape, which involves various measures from the <a href="https://coincu.com/204120-sec-adds-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-federal-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/205581-binance-cz-file-a-petition-dismiss-cftcs-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a>, and state-level authorities, lacks uniformity and coherence.</p>



<p>Addressing the unique challenges posed by decentralized finance (DeFi), the GAO suggests that regulation should be inversely related to the level of decentralization. When a DeFi ecosystem operates in a fully decentralized manner, it becomes challenging to identify individuals responsible for governance and operations, potentially spanning multiple regulatory jurisdictions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771.png" alt="US GAO Urges Stronger Oversight: New Report Calls For Enhanced Regulation In Blockchain" class="wp-image-205634" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US GAO Urges Stronger Oversight: New Report Calls For Enhanced Regulation In Blockchain 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>One of the major issues raised in the report is the lack of coordination between regulators, leading to slow responses to market innovations. To address this, the report recommends establishing a formal coordination mechanism among the seven relevant regulatory agencies.</p>



<p>This mechanism would be tasked with identifying risks associated with blockchain-related products and services and formulating a timely regulatory response. The Treasury&#8217;s Financial Stability Oversight Council was already tasked with spearheading efforts to create a unified approach to crypto asset oversight following the March 2022 Executive Order on Responsible Development of Digital Assets.</p>



<p>While the GAO&#8217;s recommendations are not legally binding, they carry significant moral weight. Among the regulatory agencies, the National Credit Union Administration expressed agreement with the need for greater coordination, while others neither agreed nor disagreed.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the GAO has previously acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology to improve various government processes. In a separate report submitted to a congressional request, the GAO highlighted how blockchain integration within the Small Business Administration (SBA) could offer substantial benefits. By leveraging blockchain, the SBA could address the persistent delays in collecting and analyzing information from small businesses, potentially resolving delays of up to 16 months between 2016 and 2021.</p>



<p>As the discussions around blockchain regulation continue to evolve, policymakers will likely consider the GAO&#8217;s recommendations seriously. Striking the right balance between innovation and oversight will be crucial for shaping the future of blockchain technology in the finance sector.</p>
