The network&#x2019;s difficulty is now at an impressive 49.55 trillion, or 0.90% away from 50 trillion hashes, making it the most difficult it has ever been to discover a block reward.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Difficulty Rises to Uncharted Territory, Straining Miners</h2>
<p>This year, Bitcoin once again broke a record as the network&#x2019;s difficulty jumped by <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">3.22%</a>, rising to an unprecedented height of <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/difficulty-chart">49.55 trillion</a>. The network&#x2019;s difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a hash value that meets the required criteria for a new block to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Notably, the recent rise in difficulty followed a 1.45% drop at block height 788,256, where the chain&#x2019;s difficulty remained at 48.01 trillion for approximately two weeks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-589015 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>&#x200B;&#x200B;Bitcoin miners are currently dedicating 363.84 exahash per second (EH/s) toward the Bitcoin blockchain. The latest increase of 3.22% happened at block height 790,272, and the next difficulty change should occur on or around May 31, 2023. Recent statistics show that block intervals are running a bit longer than the usual ten-minute average. At 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time on May 18, the intervals ranged from ten minutes and 12 seconds to ten minutes and 33 seconds.</p>
<p>In the last 72 hours, the leading bitcoin mining pool has been Foundry USA, with a hashrate of approximately 109.04 EH/s. This accounts for 30.02% of the Bitcoin network&#x2019;s total hashrate during that timeframe. Foundry is followed by Antpool&#x2019;s 77.77 EH/s, F2pool&#x2019;s 54.52 EH/s, and Viabtc&#x2019;s 40.89 EH/s. Binance Pool, the fifth largest by hashrate, has approximately 27.26 EH/s of hashrate today.</p>

<p>Despite the increasing difficulty, Bitcoin miners have maintained a high hashrate by investing greater computational power into the network. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices are below the $27,000 range, they are significantly higher than the value of $16,500 that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded for on December 31, 2022. Furthermore, in addition to the all-time high (ATH) difficulty on May 18, the network&#x2019;s hashrate reached an ATH on May 2 when it reached 491.15 exahash per second (EH/s) at block height 787,895.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped below the $27,000 mark on Friday, ahead of a panel discussion which will include Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>Markets anticipate some forward guidance from Powell regarding future decisions that the Federal Reserve could take in coming months.</p>
<p>Following a high of $27,466.53 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,415.10 earlier today.</p>

<p>The move, which saw the price fall by over $1,000, pushed bitcoin towards a key price floor at $26,300.</p>
<p>Friday&#x2019;s slippage occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) once again dropped below a resistance of its own at the 42.00 mark.</p>
<p>Price strength is now tracking at 40.83, with bears possibly targeting a support point at the 38.00 zone.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also in the red in today&#x2019;s session, with prices briefly breaking out of the $1,800 level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to a bottom at $1,774.20 on Friday, which comes a day after hitting a high of $1,826.90.</p>
<p>The drop in price resulted in ethereum falling below a floor at $1,790. However, it has since rebounded.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum&#x2019;s RSI was unable to break out of a resistance point at 45.00, and is now at a reading of 44.83.</p>
<p>A sign of hope for bulls comes in the form of the 10-day (red) moving average, which moved closer to a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a reasonable chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could climb towards $1,900.</p>

<h2>Euro Banks Have Solid Fundamentals, ECB’s de Guindos Says, Rate Raises to Continue</h2>
<p>The turmoil in the eurozone’s banking sector has been “short-lived” due to limited exposure to bank stress in the U.S. and Switzerland and shielding regulations, Vice President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Luis de Guindos said during a banking conference in Spain.</p>
<p>Euro area banks are weathering the storm also thanks to solid fundamentals in key areas such as resilience, liquidity, and profitability, the high-ranking official emphasized. However, he also thinks there is no room for complacency amid a challenging outlook that creates uncertainties.</p>

<p>“While higher interest rates boost banks’ net interest income, the benefits could be somewhat smaller than previously anticipated given a slowdown in lending growth and the inversion of the yield curve,” de Guindos said in his speech <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230517_1~5747dc857a.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the ECB on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The executive pointed out that according to the latest euro area bank lending survey, demand for corporate and housing loans has decreased significantly, slowing down its landing in March, while credit standards tightened considerably in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>“There are two sides to rising interest rates. Certainly, they have a positive impact on earnings. But on the downside, they heighten interest rate risk,” Luis de Guindos elaborated. His comments come after the ECB <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-raises-interest-rates-by-25bps-amid-too-high-inflation-no-pause-lagarde-says/">slowed</a> the pace of its rate hikes in early May to 25 basis points.</p>
<p>During the event in Madrid, Guindos remarked that the ECB’s future policy decisions in that regard will depend on data about the underlying inflation which remains more persistent than expected. Quoted by Bloomberg, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We still have a way to go in the tightening journey. Surely we’ve carried out most of it, but there’s still a way to go.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ECB is trying to bring inflation in the eurozone down to its 2% target. While markets are betting on another two increases, some <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/europeans-to-see-more-interest-rate-hikes-central-bank-governors-indicate/">members</a> of its Governing Council have indicated that rate hikes may continue beyond the summer. “Vulnerabilities persist, and we need to closely monitor the situation to safeguard financial stability,” Luis de Guindos insisted.</p>

Several crypto companies have encountered difficulties in securing banking partners. This week, Bitpay, a prominent player in the crypto payments sector, made an announcement regarding the termination of its current Bitpay prepaid Mastercard program. This decision follows the end of its partnership with Metropolitan Commercial Bank.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Payment Giant Bitpay Ends Prepaid Mastercard Program</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitpay.com">Bitpay</a>, the Atlanta-based crypto payments company, has made the decision to halt its prepaid Mastercard program, rendering the card unusable for Bitpay Mastercard holders after the specified deadline. Breaking the news through a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/BitPay/status/1659231785832546316?s=20">informative tweets</a> on May 18, 2023, Bitpay also notified cardholders via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bitpay/comments/13iqf40/bitpay_and_metropolitan_commercial_bank_ends/">email</a>. Urging users to promptly terminate any recurring payments linked to the prepaid card, the company has set June 1, 2023, as the final day for card loading.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve seen some hot takes since announcing our short transition period for the BitPay Card and want to make one thing clear: we’re not going away, just taking some time to change banks and enhance the card program. </p>
<p>More details in the thread <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/HeuGZIlst1">pic.twitter.com/HeuGZIlst1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; BitPay (@BitPay) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitPay/status/1659231785832546316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitpay has announced that the card&#8217;s final day of usability is scheduled for June 15, 2023, after which it will cease to function. On January 9, 2023, the crypto sector received news regarding Metropolitan Bank&#8217;s decision to discontinue its involvement in crypto-asset-related endeavors. At the time, Metropolitan <a href="https://investors.mcbankny.com/news-events/news/news-details/2023/Metropolitan-Bank-Holding-Corp.-to-Exit-Crypto-Asset-Related-Vertical/default.aspx">revealed</a> that it serviced &#8220;four active institutional crypto-asset related clients,&#8221; collectively contributing approximately 1.5% of total revenues and 6% of total deposits.</p>
<p>When Bitpay took to Twitter to share the update, it <a href="https://twitter.com/BitPay/status/1659231791364882434?s=20">assured</a> its users that a revamped card service will make a comeback later this year. Although the current situation may be seen as a temporary setback, the company expressed its commitment to relaunching the Bitpay Card with enhancements through a new banking partner. While June 15 marks the final day to utilize the card for transactions, any remaining balances will be refunded. Within 30 days, users can expect to receive a reimbursement in the form of a paper check mailed to the address associated with their Bitpay Card.</p>

<p>“We will share additional details regarding the new card program, including new features, shortly,” the company’s email message detailed. “These changes will require a short transition period in which your current card will become inactive. As a cardholder, you will automatically be enrolled on the waitlist for the new program,” the crypto payments company’s card update concluded.</p>

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak stated that 80% of Russia-Iran trade transactions are settled using national currencies and that they are considering also the usage of the Chinese yuan.</strong></p>
<h2>80% of Russia-Iran Trade Settlements Involve National Currencies</h2>
<p>Russian and Iran have started to phase out the usage of the U.S. dollar in their bilateral trade settlements. According to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, the call to use national currencies, including the Russian ruble and the Iranian rial, has been effective, leaving only a small amount of these transactions still relying on the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>After meeting with Iranian officials, Novak <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1619073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We discussed these issues in great detail today, and both the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Russia were present, as were our Iranian counterparts. I believe approximately 80% of our mutual settlements are in national currencies: rials and rubles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Novak stated that the two countries were considering the usage of other third-party currencies to settle their bilateral transactions, including the Chinese yuan, a currency already widely used by the Russian Federation.</p>

<h2>A Push to Ditch the U.S. Dollar</h2>
<p>Novak also referred to the low utilization of traditional settlement currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the euro, stating that less than 20% of transactions involved settlements using them. &#8220;The work that was purposefully carried out in order to switch to national currencies has its results,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>Both Iran and Russia are currently facing economic sanctions enacted by the U.S. government that make difficult the use of the dollar for completing transactions using the traditional finance system. This has resulted in a complete change of the payment mechanics in international trade transactions, with the two countries seeking to adopt alternatives.</p>
<p>Recently, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/president-raisi-calls-central-bank-of-iran-to-ditch-u-s-dollar-shift-to-national-currencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered</a> the Central Bank of Iran to lay the groundwork for ditching the U.S. dollar completely from its trade transactions and switching to the Iranian rial and national currencies. In the same way, Russia has supported the shift to using national currencies and the Chinese yuan for this same purpose.</p>
<p>In January, it was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-and-russia-consider-issuing-gold-backed-stablecoin-officials-unveil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that both countries were discussing the possibility of the issuance of a gold-backed stablecoin to be used for international settlements, but Russian officials stated this discussion would have to be postponed until the approval of a clear cryptocurrency legal framework.</p>

The Bank of Russia is currently waiting for the enactment of this ruleset to conduct a live test of the CBDC&#8217;s (central bank digital currency) capabilities with real users.</strong></p>
<h2>Digital Ruble Law to Be Passed in June, According to State Duma Official</h2>
<p>The race to have a digital ruble cryptocurrency law approved in Russia is coming to an end. The Russian State Duma (the lower chamber of the Russian parliament) has estimated that the digital ruble — the Russian central bank digital currency (CBDC) — cryptocurrency law might be approved in June, according to statements from the chairman of the Duma’s Financial Markets Committee Anatoly Aksakov.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Aksakov <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1618215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bill on the digital ruble has been submitted, which I think we will pass in the spring session. It has already been passed in the first reading, which means in June it is to be passed in the second and third readings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The approval of the law would greenlight the launch of a pilot program for the e-currency with real transactions and customers, which was slated to be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-to-start-testing-digital-ruble-with-real-users-on-april-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in April. However, the regulator <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/17382789" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> it pending the approval of a framework regulating these activities.</p>

<h2>Proposed Draft Bill and Expectations</h2>
<p>The first version of the digital ruble bill, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bill-on-digital-ruble-submitted-to-russian-parliament/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> in January, was discussed and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-parliament-votes-on-bill-opening-door-for-digital-ruble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted</a> on in its first reading in March, declaring the Central Bank of Russia as the sole operator of the currency, with the responsibility of guaranteeing its functionality.</p>
<p>Also, the law seeks to give the Central Bank of Russia access to the personal data of the users of the currency without having user consent, and also without having to notify the respective government institution on this issue. In this regard, the State Duma has called to correct this and ensure the protection of personal data rights ahead of the coming discussion.</p>
<p>While Russia has <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1421831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved</a> to include the Chinese yuan as a reserve currency and it is already widely <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1608771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> to settle bilateral transactions with China, the Central Bank of Russia also has plans of profiling the digital ruble as a useful tool against sanctions enacted by Western countries since 2022. At that time, Aksakov <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/settlements-with-china-russia-plans-next-step-for-digital-ruble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinforced</a> the importance of the digital path to sidestep these sanctions and facilitate bilateral settlements with China, too.</p>

Binance Australia said while it works to find an alternative, users can still &#8220;buy and sell crypto using credit or debit cards.&#8221; Scott Collary, an executive at the service provider, claimed that &#8220;scammers are increasingly using overseas exchanges.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Australia Seeks an Alternative Third-Party Payment Service Provider</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance Australia announced on May 18 that it had &#8220;temporarily&#8221; suspended Australian dollar services after its payment service provider Westpac abruptly discontinued support for the platform. As a consequence, the crypto exchange said it is now &#8220;unable to facilitate PayID AUD deposits for Binance users.&#8221; The exchange warned users that the action taken by the third-party payment service will also likely impact bank transfer withdrawals.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fellow Binancians,</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that with immediate effect we are unable to facilitate PayID AUD deposits for Binance users due to a decision made by our third party payment service provider. We understand from our third party payment service provider that Bank…</p>
<p>&mdash; Binance Australia (@Binance_AUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1659018600496373760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, in its May 18 <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1659018600496373760">tweet</a>, Binance Australia did not explain why it has been banned or offer a hint of when the temporary suspension of the service is likely to be lifted. Instead, the tweet said the crypto exchange is working to find an alternative. The tweet also advised Binance Australia users to switch to its peer-to-peer marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working hard to find an alternative provider to continue offering AUD deposits and withdrawals to our users. Notably, you can still buy and sell crypto using credit or debit cards and our Binance P2P marketplace will also continue to operate as usual. Rest assured that your funds are safe through the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), an insurance fund that offers protection to Binance users and their funds in the event of extreme situations,&#8221; the crypto exchange said in a tweet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Crypto Exchanges Failing to Deal With Scammers</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, reports from local media have said Binance Australia was among several other crypto exchanges that have been cut off by Westpac, which announced a series of so-called scam protection measures on the same day. Explaining why his firm made the drastic decision of banning crypto exchanges, Scott Collary, the group executive of customer services and technology at Westpac, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/world-s-biggest-crypto-exchange-halts-withdrawals-for-australian-users-20230518-p5d9g1.html">reportedly</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital exchanges have a legitimate role to play in the financial ecosystem. But since the rise of digital currency, we’ve noticed that scammers are increasingly using overseas exchanges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Collary also claimed that customers of Westpac usually discover they have been scammed when the funds have already left the country. At that point, recovering the stolen funds will be &#8220;extremely difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>While an unnamed spokesperson for Australian Payments Plus, which oversees the operation of Pay ID, is quoted confirming the decision, they nonetheless denied any involvement in the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a matter for this organisation and its third-party payment service provider,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Westpac’s decision to ban Binance Australia is the latest in a series of setbacks to befall the crypto exchange in Australia. In early April, a <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/binance-loses-australian-financial-services-licence-after-asic-warning-20230406-p5cyq2.html">report</a> in the Sydney Morning Herald said the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) had canceled the license of Binance Australia’s local entity known as Oztures Trading. The report added that the Australian watchdog had been conducting &#8220;a targeted review&#8221; of the crypto exchange’s financial services business in the country.</p>

<h2>Pilot Program for e-HKD Begins</h2>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced Thursday “the commencement of the e-HKD Pilot Programme.” The central banking institution revealed that 16 firms from the financial, payment, and technology sectors have been selected to participate in the first round of e-HKD pilots for 2023. The HKMA detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pilots will take deep dives into potential use cases in six categories, including full-fledged payments, programmable payments, offline payments, tokenized deposits, settlement of Web3 transactions, and settlement of tokenized assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The HKMA will conduct a series of pilots in close collaboration with various stakeholders to examine the use cases, as well as implementation and design issues relating to e-HKD,” the monetary authority described, adding that it aims to share key learnings with the public at Hong Kong Fintech Week 2023 in November.</p>
<p>The companies participating in the pilot program include Alipay Financial Services, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Fubon Bank, Ripple Labs, Standard Chartered Bank, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, Visa, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Mastercard Asia/Pacific, and Boston Consulting Group.</p>
<p>Eddie Yue, HKMA&#8217;s chief executive, commented: “While the HKMA has not yet made a decision on whether and when to introduce e-HKD, we are excited to kick-start the e-HKD Pilot Programme, which serves as a tremendous opportunity for the HKMA to collaborate with the industry in exploring innovative use cases and maximizing our readiness for a potential e-HKD.”</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority published its policy stance on e-HKD in September last year as part of its &#8220;Fintech 2025&#8221; strategy. Two rounds of market consultation were conducted: one on high-level technical design and one on key policy and design issues. A total of 75 responses were received during the consultation period.</p>
<p>The HKMA explained at the time that it will adopt a three-rail approach. Rail 1 establishes the technological and legal foundations for the e-HKD, Rail 2 explores use cases and conducts pilots, and Rail 3 focuses on launching e-HKD based on the outcomes of the previous phases.</p>
<p>“The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of Rail 2 under the HKMA’s three-rail approach in paving the way for the possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), i.e. e-HKD, in the future,” the HKMA noted in Thursday&#8217;s announcement.</p>

<h2>Venezuela Shifting Away From USD in Trade</h2>
<p>The president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, said on his weekly “Con Maduro +” program earlier this week that Venezuela will shift away from using the U.S. dollar in trade. Commending <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-says-zimbabwe-gold-backed-digital-currency-a-potential-threat-to-financial-stability/">Zimbabwe</a> for its initiative to issue gold-backed digital currency, he said (as translated from Spanish by Google):</p>
<blockquote><p>Many alternative initiatives to the dollar are emerging in the world. We could say that we are beginning to experience a sustained accelerated process of de-dollarization of the commercial world — of world trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that it would be good for Venezuela to study these initiatives, emphasizing that the process of de-dollarization globally is &#8220;inevitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Venezuelan president, who previously expressed support for Latin America to have one <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro-signals-support-for-single-currency-in-latam-calls-for-crypto-inclusion/">single currency</a>, proceeded to describe that as the world moves &#8220;further toward equilibrium,&#8221; becoming &#8220;more multipolar&#8221; and &#8220;more pluricentric,&#8221; &#8220;a basket of currencies will appear for trade, for financial functioning.”</p>
<p>He then condemned “the political use” of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency and its associated financial system by the U.S. to sanction countries, naming China, Russia, India, Iran, Turkey, Venezuela, and Cuba in particular. Maduro opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world comes to a point where it gets tired, and also new economic powers are emerging … There could be a basket of currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maduro then highlighted Zimbabwe&#8217;s gold-backed digital currency initiative as a step towards &#8220;necessary and fair&#8221; de-dollarization efforts. He also mentioned de-dollarization initiatives by the BRICS economic bloc, mentioning the group&#8217;s New Development Bank (NDB). The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are also working to create a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a> that will help them reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Noting that the BRICS leaders plan to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discuss</a> a proposal for a common BRICS currency at their upcoming leaders’ summit in August, Maduro stressed that if a BRICS currency emerges, a new world is &#8220;necessary.&#8221; He emphasized that Venezuela needs to position itself for the new world, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the path of Venezuela and the path of a free economy where currencies are not used to punish countries and impose sanctions.</p></blockquote>
<p>The official Twitter account for Maduro also tweeted Wednesday: &#8220;The de-dollarization of world trade is inevitable, we are living it. Gone will be the old world of criminal sanctions and economic manipulations, with the interest of punishing the people. The rebirth of a new world is today, where freedom, justice, and respect prevail!&#8221;</p>
<p>A growing number of countries other than the BRICS nations are pushing to use local currencies instead of the USD. Ten Southeast Asian countries, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">agreed</a> to “encourage the use of local currencies for economic and financial transactions.” Multiple people have warned that a successful BRICS currency will erode the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance, including a former <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns/">White House economist</a>.</p>

While smaller than in the United States, the impact of the monetary policy tightening on the Old Continent is likely to grow further, the regulator expects.</strong></p>
<h2>Housing Investment in Europe Declining Amid ECB’s Rate Increases</h2>
<p>The series of rate hikes announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) is already depressing housing spending across the eurozone, the monetary authority has established in a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2023/html/ecb.ebbox202303_01~97644cdc95.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, the results of which were published on its website on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The findings come after in early May the ECB <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-raises-interest-rates-by-25bps-amid-too-high-inflation-no-pause-lagarde-says/">raised</a> its key interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), slowing the pace from previous increases. The bank has raised them by a total of 375 bps since last July, Reuters noted in a report.</p>
<p>The impact of the rate hikes on home purchases in Europe is likely to increase in the future, although it will remain smaller than that in the United States, according to the research, which also covers the American housing market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-588742 size-full" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/euus.jpg" alt="Rate Hikes Affecting Housing Markets in Eurozone, United States, ECB Study Shows" width="744" height="382" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/euus-300x154.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/euus.jpg 744w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></p>
<p>“While housing investment is one of the most interest rate-sensitive components of economic activity, it is generally much less volatile in the euro area than in the United States,” the ECB commented in an economic bulletin article presenting the study.</p>
<p>The European regulator estimates that “a temporary monetary policy shock that increases the short-term interest rate by 1 percentage point on impact leads, all else being equal, to a decline in housing investment in the euro area of around 5% after about three years … However, in the United States, the same shock has a greater impact on housing investment, leading to a drop of around 8%.”</p>
<p>Housing investment in the euro zone began to decline in the second quarter of 2022 and fell by a cumulative 4% by the end of the year. The decline in the U.S. started in Q2 of 2021 and since then housing spending has dropped by around 21%.</p>
<p>On May 3, the U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">increased</a> interest rates by 25 bps, stating that some additional raises may be appropriate to return inflation to 2%. Following the latest rate hike in Europe, ECB officials, including President Christine Lagarde and most recently Vice President Luis de Guindos, have indicated that amid stubborn inflation it’s still early for a pause in the tightening in the eurozone as well.</p>
