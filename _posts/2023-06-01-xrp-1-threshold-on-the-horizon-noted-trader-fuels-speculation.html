Is $XRP finally going to $1? — DonAlt (@CryptoDonAlt) May 31, 2023 In recent developments, XRP, the native coin of Ripple, has been displaying promising signs, as evidenced by remarkable spikes in address activity observed over two consecutive days.  This surge in address activity indicates a heightened level of interest and engagement with the cryptocurrency. Such an occurrence potentially signifies an upward trend for XRP, suggesting a possible decoupling from the broader altcoin market.

However, the past 24 hours witnessed a minor setback for the cryptocurrency, as it experienced a slump of 2.1%.  BTCUSD falls back into the $26K region.
