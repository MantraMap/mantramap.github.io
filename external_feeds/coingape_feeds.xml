According to the most recent reports, the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Western District of Washington issued subpoenas in recent months directing investment companies to provide details of their communications with the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">top cryptocurrency exchange Binance</a>.</p>
<h2>Binance In More Trouble?</h2>
<p>The subpoenas have been issued at a time when Binance, the largest crypto conglomerate in the world, is under increasing scrutiny from the media as well as the regulatory authorities on its business methods and financials. This criticism reached a fever pitch by the end of the previous year in the wake of the multi-billion-dollar implosion of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, which shook the trust of investors in an increasingly volatile and unsettled <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>.</p>
<p>However, according to legal specialists, the U.S. authorities are still examining the evidence at hand &amp; currently in discussion for a potential settlement with Binance; therefore indicating that the purportedly issued subpoenas do not aim towards pressing charges against the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> or the hedge funds in question.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></strong></em></p>
<p>During an interview, Binance&#8217;s Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, claimed the exchange regularly communicates with nearly &#8220;every regulator across the globe,&#8221; but would not elaborate on the status of any ongoing investigations in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>.</p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Growing Legal Issues</h2>
<p>According to legal experts, Binance has built quite an (in)famous reputation over the years by successfully dodging rules and exploiting legal loopholes to keep its business going in numerous countries. Legislators were concerned about the platform&#8217;s role in money laundering because the corporation had not previously required users to provide any sort of identification like a formal KYC. The crypto giant was <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-binance-dirtymoney/" rel="nofollow">reportedly</a> linked to the Russian dark web marketplace Hydra last year, with the leading media outlet calling it a &#8220;hub for hackers, fraudsters and drug traffickers&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, Binance vehemently denied the allegations and publicly objected to the report by issueing an official statement along with a blog from the company&#8217;s official Twitter profile.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reuters has it wrong again. </p>
<p>Now they&#39;re attacking our incredible law enforcement team. A team that we&#39;re incredibly proud of &#8211; they&#39;ve made crypto more secure for all of us. </p>
<p>Here’s the full statement we sent the reporter and a blog about our remarkable law enforcement team.</p>
<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1602287184400326656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Binance, as of late, has been exerting efforts to enhance its commitment to compliance. The exchange has made dire attempts to grow its workforce in the security &amp; compliance department by a factor of 500% back in 2022.</p>

This breakout will release the trapped bullish momentum and free the Ape price from the ongoing consolidation phase. Thus, how far may the potential rally will surge this altcoin.?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In ideal bullish conditions, the symmetrical triangle breakout may push the Apecoin price to $6</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-day EMA slope wavering near the $4.2 local resistance will try to offset the bullish thesis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Apecoin is $104.5. Million, indicating a 18% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EhWxtGs5.png" alt="Apecoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last four months, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/apecoin/">Apecoin</a> price has been moving under the influence of a solid resistance trendline and the 100-day EMA. However, in the last two months, growth in market demand has led to a 47% recovery and a support trendline in the daily chart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the converging trendline displays the formation of a symmetrical triangel pattern in the daily time frame chart. Moreover, the price action displays the recent recovery rally breaking above the pattern’s resistance trendline,  highlighting a bullish entry spot. However, the opposing trend in the daily volumes also warns of a failure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the coin price trades at $4.18 with an intraday gain of 3.3%, resulting in a bullish engulfing candle in the daily chart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the daily candle closes above the resistance trendline, an uptrend above the 100-day EMA will reach the overhead resistance of $5.1. Thus, the Apecoin price is expected to rise by 23% in the first few months of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the selling price drives the closing price under $4.2, the price may resonate further within the triangle pattern with increased fallout possibility. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> despite the Lower high peaks forming under the influence of the resistance trendline, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> shows a bullish growth. Thus leading to a bullish divergence in the daily chart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the 20 and 50-day EMA in the daily chart give a bullish crossover. Meanwhile, the market price jumps to challenge the 100-day EMA. A spike in market price is very likely if the bearish influence of the 100-day EMA ends. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apecoin intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $4.18</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $4.2 and $4.53</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $3.8 and $3.35</span></li>
</ul>

As a result of a breakout above the three-month descending channel, the price of LUNC experienced a significant increase over the past week. This is mostly attributable to the recent developments, initiatives, and increase in the LUNC burn rate by the Terra Classic community, as the price surge still appears to be continuing.</p>
<h2>Can Binance Push LUNC&#8217;s Price?</h2>
<p>Although, these developments have been the primary driving force behind the recent price movements; prominent LUNC validator and community evangelist, LUNC DAO, has pointed out a potential way through which the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> could see a major price boost.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-are-music-nfts-how-are-they-changing-music-industry/">What Are Music NFTs? How Are They Changing Music Industry?</a></em></p>
<p>The top Terra Classic validator predicted that the LUNC token was destined to appreciate in value if the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">leading Binance crypto exchange</a> removed its words of caution from the two major Terra <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> viz. USTC and LUNA.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$LUNC</a> Community</p>
<p>If we get this done (warnings removed from <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$USTC</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$LUNA</a>) then <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$LUNC</a> will pump.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>The Terra (LUNA) Fiasco</h2>
<p>Binance initially issued the warning statement back in early 2021 when <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/terra-luna/">Terra (LUNA)</a> first experienced its UST depeg which sent the price of the LUNA token on a death spiral. The latest words of caution come after the South Korean court issued an arrest warrant against Terra&#8217;s cofounder Daniel Shin. In addition, Korean authorities have also slapped criminal charges on Terra&#8217;s key developer and founder, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/do-kwon/">Do Kwon</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-134602 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07231856/FlVAN1TWYAEu4L5.jpg" alt="LUNC price" width="1075" height="402" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> also temporarily suspended <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/withdrawals-on-terra-luna-network-temporarily-suspended-dc02bedd65be40f7b10022f26bc06879" rel="nofollow">withdrawals</a> on the Terra network on May 10th, leading to many other exchanges following suit. And, Binance being one of the top exchanges to drive LUNA&#8217;s trade volume at the moment &#8212; the removal of the warning signs may lead to more investor interest and subsequent purchases &#8212; as per the Terra community.</p>

<p>As things stand, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/lunc/">LUNC</a> price is currently being traded at $0.00015317. This represents an increase of 0.54% on the day, in contrast to a massive gain of nearly 6% during the week as per the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker CoinMarketCap.</p>

While market participants remain uncertain, the price action walked sideways and created a narrow range between the mentioned support and $0.357 resistance. Thus, It has been three weeks since this meta coin has been trapped within the range and has limited the growth potential. However, the daily technical chart reveals this consolidation as the formation of a famous bullish reversal pattern candle double bottom. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a bullish pattern, the MANA price is set for a 20% upswing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The possible rejection from the $0.356 resistance will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Decentraland token is $116,6 Million, indicating a 207.99% gain. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a> is easily identified as it is shaped into a ‘W’ letter design. During the pattern formation, the price rebounded twice more fixed horizontal support twice, indicating price sustainability above base support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with the recent recovery in the crypto market, the MANA price rebounded from the $0.29-$0.2975 support on December 31st and surged 20% higher to hit $0.356 resistance. This barrier is also the neckline of this pattern, whose breakout will encourage further growth in MANA tokens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the MANA price trades at the $0.352 mark and shows a 7.5% intraday jump. This bullish candle tries to break the neckline resistance of $0.356 to trigger the bullish reversal pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a daily candle closing above the mentioned will accelerate the buying pressure and offer long entry opportunities for traders. This breakout could soar the MANA price 20% higher to hit the local resistance of $0.425.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if the prices can’t sustain above the $0.356 mark, the price consolidation will extend for a few more trading sessions.</span></p>

Moreover, the increasing gap between these slopes indicates sustained buying in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>DMAs:</strong> the 50 DMA is moving near the $0.356 mark, making this resistance even tougher to break out.</span></p>

The BTC price has battled to remain above $17,000 for a number of weeks now, but hasn&#8217;t been able to break the resistance and recently fell below the $ 16,900 mark for the first time in almost two months.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Still Not Bottomed</h2>
<p>The struggle doesn&#8217;t end here as Bitcoin may still be able to reach much lower prices in the future. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63b9461ffc4599123b26578f-THERE-IS-STILL-ROOM-FOR-BITCOIN-TO-PLUMMET" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from CryptoQuant, suggests that the price hasn&#8217;t bottomed out yet as many were expecting. During positive crypto market cycles, the price usually remains higher than the realized price. On the other hand, as a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/">bear market</a> is nearing its final capitulation phase, the price falls below the realized price, causing widespread panic.</p>
<p><span id="inputElements~9d3f78b9c3f2259a" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8">Realized Price</span><span id="inputElements~42554a717beaed32" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8"> is the measure of the average price weighted by the supply of what the entire market participants paid for their coins.</span><span id="inputElements~afe743667e67c537" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8"> It can be interpreted as an on-chain support or resistance price and is calculated as realized cap divided by the total coin supply.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134598" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07210652/chrome_5zKKneb7ZC.png" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Price" width="752" height="526" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, during this period, market players are under a great deal of stress, and as a result, they sell off their assets in order to prevent more losses and control their exposure to further <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> changes. Now, looking at previous cycles, the beginning of a bull market can be predicted by the BTC price outdoing the realized price. However, this has not yet occurred, as the price has been unable to break above a certain price point and recently got rejected to the downside with significant bearish momentum.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price To Remain Bearish?</h2>
<p>As a result, there is still room for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> to fall, and the end of the current bear market won&#8217;t be expected until the price surpasses the realized price, which is presently at $19.7K. Until then, the negative trend is expected to continue.</p>
<p>As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $16,970. This represents an increase of 0.82% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 2.07% during the week as per the crypto market tracker CoinMarketCap.</p>

Similar to a majority of altcoins, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/sandbox/">Sandbox</a> coin experienced a sustained rally since last week, registering a 22.5% growth. The coin price currently trades at $0.46 and shows further growth potential under the influence falling channel pattern.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A falling channel pattern is currently leading to the ongoing downfall in SAND price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the $0.46 resistance encourages the SAND price to a 15% jump.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in SAND price is $409.6 Million, indicating a 10% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/q/q4SBUN36.png" alt="Sandbox Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandbox price has shown an established downtrend for the past six months. However, this downfall, led by two parallel walking trendlines, reveals the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">falling channel pattern</a>. In theory, even though this pattern leads to a direction downtrend, the prices are encouraged for a massive bullish rally once its breaks the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent recovery in the crypto market, the SAND price showcased a v-shaped recovery from the $0.38 support and surged above a local resistance of $0.46. The long-bullish candle, backed by substantial volume, indicates the commitment of buyers to a bullish recovery.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://coingape.com/markets/top-metaverse-tokens-to-buy-for-a-great-start-of-2023/">Also read: Top Metaverse Tokens To Buy For A Great Start Of 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the daily candle closes above the $0.46 barrier, the buyers may obtain a suitable launchpad to jump high. With sustained buying, the coin price may rise another 15% to hit the resistance trendline of mentioned channel pattern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, for the Sand price to ride a directional bull run, the buyers must breach the resistance trendline. In ideal conditions, this breakout may bolster a bullish price rally to the top swing-high of the pattern, which is $1.5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the prices show reversal signs at the above trendline, the ongoing downtrend will prolong for a few more trading sessions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI</a> slope shows a sharp recovery from an oversold region to a bullish territory indicating the intense buying pressure in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> With the $0.46 resistance breakout, the SAND price also breached the 20-day EMA slope offering an extra edge for coin buyers.</span></p>

The unemployment rate falls to <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-bullish-us-job-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.5% in December</a> against the expected 3.7%. As a result, traders&#8217; sentiment improved about <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum prices.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell sharply after the jobs report, causing the crypto prices to build upside momentum. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices hit a high of $16,991 and $1,273, respectively. The prices are even the 7-day high for both dominant cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Risks Fall</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst CredibleCrypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1611580604122017793" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on January 6 said the Ethereum price has reached the level he earlier suggested and most likely the ETH price will continue to fall from here.</p>
<figure id="attachment_134589" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-134589" style="width: 736px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-134589" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07184437/Fl17W15aMAETYuW.jpg" alt="Ethereum price" width="736" height="412" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-134589" class="wp-caption-text">Ethereum Price in 4Hr Timeframe. Source: CredibleCrypto</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;RED region tagged. Expecting a rejection here in the coming days to take the sets of equal lows that we left behind.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He expects a rejection near the $1,270 level and a fall below the crucial support at $1,170. The ETH price has maintained above the crucial support level for a long time now, and a break of the level means a major turnaround in the crypto market.</p>
<p>Not just $1,150, he thinks the ETH price will fall below $1,080. While $1,170 is the best level to buy Ethereum for the long term, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whales</a> expect Ethereum accumulation below $1,100. However, the price may not hold below $1,170 and will rebound soon.</p>
<p>Crypto analyst <a href="https://coingape.com/key-highlights-from-fomc-minutes-bitcoin-and-ethereum-bull-run-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael van de Poppe suggested</a> that Ethereum price can have a better upside move before a correction near the FOMC meeting in early February. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,265, moving sideways with low trading volume.</p>
<h2>Will ETH Price Rally Sustain?</h2>
<p>Ethereum price is currently trading at $1,264, up 2% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $1,240 and $1,273, respectively. The trading volume is flat as traders anticipate a fall in prices.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has been a large order of 26,000 ETH put options with a strike price of $400 and an expiration date of Jun 30. Some traders believe this is the tail management behavior of crypto whales.</p>

Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal even indirectly traded BONK tokens and liked the user experience at the Solana <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a>, as per Bonk Inu&#8217;s Twitter handle. The BONK price soared 42% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Polygon Co-founder Sandeep Nailwal Traded BONK Tokens</h2>
<p>Bonk Inu in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/bonk_inu/status/1611515944840429568" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on January 7 claimed that user experience on the Solana blockchain is so good that even Polygon&#8217;s co-founder Sandeep Nailwal experienced using BONK tokens.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;It seems Solana’s user experience is so good the cofounder of Polygon can’t help but to play with </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a rel='nofollow'  class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&amp;src=cashtag_click" rel="nofollow">$BONK</a></span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">?&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>It <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/0xFrisk/status/1611511814331961344" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cited a tweet</a> that claims Polygon co-founder funded a wallet <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">that&#8217;s been trading </span><span class="r-18u37iz">BONK</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> tokens. Therefore, he is also familiar with Solana DeFi.</span></p>
<p>The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://solscan.io/account/2rHtaAFv92ohSzAYR5dZQnGF6MNVCS6GfE2PGoPXLb37#splTransfers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blockchain data</a> reveals the alternative account received over 300 million BONK tokens. The account is actively trading BONK tokens.</p>
<p>Polygon co-founder earlier agreed that the Solana chain is unstable. Polygon even paid $3 million to DeLabs to migrate its Solana-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> projects DeGods and Y00ts to migrate chains. The projects were the top 2 NFT collections on Solana, driving almost 70% sale volume on Solana. It caused the SOL price to plummet below $10.</p>
<p>However, the BONK hype saved Solana from collapsing and lifted the SOL price to over $14.50. The BONK price also rallied over 4000% in a week. Currently, several projects and Dapps are coming onto the Solana blockchain, which may further increase Solana&#8217;s utility.</p>

<h2>Can Solana and BONK Rally Again?</h2>
<p>Both Solana and BONK continue to trend on Crypto Twitter and CoinMarketCap. The Solana price is currently trading sideways after a 35% rally this week. The SOL price is $13.17.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the BONK price also witnessed profit-taking after a 4000% rally this week. The BONK price is currently trading at $0.000002191, up over 40% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Crain in the screenshot on Twitter said he is taking full ownership and they over-hired. The 9 million USD Series A fundraising for SuperRare was led by Velvet Sea Ventures and 1confirmation in March 2021.</p>
<p>Crain said, &#8220;to correct course, we have made the difficult decision to rightsize our team, ensuring that SuperRare Labs will be able to continue serving our community of artists, collectors and curators while remaining the destination for the best cryptoart in the world.”</p>
<h2>NFT marketplace was funded by renowned personalities</h2>
<p>The CEO claimed that Web3, NFTs, cryptoart, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/">decentralized finance</a>, and governance are still in need of significant innovation and reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are facing headwinds, yes &#8211; but there remains an incredible uncaptured opportunity as we continue building something totally new: a global digital art renaissance that is transparent, fair and that anyone can access from anywhere in the world,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the global economy is uncertain, our mission to build the foundation for new, peer-to-peer economies feels more urgent and important than ever. Winter is our time to build,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Celebrities like Ashton Kutcher, Marc Benioff, and Mark Cuban contributed to the NFT startup. Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, a top NFT marketplace, said earlier last year that around 20% of the company&#8217;s workforce would be let go.</p>
<h2>Mass Layoffs Continue Amid Crypto Winter</h2>
<p>Huobi’s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/justin-sun/">Justin Sun</a> confirmed the news of Huobi slashing down its workforce by 20%. According to a report, earlier the firm was forcing its employees to accept payment in USDC/USDT instead of fiat currency.</p>
<p>The turmoil from FTX has hit the crypto-focused bank Silvegate. In the preliminary report published by then for the last quarter of 2022. It indicated a huge withdrawal of cryptos worth 8 billion USD. Following this, the firm has decided to lay off its 200 employees, which accounts for 40% of the workforce.</p>
<p>According to reports, Genesis Global is cutting off its workforce by another 30% as the firm faces heat for lending millions to the crypto empire of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>.</p>

In the detailed piece of writing, he tends to connect the apex of Western Exceptionalism, the resurrection of Eurasia and the Failure of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX. However, <a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-to-plead-not-guilty-next-week-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBF, who is on house arrest</a> came out to reply to Hayes.</p>
<h2>Hayes blames SBF</h2>
<p>Hayes stated that he is done talking about SBF and the collapse of FTX and it is not fun anymore when a person doesn’t want to fight back. However, he predicted that the SBF will be posting some bland, carefully crafted tweets to render himself before the trial.</p>
<p>However, he added that there is still a final lesson to be learned from the FTX debacle and what have been its repercussions on global macroeconomics and political perspective. He mentioned that TradFi system will unconsciously try to cozy up to individuals and firms they believe will continue to support the supremacy of the fait-led financial order.</p>
<p>The last chapter highlighted that SBF was very clear about his belief in operating a centralised crypto business was one of the best ways to earn the most amount of money and that too in the shortest time. While he believed that he could give it all away for the betterment of humanity.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1611543508225232897" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SBF came forward</a> to reply over the matter and stated that he obviously strongly disagrees with many specific FTX linked allegations. He largely agrees with Arthur Hayes&#8217;s higher level point. While it turned out to be the same thing he is overseeing again.</p>

<p>The renowned musician is creating new opportunities for up-and-coming musicians. However, his digital music platform is where musicians can directly upload their works and make money from them. Rahman will also make some of his original works available on the Katraar platform.</p>
<p>This Metaverse platform will soon feature many works from around the world. The HBAR foundation is collaborating on the platform&#8217;s development, which will be made available on the Hedera Network.</p>
<p>Rahman is renowned for both his musical contributions and his international collaborations. Director Mani Ratnam took notice of him, and Rahman began composing the music for his Tamil movie &#8220;Roja.&#8221; Later on, he also worked for Bombay and Dil Se. He received two Oscars. He has also received six national film awards and the Padma Bhushan.</p>
<h3><b>Kartik previously announced metaverse space</b></h3>
<p>India&#8217;s first music NFTs were previously announced by Tamil singer Karthik, who will perform in the metaverse. As part of his metaverse concept, Karthik launched the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-biggest-music-nfts-to-look-in-2023/">music NFTs</a></strong> on April 14. As one of India&#8217;s first <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT marketplaces</a>, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.jupitermeta.io/">Jupiter Meta</a> will list the NFTs.</p>
<p>The introduction of NFT is a turning point for the music business because it will grant artists ownership of their creative output and put them in touch with their fans. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a></strong> will benefit artists and creators in a variety of ways. These music videos will encourage a sense of ownership and financial flexibility in their listeners.</p>

Fintech giant’s shareholders voted to implement a series of adjustments that will see the billionaire&#8217;s departure from Ant Group, Reuters <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ant-group-says-jack-ma-relinquishes-control-company-2023-01-07/" rel="nofollow">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Chinese regulators had stopped Ant Group’s planned $37 billion IPO in Hong Kong in 2020.</p>
<h2>Jack Ma controlled 53.46% of Ant Group&#8217;s shares</h2>
<p>Ant Group said in a statement that it is adjusting its ownership structure in a way so that “no shareholder, alone or jointly with other parties, will have control over Ant Group.”</p>
<p>Previously, Jack Ma indirectly was responsible for the company’s nearly 54% shares. With new structure adjustments, the Chinese billioanire will only hold around 6.2% of the voting rights in the company. Chinese regulators have not been kind to Alibaba founder since his comments about government regulation policies. Earlier, Alibaba was hit with a $2.75 billion fine for alleged unfair practices.</p>
<h2>Will Ant Group continue to invest in Metaverse?</h2>
<p>China-based companies Alibaba and Ant Group both have invested in <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/">metaverse </a>at some capacity. Alibaba invested $60 million in Chinese<a href="https://coingape.com/future-rulers-of-the-metaverse-top-5-augmented-reality-companies/"> augmented reality</a> glasses maker Nreal last year in May. Ant Group remained bullish on metaverse and virtual reality throughout the year. However, with Jack Ma’s exit as leading shareholder in the firm, it will be interesting to see how the fintech giant will approach metaverse.</p>
<h2>Where is Jack Ma?</h2>
<p>In 2021, Alibaba founder completely disappeared from public view after Ant Group’s IPO was torched by Chinese regulators and his other businesses were also scrutinized. There have been several reports as to where Jack Ma has been residing all these months. Reuters reported that the Chinese billionaire was <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.reuters.com/article/thailand-jackma/chinese-billionaire-jack-ma-spotted-in-bangkok-thai-media-reports-idINL1N33S05T" rel="nofollow">spotted</a> socializing in Bangkok this week.</p>
<p>Jack Ma has not made any public comments since he slammed Chinese financial regulators back in 2022 in Shanghai. .</p>

However, recent updates coming from the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/shiba-inu-shib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu</a> ecosystem have motivated and assured the community of some good times ahead amid the increased volatility in the market.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu among favs of ETH whales?</h2>
<p>As per the report, Shiba Inu Ecosystem’s long planned Layer 2 blockchain solution, <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-shiba-inus-shibarium-beta-launch-almost-here-says-official-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shibarium dropped a much anticipated update</a>. It highlighted that the Beta launch is expected to happen in early 2023.</p>
<p>It mentioned that Shiba Inu’s Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) token will serve as the required gas token within <a href="https://coingape.com/is-shiba-inus-shibarium-launch-coming-in-early-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Shibarium</a>. However, this time it added that each transaction done will burn the Shiba Inu token in the process.</p>
<p>This recent announcement has pumped the Ethereum whales to add more Shiba Inu in their wallets. As per Whalestats, SHIB token flipped Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) for the most traded token among the top 1000 whales. <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-ethereum-whales-scoop-shib-tokens-ahead-of-shibarium-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Shiba Inu News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>While a whale address named BlueWhale0159 bought 187 billion Shiba Inu token in a single transaction. The total worth of the purchase stands at around $1.5 million.</p>
<p>As per the data, Shiba Inu is in the top 10 list of tokens purchased by the largest 100 ETH whales in the last 24 hours. SHIB token also made it the most used smart contract by the same whales.</p>
<p>Data suggests that the top 100 ETH whales are now cumulatively holding $44.2 million worth of Shiba Inu tokens with them. This makes up just 2% of their total holdings.</p>
<h2>Will SHIB Burn help its price to surge?</h2>
<p>The update from the Shibarium depicts that the BONE will be the only crypto for transactions in Shibarium. While Shiba Inu holders (which hold over 1 million SHIBs) will need to make transactions in Shibarium to burn their tokens.</p>
<p>With every transaction, SHIB tokens will be sent to a dead wallet. This move will help the community to lock in huge amounts of SHIB tokens which can boost the Shiba Inu price in the future.</p>

Gox has been changed from July 31 to September 30, a delay of two months. The start date for payments has also been pushed back two months and is now March 10.</p>
<p>Additionally, the deadline for providing banking and cryptocurrency exchange details has been moved from January 10 to March 10. The deadline was extended, according to former CEO Mark Karpeles, who stated this in a Telegram chat message, because a sizeable number of people had not yet submitted their information.</p>
<p>There is a base payment that will be made to each creditor. Moreover, they will either accept an early lump sum payment or decide to accept a later payment that may be for a different sum. Payments may be made in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fiat-money/">fiat money</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>, or both. The recipient&#8217;s bank account or <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> will receive this.</p>

<h2>The probable effects of Kraken exist</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/kraken/">Kraken</a>&#8216;s departure from Japan may not have an impact on the majority of debtors or repayments, but it may pose issues for Japanese customers who want to convert their cryptocurrency to fiat money and withdraw to a local bank account.</p>
<p>There have been rumours among Mt. Gox creditors that the timing modification may be connected to Kraken&#8217;s withdrawal from the Japanese market as a crypto exchange. It was one of the exchanges that creditors may choose from to get their cryptocurrency payments. However, the exchange announced that following global layoffs, it planned to quit the Japanese market in January.</p>

<p>Some creditors said that the new deadline will make it easier for them to verify their crypto exchange details in time for the current deadline. They have been facing difficulty doing so in the past. In the Mt. Gox creditors Telegram channel, one creditor claimed to be from Japan and to have registered Kraken as their exchange. They signed up for two more exchanges after learning about Kraken&#8217;s intention to exit the country so they could offer an alternative method of payment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still waiting for both exchanges to complete my KYC, I will most likely miss the Jan 10th deadline. For me, the extension was needed, I do sympathise with everyone who isn&#8217;t in my predicament,&#8221; they said.</p></blockquote>
