<p>Gary Harmon, 31, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-sentenced-stealing-over-712-bitcoin-subject-forfeiture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentenced</a> Thursday in Washington, DC, by US District Judge Beryl Howell, after pleading guilty in January. He also agreed to give up cryptocurrency and other assets worth more than $20 million.</p>



<p>Harmon pled guilty to criminal charges in January, facing one count of wire fraud and one count of obstruction of justice, each having a potential penalty of 40 years.</p>



<p>He obtained the 712 Bitcoin in question after his brother&#8217;s incarceration in February 2020. The money was valued at about $4.8 million at the time they were stolen, according to the Justice Department.</p>



<p>Harmon acknowledged in April 2020 that he used his brother&#8217;s credentials to replicate eight Bitcoin wallets held on a device in an Internal Revenue Service evidence locker. The Bitcoin he stole was one of 4,877 digital tokens seized from his brother, Larry Dean Harmon, who was arrested in February 2020 for operating Helix, a coin-mixing service that processed over 350,000 Bitcoin between 2014 and 2017 and partnered with several darknet markets, according to the Justice Department.</p>



<p>Larry Dean Harmon subsequently pled guilty in 2021 to a money laundering conspiracy and crimes related to unlawful money transfer. In addition to criminal charges, Larry Dean Harmon was fined $60 million by The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the first time a Bitcoin mixer was penalized.</p>



<p>Though proponents of coin mixers have described them as necessary tools for ensuring the privacy of crypto transactions, government officials have attacked the services, claiming that they are critical to hackers and other bad actors.</p>



<p>After the Bitcoin vanished from the IRS device, agents discovered a photo on Gary Harmon&#8217;s cellphone of him smiling in a tub full of cash at a nightclub. Authorities claim he used 68 Bitcoin as collateral for a $1.2 million loan and used part of the funds to purchase a luxurious property in Cleveland.</p>



<p>According to court records, Harmon attended two bail hearings for his brother and discovered in court that the authorities needed the difficult seed phrase to access the Bitcoin that his brother had placed on a Trezor device. Someone with the phrase and an extra PIN may steal Bitcoin from another device.</p>



<p>Law enforcement confiscated multiple assets as part of that case, including a cryptocurrency storage device that couldn&#8217;t be accessed at first owing to specific security measures, according to the Justice Department.</p>



<p>Harmon&#8217;s lawyer said that his client had been held in very severe circumstances for the last 21 months. He&#8217;d requested a three-year term.</p>

<p>This week, Genesis, Digital Currency Group, the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC), the Creditor Committee, and Gemini have agreed to begin a 30-day mediation process to come to a final resolution soon as possible. An order from Bankruptcy Judge Lane directing the mediation is expected to be entered as early as Monday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Earn update: This past week, Genesis, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC), the Creditor Committee, and Gemini agreed to start a 30-day mediation process to drive to a final resolution as soon as possible.</p>&mdash; Gemini (@Gemini) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1652779387970899969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 30, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The mediation will focus on Digital Currency Group&#8217;s economic contribution to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of all creditors, including Earn users, and is designed to resolve the Genesis bankruptcy plan. By way of background, a Term Sheet reflecting an agreement in principle was filed on February 10, 2023. Last week, the UCC presented revised terms to DCG for its contribution to the Genesis creditors based on the UCC&#8217;s continuing investigation.</p>



<p>The proposed mediation provides for two meetings before May 8th. This is an essential date because, on May 9th-11th, DCG owes the Genesis bankruptcy estate $630 million (money due for all creditors&#8217; benefit). If DCG cannot pay and/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations. So while the mediation is scheduled for up to 30 days, the parties are expected to work expeditiously towards agreement in the immediate window.</p>



<p>Gemini supports the mediation and looks forward to starting it next week and working with the parties to conclude it. They have also expressed frustration with the pace of progress among the parties and the need for urgency. The next status conference with the Court will be on May 4th.</p>



<p>This mediation process is crucial for the future of Genesis and DCG, and the outcome will impact all the creditors involved. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as they become available.</p>

<p>The Sui network, with 100 globally distributed validators, recently achieved peak throughput ranging from 10,871 TPS to 297,000 TPS on various workloads.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>To achieve high-fidelity and realistic performance results, Sui&#8217;s performance characterization was conducted using a globally-distributed setup that mirrored Mainnet regarding hardware configurations, number of validators, the geographic distribution of validators, and voting power distribution. A scalable load generator was explicitly developed for this exercise.</p>



<p>One of Sui&#8217;s most powerful core developer primitives is Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTB), which allows developers to customize their applications by constructing increasingly sophisticated PTBs. As Sui&#8217;s programmability was highly expressive even before PTB, a single execution can perform up to 1024 heterogeneous operations, each of which would otherwise be an individual transaction on most other blockchains.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2022.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="540" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2022.png" alt="BREAKING: Sui Network&#039;s Mainet To Launch On May 3rd " class="wp-image-184825" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2022.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2022-300x162.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2022-768x415.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2022-750x405.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="BREAKING: Sui Network&#039;s Mainet To Launch On May 3rd 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Sui&#8217;s time to finality is approximately 480 milliseconds, a promising result for the protocol&#8217;s future. The time to finality measures the point in the transaction lifecycle where both the transaction itself as well as the effects of the transaction are final and can be used in subsequent transactions. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2023.png"><img decoding="async" width="626" height="83" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2023.png" alt="BREAKING: Sui Network&#039;s Mainet To Launch On May 3rd " class="wp-image-184826" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2023.png 626w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2023-300x40.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" title="BREAKING: Sui Network&#039;s Mainet To Launch On May 3rd 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Sui protocol has come a long way from its inception and has shown promising early performance results. Yet there are still many opportunities for optimization and scalability. In the near future, scalability and coverage of benchmark tooling, horizontal scalability to support intra-validator scaling across multiple machines, and resilience to under-performance of individual validators will be refined on Sui.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>What is Sui Network?</strong></h3>



<p>Sui is a blockchain that offers low latency and high throughput, making it ideal for on-chain use cases like DeFi and GameFi due to its instant transaction finality. The blockchain is created using Rust, a programming language that prioritizes fast and secure transaction execution. Notably, Rust is also used by Solana, another high-speed blockchain.</p>

<p>The hacker acquired access to hundreds of crypto wallets, which most likely belonged to Russian law enforcement organizations, by employing abstruse abilities. Analysts at Chainalysis believe the hacker used a feature of the bitcoin blockchain that documents transactions to identify 986 wallets controlled by the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation (GRU), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and the Federal Security Service (FSB).</p>



<p>At the same time, the hacker wrote messages in Russian to the wallet owners, claiming that the wallets were used to pay for the services of Russian hackers. The extent to which these claims are genuine is unknown. Western analysts believe that Russian intelligence services deploy hackers in a variety of missions.</p>



<p>Third parties have already linked at least three of the allegedly Russian wallets to Russia, they say. Two of them are suspected of being involved in the Solar Winds attack, while the third paid for servers used in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184486-russian-bitcoin-wallet-leaked/">Russia</a>&#8216;s disinformation effort during the 2016 elections.</p>

<p>Analysts at Chainalysis believe the hacker obtained control of the wallets, which he claims were controlled by Russian intelligence services, through &#8220;inside work&#8221; rather than hacking.Simply put, this person may have entered the Russian hacking structure, or he could have been a Russian special services employee who later defected.</p>



<p>The individual was first intended to simply trash the stolen monies in the Russian special services&#8217; wallets. According to Chainalysis, the mystery attacker deleted bitcoins worth approximately $300,000 using the bitcoin blockchain&#8217;s OP_RETURN feature (this function allows you to invalidate previously executed transactions).</p>



<p>According to Chainalysis, after the war began, several of the wallets included in this research transferred cash to Ukrainian government wallets. The unknown hacker stopped burning money and began sending it to help Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;The fact that the OP_RETURN sender was both willing and able to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars&#8217; worth of bitcoin in order to spread their message makes it more likely in our opinion that their information is accurate,&#8221; Chainalysis analysts concluded.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-30/bitcoin-s-btc-four-month-winning-run-brings-100-000-in-view-if-history-right?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto#xj4y7vzkg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-30/bitcoin-s-btc-four-month-winning-run-brings-100-000-in-view-if-history-right?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto#xj4y7vzkg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent gains have led to bullish projections for the cryptocurrency, as analysts from Standard Chartered Bank, BCA Research, and Bloomberg Intelligence predict a potential climb to $100,000 or more. Bitcoin is currently on track to climb for the fourth consecutive month, a streak that has historically signaled a surge of around 260% over the following year.</p>



<p>This recent jump in price has re-established Bitcoin&#8217;s core use case as a decentralized, trustless, and scarce digital asset, which has drawn the attention of various investors. The cryptocurrency has changed its narrative garb over the years, with the latest surge being supported by bets on a Federal Reserve pivot to looser monetary policy, the perceived blow to fiat currency from the US banking crisis, and a planned reduction in the supply of new tokens &#8211; a so-called halving &#8211; due next year.</p>



<p>Despite the bullish projections and positive market conditions, Bitcoin and other virtual assets remain exposed to various risks, including a crackdown by US regulators and the possibility of traders paring back expectations of friendlier Federal Reserve policy. It&#8217;s essential to recognize these risks and navigate the volatile market to reap the potential benefits of investing in cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency market is complicated and uncertain, with multiple drivers influencing its narratives and opening up new opportunities for investing cohorts. As such, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent gains show that the cryptocurrency remains a lightning rod for liquidity and a resilient investment option for those willing to navigate its risks and volatility.</p>

<p>According to the data provided by the cryptocurrency intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, significant market participants in the cryptocurrency space spent the previous week purchasing more than 6.4 trillion Shiba Inu tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Wednesday, there were 1.39 trillion <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182967-3-1-trillion-shiba-inu-voyager-binance/">SHIB</a> tokens acquired, making it the busiest day of the week. To this point, there have been 124 major customers who have provided their addresses in Shiba Inu. This number comprises all of the addresses that were responsible for at least one percent of the overall trading volume on Shiba Inu.</p>



<p>On the other hand, contrary to what the preceding line might lead one to believe, things are not always running smoothly around Shiba Inu. It is estimated that the number of SHIB tokens sold by major players was 6.5 trillion, which is an increase of 100 billion over the amount that was purchased. In addition, there are 149 addresses of major sellers of the product.</p>

<p>At the same time, the price of SHIB has shown a fall of 1% at the time of writing, which is not very important at all. This occurred at the conclusion of the week. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the weekly extremes were set at 5% both up and down from the opening price. This is one of the most important things to keep in mind.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the outperformance of bears over bulls by 100 billion SHIB did not have a significant impact on the price of the token. The cryptocurrency market as a whole saw a stormy week, and so did the Shiba Inu market specifically. Throughout the week, the initiative in trading frequently switched from sellers to buyers and back again.</p>

<p>According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s official website, the SEC filed settlement charges against the encryption ATM company Coinme, the encryption project Up Global, and Neil Bergquist, the two companies&#8217; CEO, and fined a total of roughly $4 million US dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up Global was charged by the SEC of deceiving investors in the 2017 ICO and engaging in unregistered sales of encrypted asset securities, for which Coinme was jointly and severally liable, and Bergquist was also barred from serving as a director of publicly traded businesses for the next three years.</p>



<p>According to the order, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/140360-coinmetro-closed-7-million-funding-round/">Coinme</a>, Up Global, and Bergquist engaged in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities from October 16, 2017 to December 15, 2017, during which they marketed, among other things, the financial benefit that UpToken investors would reap from this firm purchasing UpToken in the secondary market after the ICO. </p>

<p>The order also finds that, unbeknownst to UpToken investors, Bergquist and Up Global took steps prior to and during the ICO to obtain an UpToken supply that would significantly reduce Coinme&#8217;s need to purchase UpToken after the ICO, and that Bergquist and Up Global knowingly or recklessly publicly inflated amounts raised in the ICO.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s ruling concludes that Coinme, Up Global, and Bergquist violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Coinme, Up Global, and Bergquist agreed to resolve the allegations, cease and desist from future violations of those provisions, and comply with specific undertakings without admitting or rejecting the SEC&#8217;s conclusions.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Up Global agreed to pay a $3,520,000 penalty, for which Coinme is jointly and severally liable; Coinme agreed to pay a separate $250,000 penalty; and Bergquist agreed to pay a $150,000 penalty. Bergquist is also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public business for three years, according to the SEC decision.</p>
