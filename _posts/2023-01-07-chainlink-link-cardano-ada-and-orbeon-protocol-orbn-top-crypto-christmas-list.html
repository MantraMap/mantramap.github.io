<p>There are thousands of cryptocurrency projects to choose from this Christmas but three that have significantly stood out include Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA), and of course Orbeon Protocol (ORBN).</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) are starting to look great again after entering the green zone lately but it is Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) that has created the biggest buzz in the crypto world because of the huge gains seen by its presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol is currently in phase 3 of its presale and already seeing price hikes of 805%. It is even expected to hit a 6000% price increase at the end of the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the three coins to see why they are the best candidates for your December and early January investment list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chainlink (LINK) Still Going Strong</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) is an innovative platform powered by blockchain technology that helps to build smart contracts that are universally connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its major goal is to connect data from different sources outside the blockchain to smart contracts. To achieve these goals, Chainlink uses external payment methods and data feeds.</p>
<p>Despite the dominance of market bears in 2022, Chainlink (LINK) still remains resilient in the green zone with recent price hikes of up to 18%. If the trend continues, Chainlink (LINK) could potentially provide investors with a good ROI in 2023. Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $5.68 and&nbsp; the volume on Chainlink (LINK) currently its around $220 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cardano (ADA) Fluctuating But Showing Signs of Growth&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most traders would say that Cardano (ADA) has been showing mixed results lately but from a long-term perspective, the token has a lot of promise. Cardano (ADA) is a third-generation platform powered by blockchain technology. It was launched in 2017.</p>
<p>Cardano&rsquo;s utility lies in building smart contracts for developing decentralized applications. Cardano (ADA) is also energy-efficient because it uses proof-of-stake consensus in its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price of Cardano (ADA) has had a few dips in the past weeks in tandem with the rest of the crypto tokens, especially after the FTX downfall but has shown signs of bouncing back in 2023. It is worth keeping an eye on Cardano (ADA) as you speculate on the best coins this holiday season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Rise of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Looks Unstoppable</p>
<p>Judging by the huge success of its current presale, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is definitely your best bet this holiday season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blockchain-based decentralized investment platform does what no other cryptocurrency project has managed to achieve before. It creates a great opportunity for regular people to enter the previously prohibitive venture capital industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startups also benefit from the platform by reaching out to a wider pool of interested investors and raising capital within a shorter time than they would with traditional angel investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol provides a much-needed solution in the crowdfunding and venture capital industry that was previously dominated by the big sharks and red-tape bureaucracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol allows retail investors to buy into promising startups through the use of its NFTs-as-a-service (NFTaas). Any company seeking to raise funds can use the service to mint equity-based NFTs that are then fractionalized and sold to investors for as low as 1 dollar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the practical utility of the Orbeon Protocol, its token ORBN is seeing massive gains in the first stage of its presale. Industry experts predict that the price of ORBN will attain a 6000% gain in the next few weeks when the presale ends.&nbsp;</p>
