					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is still strangling at the $16,000 price level with no significant movement up or down. This is normal given the historically low rates of volatility that are being recorded in the market. However, there may be some good rallies in the near future for the digital asset, but it depends on what BTC whales do. Bitcoin Whales Not Interested A look at bitcoin whale transactions over the month of December shows that whale interest in the digital asset has been on the decline. This coincides with the low price ranges of BTC during this time, and with such little movement, it becomes harder to flip a profit. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Mining Hashrate May Not Be Out Of The Woods Just Yet These whale transactions carrying $1 million and above have seen a decline in recent times. This shows a lack of interest in both buying and selling from these large investors. As a result, the price of bitcoin has continued to stagnate between $16,600 and $16,800. In essence, this lack of activity from the large BTC whales is neither bullish nor bearish. The next trend, however, will be decided from what these large holders decide to do from here. BTC whale interest declines in crypto winter &#124; Source: Santiment As this Santiment chart shows, a decline in whale interest has usually coincided with periods of low prices. However, if there were to be some significant accumulation from these large holders, then the price of bitcoin will begin another bull rally. Since whale transactions carrying at least $1 million are sitting at a 2-year low, it makes for a prime setup for at least a short-term rally. If the whales increase their BTC holdings during this time, the impact on the price of BTC will become apparent right away. How High Can BTC Go? Santiment notes that an accumulation trend from these large whales would trigger a historically bullish signal for the digital asset. This means that such events have always led to an upward rally in the past. When this happened in August 2021, it triggered the rally that saw bitcoin hit its all-time high price of $69,000. BTC price falls below $16,700 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com This time around, with the BTC price sitting so low, such a trend would lead to at least a 10% increase in the price of the digital asset. From here, a 10% increase would mean that bitcoin would surpass the $20,000 level once more, although a lot of resistance from the bears would be expected at such levels. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Beats The Odds With 16% Rally, More Gains Ahead However, on the flip side, a continued decline will increase selling pressure on BTC from here. That would mean a reversal toward the $15,000 level once more. Now, it becomes a waiting game to see what happens first. BTC&#8217;s price was sitting at $16,684 at the time of this writing.

					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu price has moved south on its chart over the last 24 hours. In the same time frame, SHIB depreciated by 3%. In the past week, the meme coin also did not register gains, losing a few support lines after losing close to 6% of its market value. SHIB has now formed a pattern that indicates that the coin might witness a breakout to the upside in the coming 24 hours. The technical outlook still displays bearish signs on the daily chart. Sellers have remained in control of the price for most of this month. Buyers still have to come to the rescue for SHIB to follow through with an upside breakout. According to the technicals, the coin might fall on its chart over the immediate trading sessions and then move to the upside. The trading volume of SHIB declined, which supports the notion that buyers have remained low in the market. At the moment, SHIB is trading 90% below its all-time high, which the coin secured almost one year ago. Related Reading: Uniswap Tops Other Big Crypto In Social Dominance Despite Price Drop Shiba Inu Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.0000080 at the time of writing. Over the past week, the Shiba Inu price fell from the $0.0000082 support line. Shiba Inu is expected to fall below the $0.0000080 level as buying strength remains low. It has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern which re-affirms that the coin could witness a rally due to a breakout. The first local support stood at $0.0000076, after which the meme coin is expected to break out. The breakout will cause the Shiba Inu price to rally to $0.00000824, and clearing that resistance will take the coin to $0.0000086. The amount of Shiba Inu traded in the last session declined, which explains why buyers remained low. Technical Analysis SHIB was in the sellers&#8217; dominance zone for November and December. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40 mark after the recent fall in price. The indicator&#8217;s reading displayed that sellers exceeded buyers at press time, indicating bearishness. On the same note, due to a lack of demand, SHIB traveled below the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. If SHIB remains above the $0.0000080 mark, the meme coin will move above the 20-SMA. Other technical indicators have also sided with the possibility of SHIB&#8217;s value dropping on its chart. The Parabolic SAR demonstrates the price direction and the trend of the asset. The indicator was above the price candlesticks, which indicates that the price is in a continued downtrend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents price momentum and trend reversals. MACD continued to paint red histograms, which meant that this was an indication for traders to sell, as that would mean that the price of SHIB could increase.

<p>Other technical indicators have also sided with the possibility of SHIB&#8217;s value dropping on its chart. The Parabolic SAR demonstrates the price direction and the trend of the asset. The indicator was above the price candlesticks, which indicates that the price is in a continued downtrend.</p>
<p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents price momentum and trend reversals. MACD continued to paint red histograms, which meant that this was an indication for traders to sell, as that would mean that the price of SHIB could increase.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The current Bitcoin cycle might be its &#8220;most challenging&#8221; one yet if the drawdown in this on-chain metric is anything to go by. Total Amount Held By 1k-10k BTC Value Band Has Sharply Gone Down Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the latest drawdown in the holdings of the 1k-10k BTC value band is the most drastic in the history of the crypto. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;UTXO Value Bands,&#8221; which tells us the total amount of coins each value band is holding in the market. UTXOs are divided into these &#8220;value bands&#8221; or groups based on their current value. For instance, the 100-1k BTC value band includes all UTXOs carrying between 100 and 1,000 coins. Here, the relevant UTXO value band is the 1k-10k BTC range, a historically important cohort as usually only the whales have wallets with UTXO amounts so large. Now, the below chart displays the trend in the total holdings of this value band over the last five years: Looks like the value of the metric has rapidly declined in recent months &#124; Source: CryptoQuant The graph shows that the total number of coins held by this Bitcoin UTXO value band has seen a sharp drop this year. In all, the drawdown has amounted to 453,205.04 BTC being dumped by this cohort since the peak observed in June 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selling Power Plunges, Green Signal For Price? For comparison, in the 2018/19 bear market, the 1k-10k BTC value band saw a total drawdown of 324,868.65 BTC from the high. During the COVID black swan crash of 2020, the group also distributed a significant amount, shedding 186,928.48 from its holdings. And in the bull run during the first half of last year, these whales reduced their holdings by 407,457.14 BTC between the peak in February and the July bottom. The latest drawdown in the metric&#8217;s value is the sharpest that Bitcoin has seen yet.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto winter is a drawn-out one exacerbated by the collapse of large players such as Terra and the FTX crypto exchange. As crypto businesses continue to feel the effects of the current bear market, another major player, Kraken, has been affected to the point that it has, once again, put a pause on operations in Japan. Kraken Consolidating For Crypto The Bear Market Crypto exchange Kraken plans to stop operations in the Japanese market. The exchange said this in a government publication in the country which states that it will deregister from the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) on Jan. 31, 2023.

The decision comes just a month after Kraken revealed that it was laying off about 30% of its workforce. Given the size of the company and the amount of labor it employs, this came out to about 1,100 employees who lost their jobs at the crypto exchange.

					<description><![CDATA[The Terra Classic (LUNC) price has been boosted in recent days by a rumor that the world&#8217;s second-largest exchange, Coinbase, might buy and list the token. As NewsBTC reported, the rumor originated from an anonymous source in the Terra Classic community. However, the credibility of the rumor is more than questionable. Nevertheless, the community seemed to believe the rumor that Coinbase has approved the purchase of $245 million in LUNC and will make the listing on the exchange public on January 3. The price subsequently rose from a low of $0.000125988 on Dec. 22 to a three-week high of $0.000185499 on Dec. 27. With this, the Terra Luna predecessor token saw a price increase of around 46%, bucking the current market trend. Related Reading: Terra Luna Classic Up 6% On Rumor That Coinbase Is Buying LUNC However, the euphoria was dampened today by Binance after the crypto exchange announced that it is making changes to the Terra Classic trading fee burn. Binance stated that following recent developments as outlined in proposal 10983 and proposal 11111, it will burn 50% of LUNC spot and margin trading fees instead of 100% starting in December 2022. By doing so, Binance is following the community&#8217;s proposals that LUNC burn will be converted into a development fund. Binance&#8217;s change is thus done in line with the community&#8217;s intent to further reduce LUNC supply and in line with what they have agreed upon. To allow time for these new updates to be implemented, Binance will delay sending out the LUNC trading fee burn postings until January 3, 2023. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Beats The Odds With 16% Rally, More Gains Ahead &#8220;Binance will continue to work with the community to support the implementation of this new plan, and if for any reason this is not possible, Binance will consider removing the burn contribution in the future,&#8221; the exchange added. LUNC Price Poised For More Gains? Since the high on December 27, the LUNC price has already lost about 16% of its price appreciation again. At press time, Terra Classic was trading at $0.000157195, down 11% over the last 24 hours. The trading volume within the same period was $245 million, down a modest -1.4% from the previous period. A look at the 1-day chart reveals that on Boxing Day, the Terra Classic price managed to break out of a downtrend channel that has persisted since October. Today&#8217;s correction could represent a retest of the move, so traders should keep an eye on the $0.0001406 area. Support could also be provided by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which sits at $0.000162919. Otherwise, the 200-day SMA at $0.000179240 should be decisive as the next resistance for the Terra Classic price. Featured image from The VR Soldier, Chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

The MACD histogram has fallen below zero, which indicates an increase in the amount of pressure being exerted by sellers. UNI Technical Indicators: Seller Aggressiveness Uniswap’s technical indicators show that sellers are more aggressive than buyers in the coming days. Uniswap, with the daily trading session, hinted at the formation of a descending triangle pattern. It also demonstrates a long-term bearish trend considering that the price dangles within the 100 and 200 SMA.

However, if the coin barrels past the key support level, it could aggravate the losses. Now, in order to reverse the negative sentiment, the bulls should maintain the support level and push the prices way up. UNI Search Volume Among Traders Climb In terms of social dominance and volume, UNI sits at 6,902 crests, which means that search volume has increased among the traders. Traders now see the spike in social dominance as an opportunity to rake in profit from UNI. In fact, Binance funding has increased by 0.009%. However, despite the spike in investor interest, Uniswap still needs to increase in value. In November, Uniswap rolled out an NFT aggregator as the market was bullish then. However, the tide has turned, and UNI NFTs did not seem to tickle the fancy of many investors as NFT trades have plummeted to only $7,562. While UNI is dominating social volume and dominance, this might not go on for long, as the social volume and price seem to plunge further in the coming days.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano is one of the altcoins that has been hit the hardest by the bear market. Created by former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, the coin is 91.6% below its all-time high of $3.10, which was reached on September 1, 2021. Thus, ADA is performing much worse than its main competitor Ethereum. ETH reached its all-time high of $4.878 on November 10, 2021, and is currently about -75.4% below that level. However, according to on-chain analytics service Santiment, there are early signs of a trend reversal. For instance, sharks and whales holding 100,000 to 10 million ADA have been accumulating aggressively over the past six weeks. As the analyst writes, there is currently a bullish divergence between price and whale activity. A look at realized gains and losses also paints a bullish picture. According to the analyst, there are signs of seller exhaustion. &#8220;On every big price decrease there are fewer and fewer coins moving at a loss,&#8221; the analyst notes. Furthermore, the Santiment analyst says that Cardano (ADA) is facing a trading volume gap in the $0.19 to $0.26 range, where he expects the price to see &#8220;serious buying.&#8221;  “Based on the things mentioned above, I believe price will increase in value. However, without any other data, it is difficult to accurately assess the validity of this analysis,” the analyst concluded. Messari Research Assesses The Current State Of Cardano An analysis of the state of the Cardano network was also published yesterday by Messari. In the research, the company provides interesting insights into the growth of the network, but at the same time, how it is lagging behind its main competitors. Related Reading: Cardano Price Consolidates, When Should You Short Again? As Messari notes, Cardano experienced an increase in DeFi activity in 2022, with daily transactions leveling off at around 60,000 since the second quarter, which equates to an average of around 0.75 transactions per second (TPS). Cardano&#8217;s DeFi TVL was approximately $78 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. With a market cap of $14.8 billion, the project has a market cap/TVL ratio of 190, significantly higher than competitors Ethereum, Solana, and Binance with ratios of 6, 17, and 10, respectively, Messari said. Despite its relatively late entry into the DeFi space, Cardano&#8217;s TVL ranks 30th, with Minswap, WingRiders, and SundaeSwap dominating the DeFi ecosystem with 52%, 20%, and 19% market shares, respectively. In the NFT space, Cardano is hosting 8,000 NFT projects and 15 marketplaces but is only generating an average monthly volume of $6.8 million. This, as Messari notes, is a far cry from industry leader Ethereum, which has over $150 million in monthly volume. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Downtrend Far From Over, $0.22 Still In Play According to the analytics firm, Cardano&#8217;s ethos of &#8220;building carefully and deliberately with extensive reviews&#8221; is one reason it forfeited a potential first-mover advantage with its proof of stake. According to Messari, the goal of the Hoskinson-led project must be to catch up with established ecosystems and capture market share in the near future. [&#8230;] its market cap and decentralization are ahead of most competitors. However, Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem is still far behind the competition despite its growth this year. Cardano&#8217;s goal in the near future will be to catch up to established ecosystems and take some market share. ADA Price Trapped In Downtrend A look at the 1-day chart reveals that the ADA price has been in a downtrend channel since August, which could spell further doom. At a current price of $0.251, the ADA price is as low as it was last in January 2021. To initiate an uptrend, ADA would first need to reclaim the 50-day moving average at around $0.30 in order to break out of the trend channel at around $0.34.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the combined Litecoin address count of sharks and whales is now at a 2-year high, a signal that could be bullish for the asset&#8217;s value. Litecoin Addresses Holding More Than 1,000 LTC Now At Highest Level Since 2020 As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, LTC has been climbing strongly since the population of these large addresses began to rise. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;Litecoin Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us how many addresses (or holders) belong to each wallet group in the market currently. Addresses are put into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that they are currently holding. For example, the 1-10 coins band includes all addresses that are holding between 1 and 10 LTC right now. The Supply Distribution metric for this band would then measure the total amount of such addresses that are there in the market currently.

Since there is no upper bound here, all balances ranging from this amount to infinity are stacked together. Here is the Supply Distribution chart for these Litecoin address bands: Looks like the value of the metric has been sharply going up in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment As the above graph displays, the value of the indicator for Litecoin addresses falling inside this range has been rising since May of this year. Holders that have 1,000 or more coins in their wallets are sharks and whales, so this uptrend implies that the total number of these large investors has been going up in the last few months. Just recently, the address count of these holders hit a value of 4,232, which is the highest value recorded in more than two years. From the chart, it&#8217;s also visible that while these sharks and whales have been increasing in number (and hence accumulation has been going on), the LTCBTC ratio has seen a rise of more than 130%.

					<description><![CDATA[NEAR, the native crypto of Near Protocol, seems to continue mirroring the trajectory of Bitcoin, one of the main driving forces of the cryptocurrency industry. The largest crypto asset boasting a total market capitalization of $320.76 billion has so far failed to establish a strong upward momentum that will enable it to exit 2022 with a higher value. In fact, BTC, which is trading at $16,658, is in danger of ending the year with a meager gain of less than 2%. At the time of writing, the maiden crypto has only managed to go up by 1.2% during the last 30 days and is looking at a weekly decline of 1.5%. As Bitcoin continues with its struggles, lesser known altcoins such as NEAR will also have a hard time to trigger an upward movement of their prices.

NEAR Protocol has the strongest positive correlations with Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP. This suggests that these coins frequently trend in the same direction at the same time. According to latest data from Coingecko, at press time, NEAR is changing hands at $1.32 and has already lost 20% of its value in the last 14 days. As for its month-to-date (MTD) performance, the coin is currently one of the worst performers among the top 40 crypto assets, going down by 16.2% over the previous 30 days. Adding to the woes of the cryptocurrency is the findings of Investors Observer, which gave the altcoin a moderate volatility rank of 39, putting NEAR in the bottom 39% of all cryptocurrencies in the market. Bulls are also put in a tough spot as they now bear the responsibility of flipping the resistance region of $1.45 into support zone to trigger some sort of a bullish movement.
