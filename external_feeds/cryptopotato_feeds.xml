			            <description><![CDATA[Ethereum Classic is among today's best performers, while the rest of the market sits quietly. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down $17,000 hours ago but was stopped in its tracks and now sits close by.</p>
<p>Most altcoins are with insignificant gains or losses, aside from ETC, which pumped by around 5% in a day.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Stopped at $17K</h2>
<p>It was less than a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency was flying higher at over $18,000. However, the overall bearish market sentiment didn&#8217;t allow the asset to continue further or even remain there.</p>
<p>BTC started retracing in the following days, losing over $1,000 at one point. This culminated in a drop to $16,300 registered yesterday, which became bitcoin&#8217;s<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-bounces-above-1-2k-bitcoin-touches-december-lows-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal"> lowest price position</a> since the end of November.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the bulls stepped up at this point and reversed BTC&#8217;s price trajectory. The asset bounced off rather quickly and added a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p>It even pumped to just over $17,000 earlier today. However, that was short-lived, and BTC returned below that level almost immediately, where it&#8217;s currently situated as well.</p>
<p>Its market cap has remained around $325 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins is at an even 40% on CoinMarketCap.</p>

<h2>ETC Jumps the Most</h2>
<p>Most alternative coins also felt similar volatile moves in the past week or so, but the past 24 hours have been completely different.</p>
<p>Ethereum managed to reclaim $1,200 yesterday following a brief dip below that line and currently sits just above it after a minor daily increase.</p>
<p>Binance Coin, OKB, Tron, and Litecoin have also charted gains of up to 2% in a day. In contrast, Ripple, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polygon, Polkadot, and Shiba Inu are with minor losses.</p>
<p>Ethereum Classic is the best performer from the top 50 largest digital assets. It&#8217;s up by about 5% and trades close to $17.</p>
<p>Overall, the crypto market cap has remained still at just over $800 billion.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[After being arrested by the Royal Bahamas Police Force, SBF dropped plans to resist extradition.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former boss of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is flying back to the United States as early as Wednesday.</p>
<p>This was revealed by Doan Cleare, the acting commissioner of corrections for the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services, according to a new <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-agrees-extradition-crypto-fraud-case-rcna62513" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> by NBC News.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bankman-Fried, who is currently in the Fox Hill jail of the Bahamas, declined to waive his right to challenge extradition to the United States and signed the necessary paperwork for the process.</li>
<li>Cleare did not reveal the reason behind the move but noted that fighting the extradition could take years.</li>
<li>In a statement to the Bahamanian newspaper, he said that Bankman-Fried would prefer to spend that time in the US than the Bahamas despite the island nation being home to FTX since 2021.</li>
<li>Jerone Roberts &#8211; the attorney representing SBF &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/its-official-sbf-agrees-to-be-extradited-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">confirmed</a> that the former exec &#8220;voluntarily agreed to be voluntarily extradited to the United States of America.&#8221;</li>
<li>Certain reports <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sam-bankman-fried-to-fly-to-us-wednesday-escorted-by-fbi-agents-1.1861932" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">claimed</a> that the FTX founder will be escorted by FBI agents in a non-commercial aircraft.</li>
<li>Bankman-Fried was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bahamian-authorities-arrest-sbf-at-the-request-of-us-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">arrested</a> by Bahamian police on December 12th and held at the notorious Fox Hill prison.</li>
<li>The 30-year-old is accused of misappropriating billions of dollars deposited in the crypto exchange FTX that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month.</li>
<li>The day after his arrest, a Bahamian judge denied Bankman-Fried&#8217;s request for bail, calling the former billionaire a flight risk.</li>
<li>The exec is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-closer-look-at-what-sam-bankman-fried-is-accused-of-exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">facing</a> a litany of charges brought by three separate government agencies &#8211; the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The struggling miner is the first publicly listed company to declare bankruptcy.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once prominent Bitcoin miner &#8211; Core Scientific &#8211; is the latest one planning to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Texas.</p>
<p>Mining companies are experiencing turmoil and a lingering crisis of confidence in digital assets after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX. While Bitcoin miners may not have had direct exposure to the now-collapsed crypto exchange, the subsequent turn of events and the ensuing price crash is threatening more of them with bankruptcy.</p>
<h2>Core Turmoil</h2>
<p>According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-filing-for-bankruptcy-will-keep-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a>, Core Scientific&#8217;s market capitalization had plunged to $78 million as of the end of trading Tuesday, decreasing from a $4.3 billion valuation last July since the listing on the Nasdaq through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.</p>
<p>Over the past year, its stock has depreciated by more than 98%. Despite generating positive cash flow, the cash is not sufficient for the company to repay the financing debt owed on equipment it was leasing. The firm does not plan on liquidation and instead will continue to operate normally.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the company&#8217;s finances expect it to reach an agreement with senior security noteholders, holding the major chunk of its debt.</p>
<h2>Attempts to Avert Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>As a result of the distress, Core Scientific recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-receives-72m-offer-from-creditor-to-avoid-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">received</a> an offer of $72 million to avoid bankruptcy from one of its top lenders &#8211; B Riley. The investment bank proposed a new financing plan that entailed providing non-cash pay funds on favorable terms with more than two years of runway for the company to achieve profitability.</p>
<p>In a statement, B Riley said that a vast majority of issues plaguing Core were self-imposed and went on to add that it can be corrected in conjunction with &#8220;an open, transparent discussion and ongoing participation with its creditors and equity holders.&#8221;</p>
<p>B Riley already has an outstanding loan of $42 million with Core. The bank stated that it prepared to fund the first $40 million of the new financing immediately, with &#8220;zero contingencies.&#8221; All principal payments to equipment lenders would need to be suspended until the Bitcoin price recovers to $18,500 for the remaining of the proposed financing.</p>
<p>Apart from Core Scientific, another prominent company in the space &#8211; Compute North &#8211; that hosted infrastructure for crypto mining filed for bankruptcy in September.</p>

The gaming giant said the failure of its partner and the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) are the main reasons for annulling the collaboration:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;There is simply no way for FTX to cure the reputational harm already caused to Riot as a result of the highly public disrepute wrought by the debacle preceding FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy filing.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Riot Games teamed up with FTX last summer, vowing to place the platform&#8217;s logo on its marketing materials. For its part, the exchange had to pay the gaming company $12.5 million in 2022, but it has distributed only half of the amount so far. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jo Johnson &#8211; the brother of the UK&#8217;s former PM, Boris Johnson &#8211; reportedly resigned from his advisory role in Bifinity (a payments technology company launched by Binance). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency platform has had several brushes with British regulators over the past few years. Despite the tension, the company aims to become a registered entity in the Kingdom sometime next year.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Johnson&#8217;s Departure</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to recent <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/12/19/boris-johnsons-brother-quits-adviser-binance-amid-crypto-meltdown/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">coverage</a> by The Telegraph, Boris Johnson&#8217;s younger brother &#8211; Jo Johnson &#8211; has quit the advisory board of Binance&#8217;s subsidiary.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He and Britain&#8217;s former Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries &#8211; Ed Vaizey (Lord Vaizey of Didcot), joined the company in September, highlighting Binance&#8217;s efforts to build trust between the crypto industry and the UK&#8217;s regulators and political elite. Lord Vaizey resigned from his post at Bifinity, too.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Binance spokesperson said Johnson left the firm to become an Executive Chairman of the digital education platform &#8211; FutureLearn.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;He will be focusing on his new role within the digital learning platform and is looking to scale back other activities,&#8221; he added.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The United Kingdom has not been the most-welcoming destination for Binance.

			            <description><![CDATA[Politicians are returning tainted money donated to them by Sam Bankman-Fried prior to FTX’s collapse. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Negative press surrounding bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has inspired the Democratic Senate Majority PAC to return $3 million in political donations from the company’s executives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those donations include $2 million from FTX’s ex-head of engineering, Nishad Singh, and $1 million from disgraced former boss Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). </span></p>
<h2>Returning Tainted Money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/ftx-democrats-senate-majority-pac-to-return-bankman-fried-donations.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by CNBC, a spokesperson for the PAC said the PAC decided to return the funds following “serious allegations against FTX.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before returning the money, the PAC is waiting on “proper direction from federal law enforcement officials based on their legal proceedings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wouldn’t be the first Democratic arm to take such action. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have also agreed to pay back their contributions from FTX. Daniel Wessel – spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee – </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-112ab1f32d23b1409fc53a5a73207f34" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the group will return $815,000 in donations from Bankman-Fried dating back to 2020, following proper legal guidance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">SBF is </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-says-sbf-donations-to-democrats-probably-over-1-billion/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">notorious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for being the second-largest donor to the Democratic party during this year’s midterm election cycle. By his own account, he also made donations </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DezodR9hNI&amp;ab_channel=TiffanyFong" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">supporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Republican candidates in roughly equal measure – but kept these under the radar for fear of public backlash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of the former billionaire’s donations totaled nearly $40 million. Singh’s totaled $8 million – though the latter has not been charged with any crimes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, FTX’s sister trading desk Alameda Research donated $5 million to Future Forward USA – which spent millions on Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential bid. FTX’s bankruptcy lawyer </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-used-client-assets-for-margin-trading-at-alameda-confirms-bankruptcy-lawyer/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that FTX’s assets were comingled with Alameda’s for the purpose of margin trading, where tremendous money was lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bankman-Fried has been arrested in the Bahamas, and is set to be extradited to the United States. He’s also been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for defrauding investors, while still being investigated by both agencies for potential securities fraud. </span></p>
<h2>Potential Binance Clawbacks</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Politicians aren’t the only ones who may have to pay back their ill-gotten gains from FTX. Binance – which received $2 billion from the company when exiting its FTX equity position last year – may also face clawbacks during the bankruptcy process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked whether his company could handle such a clawback last week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was reluctant to provide a clear answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll let the lawyers handle it. We are financially strong,” he </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cz-binance-on-audits-ftx-the-2-1-billion-sbf-buyout-in-2021-and-recent-withdrawal-spree/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The South Korean court has reportedly frozen 120 billion won (over $93 million) in assets belonging to executives of blockchain consultancy firm Kernel Labs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity is speculated to have had a hand in Terra&#8217;s collapse earlier this year while its CEO &#8211; Kim Hyun-Joong &#8211; served as Vice President of Engineering at Terraform Labs. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest Efforts</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a local </span><a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202212208809B" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the Korean Authorities froze around $93 million owned by bosses of Terraform Labs&#8217; affiliate company &#8211; Kernel Labs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some sources revealed that employees of the organization previously worked at the Terraform Labs Korea office, while CEO Kim Hyun-Joong was the Vice President of Engineering of the notorious crypto fintech firm. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest coverage disclosed that the nearly $100 million were frozen from seven people. The Seoul Southern District Court claimed that all those individuals have been involved in selling pre-issued Terra tokens to generate significant profits. </span></p>

For his part, Choi &#8211; Kernel Labs&#8217; former CEO &#8211; received around $32 million in illicit profits.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The South Korean authorities recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-korea-confiscates-over-100-million-from-terras-co-founder-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">confiscated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> more than $100 million worth of assets belonging to Shin Hyun-Seong (Daniel Shin).

			            <description><![CDATA[The demise of FTX has set back crypto by years and this disaster is likely to stir regulators into action.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, for one, believes that ideal crypto regulations should start with centralized actors since most of the damage to the consumers has been done by these entities.</p>
<p>In a recently <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/regulating-crypto-how-we-move-forward-as-an-industry-from-here?__cf_chl_f_tk=3IJazblXj4XHfNypOvRnwTnHSkJK.AmbJz7y7Tfj3l0-1671545172-0-gaNycGzNCz0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">released</a> &#8220;realistic blueprint,&#8221; Armstrong highlighted the need to pursue legislation early instead of waiting for something comprehensive and perfect. Regulations should initially focus on centralized actors in crypto, such as &#8211; stablecoin issuers, exchanges, and custodians, which have seen the most risk of consumer harm, he argued.</p>
<h2>All Eyes on Centralized Entities</h2>
<p>A good place to start will be stablecoin regulations, a sector that has already garnered much attention from DC. According to Armstrong, the stablecoin market in the United States can be regulated under standard financial services laws.</p>
<p>A sound stablecoin regulation would require issuers to register as a state trust or OCC national trust charter and undergo rigorous annual audits to provide the transparency that customer funds are held in appropriate reserve assets and separate from corporate cash. The issuers should also ensure reasonable controls and board governance, meet basic cybersecurity standards such as SOC compliance, and set up a blacklist capability to meet sanctions requirements.</p>
<p>Watchdogs should then target exchange and custodians to help prevent malicious activity while ensuring that they do not stifle innovation. Traditional financial services can serve as inspiration, according to the Coinbase chief, which could entail implementing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, establishing a federal licensing and registration regime, etc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, commodities and securities are other areas that need urgent attention from regulatory agencies. As such, Armstrong believes the US Congress should require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to classify each of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, declaring them as either securities or commodities.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The industry is primarily focused on trading crypto commodities today, but a robust market to register and issue crypto securities should also exist in the U.S., and could be a real improvement over how traditional securities are issued.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Decentralized Crypto</h2>
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been the &#8220;trickiest&#8221; area to get right. Armstrong opined that the role of financial regulators should be limited to centralized actors in cryptocurrency while their decentralized counterparts should instead be allowed to innovate.</p>
<p>He explained that decentralized platforms do not have intermediaries and that the open-source code and smart contracts serve as &#8220;the ultimate form of disclosure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest draft comes exactly two months after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-shares-his-position-on-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">published</a> a set of standards for crypto regulation that was met with significant backlash.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to consolidate in a tight range, as it failed to break a significant resistance level to the upside a few days ago. However, from a technical analysis standpoint, the time for a decisive breakout is near.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On the daily chart, the price is still consolidating in a large falling wedge pattern. These are commonly known as potential bullish reversal patterns in a bear market, provided they get broken to the upside.</p>
<p>However, last week&#8217;s rejection from the $18K resistance level and the 50-day moving average has halted the rally toward the higher boundary of the pattern. As a result, it likely initiated a drop down to the $15K support level and the lower trendline of the wedge.</p>
<p>Considering today&#8217;s bullish daily candle, a retest of the 50-day moving average currently located around the  $17K mark seems likely. The short-term future of BTC&#8217;s price would be determined by the outcome of this attempt.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Viewing the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price is recovering but is experiencing major issues returning above the $16,800 level following last week&#8217;s plunge.</p>
<p>In the event of a break above the $16,800 level, a retest of the broken bullish trendline would be expected. On the other hand, the price&#8217;s failure to break above $16,800 would likely initiate a bearish continuation toward the key $15K area.</p>
<p>A recent short-term bullish move was signaled by the RSI indicator, as a clear divergence was formed between the last two price lows.</p>
<p>However, the oscillator is currently showing values around 50%, hinting at a neutral state in momentum and offering little clue on the probable direction of the trend in the short term as the market continues to witness a fragile equilibrium between buyers and sellers.</p>

<h2>Onchain Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan </a></p>
<p>The following chart includes the Long Term Holder SOPR(Block resolution) and Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>Long-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio is a ratio of spent outputs (more than 155 days) in profit at the time of the window. Values over &#8216;1&#8217; indicate more long-term investors are selling at a profit, while values below &#8216;1&#8217; mean more long-term investors are selling at a loss.</p>
<p>The metric spiked three times during the price recovery from $16K to roughly $18.4K. Also, it has printed a significant jump after Bitcoin surged and reached the crucial resistance level of $18K.</p>
<p>This proves that long-term holders consider each price surge an opportunity to offload their assets and realize profits.</p>
<p>This is typical behavior during the late bear market stages; however, the next bull run won&#8217;t be initiated unless this cohort stops distributing their assets and start accumulating BTC with higher rates.</p>
