At the time of this move, El Salvador became the third-largest ATM hub, after the United States and Canada, put was soon overtaken by Spain and Australia in 2022. In October 2022, Spain was reported as being the third-largest crypto ATM hub after it installed 215 ATMs.</p>
<p>Australia however deployed 99 crypto ATMs in the last three months of 2022, according to data by Coin ATM Radar &ndash; an internet analytics company that keeps track of the total number of cryptocurrency ATMs all over the world.

Canada and Spain remain in second and third place respectively.</p>
Australia Keeps Up with Installations Despite Stricter Incoming Regulations
<p>The country has taken an active effort to improve its regulation of crypto services with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirming this. The government down under is also set to publish a consultation paper in early 2023 to determine which digital assets will be subject to legal regulation. This proposed regulation will involve a range of activities, from the registration and licensing of crypto service providers to the implementation of AML and counter-terrorism financing measures.</p>
