The billionaire &#8220;has no idea the DARPA rattlesnake he just stepped on by doing this,&#8221; a censorship expert stressed, revealing that the U.S. censorship industry needs to &#8220;scrape hundreds of millions of tweets&#8221; in order to &#8220;build their social media censorship death star.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Twitter Imposes Rate Limits Citing &#8216;Extreme Levels of Data Scraping&#8217;</h2>
<p>Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk has stirred up controversy by implementing temporary rate limits on the number of tweets users can read daily. The billionaire explained in a tweet on Saturday that these limits were introduced to combat excessive data scraping and system manipulation on the social media platform.</p>
<p>Verified Twitter accounts can read up to 6,000 posts per day, while unverified accounts are limited to 600 posts, and new unverified accounts can only read 300 posts per day, according to Musk&#8217;s initial announcement. The Tesla boss further tweeted that the rate limits would soon be increased to 8,000 for verified users, 800 for unverified users, and 400 for new unverified users. Subsequently, the billionaire stated that the limits would be further raised to 10,000, 1,000, and 500 respectively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-596057 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/musk-twitter-rate-limit1.jpg" alt="" width="802" height="601" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/musk-twitter-rate-limit1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/musk-twitter-rate-limit1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/musk-twitter-rate-limit1.jpg 802w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>
<p>Many people slammed Musk for introducing the rate limits. &#8220;This is a terrible move by Musk. User engagement and interactions will drastically decline,&#8221; one warned. &#8220;A social media that is trying to limit engagement is not a place that is welcoming its users &#8230; on that note bye,&#8221; another wrote.</p>
<p> CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) offered his advice on the matter: “Viewing should not be limited. Posting and commenting should be. No humans post more than 800 posts per day.” In a follow-up tweet, he revised his suggestion: “Actually, only commenting need to be limited. IMO.”</p>
<h2>Musk Steps on the DARPA Rattlesnake, Says Censorship Expert</h2>
<p>The decision to impose daily limits followed a rising trend of AI programs massively scraping tweets, including the widely used Chatgpt. Following the implementation of the limits by Twitter, users reported that Chatgpt informed them that it could <a href="https://twitter.com/WholeMarsBlog/status/1675376517537480705">no longer</a> access tweets.</p>
<p>Referencing the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research and development agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military, Mike Benz, executive director of the Foundation for Freedom Online, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1675254646942896128">tweeted</a> Saturday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Musk has no idea the DARPA rattlesnake he just stepped on by doing this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on the new Twitter rate limit controversy &#8220;from the perspective of the censorship industry,&#8221; he claimed that what Musk did has &#8220;wide-ranging implications for the science of censorship,&#8221; noting that &#8220;AI censorship is where all of the magic happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benz explained that the Twitter files revealed that while the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) could potentially censor 22 tweets, AI technology, such as Enterprise Intelligence Platform (EIP) and other censorship groups, enabled the censorship of 22 million tweets. “It&#8217;s a completely different animal. You could not censor the internet before 2016 at the kind of scale that you do now because you have AI censorship models … There&#8217;s an AI censorship death star that has been under construction, innovation, and renovation every week, every month, every year, for the past six, seven years now,” he detailed. “It all relies on massive scraping of Twitter data in order to build these models and databases to track trending narratives, to systematically surveil and build intelligence dossiers, and to track and to turn down, all at once, communities online.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;"></span></p>
<p>The Foundation for Freedom Online&#8217;s executive director added that these AI models “map real-time narrative emergence on Twitter in a way you can&#8217;t do on any other social media platform,” noting that they have been used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the state department, the defense department, hundreds of government-funded NGOs, centers, and non-profit foundations. He emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to build their social media censorship death star, they need to scrape hundreds of millions of tweets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Benz asserted that on the one hand what Musk is doing is “limiting the openness of the internet,” but on the other hand he is “actually, potentially preserving the openness of the internet by preventing the construction of this censorship death star that is getting more and more refined every day, and is getting funded by your tax dollars to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from DARPA, and the National Science Foundation, to say nothing about the state department and the National Endowment for Democracy grants.”</p>
<p>While Benz stated he is not sure whether Musk is restricting Twitter views “to throttle the AI censorship death star” or whether he is doing it to “pump up the subscription base, or a privacy reason, independent of censorship,” he stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether Musk knows it or not, he has stepped on a rattlesnake … There are going to be hundreds of censorship operatives, housed within the university research centers, this week howling at the moon that this is an attack on democracy for Musk to limit their access.</p></blockquote>
<p>“If they lose access to the underlying data on which their AI censorship models are built, then they will not be able to do their jobs as effective, fast, precise, and comprehensive asocial media censors,” Benz clarified.</p>

<h2>Tim Draper&#x2019;s $250K Bitcoin Price Forecast</h2>
<p>Venture capitalist Tim Draper has adjusted the projected timeframe for his bitcoin price prediction. He tweeted Friday that when the price of bitcoin was $4,000, he predicted that it would climb 60 times and reach $250,000 by now. However, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ended June below $31,000. &#x201C;I guess we have to wait a little longer,&#x201D; he wrote, adding that it may take two more years for his $250K prediction to come true.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-596009 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-draper-bitcoin-price-prediction-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="817" height="327" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-draper-bitcoin-price-prediction-tweet-300x120.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-draper-bitcoin-price-prediction-tweet-768x307.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-draper-bitcoin-price-prediction-tweet.jpg 817w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px"></p>
<p>Draper previously predicted that the price of bitcoin would reach <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venture-capitalist-tim-draper-doubles-down-on-his-250k-by-2022-bitcoin-price-prediction/">$250K by the end of 2022</a>. However, he acknowledged on Dec. 31, 2022, that his &#x201C;$250k by 2022&#x201D; forecast for bitcoin was &#x201C;off by a bit.&#x201D; Nonetheless, he insisted that the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will &#x201C;certainly&#x201D; reach the predicted level before the halving in 2024.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">See t-shirt. $250k by 2022. My prediction was off by a bit. Hasn&#x2019;t made it there&#x2026;yet.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>When his forecast did not come true in December last year, he extended his <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price prediction timeframe by six months to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-extends-btc-price-prediction-by-6-months-by-mid-2023-im-expecting-to-see-bitcoin-hit-250k/">mid-2023</a>. He <a href="https://observer.com/2022/12/tim-draper-bitcoin-prediction-ftx-crypto/">told</a> the Observer that if that still does not happen, then he is certain bitcoin will reach the $250,000 milestone before the end of 2024. He stated: &#x201C;I am almost 100 percent sure I will be right in 18 months.&#x201D; The venture capitalist also expects the price of bitcoin to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venture-capitalist-tim-draper-explains-why-bitcoin-will-soar-past-his-250k-estimate/">soar past his estimate</a> due to adoption by women.</p>
<p>According to his tweet on Friday, Draper now believes that it could take until the end of June 2025 for bitcoin to reach the $250,000 price point.</p>

<p>Draper also recently raised concerns regarding cryptocurrency regulation and criticized the enforcement approach taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Regulation by enforcement is killing our economy. It is killing China too,&#x201D; he tweeted on June 20. During an <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6329302394112">interview</a> with Fox Business on June 12, he criticized the securities regulator and its chair, Gary Gensler, for taking an enforcement-focused approach to regulating the crypto industry, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think we&#x2019;ve got a real problem because the SEC has been spreading fear and all of the innovators are leaving the country &#x2026; This regulation by enforcement makes no sense.</p></blockquote>

Just over $2 billion in stablecoins have been withdrawn from the stablecoin token economy since May 28.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoin Economy Faces Contraction as Market Capitalization Dips Below $129 Billion</h2>
<p>The value of the <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">crypto economy</a> has risen over the past 30 days; however, the stablecoin economy experienced a loss of over $2 billion in June. According to data, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230528085033/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">on May 28</a>, the net value of the stablecoin economy was $130.28 billion, whereas it currently stands at $128.21 billion. This indicates that stablecoin redemptions amounted to $2.07 billion over the past 30 days.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://archive.ph/lUlbr">current statistics</a> archived on July 2, three out of the top five stablecoins by market valuation experienced redemptions. Tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) and trueusd (TUSD) witnessed gains in the past 30 days, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> increasing by a mere 0.1%. In contrast, TUSD surged by 49.4% compared to the previous month, resulting in its market cap expanding from $2 billion to the current $3.05 billion.</p>

<p>Among the top five stablecoins, USDC, DAI, and BUSD experienced redemptions. Usd coin (USDC) had 5.5% of its supply redeemed, DAI recorded a loss of 5.7%, and BUSD saw a reduction of 20.2% in its supply over the past month. The supply of USDC dropped to 27.32 billion, while DAI&#x2019;s supply decreased to 4.34 billion, and BUSD&#x2019;s supply was reduced to 4.13 billion.</p>

<p>The stablecoin economy has significantly contracted since last year, reaching its lowest value in approximately 21 months. Additionally, stablecoin trade volumes have declined. However, the sector of dollar-pegged tokens still represents a majority of the overall trading pairs in the crypto market. Out of the entire $26.80 billion in trade volume across the entire crypto economy, a total of $15.86 billion in trades involved stablecoin assets.</p>

<h2>Ethereum&#x2019;s Liquid Staking Derivatives Platforms Near $20 Billion Valuation with 10 Million Ether Locked</h2>
<p>As of July 2, 2023, more than ten million ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) is locked in liquid staking defi platforms. At the time of reporting, <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">approximately 10.11 ETH is locked</a>, with a value of $19.456 billion using today&#x2019;s exchange rates. Lido, the top-ranking liquid staking derivatives protocol, claims a remarkable 74.51% market share as it holds roughly 7,530,330 ether as of Sunday morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">defillama.com</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past week, Lido&#x2019;s total value locked (TVL) rose by 1.90%, while its monthly growth rate reached 7.57%. The defi application&#x2019;s current TVL stands at $14.43 billion. Meanwhile, Coinbase&#x2019;s Wrapped Ether defi platform witnessed a seven-day TVL increase of 3.27%, although it experienced a slight dip of 0.24% over the month. Currently, Coinbase&#x2019;s liquid staking derivatives platform secures around 1,124,130 ether worth $2.24 billion.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool, the third-largest liquid staking protocol, saw a modest seven-day growth of roughly 0.99%. However, its 30-day performance revealed a more substantial increase of 9.69%. On Sunday morning, Rocket Pool&#x2019;s holdings amounted to around 803,406 ether valued at $1.54 billion. In contrast, the Frax Ether defi application reported a 1.96% weekly rise and a monthly growth of only 0.81%, with control over 234,062 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. Lastly, Stakewise, the fifth-largest liquid staking derivatives platform, observed a marginal 0.31% uptick over the past week and a June increase of 1.10%.</p>

<p>Among the 10.11 million staked ether, a total of 22 liquid staking derivatives platforms exist. The top five liquid staking derivatives tokens have an ETH-peg price discrepancy ranging between 0.08% and 0.53%, as recorded on Sunday morning. With Lido&#x2019;s impressive liquid staking cache, its token Lido staked ether (STETH) now ranks as the seventh largest market cap in the industry today.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think the future holds for liquid staking derivatives platforms? Will they continue to attract more ethereum and reshape the defi landscape? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Attorneys for Bittrex argue that the SEC cannot regulate cryptocurrency assets as securities without approval from Congress.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SEC Lawsuit: Bittrex Seeks Dismissal, Citing Lack of Clarity in Token Securities Regulation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In mid-April 2023, Bittrex&#8217;s U.S. crypto exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-crypto-exchange-bittrex-with-operating-unregistered-exchange-broker-and-clearing-agency/">faced a lawsuit</a> from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the securities watchdog was &#8220;holding Bittrex accountable for its noncompliance.&#8221; Two weeks later, Bittrex&#8217;s U.S.-based exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-bittrex-enters-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-following-sec-lawsuit/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In the most recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.321164/gov.uscourts.wawd.321164.40.0.pdf">court filing</a>, Bittrex&#8217;s legal team is seeking the dismissal of the SEC case against the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The attorneys argue that the regulation of tokens as securities in the U.S. remains a &#8220;major question&#8221; that lacks definition and remains unanswered. Bittrex also contends that the SEC failed to provide sufficient notice regarding the alleged violations of securities laws. The attorneys representing the crypto exchange criticized the securities regulators for conducting a six-year investigation without identifying a single unlawfully listed crypto asset token until mid-April 2023. “Yet the Commission is still missing essential elements of its claims,” noted Bittrex in its request for dismissal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The complaint offers three reasons for seeking dismissal. First, it highlights the unresolved question of whether tokens should be subject to securities regulations, as asserted by the SEC. Attorneys emphasize that this issue requires the attention of congressional leaders rather than being solely determined by the SEC or the court. Second, Bittrex emphasizes that the complaint fails to provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that any of the secondary-market transactions conducted on Bittrex&#8217;s platform involved securities.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Lastly, the attorneys contend that the SEC&#8217;s inadequate definition of the alleged misconduct has deprived Bittrex of proper notification regarding the claims made against it. Bittrex&#8217;s attempt to seek dismissal aligns with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/">Coinbase&#8217;s 177-page argument</a>, which asserts that the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions violate due process and the constitutional separation of powers. The Bittrex dismissal request shares a similar sentiment with Coinbase&#8217;s argument, as it firmly believes that the SEC lacks the &#8220;clear congressional authorization&#8221; necessary to apply securities laws to tokens under the major questions doctrine.</p>

<h2 class="sc-fXMkjo erYIft">What is De-Dollarization? Exploring the Shift Away From the US Dollar&#x2019;s Global Dominance</h2>
<p>From the latter half of 2022 and continuing into 2023, the concept of de-dollarization has gained significant traction, making its mark on the mainstream media. This surge in attention can be attributed to the concerted efforts of BRICS countries such as Brazil, China, and Russia, who are endeavoring to diminish the dominance of the greenback. Although a prevailing sentiment suggests that the U.S. dollar&#x2019;s global reserve status is on the brink of dissolution, there are dissenting voices asserting that the hype surrounding de-dollarization has been exaggerated.</p>

However, as much as 59% believe scams are among the main barriers stopping many from dabbling with cryptos. Just under half of the respondents (48%) named the crypto market’s volatility as one of the most significant barriers to entry.</strong></p>
<h2>Respondents See Financial Trading as a Requisite Skill</h2>
<p>According to the findings of Consensys’ <a href="https://4795067.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/4795067/Reports/Consensys-Global-Report-on-Crypto-and-Web3-Summary-South-Africa.pdf?utm_campaign=Infura&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=263545422&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-888mwmgldnuMQAE4CxMJFlF0nqEkUnrv8o5mqFG4fXJkizCGrEMSLmIYKECIEBDFzFSQ-poqrNV_SwSBsUI_Yq4bIrFg&amp;utm_content=263545422&amp;utm_source=hs_automation">survey</a> on crypto and Web3, about 40% of South Africans are &#8220;familiar with the concept of Web3.&#8221; Overall, the survey found that &#8220;there are high levels of awareness of all Web3 concepts&#8221; among interviewed South Africans. Metaverse is the term that most of the respondents are familiar with and this is followed by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3.</p>
<p>However, when asked about the set of skills that one needs to participate in Web3, 43% of the respondents named financial trading as the most important prerequisite. Some 24% of the surveyed South Africans thought software engineering is the most important skill, while 17% identified marketing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Scams Said to Be a Barrier to Adoption of Crypto</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the survey findings also suggested that half of South Africa’s population believes the financial system could be improved. An even larger proportion of the respondents said the technology to improve the financial system already exists.</p>
<p>&#8220;80% Of the population of South Africa agrees that we currently have the technology required to transform or fully rebuild the financial system. Only 4% disagree with that,&#8221; the survey report said.</p>
<p>Concerning cryptocurrencies, the survey found that 98% of the respondents have heard about cryptocurrencies. However, as much as 59% believe scams are one of the biggest barriers stopping many from dabbling with cryptos. Just under half of the respondents (48%) named the crypto market’s volatility as a significant barrier, while 40% thought the financial technology backing cryptocurrencies is too complex and only for the tech-savvy. Just 13% of the respondents said the “technology is not innovative or different from what exists now.”</p>
<p>On the regulation of cryptocurrencies or the lack thereof, 46% of the respondents said these must be &#8220;heavily regulated to ensure that traditional financial markets are not destabilized and that investors are protected.&#8221; Only 7% felt regulators need to let the industry self-regulate.</p>

Buterin mentioned how projects like Solana were included in these legal actions and stated that the real competition was the &#x201C;centralized world.&#x201D;</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Vitalik Buterin Opens up on SEC Crypto Enforcement Actions</h2>&#13;
<p>Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, has opened up on his thoughts about the recent crypto enforcement actions the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking against exchanges and cryptocurrency projects. When asked about his thoughts on the issue by Matt Huang, co-founder of California-based crypto investment firm Paradigm, Buterin <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1674644137847451649?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">I feel bad that Solana </span>and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don&#x2019;t deserve it, and if ethereum ends up &#x2018;winning&#x2019; through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that&#x2019;s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn&#x2019;t even a victory.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Furthermore, Buterin warned about the possible objectives behind these actions, stating that &#x201C;the real competition is not other chains, it&#x2019;s the rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on us as we speak,&#x201D; wishing other crypto projects a &#x201C;fair outcome&#x201D; on this situation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>Ethereum, Solana, and Their Classification</h2>&#13;
<p>Solana, Cardano, Polygon, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>, and other cryptocurrency projects have been included in the current legal cases that the SEC is battling against <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the market. SOL, the native token of Solana, a smart-contracts-enabled cryptocurrency project, has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/">labeled</a> a security in these processes, endangering its permanence and listing in U.S.-based exchanges without prior registration.</p>&#13;
<p>However, the Solana Foundation, whose mission is to &#x201C;help build the Solana protocol into the most censorship-resistant network in the world,&#x201D; has questioned the validity of the SEC&#x2019;s vision, <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1667578529612017666?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> it &#x201C;disagrees with the characterization of SOL as a security.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, is also part of this security categorization debate. On a recent congressional hearing, SEC chairman Gary Gensler did not answer a direct <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethers-security-status-remains-unclear-as-sec-chair-gensler-fails-to-answer-lawmakers-question/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">question</a> on whether ether represented a security in the eyes of the commission or not.</p>&#13;
<p>However, in his now infamous 2018 speech, former SEC official William Hinman <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a> that based on his understanding, &#x201C;current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.&#x201D; On March 9, 2023, New York attorney general Letitia James filed a lawsuit against Kucoin, in which the prosecutor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-attorney-general-files-lawsuit-against-kucoin-and-declares-ethereum-a-security/">classified</a> ether as a security.</p>&#13;
<p>According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the unsealing of the Hinman docs, a group of internal memos and emails showing the discussions SEC officer had before this speech, boosts the possibility of ethereum being ruled a commodity, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-managing-director-nikolaos-panigirtzoglou-hinman-docs-are-a-boost-to-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explaining</a> that these might trigger a boom for decentralization.</p>&#13;

China wants to be one of Africa&#8217;s largest trading partners, and reports revealed on Friday that this year&#8217;s expo is expected to generate $19 billion in deals.</strong></p>
<h2>Annual Trade Event Between Africa and China Highlights ‘Western Smears’ and Multi-Billion-Dollar Trade Deals</h2>
<p>After 2010, trade between Africa and China increased a great deal and in 2011, trade between Africa and China increased by 33% from the previous year to $166 billion. The following year, trade increased further by over 22% year-over-year. China and Africa have significantly <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/china-regional-snapshot-sub-saharan-africa/">increased</a> their trade in 2023 through a variety of initiatives and investments. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-03/china-to-deepen-africa-ties-over-next-decade-with-focus-on-trade">Reports</a> further indicate that China aims to surpass the European Union as Africa&#8217;s largest trading partner by 2030.</p>
<p>Trade between China and Africa grew by 9% year-on-year to reach $94.4 billion in the first four months of 2023, according to <a href="https://www.ecofinagency.com/public-management/1805-44547-china-africa-trade-value-up-by-8-9-in-the-first-four-months-of-2023-yoy">statistics</a>. This week, leading members from African governments and the continent&#8217;s private sector have convened for the third annual China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo held in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. The annual event is a platform for China and African countries to promote economic and trade cooperation. This year&#8217;s Expo is themed &#8220;Common Development for a Shared Future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regional <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0630/c90000-20037930.html">reports</a> indicate that this year&#8217;s expo is expected to generate $19 billion in deals. According to Chinese media, many African officials and business representatives have rejected Western <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3206555/china-denies-creating-debt-trap-african-countries">accusations</a> of a &#8220;debt trap&#8221; in China-Africa cooperation, and have expressed their desire for closer ties with China. Anna A Wapalila, CEO of Herbanna General Supply Co in Tanzania, was quoted in the Chinese media report as saying, &#8220;China is the biggest market. If you can get any products to China, it means that you [don&#8217;t need to] look for any other countries in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Kimonyo, the Rwandan Ambassador to China, also spoke about the United States <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china-rejects-africa-debt-trap-claim-ahead-us-africa-summit-2022-12-12/">claiming</a> China is setting Africa up to fall into a debt trap. &#8220;In any economic structure, you look at the pillars and the projects that are going to support your growth,” Kimonyo said. “Once you have identified them, then you look for the resources to implement them. And then in the process of looking for the resources, then you engage the partners. China happens to be a partner that is very open in terms of what we discuss in terms of the financing of projects.” Kimonyo added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that narrative is wrong. China is not putting Africa in a debt trap.</p></blockquote>
<p>The People’s Daily explained that there was a lot of talk about the “Western smear” and statements against the alleged Western countries&#8217; attempt to &#8220;decouple&#8221; Africa from China. China is now the fourth largest investor in Africa, and its investments in African countries have exceeded $30 billion in the last ten years. “There is no point in complaining when you get money from China as long as the money is invested in the projects that are going to make a difference in the lives of all people,” Kimonyo added.</p>

The blockchain achieved two milestones in June, as the network reached an all-time high in hashrate on June 11, and three days later, on June 14, the mining difficulty also reached a new peak.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>While Miners Accrued 27,025 Fresh Bitcoin in June, Mining Difficulty Tapped an All-Time High</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin miners, over the past 2,016 blocks, have recorded an average hashrate of approximately 359 exahash per second (EH/s). On Saturday, July 1, 2023, the current hashrate is roughly 335.71 EH/s, with 37 mining pools dedicating hashpower to the Bitcoin chain.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Foundry USA is the top mining pool on Saturday, and it also held the top position during the previous month. Statistics indicate that throughout June, mining pools discovered 4,324 block rewards, with Foundry finding 1,404 of them.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Foundry&#x2019;s metrics in June indicate that the pool accounted for 32.47% of the global hashrate. Antpool claimed the second position in June, discovering 923 blocks during the month and capturing a 21.35% share of the total hashrate.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following closely were F2pool (593 blocks), Binance Pool (382 blocks), and Viabtc (373 blocks), together accounting for 31.17% of the global hashrate. A total of 16 mining pools generated at least 1 exahash or more of global hashpower on July 1.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In June, the Bitcoin blockchain experienced two difficulty retargets. On June 14, at block height 794,304, there was a 2.18% increase, and on June 28, at block height 796,320, a 3.26% decrease occurred.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The June 14 increase brought the difficulty to an all-time high (ATH) of 52.35 trillion, while the subsequent decrease two weeks later reduced it to the current 50.65 trillion. Although the difficulty ATH was a significant milestone, Bitcoin&#x2019;s total hashrate reached an ATH of 516.61 EH/s on June 11, 2023, at block height 793,868.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

Currently, the next difficulty change is scheduled to occur on or around July 13, 2023, and the next block reward halving is just over 43,000 blocks away. Bitcoin&#x2019;s halving is expected to take place on or around April 21, 2024, reducing the block reward from 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to 3.125 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.&#13;<br />

As of the time of writing, at block height 796,756, miners are projected to discover approximately 270,275 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> before the halving. Amid the upcoming block reward halving, which will halve an operation&#x2019;s mining revenue, bitcoin mining statistics from theminermag.com indicate that the amount of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> produced per day by a single EH/s of operating hashrate has steadily declined since January 2022.&#13;<br />

In January of last year, miners earned 5.1 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> per day, but the current statistics show a decrease to 2.6 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. In June, the figure remained at 2.6 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, while May recorded 3 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, surpassing April&#x2019;s daily rate of 2.7 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for one EH/s.&#13;<br />
