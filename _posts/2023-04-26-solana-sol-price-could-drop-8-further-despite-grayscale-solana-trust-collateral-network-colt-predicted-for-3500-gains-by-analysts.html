<p class="s7">After a month of steady price increases, Solana (SOL) is on a downward spiral, with a 10.61% decrease in the last week, despite the announcement that the Grayscale&reg; Solana Trust (the &lsquo;Trust&rsquo;) has begun trading on OTC Markets. While some investors are selling Solana (SOL), others are buying Collateral Network (COLT) tokens following a 40% price jump during its presale. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Solana (SOL) Is Hit Hard By Market Downturn </p>
<p class="s7">Since its rise to fame in 2021, Solana (SOL) has remained one of the most popular crypto investments worldwide. Ranked the 10th largest cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL) currently has a market cap of $8.7 billion, with daily trading volume often passing one billion. However, &nbsp;at the time of writing, both the Solana (SOL) price and trading volume have dipped. </p>

<p class="s7">Compared to top competitors in the market, Solana (SOL) has been one of the worst hit by recent trends. While Solana (SOL) has dropped over 10% in the last week, BNB has dropped just 0.90%, and Tron has dropped 1.55%. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s7">With signs that crypto growth is slowing down, experts believe that Solana (SOL) could drop another 8% as trading volume begins to dip. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Collateral Network (COLT) Defies Market Trends</p>
<p class="s7">As much of the mainstream crypto market begins to decline, Collateral Network (COLT) is thriving. Since its presale started, Collateral Network (COLT) has increased in value by 40%, with an additional price increase expected once the next phase of its presale sells out. </p>
<p class="s7">Collateral Network (COLT) looks to solve many of the issues associated with the pawnbroking industry. The current market is not only old fashioned, but in some circumstances also has a bad reputation. Collateral Network (COLT) looks to reinvent pawnbroking with DeFi technology. </p>
<p class="s7">Using Collateral Network (COLT), individuals can take a loan against their physical assets discreetly and without ever impacting their credit. Borrowers can use real-world assets, including cards, jewelry, real estate, and fine whiskeys, as collateral to obtain a loan.</p>
<p class="s7">To do this, Collateral Network (COLT) mints an NFT representing the borrower&rsquo;s physical asset and fractionalizes it in pieces. Lenders buy these fractions as a way to lend small amounts of money to fund a single loan. In return, investors receive a fixed interest rate until the borrower pays their loan. </p>
<p class="s7">With huge potential to disrupt the pawnbroking market, market analysts believe that Collateral Network (COLT) could hit $0.35 during its presale, providing investors with an early return of 3500%. </p>
<p class="s7">To get involved now, you can buy tokens through the presale portal with several cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, and BNB. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Conclusion</p>
<p class="s7">With Solana (SOL) decreasing in value, many investors are now looking toward other projects to boost their portfolios. As a result, demand for Collateral Network (COLT) is extremely likely to gain traction, making it a great time to buy before $COLT tokens surge. &nbsp;</p>
