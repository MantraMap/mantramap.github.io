<p>According to a recent report from market intelligence firm Messari, the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tron-deals-with-major-blockchain-and-gaming-groups-in-south-korea/"> Tron blockchain</a> experienced a notable surge in usage during the first quarter of 2023. Despite facing lawsuits from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Tron ecosystem tokens, the network remained resilient, displaying robust activity. The market cap of Tron&#8217;s native token, TRX, also saw a substantial increase of nearly 20% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ).<br /><br />In terms of revenue, Tron witnessed impressive growth, with total quarterly revenue reaching $90.04 million in Q1 2023. This marked an impressive 88% jump from Q4 2022 revenue of $47.96 million.<br /><br />The report highlighted a 7.7% increase in average daily transactions during the three-month review period, reaching approximately 7 million transactions. Messari attributed this growth partly to staking activity on the network. Although staking accounted for only about 3% of all transactions on the TRX network, the total transaction count originating from staking activities soared by 197% QoQ.<br /><br />The &#8220;State of Tron&#8221; <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-tron-q1-2023?">report,</a> commissioned by Tron itself, revealed that smart contracts triggered and TRX transfers dominated the transaction activity on the network, accounting for 88% of all transactions. <br /><br />Despite remaining relatively stable throughout Q1, these transaction types showcased the USDT smart contract as the primary driver of contract execution on TRON.<br /><br />Furthermore, transaction fees experienced a substantial surge during the first quarter. Statistics indicated a 59.2% increase in the average transaction fee denominated in TRX and an 80.2% increase when measured in USD. <br /><br />Committee proposal No. 79, approved in the previous quarter, played a crucial role in driving the hike in transaction fees. This proposal introduced changes to network parameters, increasing the energy required to execute smart contracts.<br /><br />Overall, the Tron blockchain demonstrated impressive growth in usage and market cap during Q1 2023, defying the challenges posed by SEC lawsuits. The network&#8217;s resilience, combined with the surge in revenue, transaction volume, and transaction fees, indicates a thriving ecosystem with increasing adoption and activity.</p>

<p>In a tweet on <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1657099651210969088">May 12</a>, Binance announced its decision to halt operations in Canada, following the footsteps of other proactive crypto companies that have withdrawn from the Canadian marketplace.</p>
<p>While acknowledging Canada&#8217;s sentimental value and expressing optimism for the country&#8217;s crypto sector,<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-accused-of-deliberately-flouting-laws-by-cftc-chief/"> Binance</a> cited recent regulatory guidance as the reason for its departure, deeming it unfeasible to continue operating under the new conditions.</p>
<p>Despite disagreeing with the new guidelines, Binance expressed its intention to maintain engagement with Canadian regulators and return to the market when users regain the freedom to access a broader range of digital assets.</p>
<p>The regulatory landscape changed in February when Canadian securities regulators introduced new guidelines, mandating pre-registration filings and imposing specific rules on crypto companies.</p>
<p>Notably, companies operating in Canada are now required to segregate funds belonging to Canadian users and withhold margin or leverage trading from them.</p>
<p>Binance joins the ranks of Paxos, dYdX, Blockchain.com, and OKX, all of which have withdrawn their services from the Canadian market.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kraken, Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Gemini have expressed their intent to continue operating in Canada.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/nexo-settles-with-sec-for-45-million/">Nexo</a>, a prominent cryptocurrency lending platform, has decided to dissolve two of its business units based in the United Kingdom as it grapples with regulatory challenges in various parts of Europe and North America. This move is part of a broader restructuring effort, although Nexo will continue its operations within the country.<br /><br />According to filings reported by<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-lender-nexo-takes-steps-to-dissolve-uk-units-1.1918939"> BNN Bloomberg</a>, Nexo has applied to remove Nexo Financial Services Ltd. and Nexo Clearing and Custody Ltd. from the UK company register. In a message to Bloomberg, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of Nexo, explained that the company is undergoing restructuring and reevaluating its approach to client services.<br /><br />Aside from crypto trading and custody, Nexo offers a range of crypto-based financial products, including debit card services, borrowing, and savings accounts. The savings accounts, as advertised on their website, can yield &#8220;up to 15% APR on your crypto,&#8221; with Bitcoin reaching as high as 7% and USDC up to 12%.<br /><br />Regulators in the United States have expressed skepticism towards crypto-based interest-bearing accounts, highlighting their unusually high savings rates compared to traditional accounts. Unlike chartered banks, crypto financial platforms are not covered by federal deposit insurance. Scrutiny heightened in mid-2022 after several crypto lending platforms, including Celsius, Voyager, and later BlockFi, encountered financial difficulties.<br /><br />Nexo clarified that it is not facing the same dire financial situation as those firms. However, it continues to face ongoing scrutiny and charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming months. In December, Nexo announced its departure from the United States due to regulatory obstacles.<br /><br />Furthermore, Nexo&#8217;s Earn product is currently inaccessible in Canada due to the complete ban on crypto margin trading imposed by regulators in the country. The company&#8217;s troubles also extend to Bulgaria, where its offices were raided in January on allegations of money laundering, tax fraud, and computer fraud related to unlicensed banking services.</p>
<p>Trenchev dismissed these accusations as &#8220;ludicrous&#8221; and responded by filing a $1 million lawsuit against Bulgaria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a significant development within its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/blockfi-set-to-pay-back-over-100000-to-california-users/">BlockFi</a> has been granted authorization to refund $297 million to select customers, as reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/blockfi-gets-court-permission-return-297-million-wallet-customers-2023-05-11/">Reuters</a> on May 11. This decision pertains specifically to customers who held funds in BlockFi&#8217;s Wallet rather than its interest-bearing accounts.<br /><br />The ruling was delivered by Judge Michael Kaplan, who determined that while wallet users maintained ownership of their deposits, customers who stored funds in interest-bearing accounts relinquished ownership and granted control to BlockFi. Subsequently, the company utilized those assets for its lending activities.<br /><br />However, customers who transferred their funds to the wallet accounts as a last-minute measure when BlockFi filed for<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-lender-blockfi-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection/"> bankruptcy</a> in November last year will not be eligible for the refund. Approximately 48,000 users attempted to move a total of $375 million from interest accounts to wallet accounts during that period.<br /><br />Although customer lawyers contended that this amount should also be returned, Judge Kaplan dismissed the claim, citing BlockFi&#8217;s failure to finalize those transactions and its prerogative to block such transfers during the service halt.<br /><br />BlockFi&#8217;s legal representatives previously argued that returning the $375 million sum would dilute the value of funds recoverable by wallet users. They further asserted that such a payout could impede BlockFi from refunding any funds altogether due to a lack of fund segregation.<br /><br />The tumultuous series of events began when BlockFi temporarily suspended user withdrawals and activity on November 10, 2022, in response to the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Subsequently, the company filed for bankruptcy on November 28.<br /><br />Earlier in March, BlockFi had already initiated refunds of $100,000 to users in California.</p>

This decision was part of a broader action that involved transferring 16 other struggling digital assets, including JasmyCoin (JASMY), OMG Network (OMG), WazirX (WRX), Serum (SRM), OAX (OAX), and more.<br /><br />Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1656231470959063041?s=20">CEO Changpeng</a> &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao explained that rather than directly delisting these tokens, the exchange opted to move them to the innovation zone based on a suggestion from a community member. CZ emphasized that this relocation serves as a prelude, allowing the failing projects to improve. However, CZ made it clear that if these projects fail to demonstrate progress, delisting remains a possibility.<br /><br />The innovation zone on Binance was specifically designed to provide users with a platform to trade innovative projects characterized by higher volatility and risks compared to other tokens. Binance will periodically review and assess projects that meet these criteria, monitoring their development closely. If deemed appropriate, these projects could be migrated to Binance&#8217;s main platform.<br /><br />Both Voyager (VGX) and FTX (FTT) have experienced a significant decline in interest since filing for bankruptcy in 2022. VGX, for instance, has dropped from over $1 to approximately $0.15911 at the time of writing, representing an 83% decline over the past year. Its market capitalization has also plummeted to around $40 million from a peak of over $300 million, with a daily trading volume below $10 million.<br /><br />Similarly, FTX&#8217;s FTT has witnessed a rapid decline from its previous heights. The token, associated with the bankrupt exchange, has fallen by over 96% to $1.18594 after reaching an all-time high of over $84 in 2021. Currently, its market capitalization stands at $390.05 million, with a trading volume of $11 million.<br /><br />As the situation unfolds, Binance&#8217;s move to the innovation zone provides a new opportunity for these struggling tokens to potentially turn their fortunes around.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tether-predicts-700-million-q1-profit-cto-reveals/">Tether</a>, the dominant player in the stablecoin market, recently <a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-latest-q1-2023-assurance-report-shows-reserves-surplus-at-all-time-high-of-244b-up-148b-in-net-profit-new-categories-for-additional-transparency-reveals-bitcoin-and-gold-allocations/">released</a> its Q1 2023 financial report, revealing an impressive net profit of $1.5 billion. BDO Italia, an auditing firm, attested to the accuracy of the report, adding credibility to the figures.<br /><br />The reserves report provided a comprehensive breakdown of Tether&#8217;s assets as of March 31, showcasing a significant increase in reserves to $2.44 billion. Notably, the report introduced new asset categories, such as physical gold, diversifying Tether&#8217;s holdings. Additionally, the first quarter witnessed remarkable growth in both profit and token circulation, with a 20% increase.<br /><br />Tether&#8217;s total consolidated assets amounted to a staggering $81.8 billion, with a substantial portion invested in US Treasury bills. In a strategic move to enhance security and liquidity for its users, Tether revealed its plan to reduce reliance on traditional bank deposits and instead engage with the repo market.<br /><br />Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of Tether, expressed satisfaction with the net profits, highlighting how they underscored the platform&#8217;s stability. Ardoino emphasized Tether&#8217;s continuous monitoring of the global economic landscape to safeguard customer funds. However, concerns have been raised by former SEC official John Reed Stark regarding Tether&#8217;s operations.<br /><br />Stark cautioned that an attestation report should not be equated with a conventional financial audit, casting doubt on the financial stability of a firm like Tether that operates without a certified financial audit. He also raised concerns about Tether&#8217;s regulatory status, pointing out its lack of SEC registration and investor protection. Stark&#8217;s remarks highlight the importance of ongoing scrutiny of Tether&#8217;s operations and regulatory compliance.<br /><br />While Tether&#8217;s Q1 performance paints a lucrative picture, the company must address the concerns raised by industry experts and regulatory bodies to ensure transparency and build trust within the crypto community.</p>

<p>Data from <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">ycharts.com</a> shows that the average transaction fee for Bitcoin has spiked to $30.91, a level not seen since April 2021. The period leading up to April 2021 was marked by Bitcoin&#8217;s surge to $64,900, fueled by Coinbase&#8217;s NASDAQ listing and the narrative that crypto was going mainstream. <br /><br />However, this run came to an abrupt end when China extended its anti-crypto policy to ban proof-of-work mining and Tesla <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-stop-accepting-bitcoin-for-car-purchases.html">announced</a> it would stop accepting BTC for vehicle purchases due to environmental concerns.<br /><br />Currently, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/dogecoin-real-life-currency-or-meme-coin-only/">meme coin</a> mania is driving activity on the Bitcoin network via the recently released BRC-20 standard. BRC-20 was created in March by an anonymous individual known as &#8220;<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-bitcoin-brc-20-tokens/">Domo</a>&#8221; and allows fungible assets to operate on the Bitcoin chain. Taproot, launched in November 2021, enabled this by making transactions quicker and more cost-effective, laying the groundwork for smart contracts and dApps. However, this has led to higher transaction fees and chain bloat, as warned by commentators at the time.<br /><br />The top three BRC-20 tokens by market cap are Ordi, Nals, and Pepe, valued at $411.3 million, $42.3 million, and $34.7 million, respectively, according to the <a href="https://brc-20.io/">brc-20.io</a> website. Despite the triviality of some token names, some experts believe that BRC-20 tokens will be a significant factor in driving Bitcoin dominance and rendering Ethereum irrelevant in the next bull market.<br /><br />Willy Woo points out that while there are pros and cons to the current situation, an alternative source of mining revenue is needed to keep miners incentivized as block rewards will be zero one day. However, the trade-off is &#8220;bad for nodes and decentralization,&#8221; especially since the impact of Ordinals is happening at a time when mining rewards are still high.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/paypals-crypto-cache-surges-to-604-million-by-2022-end/">PayPal</a> has announced that it now holds $943 million in customers&#8217; crypto assets, representing a 56% increase from the previous quarter. The company allows users in some regions to buy, hold, sell, and pay for purchases using cryptocurrency. However, PayPal doesn&#8217;t hold any cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet other than those belonging to its customers.<br /><br />According to the latest Q1 2023<a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001633917/195d9afa-779f-4932-b227-90f0a170923e.pdf"> Form 10-Q SEC filing,</a> customers&#8217; crypto deposits surged from $604 million in the prior quarter to $943 million as of March 31. Bitcoin was the most popular cryptocurrency in terms of current holdings and quarter-over-quarter percentage increase, spiking 71% to just short of half a billion dollars. Ethereum, the second-most held cryptocurrency, saw a 45% increase in deposits, while &#8220;Other,&#8221; consisting of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, saw gains of plus 30%.<br /><br />PayPal noted that accounting for cryptocurrency involves several risks, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks, which is why crypto assets are recorded as both a liability and an asset on their books.<br /><br />Although the total crypto market experienced a significant increase of 49%, rising from $796 billion on December 31, 2022, to $1,183 billion on March 31, 2023, the exact <a href="https://investor.pypl.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx">breakdown</a> of PayPal customers&#8217; holdings is unclear. <br /><br />Therefore, it is uncertain precisely how much of the 56% quarter-over-quarter increase in deposits relates to increased crypto holdings or the increase in dollar value over that period. However, the majority of the increase likely relates to an increase in the dollar value of holdings rather than a jump in customers&#8217; deposits.</p>

<p>Liechtenstein&#8217;s Prime Minister, Daniel Risch, has <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/kryptowaehrung-liechtenstein-will-staatliche-dienstleistungen-kuenftig-auch-in-bitcoin-bezahlen-lassen/29134712.html">announced</a> plans to enable Bitcoin payments for various government services. While he did not disclose whether the country plans to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender, citizens will be allowed to settle government services in Bitcoin, with the option for authorities to swap the crypto assets for Swiss francs. <br /><br />This move<a href="https://www.liechtensteinusa.org/article/liechtensteins-parliament-approves-blockchain-act-unanimously"> follows</a> the passage of the <em>&#8220;Blockchain Act,&#8221;</em> which set clear standards in the sector and provided maximum protection to users. Additionally, Liechtenstein&#8217;s leading private bank, LGT Bank, partnered with SEBA Bank in 2022 to enable direct investments in digital currencies for its clients.<br /><br />Switzerland&#8217;s city of Lugano, Liechtenstein&#8217;s western neighbor, has also made moves toward adopting cryptocurrencies. The domestic authorities have developed an infrastructure to make Bitcoin, Tether, and LVGA tokens official means of settlement in the region. This initiative, called PlanB, aims to enable locals to pay taxes or public service fees via the aforementioned assets. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tether-utilized-signature-bank-to-gain-access-to-us-financial-market/">Tether</a> outlined in March this year that the initiative has been quite successful during the first year of its existence, with more than 150 domestic merchants accepting BTC, USDT, and LVGA as payment methods, while the total number could surpass 2,500 by the end of 2023.<br /><br />The move towards cryptocurrencies in Liechtenstein and Switzerland highlights the increasing acceptance and mainstream adoption of digital assets worldwide. However, it remains to be seen if Liechtenstein will follow in the footsteps of El Salvador and the Central African Republic and adopt BTC as legal tender.</p>
