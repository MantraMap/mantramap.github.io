										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/14143840/polygon-MATIC.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="polygon matic price" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U-shaped recovery in the polygon coin price showed the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern.</a> This bullish reversal pattern is a sign of sustained recovery, which could gradually rise the coin&#8217;s market value significantly. Under the influence of this pattern, today, the polygon coin price gave a bullish breakout from the $1.13 barrier. Here’s how far this pattern may lead to a bullish recovery. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A high momentum breakout from the $1.13 breakout sets the polygon coin for a 10% rise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A golden crossover between the 50-and-200-day EMAs attracts more buyers in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC  is $1.07 Billion, indicating a 14% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/FRijp7I4.png" alt="Polycoin Coin" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the new year recovery in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/">Polygon coin price</a> gave a bullish breakout from the monthly resistance of $0.95 on January 14th. This breakout indicated the prices are out of the accumulation zone and could trigger a fresh recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the coin prices went sideways and above the breached resistance, trying to stabilize the bullish trend.  Thus, this correction phase was important for MATIC price as it neutralized the excess buying and checked coin sustainability at higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the replenished bullish momentum surged the prices higher and pierced immediate resistance of $1.04 and $1.13. Today, the polygon price traders at $1.17 and is 55% up since Jan 1st low. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-discord-groups-servers/">Top Crypto Discord Servers/Groups Worth Joining In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the daily candle closes above $1.13, the buyers are getting a suitable launchpad to take a jump from and resume the bullish trend. With sustained buying, the coin price could rise 10% higher to hit the $1.3 neckline of the rounding bottom pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in response to this pattern formation, the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-discord-groups-servers/">Polygon coin price</a> should surpass the $1.3 barrier in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the falltish EMA(20, 50, and 100) started bending upward accentute a strong recovery in MATIC price</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> rising back to the overbought region gives an additional confirmation that market sentiment favors bullish growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1.17</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $1.3 and $1.145</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $1.13 and $1.04</span></li>

By the press time, the coin price traded at $17.8 and registered a 482% gain over the past four weeks. However, the price analysis justifies this growth with the repetitive formation of a bullish pattern called Flag. Here’s how this bullish continuation pattern could influence Aptos’s future price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the flag pattern resistance trendline could hint at the resumption of price recovery </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 26th, the daily chart candle showed a high wick rejection at $20, indicating the sellers are aggressively defending this level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Aptos is $1.25 Billion, indicating a 53% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptos Price Prediction Shows Repetitive Formation Of Bullish Pattern</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/BYdDldEl.png" alt="Aptos Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish continuations pattern displays itself with a strong bull run followed by a minor counter-trend correction to recuperate the bullish momentum. In theory, this minor pullback neutralizes the excess buying and refuels buying pressure for higher gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month the Aptos price action has already formed this pattern twice, and the third one is in progress. Thus, this altcoin&#8217;s recent reversal from $20 psychological resistance has triggered the current pullback.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buying pressure persists in the market, a bullish breakout from the pattern&#8217;s resistance trendline will offer buyers a suitable launchpad to prolong the price rally. In an ideal bullish scenario, the post-breakout rally could push the Aptos price to the $26 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the traders should be cautious at $20 as it could assist sellers in undermining the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, a renounced crypto Enthusiast/Traders @LaCryptoLycus recently highlighted the strong bullish momentum in Aptos coin, which indicate more upside potential in the ongoing bull run.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptos blockchain remains a tough competitor for Solana, with a performance goal exceeding 100,000 transactions per second. The recent drop in SOL price due to its relation with the FTX crypto exchange cautioned several investors for this blockchain and gave an additional edge to Aptos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite the panic selling, the SOL price has recovered significantly and remains fundamentally strong. Moreover, it continues to carry out fast and cost-efficient transactions and will continue to rank as one of the top-performing layer 1 coin blockchains for the time being.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index(4-hour):</strong> despite the price pullback, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> continues to stay above the midline, indicating the bullish sentiment among the market participants remains intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the rising EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) could offer significant support during the occasional pullback in the Aptos coin.</span></p>

The White House issued a call to government departments across the board, urging them to coordinate what has been a fragmented approach to the new asset class up until this point.</p>
<h2>U.S. To Prioritize Digital Assets</h2>
<p>According to a statement that was released by senior officials in the United States, including the chief of the National Economic Council Brian Deese and the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the Biden Administration will announce its priorities for research and development of digital assets in the coming months.</p>
<p>The officials believe that U.S. government agencies should continue their efforts to increase enforcement and issue new guidance for cryptocurrencies as necessary. These new guidances should include those that address and limit the exposure of financial institutions to the risks associated with digital assets. They add that the events that took place over the course of the past year underline that more is needed.&#8221;<br />
Additionally, officials claim that Congress should increase the authority of regulators in order to avoid the misuse of customers&#8217; money.</p>
<p>They were quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many everyday investors who trusted cryptocurrency companies—including young people and people of color—suffered serious losses, but, thankfully, turmoil in the cryptoc markets has had little negative impact on the broader financial system.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New Guidelines For Crypto Businesses</h2>
<p>In the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/nec/briefing-room/2023/01/27/the-administrations-roadmap-to-mitigate-cryptocurrencies-risks/" rel="nofollow">statement</a>, Congress was also advised to enhance disclosure and transparency standards for crypto-centric businesses, impose fines for breaking laws governing illegal money, and collaborate more closely with foreign law enforcement partners. Additionally, the authorities recommended against Congress&#8217; decision to greenlight mainstream institutions, such as pension funds, to leap headfirst into <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> markets while formulating new crypto regulations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p>The Biden Administration believes that deepening the connections between cryptocurrency and the larger financial system would be a big mistake. Although <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> was not specifically mentioned in the statement, its influence figured prominently over the officials&#8217; recommendation, which referred to 2022 as &#8220;a tough year for cryptocurrencies&#8221; marked by the collapse of &#8220;a major <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a>&#8221; and the implosion of an algorithmic stablecoin&#8211;hinting at <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/terra-luna/">Terra&#8217;s UST</a>&#8211;which caused a flurry of liquidations.</p>
<blockquote><p>It would be a grave mistake to enact legislation that reverses course and deepens the ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial system.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Biden Administration will be announcing priorities for digital assets research development, which will enable the systems underlying cryptocurrencies to protect consumers by default, according to the four officials, in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>

However, since last week, the bullish sentiment has stalled and triggered a minor correction phase in these coins. Having said that, the technical chart shows some of the meta coins revealed a bullish setup that could provide higher gain in the near future. Here&#8217;s a list of top metaverse coins to buy before the recovery rally resumes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U-shaped recovery in the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/decentraland/">MANA price</a> recently hit the $0.735 resistance, accounting for 160% growth within the first three weeks of 2023. However, the prices immediately shifted sideways later on and started resonating between the $0.735 and $0.6 levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This consolidation phase, after the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">U-shaped recovery,</a> reveals the formation of a cup and handle pattern. Therefore, under the influence of the bullish pattern, the MANA price is well likely to breach the $0.735 resistance and offer an entry opportunity for interested traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal bullish scenario, the post-break rally could drive the MANA price 72% rise to hit the $1.12 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandbox(SAND)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/ToXVeWn9.png" alt="SAND" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 14th, the Sandbox coin price gave a bullish breakout from the long coming resistance of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">falling channel pattern</a>. Thus, after facing aggressive selling from the downsloping trendline, the bullish breakout could be a sign that market sentiment has shifted from selling to buying on dips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-breakout rally surged the<a href="https://coingape.com/decentraland-vs-the-sandbox-who-will-reach-1-first-in-2023/"> SAND price</a> 22% higher to hit the $0.81 resistance recently. However, with the current uncertainty in the crypto market, the coin price reverted from the aforementioned resistance and plunged to the $0.72 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the ongoing correction could tumble the price by another 10% to retest the breached resistance of $0.64. Anyhow, if the buyers sustain above the flipped support, the SAND price could witness a sustained recovery to the $0.98 to $1.5 mark.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axie infinity(AXS)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1Ewyz57z.png" alt="AXS" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly to the Sandbox coin, the Axie Infinity coin price gave a bullish breakout from the resistance trendline of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern.</a> The post-breakout rally pushed the prices 63% higher to poke the $13 resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the coin price reverted from the aforementioned resistance indicating the exhausted bullish momentum. Anyhow, this minor retracement could benefit the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/axie-infinity/">AXS price</a> by replenishing the bullish momentum and providing a pullback opportunity to interested traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The correction fall could revisit the $10.2 support and check price sustainability at higher chart levels. Anyhow, in response to this bullish pattern, the AXS price could offer a potential target to the $20 or $27.3 mark.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amazon NFT News</strong>: With the news of tech major Amazon preparing to launch its digital assets enterprise, the onus is now on the cryptocurrencies that previously partnered with the e-commerce company. What caught the attention of the crypto community is the speculation of Amazon&#8217;s plans to announce the crypto ambitions as early as April 2023. This could well be a landmark moment in the history of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/">web 3.0</a> industry that is yet to gain full acceptance from the mainstream companies. However, it remains to be seen how soon would Amazon bring full fledged products.</p>

<p>Considering the massive customer reach Amazon enjoys worldwide, the NFT initiative could turn out to be a huge success. At the same time, it could mark huge validation and adoption for the web 3.0 space. Reports suggested that the e-commerce giant is pushing its <a href="https://coingape.com/report-amazons-nft-program-is-coming-this-spring/">Amazon NFT plan</a> for launch in the next quarter. The company appears to be planning to make its customers play crypto games and reward with free NFTs.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrencies In Partnership With Amazon</h2>
<p>As recently as 11 January 2023, Amazon Web Services (AWS) inked a partnership with <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/#:~:text=Proof%20of%20Stake%20solves%20the,is%20set%20at%2032%20ETH.">proof of stake</a> blockchain Avalanche (AVAX). Ava Labs, the company behind <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/building-application-specific-blockchains-with-aws-on-avalanche/">Avalanche, teamed up with AWS</a> in an effort to accelerate web 3.0 adoption. Thanks to the partnership, AWS Marketplace allows for launching an Avalanche validator node in a simple way. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.chainlinkecosystem.com/ecosystem/aws-amazon">AWS had also partnered with Chainlink</a> (LINK) for the node creating solution. This enabled node operators and data providers in the Chainlink ecosystem to connect to blockchains within minutes.</p>
<p>The Amazon Web Services had also tied up with public blockchain <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://medium.com/vechain-foundation/amazon-web-services-aws-becomes-technology-partner-to-vecarbon-enabling-inter-national-scale-162fbad6dd39">VeChainThor</a> for blockchain-based carbon management services.</p>

Often hailed as the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/shiba-inu-shib/">Shiba Inu</a>-killer, the token saw a massive price surge of 25%  following a community proposal that would burn a colossal number of its circulating tokens.</p>
<h2>4.97 Trillion Floki Burn</h2>
<p>The developers of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/floki-inu/">Floki Inu</a> have proposed a governance change that would involve the elimination of almost $55 million worth of the project&#8217;s namesake FLOKI tokens and a reduction in the tax that is imposed on each transaction. As an additional line of reasoning, the proposal cited the potential safety hazards that are linked with bridges. As per reports, over 2 billion dollars were either misplaced or stolen from cross-chain bridges alone in the past year.</p>
<p>Tokens can be destroyed through a process known as &#8220;burning,&#8221; which lowers the total supply of tokens in circulation. This, in turn, increases the value of each token so long as demand stays the same.</p>
<p>The proposal stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>More exploits and data have emerged to show how much of a threat cross-chain bridges could pose, especially if they hold a significant amount of a token’s supply.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Floki (FLOKI) Price Surge</h2>
<p>They went on to say that in the instance of Floki, an attack on their major cross-chain bridge would have a devastating effect on the project due to the fact that the bridge presently carries 55.7% of what FLOKI&#8217;s entire <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/circulating-supply/">circulating supply</a> should be. If this vulnerability is exploited, it will allow the draining of the project&#8217;s liquidity pools and will, in effect, bring the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/floki-inu/" rel="nofollow">project</a> to its knees.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p>Floki&#8217;s token was first minted on <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, with a total quantity of 10 trillion tokens, before finally extending to the BNB Chain in 2021, touting it to be both faster and cheaper. This expansion was in response to requests from the community.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136874" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/27194102/Screenshot_20230127_194040.png" alt="" width="1188" height="651" /></p>
<p>As a direct result of the brewing bullish sentiment surrounding the token, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/">market capitalization</a> and 24-hour trading volume skyrocketed by 20% to $118 million and 37% to $4 million respectively; demonstrating the growing interest in the market. Currently, the price of Floki (FLOKI) is being traded at $0.00001316. This represents an increase of 25% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 30% jump during the last seven days, as per <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker CoinMarketCap.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past two months, the Apecoin price rose while resonating between two trendlines, indicating the formation of a parallel channel pattern.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1280" height="720" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/23151844/Apecoin-APE_Yuga-Labs.png" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="ape" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two months, the Apecoin price rose while resonating between two trendlines, indicating the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">parallel channel pattern</a>. Now, in theory, this rising channel is actually a bearish continuation pattern whose most common outcome is the breakdown of the rising support trendline. However, the coin price recently gave a bullish breakout from the pattern’s resistance trendline and undermined the prior bearish theory. This bullish breakout hints at a potential bullish rally in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $5.93 breakout sets Apecoin price on a 22% rise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rising 20-day EMA could provide dynamic support to the Apecoin price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Apecoin is $173. Million, indicating a 26% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/i/is619kOK.png" alt="Apecoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 21st, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/apecoin/">Apecoin price</a> gave a high momentum breakout from the long-coming trendline of a rising parallel channel pattern. Now, a bullish breakout from a famous bearish continuation pattern projects a strong commitment from buyers to lead a prolonged recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This breached trendline should offer buyers a suitable launchpad to climb to the higher levels and entry opportunities for new traders. However, earlier this week, several higher rejection candles near $6 indicated the sellers are trying to defend this level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rejection candles suggested the earlier breakout was a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-bull-trap-in-crypto/">bull trap</a>, and the prices should witness a minor correction. Having said that, on January 25th, the daily chart showed a massive bullish engulfing candle, which offset the threats of the rejection candle by closing above the $5.93 local resistance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Apecoim price traded at $6.28 and registered a 15% gain in the last three days. Thus, with sustained buying, the coin price could rise another 22% and hit the $7.64 ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, the traders looking for an entry opportunity can consider buying if the price revisits the breached trendline or $5.93 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> approaching the oversold region indicates aggressive buying in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the 20-50-and-100-day EMA change their direction to upward accentuates a sustained recovery phase for Apecoin holders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apecoin Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $6.22</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $7 and $7.6</span></li>

Since this is anticipated to be the final announcement prior to the general elections in 2024, all eyes are on the announcement. The sector anticipates that the budget for 2023–24 will help India reach its $5 trillion economic goal.</p>
<p>With increased Capex, improved infrastructure, and incentives for important industries like manufacturing and services. However, it is no longer a noble objective but rather a doable strategy that is ready for implementation. This budget seeks to resolve current issues and strengthen the country for the ensuing decades.</p>
<h2>Expectations for the Union Budget 2023</h2>
<p>The income tax division claims that a sizable portion of taxpayers are people who earn a living from salaries. ITR-1s from members of the salaried class made up nearly 50% of all ITRs submitted in 2022. With the exception of the new tax structure, however, the salaries of people had very little to celebrate in the recent budgets. They are hoping for a few things to happen. To be fair, given the harsh effects of layoffs, pay cuts, rising inflation, and the worry of a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-does-global-recession-mean-causes-and-how-to-survive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global recession</a></strong>, the past few years have been challenging for them.</p>
<p>The following potential adjustments could be made to the salary class&#8217;s budget:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tax Exemption Limit</li>
<li>Increased Standard Deduction</li>
<li>Decluttering Section 80C</li>
<li>Deductions for Medical Insurance Premium</li>
<li>Reduced Surcharge Rate</li>
<li>Validity of other Deductions</li>
<li>Reviewing Children&#8217;s Education and Hostel Allowance</li>
</ol>

But how do you buy into it? This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to buy Cardano (ADA) and an overview of some fundamentals that could help investors maximize their experience. Let&#8217;s begin!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Cardano (ADA)?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/">Cardano is a cryptocurrency</a> that was founded in 2015. Cardano is similar to other cryptocurrencies in that it is a decentralized digital currency that can be used for peer-to-peer transactions. However, Cardano differentiates itself from other cryptocurrencies in a few key ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, Cardano is built on a unique proof-of-stake algorithm designed to be more energy-efficient than other <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/"><strong>proof-of-work algorithms</strong></a>. Second, Cardano has a layered architecture that allows for the development of complex decentralized applications. Finally, Cardano&#8217;s scientific philosophy and research approach emphasize rigorous analysis and peer-reviewed research. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to buy Cardano (ADA)?</span></h2>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy Ripple (XRP) On Different Platforms</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous exchange platforms can be used to buy Ripple (XRP), including Binance, Kraken, and Bitstamp. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to research before selecting one. </span></p>
<h3><b>Binance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a rel='nofollow'  href="http://binance.com/en" rel="nofollow">Binance</a> is a popular choice for those looking to buy Ripple (XRP) because it offers a variety of features and is relatively easy to use.

<h3><b>Bitstamp</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitstamp is another option that can be used to purchase Ripple (XRP). Bitstamp is one of the oldest exchange platforms and is considered to be reliable. However, Bitstamp has been hacked in the past and may not be as secure as some of the other options. Follow the below-mentioned steps to buy Ripple (XRP) on Bitstamp: </span></p>
<p><b>Step 1: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to Bitstamp and click on Sign Up to create an account. </span></p>

<p><b>Step 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step is to place an order to buy Ripple (XRP). You can do this by going to the &#8220;Buy/Sell&#8221; page on the Bitstamp website and selecting &#8220;XRP&#8221; from the list of currencies. Then, enter the amount of Ripple (XRP) you want to buy and click &#8220;Buy.&#8221; Your order will then be executed, and your Ripple (XRP) will be deposited into your account.</span></p>
<h3><b>Paypal</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP is not available on PayPal. However, you can use PayPal to buy other cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged for XRP. When buying through PayPal, you&#8217;ll likely be paying a higher price than if you were to buy directly from an exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to buy Ripple (XRP) through Paypal; the first is to directly go to Paypal, choose the available cryptocurrencies, i.e., Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin, buy any of them, and then use them to buy XRP on any preferred exchange. If you&#8217;re looking to purchase Ripple (XRP) using Paypal, there are a few steps you&#8217;ll need to follow. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 1: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">make sure you have a Paypal account and that it&#8217;s sufficiently funded. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that offers Ripple (XRP) and accepts Paypal as a payment method. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;ve registered for an account and logged in on your preferred exchange, go to the deposit page and select Paypal from the list of payment options. Enter the amount of Ripple (XRP) you wish to buy, then click on the &#8216;Buy&#8217; button. Your Ripple (XRP) will be deposited into your account immediately.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, withdraw your Ripple (XRP) to the wallet of your choice &#8211; we recommend using the official (Ripple) Wallet for maximum security.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottom Line</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, buying Ripple (XRP) is easy and a great way to diversify your portfolio. It can easily be done online through established cryptocurrency exchanges.

Aside from its effects on staking, it&#8217;s also ETH to new heights in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">cryptocurrency market</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, an open-source <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> with smart contract functionality used to run on Proof-of-work, which made the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-mining/">mining</a> process expensive and energy intensive. After the merge, Ethereum’s mechanism shifted from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the database secure. Now, what changes <strong>Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade</strong> brings for ETH holders?</p>
<h2>The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Have a Huge Impact on ETH</h2>
<p>In March 2023, the Shanghai/Capella fork will go live. Jack Niewold, Founder of Crypto Pragmatist, an email newsletter on the narratives and assets shaping crypto, recently tweeted,</p>
<blockquote><p>“about 14% of total ETH supply is staked, and it can be unstaked after the Shanghai fork. This makes some people bearish”</p></blockquote>
<p>On Monday, Ethereum&#8217;s core developers deployed the first mainnet shadow fork designed to test the readiness of ETH staking withdrawal capability. This brought ETH holders one step closer to accessing the $26 billion worth of Ethereum.</p>

<h2>Withdrawals and ETH Developers Feud</h2>
<p>Where the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ethereum-merge/">Ethereum merge</a> introduced the ability for users to deposit ETH with the network, The Shanghai upgrade will allow ETH holders to stake their coins since the Beacon Chain, Ethereum’s Proof of Stake consensus layer. However, some of Ethereum’s devs believe the team is rushing the Shanghai upgrade. Micah Zoltu, an Ethereum dev, stated that the current Shanghai code does not allow ETH withdrawals to be compatible, and a rushed launch will create more problems for both developers and holders. They believe that the unstaking of ETH is acceding to public demands and not so much about the long-term health of Ethereum.</p>

Though it stands to lose a lot if the case goes in favor of the SEC, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> is expected to embark on a new journey north in the forthcoming month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Top 5 reasons why Ripple might explode in February 2023</h2>
<h4>Whales Effect</h4>
<p>In a stunning display of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">crypto-currency</a> power, XRP crypto whales have purchased up to 70 million worth of XRP tokens in multiple transactions over the past 24 hours. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="nofollow">WhaleAlert</a>, $29.1 million worth of XRP tokens were transferred from an unknown wallet to Bitstamp. And soon after, 30,200,000 of the token, valued at $12,867,050, were moved from Bitso to another unknown wallet.</p>
<h4>Strong Partnerships</h4>
<p>Strategic partnerships are an essential element of a business&#8217;s growth strategy. And it&#8217;s no different for XRP. Ripple has partnered with more than 100 financial institutions including Santander (USA) Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Canada) Kotak Mahindra Bank (India).</p>

<h4>Social Dominance</h4>
<p>XRP has one of the biggest social dominance, which can easily lead to price surges ahead. At the time of writing, XRP is hovering around $0.4058 and has an $877,832,945 24-hour trading volume. The coin has increased by 4.41% during the past seven days and there are subtle cues to suggest that more gains will be had in the very near future.</p>

<h4>Ripple’s Post-SEC Future</h4>
<p>One of the latest news about the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit is that the US District Court Judge Analisa Torres overruled the SEC’s objections to providing emails sent by William Hinman (former Finance Division Director). Looking at the recent price surge, XRP does have a chance to reach the $0.5 mark by the end of February 2023. However, if the SEC trial goes in Ripple’s favor, the price may even surge higher than $1.</p>

Indeed, Paul Buccheit, the creator of Gmail, claimed on Twitter that the program could bring down Google in &#8220;a year or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a tweet from <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-chatgpt-3-why-it-has-become-so-popular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a></strong> employee Sam Altman, the tool was introduced in November 2022 and quickly gathered more than one million users. In the last few weeks, ChatGPT has shown off its prowess by producing instant and intricate essays, marketing pitches, poems, jokes, and even a draught of a US congressman&#8217;s speech. There are also concerns that AI may replace some human jobs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google may be only a year or two away from total disruption. AI will eliminate the Search Engine Result Page, which is where they make most of their money.</p>

<h2>ChatGPT clears MBA Exam</h2>
<p>The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the top business schools in the world, tested ChatGPT last week. The professor was absolutely stunned to see that it passed the MBA exam. Professor Christian Terwiesch investigated ChatGPT&#8217;s performance on the Operations Management final exam, a typical MBA core course. However, later published his findings in a research paper.</p>
<p>Later, the news service AFP reported that ChatGPT passed exams at a US law school. However, after writing essays on subjects like constitutional law, taxation, and torts.</p>
<h3>It can affect the cryptocurrency market.</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a></strong> market may be impacted by ChatGPT in a number of different ways. It can be used to analyze market data, forecast future trends, and find trading opportunities. It can also be used to make decisions and create automated trading algorithms.</p>
<p>By examining market data, ChatGPT can assist traders in taking better decisions and seizing new opportunities. Finally, it can help with customer service by promptly and accurately responding to queries from users.</p>

According to documents submitted to the bankruptcy court by FTX&#8217;s advisors, the defunct crypto empire owes money to an astonishing variety of businesses, some of which are Wells Fargo &amp; Co., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p>
<h2>Industry Heavyweights As Creditors</h2>
<p>The names of the individuals are concealed throughout a 116-page document that was submitted on Wednesday and details FTX&#8217;s creditors. The dossier comprises thousands of entries. However, the exhaustive list mentions powerful figures from across Wall Street as having some sort of association with <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s</a> crypto exchange, which even rivaled <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> at one point in time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p>The list of creditors also includes commercial airlines, such as American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Spirit Airlines; media businesses, such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal and several major players in the technology industry, including the likes of Netflix, Apple, and <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/">Metaverse</a>-focused Meta. Besides these, the list includes Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Bank, and MUFG Bank.</p>
<h2>FTX&#8217;s Growing Concerns</h2>
<p>The document does not reveal the total amount owed or the nature of the debt, as FTX has requested that the names of individual creditors, who were primarily customers of FTX, be withheld from public view. Even though the parties are included on the creditor list, it does not always imply that they had an FTX account.</p>
<p>In a statement that was submitted to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bankruptcy/">bankruptcy</a> court on Thursday, attorneys for FTX stated that the list is designed to be extremely comprehensive for the purposes of service and it includes parties that may appear in the books and records of the debtors for a variety of reasons. According to a spokesman from Deutsche Bank, the company does not have any credit exposure to FTX, while a representative from Goldman Sachs was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs has not filed a claim against the debtors. This type of creditor matrix is prepared by the debtors for the purpose of providing notice to interested parties in a bankruptcy proceeding and is not necessarily evidence of a creditor relationship.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is believed that FTX has more than one million creditors, with the top 50 creditors being due a total of more than $3 billion combined.</p>

Experts suggested the SEC win a warning bell for the crypto industry. However, the last hearing in LBRY Vs SEC is expected to drive the much anticipated ruling in the XRP lawsuit.</p>
<h2>XRP lawsuit ruling when?</h2>
<p>Amicus Curiae in the SEC vs XRP lawsuit, John Deaton asserted that the <a href="https://coingape.com/lbry-vs-ripple-lawsuit-why-sec-may-actually-lose-xrp-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming hearing in the LBRY case</a> is going to be important for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the crypto industry</a>. It is anticipated that the SEC will be using the Judge’s decision in order to apply it to all LBRY Credits (LBC) transactions. The attorney highlighted that this will include secondary market transactions where a user tips a content provider with LBC tokens.</p>
<p>The SEC in the XRP lawsuit has tried to establish that Ripple is a common enterprise. However, this claim has become a real problem for the commission now. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SEC has already received a ruling on the record that many LBC token holders, if not the vast majority, did not see LBC tokens as an investment. While they utilized LBRY’s tokens for personal consumption as a means to make money.</p>
<h2>Will Ripple case can reach Apex court?</h2>
<p>Deaton articulated that if the Howey Test is strictly applied in the manner how Supreme Court used it in 1946. Most of the cryptos will fail to satisfy the Howey test he added. While the SEC publicly admitted that it disregards the common enterprise factor.</p>
<p>However, the SEC has already stated that they do not require vertical or horizontal commonality per de. While it does not view “commons enterprise” as a distinct element of the term investment contract.</p>
<p>Attorney brought up the Supreme Court’s West Virginia Vs EPA ruling. He stated that with the current trend set by the court, there will be a ruling in the favor of Ripple if the case makes it that far.</p>

However, there seems to be a growing deviation in terms of accumulating and selling LDO tokens. The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> Shanghai update, which allows stakers to withdraw their staked funds, is scheduled for March 2023. Although the event looks to be on track for deployment in March, any changes could possibly delay the upgrade.</p>

<h2>Lido Whales Selling</h2>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/ldo-the-sharks-are-impressed-the-whales-not-so-much-7187">On chain data</a> shows that the Lido whales holding 1,000,000 to 100,000,000 LDO tokens have been on a selling spree while those holding 100 and 1,000,000 LDO tokens are on an accumulation phase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136839" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/27155018/LDO.png" alt="" width="3840" height="1300" /></p>
<h2>How Shanghai Upgrade Will Turn Out</h2>
<p>The Shanghai upgrade is the most anticipated development initiative for the Ethereum community after The Merge. Contrary to popular market opinion, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum-merge/">The Merge</a> event did not come off as a &#8216;buy the news&#8217; event and the ETH price did not shoot up after the upgrade was completed in September 2022. Similarly, there is a section of the community that believes the Shanghai upgrade will fail to reflect price upside for ETH. It is argued that as opposed to the perception that the staked ETH will be withdrawn, more tokens will be staked after the upgrade.</p>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/LeeorShimron/status/1618305735255023617">Leeor Shimron</a> on Twitter, the upgrade could lead to reduced selling pressure with more tokens staked than withdrawn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Opening withdrawals may lead to a higher number of tokens staked and reduce sell pressure, as it could assuage would-be stakers that their tokens are freely redeemable and no longer locked for an indeterminable amount of time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If this view goes on to be true, against the market expectation, Ethereum (ETH) as well as Lido DAO (LDO) price could see negative action. As of writing, Ethereum price stands at $1,579, down 1.55% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">CoinGape price tracker</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto tax software is a program that helps you prepare taxes for your earnings on crypto assets. It allows you to calculate your profit and loss from cryptocurrency trading, as well as capital gains and losses and expense deductions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, this type of software also includes a full crypto portfolio tracker and analysis tool to provide a centralized view of all your crypto holdings across multiple exchanges and wallets. Crypto tax software also makes it simple to calculate and file your crypto taxes.</span></p>
<h3>Crypto Tax Regulations In the UK</h3>
<p>Crypto regulations around the world are still in their infancy as more countries figure out how to deal with this emerging industry. Though, a common consensus has emerged among developed countries to heavily tax crypto earnings. The UK is one of them. However, it can be a tumultuous process to calculate tax on your crypto earnings. In this article, we explore the best crypto tax software in the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3><strong>How Is Crypto Tax Calculated In The UK?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who acquire, sell, or receive cryptocurrencies through a trade typically have to pay income tax. A &#8220;day trader&#8221; is someone who actively buys and sells crypto assets in order to make a profit in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when trading on their own account, people are unlikely to qualify as &#8220;traders&#8221; for income tax reasons and are more likely to fall under the capital gains tax scheme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you reach the trading level, your net gains will be liable to national insurance at rates of 12% and 2%, as well as income taxes of 20%, 40%, and 45%, depending on the tax band your income falls into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any earnings from cryptocurrency as income will be subject to income tax: In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, tax rates range from 0% to 45%, while in Scotland, where there are two additional tax bands, the beginning rate is 19% and the intermediate rate is 21%. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax on Capital Income In United Kingdom: A Gist </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, anyone purchasing, holding, and disposing of cryptocurrencies on their own behalf is regarded as engaging in investing activity and is liable for capital gains tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When an individual&#8217;s total gains exceed the £12,300 yearly tax-free allowance, they are subject to capital gains tax. Gains that exceed this limit will be subject to a 20% tax rate on gains at the higher and additional tax rates, and a 10% tax up to the basic rate tax band.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s explore some of <strong>the top crypto tax software in the UK for 2023,</strong></span></p>
