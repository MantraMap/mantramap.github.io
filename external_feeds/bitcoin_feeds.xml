<h2>Whitepaper Submission and Review</h2>
<p>The Dubai digital asset regulator, Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), recently unveiled a schedule of fees for &#8220;the issuance of no-objection certificates to proprietary traders, amendments or withdrawal of licence applications.&#8221; Also, in its June 21 announcement, the regulator stated will be accepting and reviewing whitepaper submissions.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, proprietary traders in the country will be required to have a so-called no-objection certificate (NOC) before commencing any &#8220;proprietary trading in or from the Emirate of Dubai.&#8221; The annual NOC fee is pegged at approximately $367 (AED1,000) and no further fees are required from applicants.</p>
<p>For registered digital asset firms seeking to amend or change the details of their VARA license, a payment of approximately $184 is needed, the regulator said. On the other hand, licensed entities seeking to completely withdraw from the country will be asked to pay a license withdrawal fee of $3,670.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Concerning the regulation of whitepapers, VARA said issuers that seek review under its Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook will have to pay a fee of $1,830. An additional fee equivalent to $18,300 will be required for the “completion of a detailed review.” Similarly, requests to amend whitepapers will also be subject to a submission fee of $1,830 and a detailed review fee of up to $18,300.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in instances where &#8220;legal opinions or memorandums&#8221; are submitted to the regulator for review and consideration for the &#8220;regulatory perimeter applicable to a firm’s virtual asset activity,&#8221; VARA said a fee of up to $1,090 may be charged.</p>

According to reports, the move will allow companies to settle transactions for commodities in bulk, promoting the digital yuan, the Chinese central bank digital currency (CBDC), in international markets.</strong></p>
<h2>Shanghai Clearing House to Support Digital Yuan</h2>
<p>The Shanghai Clearing House, one of the largest counterparty and clearing companies in Asia and the world, recently introduced support for operations and settlements using the Chinese central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. According to local <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202306/1293131.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, the institution will allow its customers to settle bulk commodities payments with the digital yuan with no added fees for the time being.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that using the digital yuan in a large clearing house business will boost efficiency in managing commodity settlements. Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The launch of the services will make cross-border settlement of bulk commodities more secure, faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective for financial institutions and service providers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China was the <a href="https://trendeconomy.com/data/commodity_h2/TOTAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second</a> biggest commodities importer in the world in 2021, with 12.6% of all commodities being purchased by the nation for $2.68 trillion, just behind the U.S., which imported $2.93 trillion in the same period.</p>

<h2>Opening Paths for the Digital Yuan</h2>
<p>The measure can be seen as a natural extension of the movements that the People&#8217;s Bank of China has been making to position the digital yuan as a cross-border transactional currency after passing tests in retail environments.</p>
<p>Dong added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The move will also facilitate the internationalization of the Chinese currency, and provide the world with a trusted clearing system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The currency is also being tested with the Faster Payments System to allow Hong Kong citizens to pay with the digital yuan in mainland China. In May, the Chinese autonomous region of Guanxi <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-autonomous-region-of-guanxi-to-adopt-digital-yuan-in-push-for-asean-trade-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it was preparing to present the digital yuan at the next China-ASEAN Expo event. Guanxi also plans to use digital yuan as a settlement currency in cross-border trade with other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.</p>
<p>Previously, in April, it was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-pushes-digital-yuan-for-wage-payments-in-changshu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the city of Changshu, with more than 1.5 million inhabitants, would be the first city to use the digital yuan to pay for wages of city employees, including public servants in government offices, as well as schoolteachers, medical staff, and employees of state companies.</p>

According to local reports, Aksakov also stated that crypto users were looking forward to this legalization to use the assets for international settlements.</strong></p>
<h2>State Duma Official: Russia to Have &#8216;Serious&#8217; Control Over Crypto After Legalization</h2>
<p>Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the Financial Markets Committee of the Russian State Duma, has given an update about the legalization of crypto in Russia and the role of the Russian government regarding its control. According to <a href="https://t.me/therussianmarket/5728" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local media</a>, Aksakov hinted at establishing tight regulations regarding crypto transactions and service providers.</p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cryptocurrency will be legalized. Its movement will obviously be under serious control so that there will be no abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aksakov also declared that cryptocurrency users in Russia were expecting this legalization to allow for crypto to be used easily, including leveraging it to settle international transactions and avoid problems at the banking level. Aksakov explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They are ready to work in the legal space, because foreign banks are sometimes wary of interacting with Russian banks and making settlements with Russia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The State Duma official has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/financial-market-committee-chair-aksakov-joins-calls-for-identification-of-russian-crypto-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> the identification of cryptocurrency holders in Russia previously to &#8220;establish taxation and certain rights for cryptocurrency owners,&#8221; as well as offer protection in these markets.</p>

<h2>Using Crypto to Sidestep International Sanctions</h2>
<p>Aksakov remarked on the importance of using crypto as an instrument to expedite international trade.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-trial-digital-asset-settlements-in-foreign-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">informed</a> recently that it intends to run pilot tests of cross-border settlements using digital and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Deputy chairman of the CBR, Alexey Guznov, stressed that these settlements would not be available inside the country but were directed to expedite international transactions.</p>
<p>In this sense, Aksakov had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-enact-laws-to-regulate-crypto-exchange-action-profiles-use-of-cryptocurrency-to-bypass-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> before that &#8220;exchanges will be used for cross-border settlements, including bypassing sanctions restrictions, so new restrictions may be introduced against them&#8221; when announcing that the country had dropped the idea of a national cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>Aksakov also reported that he expected a bill regulating crypto to be passed by next October. Previously, Aksakov <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-companies-actively-using-crypto-russia-to-adopt-4-relevant-laws-official-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to pass four crypto-related laws during the State Duma&#8217;s spring session, which ends on July 30.</p>

The regulatory body seeks to not only shut down Prime Trust but also swiftly seize its property, assets, books, papers, documents, and records. The state&#8217;s financial overseer aims to place Prime Trust under receivership, ensuring a comprehensive resolution to the matter.</strong></p>
<h2>Nevada Regulator Moves to Shut Down Prime Trust as Crypto Custodian Faces Insolvency and Asset Accessibility Issues</h2>
<p>Nevada&#8217;s financial watchdog has raised <a href="https://fid.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/fidnvgov/content/Opinion/Prime%20Trust%20-%20C%20and%20D%206.21.23.pdf">concerns</a> about the financial status of crypto custodian Prime Trust. In a recent development, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division revealed that Prime Trust faced insolvency and was unable to fulfill customer withdrawal requests.</p>
<p>This disclosure, made five days ago, prompted the regulator to assert that Prime Trust had breached its fiduciary responsibilities. Consequently, on the same day, Prime Trust took the step of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-firms-face-turmoil-as-prime-trust-fallout-causes-service-disruptions-and-concerns/">suspending</a> both deposits and withdrawals, compounding the situation further.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/Q5WNMMS/prime-core-technologies-et-al-petition-pdf#page=7">filing</a> submitted to the Eighth Judicial District Court in Las Vegas and put forward by the regulator’s commissioner Sandy O’laughlin stresses that Prime Trust should be placed into receivership immediately.</p>
<p>The regulator wants to immediately impound the property including all assets, documents, and the firm’s application programming interface (API). The regulator wants to “appoint a receiver over Prime Trust with the authority to enter the business and immediately oversee operations.”</p>
<p>The filing says that in 2019, the company enlisted the services of Fireblocks, a digital asset security firm to safeguard assets. The migration to Fireblocks&#8217; platform was successfully carried out in 2020, rendering Prime Trust’s original wallet inactive.</p>
<p>With the arrival of new management in the same year, they were assured by their predecessors that all cryptocurrency assets could be accessed through the Fireblocks platform. In January 2021, the company reintroduced legacy wallet forwarding addresses for customers.</p>
<p>“Prime purportedly believed that these legacy wallets existed on the Fireblocks platform or were configured to forward to wallets accessible on the Fireblocks platform,” the filing details. Unfortunately, in December 2021, a revelation unfolded—the company found itself unable to access the legacy wallets and the digital currency they contained.</p>
<p>Faced with this predicament from December 2021 to March 2022, the company allegedly resorted to utilizing customer funds to procure additional digital currency in order to fulfill withdrawals from the inaccessible legacy wallets.</p>
<p>Despite relentless efforts, Prime Trust has yet to regain access to the elusive legacy wallets as of the present day. While it tried to stave off withdrawals with other funds available, Nevada&#8217;s financial watchdog says that in recent times withdrawals became more frequent and larger.</p>
<p>“As such, at or about the time of the instant petition, it is understood that Prime’s financial status is such that it owes, in fiat currency, $85,670,000 to its clients but has $2,904,000 in fiat currency (equaling an $82,766,000 fiat currency liability),” the court filing discloses. “As to digital currency, Prime owes $69,509,000 to its clients but only has $68,648,000 in digital currency.”</p>

He stressed that it is wrong for the U.S. dollar to be widely used globally given that the U.S. government uses the currency &#8220;for the purposes of national interests&#8221; and &#8220;the economic and financial obligations of one country.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>IMF Director on De-Dollarization Gaining Momentum Worldwide</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Fund&#8217;s (IMF) executive director for Russia, Aleksei Mozhin, shared his thoughts on the global de-dollarization trend in an interview with RIA Novosti Monday.</p>
<p>He explained that Washington’s policies and actions have compelled countries around the world to seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar, noting that more nations are ramping up the use of alternative currencies, particularly the Chinese yuan, in cross-border transactions. The IMF executive director described:</p>
<blockquote><p>We can see that Iranians, Brazilians, and Saudis are already switching to trade in yuan, not only with China but also with third countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mozhin associated the U.S. dollar’s long-standing dominance in the global economy with a lack of competition since most international settlements and deposits worldwide are in dollars. He pointed out that some U.S. officials have sounded the alarm on the risk of the USD losing its world’s reserve currency status.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-acknowledges-sanctions-weaponization-could-hurt-dollar-hegemony/">Janet Yellen</a> recently acknowledged that the use of financial sanctions could erode the dominance of the U.S. dollar. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-rand-paul-warns-of-us-dollar-losing-reserve-currency-status-says-its-not-an-unfounded-prediction/">U.S. Senator Rand Paul</a> similarly warned that the USD is losing its hegemony. “I think our foreign policy has something to do with that … We’ve pushed all of our adversaries farther and farther away from us and closer and closer together,” said the lawmaker.</p>
<p>Mozhin anticipates a gradual decline in the dominance of the USD, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s clear that it will not happen at once, but the process has begun.</p></blockquote>
<p>Russia has been replacing the U.S. dollar and euro with alternative currencies in foreign settlements, significantly reducing bank accounts and transactions involving Western currencies. The share of the dollar and euro in Russia&#8217;s international settlements dropped from 90% in early 2022 to below 50% by the end of last year, Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Vladimir Ilyichev recently revealed, emphasizing that this trend is likely to continue.</p>
<p>Noting that the U.S. government uses the dollar “for the purposes of national interests&#8221; and &#8220;the economic and financial obligations of one country,” the IMF director concluded that it is “wrong” for the USD to be widely used globally.</p>

The report alleges that they spent $243 million on luxury residential real estate for senior staff and family members, as well as on commercial properties. </strong></p>
<h2>FTX Execs Accused of $243 Million Real Estate Spending Spree, Retaliation, and Fraud</h2>
<p>A second investigative report by FTX debtors alleges that “commingling and misuse of FTX.com customer deposits occurred for several years.” The report criticizes this fraudulent practice for making it “extraordinarily challenging” to trace the origins of specific transactions or distinguish between operating funds and customer assets.</p>
<p>As part of the report, it states that FTX.com owed customers $8.7 billion as of the date of the bankruptcy petition. “The image that the FTX Group sought to portray as the customer-focused leader of the digital age was a mirage,” the current FTX CEO and chief restructuring officer, John J. Ray III <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-release-second-investigative-report-301863419.html">stated</a>. Ray added:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the inception of the FTX.com exchange, the FTX Group commingled customer deposits and corporate funds, and misused them with abandon at the direction and by the design of previous senior executives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The court filing alleges that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>, senior executives, multiple FTX-controlled entities, and Alameda Research utilized numerous bank accounts and concealed intricate transactions through an undisclosed entity. Additionally, an unidentified lawyer referred to as &#8220;Attorney-1&#8221; is implicated and accused of assisting and facilitating SBF&#8217;s alleged fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>The attorney purportedly instructed senior FTX officials to establish a “false and misleading corporate register of members and managers” to be submitted to an unnamed bank. According to the report, Attorney-1 purportedly assisted senior executives and SBF in devising a &#8220;sham payment agent agreement.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">so SBF and an attorney:<br />• falsified a &quot;payment agreement&quot; between FTX &amp; Alameda<br />• backdated it by ~2y<br />• wet signed it to avoid DocuSign timestamp<br />• submitted it to an external auditor<br />• used it to obtain a $400M funding round <a href="https://t.co/x1qODBrKbU">pic.twitter.com/x1qODBrKbU</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Molly White (@molly0xFFF) <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1673493302933430272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The report asserts that, in collaboration with SBF, Attorney-1 conceived and coordinated the creation of counterfeit agreements. These agreements were designed to lend an air of credibility to unlawful transfers and arrangements within the FTX Group.</p>
<p>As a result, investigators claim that they enabled the mingling and wrongful appropriation of customer assets, along with various other forms of misconduct by the FTX Group. FTX debtors also contend there was retaliation against an FTX employee who raised concerns about commingling.</p>
<p>The highlighted misconduct encompasses the acquisition of approximately $243 million worth of residential and commercial properties, predominantly situated in the Bahamas. A significant portion of these funds was allocated towards the purchase of units within the Albany Charles development, a highly prestigious resort community located on New Providence Island in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Albany enjoys popularity among the world&#8217;s wealthiest individuals due to its exclusivity and luxurious amenities. Allegedly, an 11,500 square-foot penthouse within the &#8216;Orchid Building&#8217; was shared by SBF, Nishad Singh, Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, and other implicated individuals.</p>
<p>Attorneys contend that the majority of the real estate acquisitions were conducted by the FTX Group via a subsidiary called FTX Property Holdings Ltd., which they say was registered in the Bahamas in July 2021 under the direction of Attorney-1.</p>
<p>The report makes an allegation that a &#8220;former Bahamian official&#8221; facilitated the process to expedite FTX Digital Markets&#8217; licensing within a mere six weeks, with substantial funds being channeled through the Bahamian entity.</p>
<p>According to the document, &#8220;The FTX Group appears to have utilized the FTX DM accounts in part as an intermediary mechanism, directing at least $5.4 billion in customer deposits to FTX Trading Ltd.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chiba Finance Becomes 12th Defi Platform on Arbitrum to Exit Scam, Says Smart Contract Auditor Certik</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On June 27, 2023, the blockchain analysis and intelligence firm Peckshield&#x2019;s Twitter alert system notified the community about funds being drained from the DeFi application Chiba Finance. &#x201C;Seems like Chiba Finance rugged,&#x201D; Peckshield&#x2019;s alert <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1673615238758006786?s=20">disclosed</a> on Tuesday. &#x201C;$1M worth of cryptocurrencies were drained. The stolen funds, which have been swapped for 555 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, were bridged from Arbitrum to Ethereum. They have already been transferred into Tornado Cash,&#x201D; the notice added.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
All traces of Chiba Finance, including the website, Twitter account, Discord server, Telegram channel, and Medium account, have been completely removed and eradicated from the internet. Chiba Finance promoted a &#x201C;yield farming optimizer&#x201D; on Arbitrum, offering users the opportunity to earn &#x201C;auto-compounded yields at optimal intervals&#x201D; by consolidating gas costs through their smart contracts. Users essentially entrusted their assets to Chiba&#x2019;s vaults to accrue the project&#x2019;s native token, <a href="https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb3180df05e46f9fcdd589a2023470a9007df01ca">CHIBI</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On Monday, before the entire team vanished without a trace, CHIBI was trading at $1.35 per unit. Today, the coin has plummeted to 0.0095, which is slightly less than one U.S. cent. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230526081353/https://chibi.finance/">archived version</a> of the project&#x2019;s website reveals that it is relatively new, and its smart contract <a href="https://github.com/solidproof/projects/blob/main/2023/ChibiFinance/SmartContract_Audit_Solidproof_ChibiFinance.pdf">underwent an audit</a> by the blockchain auditor Solid Proof in <a href="https://twitter.com/SolidProof_io/status/1654506534263455744?s=20">May 2023</a>. On Tuesday, the smart contract auditing firm Certik disclosed that Chiba Finance marked the 12th exit scam recorded on Arbitrum this year.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The scammer funded EOA 0x80c via a 10 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> [Tornado Cash] withdrawal on Ethereum and created a malicious contract (0xB61),&#x201D; Certik <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1673639936631734272?s=20">said</a>. &#x201C;The deployer of Chibi Finance called `setGov` which assigned the malicious contract to the `_gov` role. This allowed contract 0xB61 to call `panic` which permitted them to withdraw funds from the Chibi Finance contracts. Funds were then transferred to EOA 0x80c, swapped for WETH and bridged to the Ethereum network.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

The ruble-denominated trading volume of the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin spiked during the short-lived rebellion, market data revealed.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Russians Traded Millions of Dollars&#x2019; Worth of Tether in a Day of Unrest Triggered by Wagner</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Many Russians have apparently tried to find safe haven in crypto when their nation was at the brink of a civil war a few days ago. On Saturday, as a revolt by the Wagner private army unfolded, trades between the Russian fiat and tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) surged to almost $15 million in value, or close to 1.3 billion rubles, according to blockchain data firm Ccdata.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The volume was up from $4 million on Friday, the Wall Street Journal noted in a report. On the same day, Wagner&#x2019;s boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, posted a series of video and audio messages announcing his mercenaries will lead a &#x201C;march for justice&#x201D; against Russia&#x2019;s military leadership, the culmination of a long-time feud with generals in Moscow over the war in Ukraine.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The market data for June 24 is based on trading on crypto exchanges that still support pairs with the Russian currency despite Western sanctions imposed after Russia&#x2019;s invasion. The largest such platforms include , Hitbtc, Cryptonex, and Coinsbit, Ccdata said, quoted by Bloomberg.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
An increase in the trading volume does not directly indicate that ruble users were buying tether, clarified Jamie Sly, who heads communications at Ccdata. However, the spike could be attributed to &#x201C;market participants looking toward a less volatile asset like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> versus rubles, as similar trends were not observed for Bitcoin volumes,&#x201D; Sly elaborated.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Ccdata&#x2019;s findings were confirmed by a representative of the blockchain data firm Kaiko. The company&#x2019;s Director of Research, Clara Medalie, highlighted that the ruble-denominated tether trading volume is at its highest since December, 2022.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Citizens of countries experiencing political and economic troubles have often sought refuge in cryptocurrencies during crises. Demand for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turks-turn-to-tether-amid-record-inflation-limited-access-to-dollar-report-reveals/">tether in Turkey</a>, for example, has been high since May amid record inflation of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turkish-lira-plunges-to-record-low-a-day-after-central-banks-interest-rate-policy-u-turn/">Turkish lira</a>, a report revealed earlier in June.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Right after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February, last year, major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), alongside <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-tether-ethereum-trade-for-premiums-in-ukraine-hryvnia-btc-price-3k-higher-than-global-average/">traded at premiums</a> against the Ukrainian hryvnia following the decision of the country&#x2019;s central bank to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ukraine-central-bank-limits-cash-withdrawals-amid-russian-assault/">impose restrictions</a> on cash withdrawals.&#13;<br />

<h2>Crypto Banter Host Ran Neuner Bullish About Blackrock Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Many members of the crypto community have been engaged in discussions regarding institutional interest in the crypto economy, which has increased following Blackrock&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filing</a> for a spot bitcoin ETF. While the filing has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-funds-joins-race-for-sec-approval-as-it-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">sparked</a> institutional interest and led to a rise in crypto prices, there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Culture/status/1673378619245338624?s=20">speculations</a> suggesting that the firm&#x2019;s move might be a &#x201C;coordinated attack.&#x201D; Some individuals have presumed that the filing strangely occurred shortly after the initial wave of enforcement actions known as &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/operation-chokepoint-bitcoin-advocates-discuss-us-governments-alleged-mission-to-eliminate-crypto-access/">Chokepoint 2.0</a>&#x201D; targeting influential entities within the crypto industry.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
During a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/AL7Wp7oJ4Lk">interview</a> with Michelle Makori, lead anchor and editor-in-chief for Kitco News, <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptomanran">Ran Neuner</a>, the host of Crypto Banter, expressed his belief that Blackrock&#x2019;s intentions are not malicious, despite the rumors and <a href="https://twitter.com/solminingpunk/status/1670589469907361794?s=20">criticism</a> circulating on social media. Some crypto enthusiasts have scrutinized the details of Blackrock&#x2019;s ETF filing, noting a mention of a hard fork, leading to <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Culture/status/1673378643840729093?s=20">speculation</a> that Blackrock could take control of development and split the network. &#x201C;That is not a theory I&#x2019;m concerned about, to be honest,&#x201D; Neuner emphasized to Makori.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Whether or not one party owns all the bitcoin won&#x2019;t make bitcoin centralized,&#x201D; Neuner insisted to the show host. &#x201C;The only way that that can change is if the majority of the miners, over 50 percent of the miners around the world, agree that the rules need to change &#x2026; Regardless of who owns the bitcoin, the mining still remains decentralized.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Neuner expressed his viewpoint that Blackrock&#x2019;s spot bitcoin ETF, combined with the upcoming halving scheduled for April 20, 2024, will drive the price upwards. Neuner stated his belief that the price could potentially reach &#x201C;much higher&#x201D; levels, doubling its current value. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just being conservative,&#x201D; he told the Kitco News show host. &#x201C;I think [the Blackrock ETF] could be a game changer,&#x201D; Neuner stated. &#x201C;If you get a bitcoin spot ETF, you now really open all of this money coming into crypto with an easy way to access this asset.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

Although Neuner&#x2019;s theory is plausible, there were complaints following the approval of a spot gold ETF by the U.S. in 2004, as it faced <a href="https://www.usfunds.com/resource/yes-gold-is-being-manipulated-but-to-what-extent/">accusations</a> of price <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2010/07/23/gold-etfs-and-the-manipulation-game/?sh=44beb3556a84">manipulation</a> and <a href="https://www.usglobaletfs.com/insights/heres-why-gold-could-be-due-for-reversal/">suppression</a>. In the interview, Neuner also discussed U.S. presidential candidates who have expressed support for Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pro-bitcoin-miami-mayor-francis-suarez-joins-race-for-2024-us-presidential-election/">Francis Suarez</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-joins-us-presidential-race-promises-to-protect-bitcoin/">Ron DeSantis</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-advocates-for-bitcoin-and-opposes-cbdcs-in-candid-interview/">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/clash-of-presidential-contenders-bitcoin-gains-prominence-as-2024-us-election-approaches/">Vivek Ramaswamy</a>. Neuner views the increasing number of candidates endorsing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> as a positive development that brings the topic into the spotlight.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Most of the candidates that have put their hats in the ring &#x2026; have taken a favorable position on bitcoin and crypto,&#x201D; Neuner explained. &#x201C;The market is telling you, and the politicians are telling you, that bitcoin is an election issue.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

The <a href="https://ax1.vc/">AX1</a> syndicate has conducted an in-depth <a href="https://ax1.vc/legal/">review</a> of the latest legal developments in the cryptocurrency space, with particular attention to the regulations, exchanges, and tax implications for both the European Union and the United States. This review aims to illuminate the evolving regulatory landscape and highlight key areas of concern and significance.</p>
<p>The study begins by examining the risks associated with using Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) for long-term storage of funds, particularly in light of recent CEX troubles. The review advises against using CEXs for long-term storage, even for the largest Tier 1 CEXs, due to potential risks such as regulatory enforcement, fraud, and liquidity issues​​.</p>
<p>The review also delves into the different crypto fiat on-ramp and off-ramp options available in the EU and US, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The options include bank transfers, credit card transactions, PayPal, Crypto ATMs, and Over-The-Counter (OTC) transactions. The legal status of crypto in the EU and US is also discussed, with the report noting that regulations, including the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) in the EU, are still evolving​​.</p>
<p>The overarching legal landscape for cryptocurrencies is also addressed. The report points out that as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, there will likely be more regulation in the years to come. Regulatory actions by entities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the US, and the proposed MiCA regulation in the EU are highlighted​.</p>
<p>A substantial part of the review focuses on the proposed McHenry-Thompson Digital Asset Market Structure Bill in the US, which seeks to provide clarity, fill regulatory gaps, and foster innovation while providing consumer protections. The Bill’s provisions include defining digital assets, distinguishing between securities and commodities, creating a new self-regulatory organization for the digital asset industry, and providing new investor protections such as disclosure requirements and customer protection​​.</p>
<p>In sum, the research conducted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ax1vc">AX1</a> team provides valuable insights into the evolving legal landscape of cryptocurrencies in the EU and US. While there are significant regulatory advancements, there are also potential areas of concern that warrant further examination.</p>
