The token rose to $2.19 the following week and has been moving sideways since amid a surge in controversy from different angles. Worldcoin (WLD) Leads Crypto Tendencies In addition to WLD, Coingecko shows that Bitcoin (BTC), Unibot (UNIBOT), Chainlink (LINK), HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have been trending along with other tokens. Bitcoin remains the leader on this chart despite the crash in the BTC.D chart. This metric gauges the percentage of the crypto total market cap comprised solely of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Often, when the chart trends to the upside, altcoins, such as Worldcoin (WLD) and PEPE, experience a drop in their prices and vice versa. In that sense, WLD’s launch came at a favorable time for small tokens.

					<description><![CDATA[Evernode, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) Layer 2 platform, has shared a series of updates on its journey toward launch, offering insights into its progress and the challenges it has faced. XRP Ledger Layer 2 Platform Audit Scheduled For Mid-August Evernode is a Layer 2 platform that seeks to bring smart contracts to the XRP Ledger ecosystem via Hooks. The platform is being developed by a team of experienced developers working to enhance the XRP Ledger network with advanced functionalities. Related Reading: Data Shows: Bitcoin Traders Going Long, Blast Above $30,000 Looming? In the first update, Evernode announced that the audit of their three hooks is tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-August. However, the team is still waiting for paperwork and funding from Ripple to confirm the audit, just like other XRPL Grants Grantees. In the second update, the Evernode team shared that the Nomad contract proved more challenging than expected. The contract did not persist on the betanet, which helped the development team identify bugs and areas for improvement. The team has been working hard to resolve these issues and remains optimistic that they will overcome the obstacles soon. Ultimately, Evernode appreciated the approximately 104 betahosts who have provided invaluable feedback in testing and improving the platform in a near-live environment. These updates highlight the complexity of developing a Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger and the importance of thorough testing and auditing. It also emphasizes the dedication and hard work of the Evernode team throughout the development process. However, upon successful launch, Evernode&#8217;s platform will enable developers to build and deploy smart contracts on the XRP Ledger network, opening up new use cases and applications for the ecosystem. This will enable XRP Ledger to compete with other smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, which has gained significant traction in decentralized finance (DeFi). Moreover, Evernode&#8217;s platform will help drive the adoption of XRP Ledger by attracting more developers to the ecosystem. As the number of developers grows, the network&#8217;s capabilities will expand, leading to more use cases and applications, ultimately driving adoption and value. The development of Evernode&#8217;s Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger is a significant milestone for the XRP Ledger community. It showcases the continued innovation and development within the ecosystem, which are critical for its growth and success. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until This Happens Overall, Evernode&#8217;s updates on the progress toward launching a Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger demonstrate the importance of rigorous testing and auditing in developing complex systems.  The successful launch of the platform will open up new opportunities for developers, potentially driving adoption and growth in the XRP Ledger ecosystem.  At the time of writing, XRP has encountered a sideways price movement since Monday. As the fourth largest cryptocurrency in the market regarding trading volume and market capitalization, it is currently trading at $0.7119, representing a decrease of 1.6% over the last 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[A Stanford MBA has explained why the current Bitcoin cycle was different from the others, and why the next one could end up being bigger. This Bitcoin Cycle Faced Obstacles That May Not Be There Next Time A &#8220;cycle&#8221; for Bitcoin refers to the period between two consecutive halvings. The halvings, events where the rewards miners receive for solving blocks on the network are permanently slashed in half, are chosen as the start and end points for the cycles due to the immense significance they hold for the cryptocurrency. The rewards miners earn are essentially the only way new supply can be introduced into circulation, so since halvings cut these in half, the production rate of the asset itself gets tightened. Because of basic supply-demand dynamics, Bitcoin&#8217;s post-halving scarcity increases the asset&#8217;s valuation. It&#8217;s not a coincidence that the bull markets have always followed these special events. The halvings occur roughly every four years, with the next one being scheduled for next year. As BTC transitions towards a new cycle, Jesse Myers, a Stanford MBA, has released a new post that looks back at this cycle so far and compares it with the previous cycles. At first sight, one difference becomes immediately clear: the structure of the top during this past bull market wasn&#8217;t anything like what the previous cycles displayed. How the previous halving cycles looked like at the current stage &#124; Source: Once-In-A-Species &#8220;Instead of a parabolic advance culminating in a blow-off top, we got a bi-modal rounded top spread out over six months,&#8221; notes Myers. So, why did the BTC price behave differently during this bull market? Well, there are mainly four factors at play here. The first and undoubtedly the biggest one would be COVID-19 and the US government&#8217;s response to it. The onset of the virus and the black swan crash that came with it just preceded the cycle, meaning that the cycle kicked off in anomalous conditions. During the cycle itself, the Fed was giving out stimulus checks as a way to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID. &#8220;That Quantitative Easing (QE) undoubtedly helped fuel the 2021 Bitcoin bull market,&#8221; explains the Stanford MBA. The problem came, however, when the Fed changed its policy and switched to Quantitative Tightening (QT). Interestingly, this switch appears to be what marked the Bitcoin top in November 2021. In the middle of all this, another factor was also at play: the May 2021 China ban on Bitcoin mining. Back then, China was the biggest hub of cryptocurrency mining, so the ban naturally delivered a significant shock to the sector. The resulting selling pressure crashed the market, leading to the bull rally prematurely halting. It wasn&#8217;t until three months later that bullish winds once again returned for the asset. While these factors have been quite influential for BTC, it&#8217;s apparent that they are unlikely to repeat, meaning they shouldn&#8217;t have any presence in the next cycle. On the contrary, the other two factors that made this cycle different are likely to appear in the next cycle as well. This previous bull market was the first one where investors widely used leveraged futures trading. Probably, leverage would again come into play in the next bull market.

While there had been some developments in this cycle that ultimately shortened the bull market, some changes can be favorable for the next cycle. The Bitcoin supply is quickly moving off exchanges, and the HODLers getting hold of the majority of the supply has often been making the news recently. Still, there is another super exciting factor. Accumulation from the small investors &#124; Source: Once-In-A-Species According to this chart from Glassnode, the relatively small entities on the network (holding less than 100 BTC) have been accumulating 275% of all Bitcoin being mined. The fact that this rate is more than 100% suggests that the smaller investors are taking coins off the likes of whales. &#8220;This has never happened before. We have reached some kind of inflection point,&#8221; says Mjers. Soon the halving will occur, and this supply shock brewing in the market will only get tighter. Perhaps the smaller investors are looking to get in before this happens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until This Happens Mjers mentions, however, that these individuals aren&#8217;t the only ones catching on; asset managers like Blackrock are also coming around and pushing to get themselves into the industry. As mentioned before, the QT policy proved disastrous for BTC in this cycle, but a shift back towards QE may be imminent, which would naturally boost the market instead. The analyst thinks this event might coincide with the upcoming halving of the cryptocurrency. Now, based on all these factors, these are probabilities that Mjers has assigned to the different price range predictions for the next cycle: The likeliness of each price range &#124; Source: Once-In-A-Species The Stanford MBA believes that a growth of more than 8x, a multiplier higher than what the current cycle saw, is the second most probable scenario, given all the potentially positive developments. A cycle outperforming the previous has never happened in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s history, so if this scenario happens, it would be a first. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,300, down 2% in the last week.

<p>The Stanford MBA believes that a growth of more than 8x, a multiplier higher than what the current cycle saw, is the second most probable scenario, given all the potentially positive developments.</p>
<p>A cycle outperforming the previous has never happened in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s history, so if this scenario happens, it would be a first.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,300, down 2% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It would appear that Bitcoin whales are shifting their BTC into exchanges at an alarming rate, which is a warning that they may be getting ready to liquidate their holdings. Recent on-chain data shows that Bitcoin whale exchange deposits reached $275 million in a single day as the cryptocurrency continues to struggle to cross over $30,000. Bitcoin Whales Moving Funds to Exchanges Tweets from the whale transaction tracker @whale_alert indicate that a total of 9,406 Bitcoins, with an approximate worth of $275 million, have been moved into exchanges through separate transactions.  Related Reading: Ripple Attorney Withdraws From SEC Lawsuit, Will It Affect XRP? The vast majority of these trades entered Binance twice, with the largest single deposit being the entry of 2,459 BTC with a total value of $72.6 million. Another significant transaction included the deposit of 1,499 BTC with a total value of $44.3 million into the Binance exchange.  The actions of these Bitcoin whales, or large holders, often significantly impact the overall market. There are a few possible for big money transfers, but when whales make large deposits to exchanges, it usually signals they are preparing to sell in large volumes, which can crash the market, at least temporarily. Many traders consider this a bearish signal and can spark worry that prices may soon drop. For smaller investors, this can mean opportunity or risk ahead. The price of Bitcoin crossed over $30,000 last month, showing promising signs of an upward trend for investors. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a slight decline in the last seven days, dropping by around 1.57%. Further massive selloffs by whales can have a counter effect on this bullish sentiment.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin continues to trade sideways during today’s trading session, holding the line draw for the past few weeks. Recent data shows that the cryptocurrency has been recording “crab-like” price action in the short term, but operators favor the long side of their trades. Related Reading: Why This Billionaire Continues To Advocate For Bitcoin Amid Surging US Debt? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,700 with a 0.7% loss in the last 24 hours and a 2% loss in the previous week. The cryptocurrency’s implied volatility has been trending to the downside while BTC’s price holds still at its current levels. Low Volatility Set The Stage For A Bitcoin Price Explosion? Data from a report posted by crypto analytics firm Block Scholes via Deribit indicates that Bitcoin and Ethereum traders have been seeking long exposure to these cryptocurrencies. As mentioned above, this behavior coincides with a decline in delivered volatility. As a result, the BTC and ETH perpetual swap markets are experiencing a shift in funding rates. This measure determines the percentage paid by long to short positions at a given time. The chart below shows that funding rates have been trending to the upside since last September 2022. At that time, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hit a multi-year low. Now, the BTC price experienced a 100% recovery from those levels leading to a change in the derivatives sector. The chart shows that funding rates across the BTC, ETH, and USDC trading pairs have been positive for the past three months. This data shows that traders are going long and willing to pay short positions for their exposure. A positive funding rate is often linked to the sentiment among operators and could hint at an upcoming bullish run when found on platforms like Deribit, where “smart money” trades. Why Are BTC Traders Going Long? Conversely, Block Scholes wonders: why are traders going long when implied volatility fell to new all-time lows? What’s driving operators for long exposure while the price trades sideways so much that they are willing to pay a premium? The report stated: We find it somewhat odd that traders are willing to pay such a consistently high rate for long exposure despite such low expectations of volatility.

					<description><![CDATA[A recent development in the ongoing showdown between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has seen the withdrawal of another Ripple attorney from the lawsuit, recent court filings reveal. This comes after a motion was filed earlier in the month for Anna R. Gressel to withdraw as attorney of defendant Ripple Labs. This recent withdrawal has cast a shadow of uncertainty as holders of XRP ponder on the likely impact of this development. Ripple Remains Upbeat Despite Attorney’s Withdrawal According to details in the filing made at the District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 27, Ripple is asking for the leave of the court to withdraw Lisa R. Zornberg as an attorney to the defendants in the ongoing XRP vs. SEC lawsuit.  Related Reading: VC Firm Sequoia Capital Slashes Crypto Fund By 65% Amid Bear Market Ripple is appealing to the court to grant Lisa R. Zornberg of the popular Debevoise &#38; Plimpton LLP permission to withdraw as an attorney in the lawsuit. This is in light of the fact that Lisa R. Zornberg will no longer be working with the law firm from July 31.  The foremost federal prosecutor was appointed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams as City Hall&#8217;s Chief Counsel earlier this week. However, this move does not in any way affect Ripple’s relationship with Debevoise &#38; Plimpton LLP as other attorneys of the firm will continue representing Ripple Labs in the case.  Ripple has also reiterated that the withdrawal of Lisa R. Zornberg does not in any way affect its interests, including those of CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen. It’s also important to note that the court had previously approved withdrawal motions for three attorneys Kylie Chiseul Kim, Clayton J. Masterman, and Anna R. Gressel to exit the lawsuit.   Attorney Withdraws As Case Grinds to a Close The withdrawal of Lisa R. Zornbergs comes in the wake of Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; referral of the lawsuit to Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn. Magistrate Judge Netburn instructed the SEC and Ripple to reach an agreement on three mutually suitable dates to hold a settlement conference on issues like institutional sales of XRP.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has continued to stagnate recently as another recovery move has failed to prosper. So here&#8217;s an indicator that may hint when a break could happen. Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until The Stablecoin Market Cap Goes Up Around the start of this week, Bitcoin observed a sharp plunge that had taken the asset&#8217;s price from the $30,000 level down to the $29,000 mark. A couple of days back, however, the coin had started surging again and had reclaimed the $26,600 level. This uplift in the price had come as the US Fed had announced a 25 bps interest rate hike, but before long, the recovery efforts had run out of steam, and now, the cryptocurrency has already retraced its gains from the rally. BTC has gone back towards the $29,000 level recently &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Earlier, Bitcoin had been stuck in a phase of stagnation above the $30,000 level for more than a month, but with the plunge in the price, this streak had been broken. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Load Up Their Bags As Memecoin Jumps 13% The asset now sticking near the $29,000 level may mean, however, that volatility hasn&#8217;t truly returned for the asset yet, as it still continues to consolidate, just around a different level. When a true break away from this stagnation may happen and the rally would return could possibly depend on the total supply of all the stablecoins. As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, range-breaking price rises in Bitcoin this year have generally only come whenever the stablecoin supply has registered an increase. The value of the metric seems to have been heading down in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As the quant has marked in the chart, the major price increases in the past few months have generally preceded a sharp local increase in the supply of the stablecoins. Usually, an increase in the stablecoin supply can suggest two things. First, there may be a fresh injection of capital happening into the market, as investors ask for more of these fiat-tied tokens to be minted. And second, some holders of other coins like Bitcoin may be selling their coins to seek the relative safety that the stablecoins offer.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has continued to stagnate recently as another recovery move has failed to prosper. So here&#8217;s an indicator that may hint when a break could happen.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until The Stablecoin Market Cap Goes Up</h2>
<p>Around the start of this week, Bitcoin observed a sharp plunge that had taken the asset&#8217;s price from the $30,000 level down to the $29,000 mark. A couple of days back, however, the coin had started surging again and had reclaimed the $26,600 level.</p>
<p>This uplift in the price had come as the US Fed had announced a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/european-central-bank-25-bps-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">25 bps interest rate hike</a>, but before long, the recovery efforts had run out of steam, and now, the cryptocurrency has already retraced its gains from the rally.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium aligncenter" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/NbFxGJoR/" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart" width="1534" height="877"/></p>

<p>Earlier, Bitcoin had been stuck in a phase of stagnation above the $30,000 level for more than a month, but with the plunge in the price, this streak had been broken.</p>

<p>The asset now sticking near the $29,000 level may mean, however, that volatility hasn&#8217;t truly returned for the asset yet, as it still continues to consolidate, just around a different level. When a true break away from this stagnation may happen and the rally would return could possibly depend on the total supply of all the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/stablecoin/stablecoin-exchange-deposits-remain-low-mean-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">stablecoins</a>.</p>
<p>As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/64c2ff380c84a11369407f96-No-change-in-All-Stablecoins-Supply" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, range-breaking price rises in Bitcoin this year have generally only come whenever the stablecoin supply has registered an increase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/226984/quicktake/019f8_00beb5837aafb098964d28edb7db5c6a5b75a02de8f6990e4df62baef497f1a4.png" alt="Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply" width="1280" height="713"/></p>

<p>As the quant has marked in the chart, the major price increases in the past few months have generally preceded a sharp local increase in the supply of the stablecoins.</p>
<p>Usually, an increase in the stablecoin supply can suggest two things. First, there may be a fresh injection of capital happening into the market, as investors ask for more of these fiat-tied tokens to be minted.</p>
<p>And second, some holders of other coins like Bitcoin may be selling their coins to seek the relative safety that the stablecoins offer. Either way, such investors who hold their capital in the form of stables do so because they eventually plan to dip (back) into the volatile side of the market.</p>
<p>Due to this reason, the total stablecoin supply may be looked at as a store of buying pressure that can be deployed into assets like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that it hasn&#8217;t exactly been the increase in the stablecoin supply that has fueled the price surges this year, but rather the decline in the metric that followed shortly after.</p>

<p>These decreases in the supply suggested a transfer of capital into Bitcoin and others, which is why their prices observed a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/stablecoin-cap-early-signs-of-reversal-why-goodr-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">bullish boost</a>. It&#8217;s also visible in the graph, however, that the stablecoin supply has been on a net decline in this period, meaning that the dry powder tied up in these tokens has been constantly running out.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Just over a year after launching its crypto fund, venture capital firm Sequoia is now rolling back its investments and taking more of a more careful approach. The firm was making some serious waves when it launched its crypto fund last year in February, signaling that crypto was ready for mainstream VC backing. But now the company has reportedly downsized its cryptocurrency fund by 65% as the crypto winter rages on.  Sequoia Pulls Back On Its Crypto Funding Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most prestigious VC firms, is scaling back its ambitions in the crypto space. After launching a dedicated $585 million crypto fund last year, Sequoia recently announced they’re slashing it by 65% to $200 million.  Related Reading: European Central Bank Follows US Fed’s Footsteps With 25 BPS Hike The firm has also reduced its ecosystem fund by 50%. The fund, which invests in other smaller venture funds and solo investors, is now at $450 million, down from $900 million. Insiders close to the situation said this is a result of the bear market, which has affected projects across the industry and pulled down prices significantly over the last year. Why Is Sequoia Taking This Step Now? Sequoia is known for making investments in crypto companies and had initially announced its funds as part of a larger restructuring effort to increase its investments in the crypto space. The crypto market, however, has seen most projects take a big hit over the last few months and Sequoia wasn&#8217;t left out, as it has seen a major part of its investment take drastic losses.  The company was particularly affected by the crash of FTX, as it had a $214 million investment in the failed crypto exchange. Rather than spray and pray with a large fund, Sequoia is now tightening its focus.  Total market cap at $1.14 trillion as VC investments slow down &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com According to the report, the company&#8217;s new investment plan is to pivot toward smaller crypto players. The smaller cryptocurrency fund will now focus more on a select group of startup companies.  With the crypto market taking a major downturn since the announcement of its funds, it&#8217;s no surprise that Sequoia has decided to scale back. Crypto projects, in particular, haven&#8217;t done well in recent times.

While it shows a lack of faith and reflects the growing trend among venture capital firms, the pullback doesn&#8217;t mean Sequoia is abandoning the space altogether. The venture capital firm began its crypto journey in 2014 and has a history of backing innovative technologies early on. Featured image from CryptoPotato, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to occupy center stage, drawing varied reactions from different financial pundits. One of these voices is billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who has yet again reiterated his support for the top cryptocurrency despite the unsettling dynamics in the United States economy. The Growing Concern: Skyrocketing Interest Payments The US is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in debts as its interest payments reach $970 billion. This figure represents a leap of $41 billion in the second quarter alone. Observers anticipate that the rising trajectory could soon see the country&#8217;s debts surge resulting in the interest payments hitting the $1 trillion milestone, which has set off alarm bells in financial circles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retreat Below $30,000: A Threat To Crypto’s 2023 Dominance Over Stocks? To clarify, interest payments are the actual payments that the borrower makes to the lender, typically on a regular schedule, to repay the interest on a loan or debt. The amount of each payment is determined by the interest rate and the terms of the loan. As such, the sustained upsurge of interest payments in the US economy has triggered growing unease among financial experts. Tax receipts are currently failing to keep pace with the ballooning sovereign debt. Consequently, the issuance of more debt to fund interest payments is becoming an increasingly common occurrence. This scenario has created a vicious cycle, causing concern about the potential repercussions on the nation&#8217;s fiscal health. In light of this, Mike Novogratz has once again expressed his firm support for Bitcoin. His latest advocacy came to the forefront recently when he urged investors to buy Bitcoin as the US national debt spiked by $1 trillion between June and July. Buy $BTC!!! https://t.co/UyGNaGXzyI — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) July 27, 2023 Novogratz&#8217;s Stance: Bitcoin As A Safe Haven Despite expressing caution regarding the broader economy, Novogratz holds a sanguine view of Bitcoin&#8217;s prospects. He envisions that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of another growth cycle, following a consolidation phase oscillating between the $28,000 to $32,000 range. However, Novogratz maintains that a significant shift in policy by the Federal Reserve, specifically a reduction in interest rates, is key for this expected surge to come to fruition. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Founder Anticipates BTC Price Surge Due To This Reason Meanwhile, recent indicators suggest that the central bank may have different intentions. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s current stance seems to diverge from the conditions that Novogratz believes are necessary for a Bitcoin rally. Despite this, the experienced investor continues to champion Bitcoin, viewing it as a potential safe haven amid economic uncertainties. In the meantime, Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation is still persistently working to rise above the recent downward trend. The digital asset experienced a slight dip of 1% in the last day and now has a market cap of $567.5 billion. BTC&#8217;s market price currently stands at $29,309, at the time of writing. This price action follows the asset&#8217;s unsuccessful endeavor to reclaim the $30,000 mark earlier this week.  Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ARK Invest CEO and crypto proponent Cathie Wood says that Bitcoin is set to grow massively as a store of value following the recent bank collapses. She believes that Bitcoin’s stability and a huge rally in the wake of US regional banks collapsing is a major testament to the fact that Bitcoin is the future of money. Cathie Wood Remains Bullish On Bitcoin In a recent interview with Barron&#8217;s, Wood maintained that she remains bullish on digital assets and highlighted three reasons she won’t be backing down on her investments. According to her, Bitcoin stood tall and rose by 60%, from $19,000 to $30,000, when regional banks like First Republic, SVB, and Signature Bank collapsed. She attributed this run to investors seeing the asset as a safe alternative for storing their wealth.  Related Reading: European Central Bank Follows US Fed’s Footsteps With 25 BPS Hike Wood explained: We see three revolutions taking place because of crypto. Bitcoin will dominate the first one, the money revolution. The biggest proof is that when regional-bank stocks were falling apart earlier this year, Bitcoin went from $19,000 to $30,000. That was a flight to safety, and we expect it to accelerate. The centralized monetary system we have today is an aberration. We could be going back to the future – before the Federal Reserve existed – under a digital, rules-based monetary system with no government oversight. The other reasons for her bullishness on digital assets relate to decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital property rights involving tokenizing several physical assets in real estate and other relevant industries.  “The second revolution is in financial services, or the so-called DeFi, which will be Ethereum-based. There are a number of infrastructure providers out there. It’s the survival of the fittest, and I’m excited to see who wins,” the CEO said. Last but not least, according to Woord, “is digital property rights, or what many call NFT or the metaverse. People are already buying real estate in virtual worlds. Our young research associates come into the office wearing jeans and T-shirts with no logos, but they are getting their status in the virtual world.” BTC bulls struggle to keep bears at bay &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Weighing In On Coinbase’s Battle With SEC During the interview, Cathie Wood also discussed Coinbase’s ongoing battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wood’s ARK holdings are one of the largest holders of Coinbase’s stock. She believes that the crypto exchange will ultimately get victory in the SEC’s lawsuit against it for the sale of unregistered securities.  According to her, the court will rule that the SEC has gone beyond its regulatory purview, and in the long run, the US Congress will pass crypto-friendly bills.  “Meanwhile, the legislative branch has awakened to the fact that crypto is a new asset class and we might need new legislatures to give the regulators some guidance,” the ARK Invest CEO added.

<p>According to her, the court will rule that the SEC has gone beyond its regulatory purview, and in the long run, the US Congress will pass crypto-friendly bills. </p>
<p>“Meanwhile, the legislative branch has awakened to the fact that crypto is a new asset class and we might need new legislatures to give the regulators some guidance,” the ARK Invest CEO added.</p>

<p>“Those two branches of government have given us great confidence that Coinbase will come out of this as a winner. Many Coinbase competitors either haven’t entered the US or moved out because of our regulatory system. Coinbase has stayed to fight. We think they’ll be rewarded accordingly.”</p>
<p>Cathie Wood’s ARK had <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/coinbase/ark-invest-ceo-still-bullish-on-coinbase/">bought $21.6 million worth of Coinbase’s stock</a> in early June, just immediately after the SEC filed a lawsuit against the crypto exchange.</p>
