The central bank chief added that cryptocurrencies pose &#8220;huge inherent risks&#8221; to India&#8217;s macroeconomic and financial stability.</strong></p>
<h2>Indian Central Bank Warns About Crypto Causing the Next Financial Crisis</h2>
<p>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das warned about the danger of cryptocurrency Wednesday. The central banker cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies have … huge inherent risks for our macroeconomic and financial stability.</p></blockquote>
<p>The RBI is primarily concerned about cryptocurrencies having no underlying value, Das clarified, emphasizing that crypto is &#8220;speculative&#8221; and should be banned.</p>
<p>Indian authorities refer to any non-government-issued cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, as &#8220;private&#8221; cryptocurrencies. Commenting on crypto trading, Das said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a hundred percent speculative activity, and I would still hold the view that it should be prohibited … because, if it is allowed to grow — if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow — please mark my words, the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, India is trying to launch its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). The RBI recently started both <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-central-bank-rbi-begins-first-digital-rupee-pilot-today/">wholesale</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rbi-begins-first-retail-digital-rupee-pilot-in-13-indian-cities-with-8-banks/">retail</a> digital rupee pilots.</p>
<p>Das explained that CBDCs can expedite international money transfers and reduce the need for logistics, including printing notes. Earlier this month, RBI Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar claimed that India&#8217;s central bank digital currency can <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indias-central-bank-digital-currency-should-be-able-to-do-anything-cryptocurrency-can-do-with-no-risk-official-claims/">do anything</a> cryptocurrencies can do.</p>

<p>The Indian government is also working on the country&#8217;s crypto policy. Earlier this week, the government provided Lok Sabha, the lower house of India&#8217;s parliament, with an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-updates-parliament-on-cryptocurrency-bill-and-investigations-of-crypto-exchanges/">update</a> on its cryptocurrency bill that was scheduled to be discussed in the winter session of parliament last year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India&#8217;s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has shared that the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with the G20 countries to establish a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-to-discuss-crypto-during-g20-presidency-to-establish-tech-driven-regulatory-framework-says-finance-minister/">technology-driven framework</a> for crypto assets. Last month, she and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-and-indian-finance-minister-discuss-crypto-regulation/">discussed</a> crypto regulation during the ninth India-U.S. Economic and Financial Partnership meeting.</p>

<h2>Stablecoin TRUST Act of 2022</h2>
<p>U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, introduced the &#8220;Stablecoin Transparency of Reserves and Uniform Safe Transactions Act of 2022&#8221; on Wednesday. The bill is also known as the &#8220;<a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/stablecoin_trust_act.pdf">Stablecoin TRUST Act of 2022</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the lawmaker, the legislation would &#8220;establish the first federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and guide Congress towards a path for sensible regulation of cryptocurrencies.&#8221; Senator Toomey opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope this framework lays the groundwork for my colleagues to pass legislation next year safeguarding customer funds without inhibiting innovation … This bill will also ensure the Federal Reserve, which has displayed significant skepticism about stablecoins, won&#8217;t be in a position to stop this activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Stablecoins are an exciting technological development that could transform money and payments. By digitizing the U.S. dollar and making it available on a global, instant, and nearly cost-free basis, stablecoins could be widely used across the physical economy in a variety of ways,&#8221; Toomey noted. The lawmaker from Pennsylvania will be retiring from the Senate at the end of his term in January next year.</p>
<p>The bill &#8220;encourages competition by authorizing several types of regulated entities to issue payment stablecoins,&#8221; the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs described, adding that it &#8220;enhances financial stability by requiring that all payment stablecoins are fully backed by high-quality liquid assets.&#8221; Furthermore, the bill &#8220;establishes transparency by subjecting all payment stablecoin issuers to standardized disclosure requirements and attestations by registered accounting firms,&#8221; the Senate committee further detailed.</p>

<p>Toomey published a draft of this Stablecoin TRUST Act back in April, calling it &#8220;the first Senate bill to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins.&#8221;</p>
<p>The senator from Pennsylvania is pro-crypto. Last week, he said cryptocurrency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-cryptocurrency-cannot-be-stopped-ftx-collapse-isnt-an-indictment-of-crypto/">cannot be stopped</a> and that the collapse of crypto Exchange FTX is not an indictment against cryptocurrency. In February, the lawmaker said crypto assets are here to stay and a thoroughly diversified portfolio <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-crypto-assets-here-to-say-diversified-portfolios-should-have-crypto-exposure/">should have some</a>.</p>

According to multiple reports, Keene resident and libertarian activist, Ian Freeman, the last member of the Crypto Six case to be tried, was found guilty on all counts which included unlicensed money transmission, money laundering, and tax evasion. Freeman faces eight years in prison but he was not taken into custody on Thursday afternoon (ET). Reports detail that he must appear for sentencing on April 14, 2023, or appeal the verdict.</strong></p>
<h2>Ian Freeman Found Guilty of Unlicensed Money Transmission, Sentencing Hearing Scheduled for April 2023</h2>
<p>During the first week of Dec. 2022, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-crypto-6-case-heads-to-trial-with-only-1-defendant-left-prosecutors-so-called-expert-excluded/">reported</a> on the Crypto Six case and how the co-host of the radio broadcast Free Talk Live, Ian Freeman, was preparing to head to trial. Freeman was the only defendant left that remained in the Crypto Six case, as he decided to take the issue to trial in order to bring his case in front of a jury.</p>
<p>The charges against Freeman originally started on March 16, 2021, when U.S. federal agents <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fbi-arrests-free-keene-members-cryptocurrency-exchange/">raided</a> the Shire Free Church in Keene New Hampshire, the Bitcoin Embassy, and the Free Talk Live studio. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said “the defendants knowingly operated the crypto exchange business in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations.”</p>
<p>After jurors were selected, Freeman’s trial officially started on Dec. 6, 2022. 16 days later, Free Talk Live co-host Mark Edge revealed on Facebook that Freeman was found guilty. “Ian guilty on all counts. unlicensed money transmission, money laundering, and tax evasion,” Edge said. The trial’s verdict was also <a href="https://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/keene-resident-ian-freeman-found-guilty-in-federal-cryptocurrency-trial/article_b50da82f-b4f1-596c-aa21-42d8e6a54fa4.html">revealed</a> by the local news publication The Keen Sentinel.</p>

<p>The Sentinel’s Rick Green wrote that “a federal jury convicted Keene resident Ian Freeman on felony charges Thursday related to his cryptocurrency business.” Green confirmed Edge&#8217;s statements that said Freeman was found guilty of “operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, money laundering, and income-tax evasion.”</p>
<p>The reporter further noted that Freeman was not taken into custody and is remanded to appear in court on April 14, 2023. Green further noted that Freeman’s defense attorney Mark Sisti told the court that the government’s case was based on “speculation, innuendo, and intuition but short on evidence.”</p>
<p>Some of the members of the Crypto Six case pleaded guilty to one charge of wire fraud last April. While Freeman is scheduled to appear in court for sentencing in April, the Free Talk Live co-host can appeal the verdict in the meantime.</p>

The recent charges against Wang and Ellison highlight some key findings and according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), FTX’s exchange token FTT is considered a security. </strong></p>
<h2>SEC Complaint Says SBF &#8216;Directed&#8217; and &#8216;Instructed&#8217; High-up Execs Like Caroline Ellison to Commit Fraud</h2>
<p>U.S. attorney Damian Williams told the public on Wednesday that charges have been filed against Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, and Zixiao (Gary) Wang, the former Chief Technology Officer of FTX Trading Ltd. The Southern District of New York (SDNY) also told the press that Ellison and Wang were cooperating with federal law enforcement, and the recent SEC charges identify key findings that were previously speculated on or were unknown at the time.</p>

<p>The first glaring evidence shows that the FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) said a lot of untruthful things during his recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-the-former-ftx-ceos-media-tour-many-unanswered-questions-remain/">media tour</a>, at least according to the SEC complaint. The SEC charges show that SBF may have lied during those interviews about specifics, and the SEC accuses Bankman-Fried and Wang of “improperly [diverting] customer assets to Alameda Research LLC and its subsidiaries.” Moreover, the speculation and rumors that said SBF and Wang built a backdoor into FTX for Alameda are also reportedly true, according to the SEC’s accusations.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-234.pdf">SEC complaint</a> says SBF, Wang, and Ellison “had provided Alameda with significant special treatment on the FTX platform, including a virtually unlimited ‘line of credit’ funded by the platform’s customers.” The U.S. regulator further says that Ellison, “acting at the direction of Bankman-Fried,” manipulated the FTX exchange token FTT’s price. The move was meant to increase the price of FTT in order to “inflate the value of Alameda’s collateral.”</p>
<p>The SEC also alleges that SBF was the sole decision maker at Alameda Research. “Bankman-Fried remained the ultimate decision-maker at Alameda, even after Ellison and Trabucco became co-CEOs in or around October 2021,” the SEC’s court filing details. The SEC’s accusations further state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most crucially, Bankman-Fried used Alameda to house FTX customer assets and to deploy those assets, under Bankman-Fried’s direction, to help grow his empire.</p></blockquote>
<h2>U.S. Regulator Defines FTT as a Security, SBF&#8217;s $250M Bail Bond Deal in Manhattan’s Federal Court</h2>
<p>One of the most glaring charges, that may produce broad regulatory measures across the entire crypto industry, is how the SEC defines the crypto token FTT. Essentially, in the eyes of the U.S. securities regulator, FTT is a security. “FTT was offered and sold as an investment contract and, therefore, as a security,” the SEC complaint against Wang and Ellison details. “As a result of FTX and its management team’s large holdings of FTT, the interests of the company and its management team were aligned with those of investors in FTT,” the complaint adds.</p>

<p>The charges against Ellison and Wang further said that the FTT white paper “specifically highlighted the profit potential of the token.” On several occasions throughout the SEC filing, it notes that Ellison says SBF “directed” or “instructed” her to execute many of the misdeeds. The claimed direction Ellison describes completely contradicts SBF’s claims when he said he was unaware of Alameda’s dealings, and that he did not operate the firm. The SEC’s allegations note that for quite some time, Ellison was supposedly ordered to do a number of fraudulent acts under SBF’s command.</p>

<p>In 2022, despite being under significant distress, the SEC alleges that “Bankman- Fried and Ellison continued to use FTX customer assets in the summer of 2022.” Funds were leveraged to mislead investors and rescue distressed crypto firms, the SEC’s complaint details. The New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/22/sam-bankman-fried-arrives-in-manahattan-federal-court-to-face-crypto-fraud-charges/">reports</a> that SBF was extradited late Wednesday evening, and he is now in New York’s Manhattan district. SBF’s mother “Barbara Fried, was seen arriving at the Pearl Street courthouse hours before an expected noon arraignment,” The Post said. The report further detailed that SBF faced a judge in Manhattan’s federal court in order to be arraigned.</p>
<p>SBF appeared in front of the Manhattan judge, Gabriel Gorenstein, who approved a $250 million bond deal that will allow the FTX co-founder to be placed under house arrest with his parents Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried. SBF was represented by sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell’s attorney, Mark Cohen, and sources <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/22/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-record-250m-bond/">told</a> the New York Post that the “deal was prearranged.” Under the deal, SBF would be allowed out of his parent’s home in California for exercise, mental health, and substance abuse treatments, according to The Post’s account of the bond deal.</p>
<p>Unsealed court documents indicate that Ellison’s plea agreement, which must be approved by the court, shows the former ex-Alameda CEO agreed to $250,000 bail. Ellison also surrendered her passport, and she will need to pay restitution decided on by the court. If Ellison fully cooperates and the SDNY federal court agrees, she may only face criminal tax violations and there’s a chance she could get off without any jail time. The unsealed plea agreement indicates that Ellison is working with the attorney <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-alamedas-caroline-ellison-retains-secs-former-enforcement-division-chief/">Stephanie Avakian</a>. A plea agreement for Gary Wang’s charges and his specific deal has not yet been revealed to the general public.</p>

This new feature is &#x201C;one of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter,&#x201D; said Elon Musk, owner of the social media platform.</strong></p>
<h2>Twitter Launches Price Chart Feature</h2>
<p>Twitter announced in a series of tweets Wednesday that it is now providing price charts for major stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When you tweet the symbol of a major stock, ETF, or crypto currency with a $ in front of it (like $<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), people on Twitter see a clickable link that takes them to search results,&#x201D; the official Twitter Business account explained, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Starting today, these search results will include the pricing graphs for major symbols.</p></blockquote>
<p>The social media giant added: &#x201C;You can also search for symbols directly, without clicking on a link within a tweet. Most symbols with and without the $ sign will work in search (QQQ or $QQQ).&#x201D; Twitter continued: &#x201C;In the coming weeks, we&#x2019;ll refine the user experience and expand our coverage of symbols.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The price charts on Twitter are provided by Robinhood, a U.S.-based trading platform for traditional investments and cryptocurrencies. All price charts include a link to the trading platform.</p>
<p>Many people on Twitter welcome the new feature. However, some noted that Robinhood is not available in their countries and they would prefer Twitter to use other price data providers.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the only cryptocurrencies that have price charts displayed are <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>. Even dogecoin (DOGE) does not have a price chart added yet despite the meme cryptocurrency being Elon Musk&#x2019;s favorite. The Tesla CEO and Twitter chief, who is also known in the dogecoin community as the Dogefather, has said repeatedly that he will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-confirms-hell-keep-buying-and-supporting-dogecoin/">keep supporting and buying</a> dogecoin.</p>
<p>Musk has been trying to find new revenue streams for his social media company after many advertisers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/25/1139180002/twitter-loses-50-top-advertisers-elon-musk#:~:text=via%20Getty%20Images-,Half%20of%20Twitter's%20top%20100%20advertisers%20appear%20to%20no%20longer,%24750%20million%20just%20in%202022.">pulled out</a>. Commenting on the new price chart feature, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter!</p></blockquote>
<p>The billionaire recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-promises-to-step-down-as-head-of-twitter-edward-snowden-throws-his-name-in-the-hat-for-ceo/">promised to step down</a> as head of the social media platform. &#x201C;I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams,&#x201D; Musk said Tuesday.</p>

After Wang’s and Ellison’s surrender announcement, the public has been wondering where FTX&#8217;s director of engineering, Nishad Singh, is located and whether or not he has come forward yet.</strong></p>
<h2>Following Ellison&#8217;s and Wang&#8217;s Guilty Plea, All Eyes Are Focused on 2 More Top FTX Execs</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-gary-wang-and-alamedas-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-fraud-duo-is-cooperating-with-feds/">Reports</a> stemming from the SDNY federal court, the CFTC, and the SEC indicate that FTX co-founder Zixiao (Gary) Wang and ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison have pleaded guilty to fraud charges. According to the U.S. attorney Damian Williams, Ellison and Wang are cooperating with law enforcement officials in a plea bargain for lighter sentences.</p>
<p>In addition to the announcement on Wednesday, Williams urged others that were involved in FTX’s misconduct to come forward as soon as possible. “[Law enforcement] is moving quickly and our patience is not eternal,” Williams stressed. One person who was not mentioned in the most recent indictments against Ellison and Wang was FTX’s director of engineering Nishad Singh.</p>
<p>According to public documents, in 2017, Singh graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and computer science engineering. He worked for Facebook for a total of five months in 2017, after graduating from college. Prior to his role as FTX’s director of engineering, Singh was the director of engineering at Alameda Research.</p>

<p>It was well known that Singh was a very close member of Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) inner circle and he’s been accused of misconduct in regard to FTX’s collapse. For instance, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sbf-to-remain-in-a-bahamian-jail-for-2-months-report-claims-ftx-execs-had-a-covert-chat-channel-called-wirefraud/">reports</a> have detailed that Singh was allegedly part of SBF’s secret Signal chat channel called “Wirefraud.”</p>
<p>The Australian Financial Review’s United States correspondent Matthew Cranston <a href="https://archive.ph/yypG9#selection-1887.19-1887.61">said</a>: “[AFR] has [learned] that FTX founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Zixiao ‘Gary’ Wang, along with FTX engineer Nishad Singh and former Alameda Research chief executive <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-alamedas-caroline-ellison-retains-secs-former-enforcement-division-chief/">Caroline Ellison</a>, used a chat group on Signal in the hope that the information would remain hidden.”</p>
<p>Records also show that Singh became a significant donor to the U.S. Democratic party and he donated $8 million during the 2022 midterm election cycle. Singh was the 34th largest Democrat donor, while his former boss SBF was the second largest Democrat donor under George Soros. Research also shows that Singh, alongside SBF and Wang, was responsible for FTX’s codebase, wallets, and trading engine.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that Singh <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/ftx-executives-used-korea-account-to-mask-giant-alameda-liabilities?leadSource=uverify%20wall">allegedly</a> “authored code that hid Alameda Research’s ballooning liabilities.” In the same report, the CFTC detailed that a great deal of FTX’s liabilities were hidden in a sub-account called the “Korean account,” which was reportedly used by SBF, Ellison, Wang, and Singh to obscure funds. Singh was also close to another FTX inner circle member named Ramnik Arora, and Singh was one of nine housemates that lived with SBF.</p>
<p>Singh once said that FTX was his “dream job,” and ever since FTX collapsed, no one has heard from the former FTX director of engineering. Singh’s and SBF’s good friend Arora, the head of product and investor relations, was also an important instrument to the FTX machine. Arora is described in reports as SBF’s “key lieutenant” and according to sources, he was the main executive who bolstered FTX’s relationships with Sequoia Capital and other investors.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-man-who-helped-sam-bankman-fried-raise-billions">article</a> published by The Information claims FTX’s Arora was “integral to FTX’s expansion,” and if it wasn&#8217;t for Arora&#8217;s efforts, FTX may not have raised as much money as it did. Like Singh, no one has heard from Arora yet, either, and whether or not he has come forward to address issues with U.S. law enforcement. So far, it seems only three of SBF’s inner circle members have snitched on him: Caroline Ellison, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-odd-relationship-with-vertical-farming-firms-a-look-at-exchange-boss-ryan-salames-and-bahamian-pm-philip-davis-trip-to-80-acres/">Ryan Salame</a>, and Gary Wang.</p>
<p>U.S. attorney Damian Williams said on Wednesday that the FTX investigation is still ongoing, and more announcements will be made in the near future. With <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/court-documents-say-ftx-boss-ryan-salame-snitched-on-sbf-2-days-before-the-bankruptcy-filing/">Salame</a>, Ellison, and Wang in the bag, it looks as though no one who committed misconduct at FTX will be left unexposed.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the fact that no one has heard from FTX&#8217;s director of engineering Nishad Singh yet? Do you expect other high-up FTX executives to come forward? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Prices have been hovering close to a two-month low in recent days, with today&#x2019;s surge bringing optimism to remaining bulls. Litecoin was also higher, as the token remained close to a one-week high.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the green on Thursday, as the meme coin rebounded from recent lows.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.07283 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.07736 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move comes as prices rallied, following a recent collision with a support point at the $0.0715 level.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, today&#x2019;s move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) raced to a ceiling of 40.00.</p>
<p>Since this time, earlier gains have somewhat faded, with the meme coin trading at $0.07657 as of writing.</p>
<p>Should price strength manage to climb above this threshold, then DOGE could rally to a ceiling near $0.0800.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) also rose on Thursday, as the token continued to trade near a one-week high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD hit a peak of $66.51 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes less than a day after it was residing at a low of $65.09.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s high is marginally below Tuesday&#x2019;s top at $66.90, which was the highest point <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> had hit since last Friday.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the move comes despite the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) recently extending its downward cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.</p>
<p>As of writing, the RSI is tracking at 39.67, which is below the next visible resistance line at 45.00.</p>
<p>Bulls will likely target this point, which could see <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> climb above the $70.00 price point.</p>

His statements follow the latest rate increase announced by the monetary authority last week and revised projections showing higher than previously expected inflation in Europe ahead.</strong></p>
<h2>‘We Have No Choice But to Raise Interest Rates,’ ECB’s Luis de Guindos Admits</h2>
<p>Recognizing that the eurozone is entering recession, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos has nonetheless insisted that the regulator should continue to raise interest rates in order to keep inflation under control. With the indicator likely to remain well above the price stability target, inflation of 2% over the medium term, the top executive told Le Monde “We have no choice but to act.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dec. 15, the ECB raised the deposit facility rate by 50 basis points to 2%. In the <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2022/12/22/nous-n-avons-pas-d-autre-choix-que-d-augmenter-les-taux-d-interet_6155367_3234.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> conducted the same day but published by the French daily and the bank on Dec. 22, de Guindos acknowledged that the European economy is “perhaps in negative territory” during the fourth quarter of 2022. With GDP expected to contract by 0.2%, he elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The lead indicators we have are not good. Our projections therefore expect the euro area to fall into a mild recession in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter of 2023, when GDP is expected to contract by 0.1%.</p></blockquote>

<p>While growth projections published in December are similar to the estimates from September, those regarding inflation have changed substantially, pointed out the former economy minister of Spain. Expectations for inflation have been revised upward significantly, from 5.5% to 6.3% for 2023 and from 2.3% to 3.4% for 2024, de Guindos detailed.</p>
<p>During a press conference after the last week’s rate hike, ECB President Christine Lagarde announced that there will be several further increases next year. Asked if that would make some governments unhappy, her deputy emphasized that inflation is currently the main problem for countries across Europe.</p>
<p>While admitting that raising interest rates will increase funding costs for European governments, Luis de Guindos insisted the ECB has to stick to its mandate. With inflation currently at 10%, the banker is convinced that “We have no choice … Because if we don’t control inflation, if we do not put inflation on a convergence trajectory towards 2%, it will be impossible for the economy to rebound.”</p>
<p>His comments come after the U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rate-by-50bps-fomc-signals-rate-to-rise-to-5-1-next-year/">raised</a> the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in mid-December. The 0.5 percentage point increase followed four consecutive rate hikes of 75 basis points.</p>

Bitcoin remained close to the $17,000 level in today&#x2019;s session, with the global market cap trading 0.01% lower as of writing. Ethereum was largely unchanged, as prices continued to trade above $1,200. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) continued to consolidate ahead of this afternoon&#x2019;s third quarter GDP data from the United States.</p>
<p>This afternoon&#x2019;s figures are expected to show growth of 2.9% in the quarter, as inflation in the U.S. began to slow down.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit a high of $16,895.71 ahead of the data release, which is marginally higher than Wednesday&#x2019;s bottom at $16,755.91.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s consolidation comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to hover near a support point at 46.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at the 46.49 level, and could be set to break out of this point at any moment.</p>
<p>Should this occur, bearish sentiment will likely return to the market, with prices heading towards $16,500.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also consolidated in today&#x2019;s session, with bulls managing to keep prices above the $1,200 level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,208.03 in Tuesday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD was marginally higher on Thursday, as it rose to a peak of $1,219.61.</p>
<p>The move sees the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency continue to be a stone&#x2019;s throw away from a ceiling at $1,230.</p>

<p>Despite the prospect of higher highs, overall momentum seems relatively bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average extending a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>As can be deduced from the chart, the RSI also looks set for a down trend, as it failed to break out of its current ceiling at 47.00</p>
<p>In order for bullish sentiment to return, it is likely that a move beyond this resistance will need to take place.</p>
