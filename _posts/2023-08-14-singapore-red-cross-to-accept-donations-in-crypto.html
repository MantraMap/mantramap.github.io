<p>The Singapore Red Cross recently announced that it will now accept donations in cryptocurrencies via a partnership with Triple-A.</p>
Singapore Red Cross Enables Anonymous Crypto Donations
<p>In an effort to secure contributions from a whole new generation, the Singapore Red Cross entered into a partnership with Triple-A to enable the option of anonymous crypto donations. According to a press release, the organisation accepts Bitcoin, Ether, Tether and USD Coin.</p>
<p>The Singapore Red Cross explained:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Powered by Triple-A, payment is compatible with all wallets and provides locked-in exchange rates. You can pre-define an amount (in fiat) that you would like to give and the system will automatically do the conversion for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Triple-A is the first crypto payment gateway licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The platform was sanctioned as a Digital Payment Token Provider by the MAS in November 2021.</p>
<p>Secretary general and CEO of the Singapore Red Cross, Benjamin William, commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By accepting digital currencies, we open our doors to a new segment of donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enabling cryptocurrency donations also opens more opportunities for the new generation of donors who are&nbsp;au fait&nbsp;with digital currencies to consider philanthropy and helping the vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donors can contribute with the four above tokens or donate via a separate solution from a Binance digital wallet.</p>
<p>Currently, crypto donations are not tax deductible.</p>
