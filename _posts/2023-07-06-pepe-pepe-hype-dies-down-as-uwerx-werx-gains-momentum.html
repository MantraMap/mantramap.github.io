<p>Memecoins had a heavy rally in the past few weeks, and it felt like the 2021 bull season again. But the excitement was short-lived, as most new memecoins that emerged in that timeframe have gone back to oblivion, but there&rsquo;s Pepe (PEPE) with some exciting narratives working in its favor. While the memecoin hype dies down, Uwerx also has taken center stage in the market with impressive presale rounds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to learn the potential it has to grow massive and how you can take advantage of the presale for profit:</p>
Pepe (PEPE) Hype Train is Down
<p>Pepe (PEPE) is impressive as a new memecoin considering the rallying strength it exhibited in just some weeks after emerging. PEPE moved to become a $1.8 billion market cap project in just two weeks, but the hype train is dying. There&rsquo;s only so much a project can do in a bear market, and PEPE holders can now wait for the bull market to launch another full-blown rally.</p>
<p>The Pepe (PEPE) community is growing, and in the past few weeks, the memecoin craze has been shipped to other blockchain networks, including Bitcoin (BTC), which is fairly new to memecoins. Pepe as a meme had existed way before it got a derived cryptocurrency, but now crypto enthusiasts are confident that it can flip Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the biggest memecoin in the market.</p>
<p>Pepe (PEPE) has fallen to around $600 million market cap, and with the prospects of passing Dogecoin ($10 million market cap) and Shiba Inu ($5 billion market cap), that&rsquo;s some 10x - 20x potential to look forward to. We could see such happen in a bull market considering Shiba Inu(SHIB) once pulled it off against Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>
<p>However, memecoins always remain a risky play, and if you want to get a crypto asset with less risk, then you should be learning more about Uwerx.</p>
