The cryptocurrency is currently ranked 8th based on market cap with total valuation of $8.88 billion. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/#:~:text=Proof%20of%20Stake%20solves%20the,is%20set%20at%2032%20ETH.">proof of stake (PoS)</a> blockchain is among the busiest in terms of crypto developer activity in the last one year. This comes amid the bear market environment that has grappled the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a> in 2022 with multiple setbacks.</p>

<h2>How Undervalued Is ADA Price?</h2>
<p>The Cardano (ADA) Price fell by around half its value three months ago, thanks to the crypto market volatility and liquidation crisis. In this context, on chain indicators reveal interesting patterns that suggest Cardano (ADA) price is currently undervalued. As of writing, ADA price stands at $0.2557, down 3.28% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/ada-is-undervalued-7152">Santiment Insights</a>, there is a clear divergence between whale purchase activity and ADA price. This is a bullish signal considering that the whales kept buying despite the FTX related crisis in the industry. Data shows that the divergence is clearly seen among whales that hold 100,000 to 1 million ADA and 1 million to 10 million ADA. Also, traders are preferring to hold on to their bags even as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price went down.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are signs of exhaustion of sellers. On every big price decrease there are less and less coins moving at a loss. BULLISH&#8221;</p></blockquote>

However, amid the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-10k-or-100k-in-2023/">recent downfall,</a> these gaming tokens witnessed a heavy toll and were discounted by large extended. Here is a list of cryptocurrencies that may prove a suitable entry opportunity before the bull cycle hits.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axie Infinity(AXS)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/O6SubUNx.png" alt="Top 5 Game Coins To invest in Before Entering 2023" width="1946" height="1105" />source-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Axie infinity weekly chart showed a textbook example of V-top reversal from the all-time high of $165.37. This downtrend tumbled the AXS prices by 95.96%, which currently trades at the $6.67 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> has showcased a more steady fall over the last seven which shaped into a falling wedge pattern. In theory, this bullish pattern reflects a gradual loss of bullish momentum as prices failed to achieve a deeper downfall in the following bear cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a potential bullish breakout from the pattern’s resistance trendline will project an early sign for price recovery and an entry opportunity for interested investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the market sentiment improves, an ideal target for this technical setup is $25.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gala(GALA)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/rVXNiQOi.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the AXS price, the GALA price action shows the formation of a f<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">alling wedge pattern</a> in the daily time frame chart. This altcoin has been strictly following this pattern for the past seven and should respect its potential target as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GALA price currently trades at $0.017 and is 97.85% down from the all-time high of $0.8367. However, amid the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the coin price has shifted sideways and trying to sustain above the pattern’s lower trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the relative strength index, which reflects the speed and magnitude of the coin’s recent price action, has drooped to the oversold region. This indicator value of 24% indicates the selling activity has overextended, and the coin is trading at a heavy discount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the indicator suggests the buyers may soon rebound from support and eventually lead the prices higher. A bullish reversal from this support trendline may encourage buyers to surpass the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, in ideal conditions, this technical step-up should raise the GALA price to the $0.09 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apecoin(APE)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/l1bqnLrO.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-why-apecoin-price-recovery-may-outperform-bitcoin-in-coming-weeks/">Apecoin price</a> currently trades at $3.62 and is 90.79% down from the all-time high of $39.40 Over the past seven months, the Apecoin price falling under the influence of a resistance trendline. During this downtrend, the prices have turned down from this trendline multiple times, indicating the traders are actively selling on rallies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, due to the current indecisiveness in the market, the Apecoin price has been moving sideways over the last seven days, struggling to break the $3.7 resistance. If market sentiment improves, a daily candle closing above $3.7 will accelerate the bullish momentum and surge prices to the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, a bullish breakout from the pattern&#8217;s resistance trendline will suggest the prior selling on rallies sentiment has flipped into turn y on dips. The price breakout may lead the coin to $9.16,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </span></p>

The disgraced crypto tycoon testified in court that loans from Alameda were used to buy a staggering 7.6% share in the stock broker &amp; crypto exchange. Shortly before being detained in December, SBF confirmed the source of funding for his <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/robinhood/">Robinhood</a> stock scoop in a court affidavit.</p>
<h2>SBF Buys Robinhood</h2>
<p>The court affidavit further stated that Bankman-Fried and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> co-founder Gary Wang together borrowed close to $600 million from FTX&#8217;s trading arm, Alameda, through promissory notes in April and May. The money was then used to fund Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd, a shell corporation that was used to carry forward the purchase of 7.6% stake in Robinhood.</p>
<p>The two set up Emergent Fidelity Technologies in Antigua to oversee their Robinhood investment. In the court filing, it was stated that Bankman-Fried had 90% ownership of Emergent while Gary had 10%.</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to capitalize Emergent so that it could make the investment into Robinhood, Gary and I agreed to borrow funds from Alameda Research Ltd. Those funds were capitalized into Emergent and it used those funds to acquire the shares in Robinhood.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Who Owns The Shares?</h2>
<p>As previously reported on CoinGape, claim for ownership of Sam&#8217;s Robinhood was made by the troubled <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> lender <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/blockfi/">BlockFi</a> which also filed for bankuptcy this year. In order to protect the interests of creditors, debtors, and claimants, the attorneys for the bankrupt exchange sought a judge to place a freeze on the assets. The affidavit allegedly corroborates the claims made by the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cftc/">CFTC</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a> that Alameda had provided loans to top executives and individual members of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defunct cryptocurrency company.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a> allegedly stole customer funds from FTX before the trading behemoth entered insolvency in May 2022, according to the CFTC&#8217;s lawsuit.</p>
<p>Prior to his detention in the Bahamas and subsequent extradition to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>, Bankman-Fried denied accusations of criminal negligence. However, in a plea agreement, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison admitted to taking customer money from SBF&#8217;s FTX <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> and sending it to her trading company.</p>

Since the onset of the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a>) vs. Ripple case in December 2020, the price of XRP has reacted profusely to the latest happenings inside the courtroom. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> is now consolidating around the $0.35 level, as the crypto community awaits the final outcome of the lawsuit.</p>
<h2>XRP Price In Danger Zone?</h2>
<p>However, according to crypto expert Ali Martinez, who goes by the username @ali_charts on Twitter, is of the opinion that the XRP&#8217;s price might experience a halt in its rally due to certain technical indicators. Ali points out that the TD (Tom Denmark) Sequential, which is an instrumental tool designed to identify the exact time of trend exhaustion &amp; price reversal &#8212; is indicating a strong &#8220;sell signal&#8221; on XRP&#8217;s four-hour price chart.</p>
<p>He also made the observation that investors should be expecting a bearish pattern for XRP, the 6th largest cryptocurrency, due to the formation of a bearish divergence against the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strength Index (RSI).</a></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>The bearish formation anticipated a one to four candlesticks correction for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XRP</a>. <a href="https://t.co/nuoQ5XRYhY">pic.twitter.com/nuoQ5XRYhY</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Lawsuit Verdict To Set Precedent</h2>
<p>In point of fact, despite the recent price increases, the underlying value of XRP will mostly be determined by the outcome of the continuing dispute between Ripple and the SEC. The lawsuit is heating up after the regulator filed a motion to seal certain documents following the completion of the final submissions made by both parties to the case.</p>

<p>Well-known <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> analysts anticipate major price movement in XRP in the event that the legal dispute is resolved favorably. Recently, a legislator and congressional candidate in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> named January Walker highlighted the relevance of the possibility that Ripple could outmaneuver the SEC in the continuing fight.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>XRP Flips BUSD In Market Value</h2>

The daily chart shows multiple short-body candles with price rejection on both sides, indicating indecisiveness among participants. However, under the influence of a bullish pattern, the price is likely to hit the overhead trendline near $1350. Here’s how this bullish may influence Ethereum’s near future price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/L6mGj9Cb.png" alt="Ethereum price" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tradingview</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Price Forming A Bullish Pattern</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price steadily falling for the past five months has revealed the formation of a falling <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">parallel channel pattern</a>. This pattern showcases itself as an established downtrend as lower resonating between two parallel descending trendlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in theory, this is a bullish continuation pattern as it provides a direction rally upon the breakout of its resistance trendline. This potential breakout will signal an early sign for price recovery and offer entry opportunities to interest traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ideal target after the breakout of the overhead trendline will be the $2000 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1000 Stands As Crucial Support</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the April-to-June bloodbath, the Ethereum price witnessed strong support from the $1000 mark. This psychological support aligned with the 0.786 Fibonacci retirement level accentuates this level as a high accumulation zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, amid the ongoing downfall, the Ethereum price may <a href="https://coingape.com/will-ethereum-eth-price-plummet-to-1000-in-early-2023/">revisit this support level</a>, offering a discount opportunity to potential buyers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relative Strenght Index</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strenght index(RSI)</a> evaluates the speed and magnitude of the coin’s recent price action to illustrate the underlying strength of the ongoing trend. Therefore, despite the falling prices, the weekly-RSI slope is moving sideways, indicating the buying pressure is growing at the bottom support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, this bullish divergence increases the chances of overhead trendline breakout and potential price recovery. </span></p>
<p><b>Current Price Action</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price&#8217;s recent bullish reversal from the pattern’s support trendline has triggered a new bull cycle. However, amid the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, this altcoin is stuck at the doorstep of $1230.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ETH price currently trades at $1215 price, with an intraday loss of 1%. A daily candle closing above the $1230 mark will replenish the bullish momentum and encourage prices to rechallenge the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance Levels: $1230 and $1400</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Levels: $1100 and $100 </span></li>

As the year 2022 approaches the end, crypto market continues to remain stagnant at the same price levels with Bitcoin (BTC) maintaining a below $17,000 level.

<h2>Tesla Stock Price Impact On DOGE</h2>
<p>The Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock price fell to $115.80, losing $7.35 in the day at a loss of 5.97%. This led to a further fall in DOGE price amid a daily drop on Tuesday. As of writing, DOGE price stands at $0.07407, down 2.31% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. The Tesla stock price drop comes after the automaker recently <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-suspends-production-shanghai-plant-internal-notice-2022-12-24/" rel="nofollow">suspended production at its Shanghai plant</a>.</p>
<p>The move came at a time when a China was witnessing a huge surge in Covid infections. The impact of Shanghai plant suspension could be clearly seen as the TSLA price fell 4.90% at the stock market open.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis</h2>
<p>The Money Flow Index (MFI) for Bitcoin is demonstrating a similar chart pattern compared to the asset&#8217;s previous two bottoms, a pseudonymous crypto analyst named Trend Rider <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1607590754242674688" rel="nofollow">noted</a> on December 27. As per historical data, during the earlier two bottoms, the BTC price took an upward trend &amp; the same bullish sentiment is expected to take place in the period of the first five months of 2023.</p>

<p>According to another <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoNoob_1/status/1607627447180349441" rel="nofollow">observation</a> made by Twitter influencer CryptoNoob, the leading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> was &#8220;trading in the oversold zone,&#8221; which is typically the place where the bottom occurs.

Former Terra Rebels developers submitted a proposal to form the “Joint L1 Task Force” developers team that will look into the maintenance upgrades and L1 layer developments on the Terra Classic <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a>.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community Votes on Edward Kim&#8217;s Proposal</h2>
<p>Professor Edward Kim, one of the core developers of Terra Classic, in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/edk208/status/1607420522832199685" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on December 27 announced that Proposal 11168 &#8220;Joint L1 Task Force&#8221; is up for voting. The discussion on the proposal is ongoing since Saturday. The current sentiment indicates that the community supports the proposal.</p>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/joint-l1-task-force/49108" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proposal</a>, Terraform Labs had a team of 6-8 senior L1 blockchain developers. Therefore, Edward Kim proposes to hire 3 full-time L1 blockchain developers to complete tasks in the next 4 to 6 months. The team will move to more innovative and long-term advancements after finishing the pending tasks.</p>
<p>The proposed team will have three members from the community such as Zaradar, Edward, and Till. The proposal noted that these contributed significantly to the revival of Terra Classic. It includes re-enabled <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/staking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staking</a>, re-enabled delegation, and introduced burn tax. Additionally, a part-time assistant and two junior developers will be required.</p>
<p>The total budget for the first quarter of 2023 is $141.75k, about 0.991 billion LUNC tokens. Notably, the distribution of payments will happen monthly only after approval from the Oversight Committee and approval from Terra Grants Foundation signers of the multisig.</p>
<p>As per current voting details, 99% of voters support the proposal. Also, the proposal looks to reach the &#8220;pass threshold&#8221; before the set voting period. Among validators, 25 have voted in favor of the proposal and 1 has voted &#8220;abstain.&#8221;</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Rally Continues</h2>
<p>Terra Classic price skyrocketed nearly 20% in the last 24 hours, with the current price trading above $0.00018. The 24-hour low and high for LUNC are $0.0001549 and $0.0001848, respectively.</p>
<p>A breakout above the 3-month descending channel led to a rally of 50% since December 24. Terra Classic has reclaimed the $1 billion market cap, supported by an over 150% increase in trading volume in the last 24 hours.</p>

The altcoin has been working on this pattern for nearly six months, preparing for a potential downfall. In theory, the bearish pattern signals the failure of buyers to rebound higher from a particular support (neckline) which eventually resumes a directional downfall.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A head and shoulder pattern governs the XRP price’s sideways trend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $0.411 will undermine this bearish pattern</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP price is $1.05 Billion, indicating a 125% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/wfbACQ3b.png" alt="XRP price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the XRP coin witnessed a <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-overtakes-busd-clinch-6th-spot-in-market-cap-ripple-top-3-2023/">significant inflow</a> on December 26th, which pushed its prices to a local resistance of $0.373. Today, the price tried to break above the mentioned barrier but couldn’t sustain the high ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the XRP price trades at the $0.368 mark and shows indecisiveness among market participants with a Doji candle. This candle pattern, backed by decreased volume, indicates a higher possibility of price reversal.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, this potential downfall may drop the XRP coin 15% down to challenge the neckline support of the H&amp;S pattern, i.e., $0.32-$0.31. This multi-month support level has supported this altcoin for the past six months and losing it will cause a deeper correction and plunge the prices to $0.26.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a bullish breakout from the $0.382 overhead barrier will weaken the bearish thesis and encourage a price rally to 12% higher to $0.41. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> The multiple crossovers between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line accentuates the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market. However, both these slopes wavering below the neutral line indicates the poses an upper hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Average Directional Movement Index:</strong> the ADX slope shows an evident rise to the recent downfall in XRP price, highlighting an overall downtrend in XRP.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.36</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.373 and $0.41</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.31 and 0.26</span></li>

<p>The company stated that it had requested the suspension of trading with the U.S. for 24 hours as the London Stock Exchange is closed on 27 December, Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, on 12 December, this bitcoin mining firm announced in a filing to the London Stock Exchange, that it is not filing for bankruptcy as of now, and restructuring itself. It stated that the company is in the stage of advanced negotiations to sell its assets and reduce liquidity. However, the firm mentioned that it cannot give any guarantee of the same.</p>
<h2>What is Agro?</h2>
<p>With an emphasis on industrial-scale cryptocurrency mining, Argo Blockchain plc is a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> technology business with dual listings ARBK and NASDAQ. Argo&#8217;s global, sustainable operations, which include its main mining plant in Texas and headquarters in the US, Canada, and the UK, are primarily powered by renewable energy. Argo joined the Crypto Climate Accord in 2021 and became the first cryptocurrency mining firm to be climate-positive. Through its Argo Labs subsidiary, Argo also takes part in a number of Web 3.0, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi</a>, and GameFi projects, significantly advancing both its commercial operations and the growth of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> markets.</p>
<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-volatility-hits-an-all-time-low-btc-to-rise-soon/">Bitcoin Volatility Hits An All Time Low; BTC To Rise Soon?</a></p>
<h2>The situation of bitcoin miners</h2>
<p>The price of bitcoin is falling and doesn&#8217;t appear to be significantly recovering any time soon. In addition, throughout the coming year, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/hash-rate/">hash rate</a> and difficulty of bitcoin mining will both continue to rise. Bitcoin mining profits will continue to decline if the coin&#8217;s price stays the same or declines further and the hash rate rises even slightly in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>However, miners with cash on hand and low-cost operations have the opportunity to profit from the slump.</p>
<p>The bear market will present value-seeking investors with an excellent opportunity to buy cheap shares of well-run miners. The coming year will be a turning point for the North American bitcoin mining industry, distinguishing the long-term players from the mediocre operators who entered when the going was good but were unprepared for the harsh realities of a down market.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">Individuals do not always act logically and evaluate all available information when making decisions, as they are swayed by behavioural biases. These biases can lead to poor judgements. And they can prove to be very costly when it comes to investing in the market.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Behavioral biases are often divided into two types: emotional biases and cognitive biases.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Cognitive biases are a result of simple statistical, information-processing, or memory flaws. They usually stem from poor reasoning.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Emotional biases arise from instinct or intuition and are often the product of feelings influencing judgment.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">To ensure that you are not susceptible to these biases, you must identify, accept, and adapt to the biases. Here are a few of them that you should try to minimise or avoid while trading or investing in the market.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/heres-how-you-can-get-a-job-in-metaverse-and-web3-industry-career/">Here’s How You Can Get a Job in Metaverse and Web3 Industry</a></p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">1. Overconfidence Bias</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:9da308a9-010d-4e44-9943-9cbd989e5e01/download_file?safe_filename=RuggerietalAAM2020.pdf&amp;type_of_work=Journal+article">studies</a>, overconfident traders trade more frequently and fail to diversify their portfolios appropriately, exposing themselves to far greater risks and possible losses.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Overconfidence bias affects traders who are overconfident in their trading abilities, causing them to make risky decisions or trade excessively. You may also be overconfident in assets in which you have previously invested substantially, resulting in a portfolio that lacks diversity.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">2. Herd Behavior Bias</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Herd behaviour occurs when investors follow others&#8217; decisions rather than making their own based on financial data and their own research.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">People follow the herd because it makes them feel safer. There&#8217;s also the &#8220;fear of missing out&#8221;: if your friends are making money by investing in a certain asset, sitting on the sidelines feels uneasy.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-100-investment-in-stellar-will-be-worth-if-xlm-reaches-1-price-prediction/">Here’s How Much Your $100 Investment in Stellar Will Be Worth If XLM Reaches $1</a></p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">3. Anchoring Bias</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive is known as anchoring, and it can have a major influence on the decisions we make.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Once that first piece of information, or &#8220;anchor,&#8221; is established, our brain makes decisions based on it, whether right or wrong. Investors can stick too closely to their earlier projections, even when new information comes to light.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">4. Narrative Bias</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">The &#8220;narrative bias&#8221; refers to our inclination to interpret information as part of a larger story, regardless of whether the facts support the entire narrative or not.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">In this case, investors are prone to overlooking evidence in favour of a compelling narrative about a certain asset or strategy. While stories might be intriguing, it is critical to analyse the big picture before making an investing decision.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">5. Confirmation Bias</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">People prefer to seek out and pay attention to information that confirms their existing beliefs, while avoiding evidence that questions or contradicts those beliefs. This arises because humans try to avoid the mental discomfort that comes when new knowledge contradicts our views or perceptions.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">As a consequence, investors dismiss unfavourable information about certain assets, which might be a warning sign that can help them avoid losses. Investors may sometimes ignore information that supports contrary views, resulting in missed opportunities.</p>

This pump at the end of the year 2022 leaves traders with optimism around future prospects. This comes after the recent crypto crash due to <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> bankruptcy and the subsequent liquidation crisis. Meanwhile, influencers credit the Terra community support for the good activity in terms of governance and proposals.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Rally With More Proposals?</h2>
<p>Thanks to the community participation, the Terra Classic community has passed the &#8216;Proposal 11111&#8217;. It is aimed at repealing Proposal 10983, which increased funding for the community pool with 50% of the 0.2% burn tax instead of 10% for on-chain development. Meanwhile, influencer <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keeEdFkur2c" rel="nofollow">Classy</a> said the huge number of people supporting LUNC is adding to the number of proposals. He added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The one thing we do have is the sufficient amount of people to think of good ideas to further the Terra Luna Classic blockchain which is one of the big reasons you are seeing so many proposals come up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

As of December, SBF was arrested on 8 different charges and is awaiting trial in the U.S. Overall, it has been a crazy ride for the crypto market this year.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the 9 craziest crypto news that took place in the cryptoverse, in 2022.</p>
<h2>The cryptos stumbled to the rising interest rates</h2>
<p>To control inflation, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">FED</a> has hiked interest rates this year to an extent, which was beyond expectations. They have also indicated to hike rates in the coming year as well. This made the investors withdraw from putting their money into any sort of investment.</p>
<p>As there were hints of raising interest rates in January itself, the crypto market started feeling turbulence. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> slipped by 19% and 29% respectively in that one month.</p>
<h2>Super Bowl LVI&#8217;s halftime advertisements were dominated by crypto powerhouses</h2>
<p>2021 saw the peak of the crypto world. Thus, the leading crypto platforms went on to partner with sportspersons and tournaments. A QR code bounced across a screen for 60 seconds in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>&#8216;s straightforward advertisement, and the company gave out $15 worth of bitcoin to entice viewers to its website.</p>
<p>LeBron James and Crypto.com partnered, while Larry David and FTX made fun of cryptocurrency naysayers in their &#8220;Don&#8217;t Be Like Larry/Don&#8217;t Miss Out&#8221; commercial.</p>
<p>FTX had various collaborations in the sports world which simply made no sense at the end of the year as it crashed.</p>
<h2>Crash of the stablecoin TerraUSD</h2>
<p>TerraUSD (UST) was always supposed to be at 1 USD, as it was a stablecoin. There was heavy selling of UST on 7th May which led to the breaking of its dollar peg.</p>
<p>Terra used an algorithm to keep the UST pegged to the dollar rather than keeping dollar reserves. If UST fell below 1 USD, this software would mint and sell modest amounts of its sister token, luna, to maintain its value.</p>
<p>The algorithm went into overdrive when UST plummeted, minting and dumping luna onto the market. It generated so much that, in a matter of days, the price of luna fell from an all-time high of 119.51 USD to 0.</p>
<h2>Celsius Network decided to never work like a bank again</h2>
<p>Citing the reason of “tough market conditions,” Celsius decided to stop its customers from withdrawing money. Bitcoin, as a result, plunged below its 23,000 USD mark, a decrease of 15%.</p>
<h2>The crypto Bitcoin slipped under the 20,000 USD mark</h2>
<p>This year has been disastrous for Bitcoin and its investors. For the first time, since 2020, Bitcoin fell below 20,000 USD.</p>
<p>The collapse of Bitcoin had an impact on the whole crypto sector. Ethereum was trading just above 1,000 USD by the end of June. At the same time, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoins</a> Solana and Polkadot were trading 90% below their all-time highs from 2021.</p>
<h2>Crash of the Three Arrows Capital</h2>
<p>The hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital saw its end this year. This cryptocurrency company, also known as &#8220;3AC,&#8221; was shut down by a court on June 27 after defaulting on a bitcoin loan from lender Voyager Digital in the middle of the month.</p>
<p>Soon after this, Voyager filed for bankruptcy, and the crypto lender company Genesis is drowning in loans.</p>
<h2>FTX Collapse</h2>
<p>Once the world’s top leading exchange, FTX was a billion-dollar empire made by Sam Bankman-Fried. It filed for bankruptcy on 11th November in the U.S.</p>
<p>According to reports from November, the sibling trading company of FTX, Alameda Research, held a sizeable portion of its portfolio in FTT, the exchange&#8217;s native token. Within a short period of time, the price of FTT fell from 22 USD to just 1 USD, causing a solvency problem for FTX.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Arrest</h2>
<p>On December 12, the former FTX CEO was arrested in the Bahamas on charges of fraud and money laundering. He is facing 8 criminal charges altogether. SBF was known to be one of the best CEOs in the crypto world. His charitable organizations had given millions to the media, NGOs, and to the democratic party in the U.S.</p>
<p>Once a crypto king, is now left with nothing.</p>
<h2>Customers pull 6 billion USD from Binance</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a>, the largest cryptocurrency exchange is under close examination following the collapse of FTX. It is a major crypto news right now.</p>
<p>In December, it lost $6 billion in just 72 hours when investors withdrew their funds from the platform. In light of this, the platform&#8217;s native Binance Coin tokens saw a sharp decline in price, leading to worries that it would have a liquidity crisis.</p>
<p>By hiring French accounting firm Mazars to conduct a proof-of-reserve audit on its cryptocurrency holdings, Binance made an effort to assuage the skeptics.</p>

The biggest crypto like <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-breaking-17000-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin (BTC) price</a> and Ethereum (ETH) price has registered marginal price drops over the past 7 days. Meanwhile, XRP, Ripple’s native token has managed to register a gain in the same period.</p>
<h2>XRP more profitable than BTC?</h2>
<p>XRP has turned out to be the top choice among the rest of the crypto. <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://twitter.com/WhaleStatsBSC/status/1607677953642479616" target="_blank">WhaleStats reported</a> that XRP has landed on the top 10 list of tokens used by the top 100 and 2000 BSC whales by trading volume in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>XRP 24 hour trading volume has surged by a whopping 120% to stand at $1.01 billion. XRP price is up by almost 6% in the last 24 hours. This surge has come amid the recent crypto downturn. The crypto market cap has dropped massively to stand at $813 billion. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here..</strong></a></p>
<p>Ripple’s native token is trading at an average price of $0.37, at the press time. Coingape reported that the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-overtakes-busd-clinch-6th-spot-in-market-cap-ripple-top-3-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP took over BUSD</a> in terms of market cap to take the 6th spot in the tally of biggest cryptos. It is still holding a market cap of over $18.6 billion despite facing <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-sec-shielding-hinman-doc-whale-move-275-mln-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal troubles from the SEC.</a></p>
<p>Earlier, Ripple announced that it has now officially launched the cross border payments in Malaysia. This move has come amid facing a legal battle against the US SEC. However, Ripple has become a 40% stakeholder in Tranglo. The firm also settles transactions using ODL.</p>

This isn&#8217;t surprising, especially when you hear about artists making tens of millions of dollars selling a single NFT. NFTs assets have skyrocketed in the market in the last year alone. <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/top-5-nft-trading-strategies-for-investors-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trading in NFTs</a> increased from $100 million in 2020 to a staggering $22 billion in 2021, according to tracking company DappRadar. The combined value of the top 100 NFTs is $16.7 billion.</p>
<h2><b>What are NFTs Assets?</b></h2>
<p>NFT stands for Non-Fungible Tokens. These non-fungible tokens are digitized tokens of physical assets such as art, music, albums, and so on. These digitized tokens are currently less valuable than physical assets, but some of them are worth millions of dollars. It emphasizes the importance of learning how to securely store NFTs to avoid losing access to your NFT investments.</p>
<p>Prior to the adoption of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain technology</a>, digital assets were less popular than they are now. However, due to poor distribution and lack of ownership in the centralized ecosystem. The owner of digital assets could not trace their distribution, causing them to lose value. Blockchain provides an immutable digital ledger that allows creators and artists to validate the original piece of their creation and manage their assets without the use of intermediaries.</p>

<h3><b>The expanding market for NFTs Assets<br />
</b></h3>
<p>According to one survey, the exponential growth began in 2021. The global <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT market</a> increased from 13.7 million to 2.5 billion dollars. People were trading NFTs in large quantities, with total sales exceeding $5 billion. In October, the most popular NFT marketplace, OpenSea, reached an all-time high of $ 1 billion in sales.</p>
<p>According to industry data from Cryptoslam.io, global NFT sales peaked at about $4.9 billion in January 2022 but have since declined to only about $565 million so far in December. The amount is about 80% less than December 2021’s $2.8 billion in non-fungible tokens sales.</p>
<p>The popularity of NFTs has grown significantly in tandem with the rise of blockchain technology. With Blockchain Council&#8217;s lifetime valid NFT certifications, you can become an NFT expert today.</p>
<h3><b>Why is it crucial to store NFTs Assets correctly?</b></h3>
<p>Non-fungible tokens have developed into valuable, scarce assets over time. For those who are interested in how NFTs can be hacked if supported by blockchain technology, it has attracted investors and hackers with success. The security of NFTs depends largely on how you are storing them. Keys that the owner stores can be used to access NFTs. If someone manages to obtain the access key to NFTs, they are free to take ownership.</p>
<p>With blockchain ledger technology, it can be followed, though. Similar incidents where hackers stole digital assets from Nifty Gateway, an NFT marketplace, have occurred before. However, a careful examination of the business&#8217;s security revealed that it had not been jeopardized. What caused it, then? Well, improper NFT storage is the cause of this. In the world of cryptocurrencies, there is a saying that goes, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have the keys, you don&#8217;t own the crypto.&#8221; It also implies NFT because, without access to one&#8217;s wallet keys, one cannot access NFTs.</p>
<h3><b>Storage options for NFTs Assets<br />
</b></h3>
<p>Security is just as important for NFT storage as it is for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a> storage. You run the risk of being the target of hacks, exchange fraud, or single points of failure if you leave them on an exchange.</p>
<p>Decentralized blockchain-based storage is much more secure than centralized storage of digital assets and gives owners complete control over their assets. Additionally, it offers a variety of options for increased mental clarity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that you shouldn&#8217;t keep cryptocurrency or NFTs in your wallet. Instead, a wallet uses a private key to ensure access to the investments stored on the blockchain.</p>

<h3><b>How to store NFTs Assets offline?</b></h3>
<p>Therefore, it is crucial to save and store NFTs in offline solutions for cold storage. This assumes storage in a platform that is not connected to the internet and is thus less vulnerable to unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other flaws common to data that is connected to the internet.</p>
<p>By purchasing a cold storage hardware wallet and transferring the digital assets there, you can store NFTs offline in the best possible way. The wallet won&#8217;t be accessible to hackers and keyloggers because it won&#8217;t be online. Every hardware wallet also includes a password and ID for additional security.</p>
<h2><b>Steps to protect NFT&#8217;s Assets privacy</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Long-term offline storage of digital assets</li>
<li>Step 2: Using a 12–24 word recovery key, also known as a seed phrase, you can access your digital wallet. Make sure to never give it to anyone or enter it online.</li>
<li>Step 3: Utilize all available data security measures, such as two-factor authentication and complicated passcodes.</li>
<li>Step 4: Make sure you don&#8217;t give anyone access to your login information.</li>
<li>Step 5: Ensure that you never save passwords and seed phrases on your computer. Make sure to always lock them away and store them on paper in a physical form.</li>
<li>Step 6: Steer clear of dangerous or unknown websites</li>
<li>Step 7: Another option is to conceal your internet protocol using a virtual private network.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Standard methods for storing NFTs Assets<br />
</b></h3>
<h3><b>Software Wallets</b></h3>
<p>Software wallets are online and simple ways for novices and non-technical users to store NFTs. These wallets are the most popular option for regular people, and the user interface is comparatively friendly. One of the most well-known software wallets that provide basic security for your non-fungible tokens is MetaMask. A 12–24 word seed phrase and a password are used to encrypt and secure MetaMask transactions. These <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital wallets</a>, like MetaMask, are online and open to hacker attacks. Enjin and Math wallet are two additional popular MetaMask alternatives.</p>
<h3><b>Interplanetary Filing System</b></h3>
<p>The Interplanetary Filing System is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol that enables users to store their non-fungible tokens off-chain. The way information is disseminated around the world is altered. Unlike other systems, IPFS uses content-based addressing as opposed to the more common location-based addressing. When a user adds a file to IPFS, the file is broken up into smaller pieces and cryptographically hashed. Each of these smaller pieces is given a distinct fingerprint known as a CID, or content identifier. These CIDs are hashes that are linked to non-fungible tokens directly.</p>
<h3><b>Hardware Wallet </b></h3>
<p>A cold, offline, or hardware wallet is the most common and effective security option for storing non-fungible tokens. It indicates that the private keys necessary to access a non-fungible token&#8217;s ownership are kept in a physical hardware wallet that is not online. It lessens the susceptibility of wallet gadgets. As an added measure of security, it also has two-factor authentication. Without physically accessing the hardware wallet, it is impossible to hack it. Users&#8217; most preferred hardware wallets for storing their non-fungible tokens are Ledger and Trezor.</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>Non-fungible tokens are expanding quickly, and users need to be made aware of the rising risks associated with digital assets. Inadequate storage and security measures are typically to blame for a hacker&#8217;s inability to recover keys to NFTs. Because NFTs are so common, businesses have begun to create solutions that raise security standards. With regard to threats and countermeasures related to non-fungible tokens, the NFT certification from the Blockchain Council provides a thorough and in-depth understanding.</p>

The LUNC price even continues to outperform <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>, Ethereum, and other <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altcoins</a> in the last few days.</p>
<p>Terra Classic has reclaimed the $1 billion <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a>. Moreover, the 24-hour trading volume has increased by over 165%, which validates the breakout is genuine.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Price Skyrockets 20% in 24 Hours</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic price continues to move higher after it fell to $0.0001269 last week. Since then, the LUNC price has rebounded nearly 50%. The market sentiment shifts from selling at highs to buying at dips.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours, the Terra Classic price recorded over 20% upside move by building momentum from earlier gains. It has now breakout above the strong resistance at $0.00016 to hit a high of $0.0001848.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-price-skyrockets-10-heres-why-more-rally-is-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported earlier</a> by CoinGape, the rally is the result of a breakout above the 3-month descending channel on December 24. Thus, this breakout signals an early sign of price recovery if the prices show sustainability above the breach trendline.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133188" style="width: 746px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-133188" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/27165342/LUNCUSDT_2022-12-27_16-52-24.png" alt="Terra Classic (LUNC) Price" width="746" height="454" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133188" class="wp-caption-text">Terra Classic (LUNC) Price. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI</a> jumped above the neutral line to 62 and also reflected the market sentiment supported by the potential price growth. Thus, the LUNC price trend is showing strength and can likely have more upside momentum.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 20-EMA (red) looks to move upwards and likely cross the 50-EMA (blue). It will confirm more upside move for Terra Classic (LUNC) price as traders will turn bullish. However, a move above $0.00020 is expected to happen due to a lack of strong resistance.</p>
