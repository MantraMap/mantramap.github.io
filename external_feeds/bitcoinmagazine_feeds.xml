    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Steven Hay, a writer, former trader and art dealer.</em></p><p>I’m a long-time Bitcoiner, preparing to travel and hopefully relocate permanently to El Salvador in 2023. Like many Bitcoiners, I wish to be a part of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/what-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-brought">amazing changes</a> happening in this country. And I’d like to share an idea which I strongly believe has the potential to accelerate those changes.</p><p>Similar to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">volcano bond concept</a>, this idea employs Bitcoin-linked assets to raise funds for the building of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-released-model-of-bitcoin-city">Bitcoin City</a>, or any other worthy project. Unlike bonds, however, these relatively-straightforward assets impose no legal or financial obligations upon the nation. They are simply created and then sold on the free market.</p><p>My idea revolves around something many of you have heard of: Bitcoin Ordinals. This new protocol, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals">launched in January 2023</a>, allows for the creation of “Bitcoin NFTs” linked to single satoshis. Known as “inscriptions,” these special satoshis are bound to data which is permanently embedded within Bitcoin’s blockchain. This data can take the form of images, text, video, etc.</p><p>Mere months after its creation, this new form of digital asset has already received considerable investment, with <a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces">at least $21 million in volume traded over the six major marketplaces</a> and additional trades conducted over the counter.. Galaxy Research<a href="https://www.galaxy.com/research/whitepapers/bitcoin-ordinals-inscriptions-5-billion-nft-market/"> estimates</a> that the Ordinals market will grow to $4.5 billion in total value by 2025. This figure may well prove to be conservative — especially if the government of El Salvador becomes an official participant in this space.</p><p>Already, renowned luxury goods makers like Bugatti and Asprey are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bugatti-and-asprey-announce-bitcoin-inscriptions">involved</a> in Ordinals. If private companies are expected to achieve millions of dollars in sales in this new market, how much more could a sovereign state achieve? As the Ordinals market matures and begins to attract mainstream investment, it seems certain that collections of historical significance will reach valuations which reflect their importance and rarity.</p><p>My suggestion is that the government of El Salvador continue to successfully implement new ideas by releasing an official Bitcoin Ordinals collection. Perhaps such a collection might comprise art or photography which highlight the country’s natural beauty, architecture and culture. Alternatively, it might feature scans of official documents relating to the new Bitcoin laws or Bitcoin City plans. Such inscriptions might confer certain benefits to their owners, such as discounts on government service fees. The purchase of a governmental inscription might even form part of a future El Salvadoran <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-citizenship-by-investment">citizenship by investment</a> (CBI) program. The possibilities are virtually endless.</p><p>Furthermore, I believe that the potential upsides are high while the risks are low and manageable. I believe that the goodwill of Bitcoiners and the world’s interest in El Salvador’s rapid improvement will lead to a great demand for what might be called its “national digital art treasures.” If the technical and creative aspects are handled correctly by the relevant professionals, I believe that such an endeavor can only bring great benefits to the people of El Salvador and to the global Bitcoin community.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Steven Hay.

    </figure><p>Through a partnership with exchange eToro, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/twitter-to-add-bitcoin-investing-in-partnership-with-etoro">Twitter recently added</a> the ability for users to invest into assets with $Cashtags, which also expanded the number of financial assets that users can see real-time prices for when using the feature. The partnership covered $Cashtags representing a wide range of instruments on the eToro platform, including bitcoin. Users can now click through to the eToro platform to see more information on the asset and have the option to invest. The $Cashtags feature has seen widespread adoption with reportedly more than 420 million searches for $Cashtags since the start of the year. $BTC (bitcoin) ranked in the top five most-searched for $Cashtags.</p><p>In an interview with a spokesperson for eToro, when asked about the vision and goal behind this partnership, they stated that “the goal of the partnership is to help people feel comfortable taking ownership of their financial futures by increasing engagement with and the accessibility of financial news and education.” <br><br>“Twitter has become a crucial part of the retail investing community — it’s where millions of ordinary investors go every day to access financial news, share knowledge and converse,” the individual speaking on behalf of the company said.</p><p>Keeping in mind the goal of providing access to financial information and education, “we hope we’re able to introduce investors to new and/or different tactics to diversify their portfolios,” the spokesperson explained.<br><br>According to eToro’s spokesperson, Twitter users have a young demographic, who typically have a longer investing timeline, similar to the user makeup of eToro's platform.</p><p>When asked about further integration with Twitter and bitcoin acceptance for Twitter Blue, eToro’s spokesperson did not provide any specifics but mentioned that they are always looking for ways to innovate and develop new products and partnerships. They confirmed that in partnership with Twitter, they hope to introduce more educational resources about bitcoin and other financial assets to their users through this partnership, but for now, eToro is focused on making the $Cashtags partnership a success. <br><br>eToro’s spokesperson said that the company believes that the future of investing is social investing and fostering dialogue in large networks, and that the inherent short form and ease of messaging on Twitter appeals to today’s investor. “Twitter is a space for conversation, where networking and interesting financial dialogue take place, eToro is a financial services provider built on the belief that social investing is the part of the future and that we can all do better by investing together and fostering dialogue in large networks,” they reiterated.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MjQwNDMz/bitcoin-price-market-analysis.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Culture War Won’t Win Mass Adoption]]></title><description><![CDATA[Prominent Bitcoiners, many of whom advocate “lifestyle maximalism,” may be hurting adoption by leaning in one political direction.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-bitcoin-culture-skew-right</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-bitcoin-culture-skew-right</guid><category><![CDATA[Influencers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Libertarians]]></category><category><![CDATA[Progressives]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Trey Walsh]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMzA4MDI5NDE1NjYzMTM3/aa-btc-2.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Prominent Bitcoiners, many of whom advocate “lifestyle maximalism,” may be hurting adoption by leaning in one political direction.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Trey Walsh, the senior director for youth programs at the MassHire Metro North Workforce Board in Somerville, Massachusetts.</em></p><p>Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has caught the world by storm, leaving many stumped by its continued adoption and growing number of use cases, and leading many others to continually dismiss it or manufacture cultural and political narratives about it to satisfy their own agendas. </p><p>We will never know the true intentions behind the creation of Bitcoin due to the pseudonymity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, but it is widely believed that Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and a widespread distrust of traditional financial institutions. Since 2008, this distrust of financial institutions, our political system and global organizations such as the World Bank and World Economic Forum has arguably continued to grow, while Bitcoin gains steam and interest continues to pique in its direction. </p><p>As more and more folks begin to notice Bitcoin, they also tend to notice what I consider to be Bitcoin’s “social layer” — and in this context, I’m referring to the range of social and cultural norms and values that have emerged among its users and biggest voices. </p><p>Every movement — in this case, a technological and monetary revolution — has a social layer and culture. Bitcoin is a complex and evolving phenomenon, with many nuances, but I would argue it is one that has been dominated, at least in the context of the United States, by those on the political right — ranging from those with far-right wing, fringe ideologies to Libertarians to mainstream Republicans. </p><p>This dominance resonates for liberal democracies throughout the West, but as an American, I will focus on the U.S. While Bitcoin users and holders may vary greatly across the social, cultural and political spectrums, many of Bitcoin’s biggest proponents and greatest public figures would identify most often with the political right and are predominately white men. </p><p>This is a value-neutral statement; an observation of the current demographic and ideological camp of prominent Bitcoiners. However, many people I know have been “turned off” from Bitcoin because they don’t see their values represented in the community. Those from marginalized groups, the LGBTQ+ community, progressives and many others can become distracted and outright dismiss Bitcoin as one of the fringe or radical ideas that have come from prominent Bitcoiners or prominent conservative politicians who express support for Bitcoin. </p><p>I would perhaps be saying the same thing if prominent Bitcoiners were arguing for far-left, fringe ideas as well. It doesn't help that many in the mainstream media have associated Bitcoin with <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/far-right-extremists-raise-millions-cryptocurrency-bitcoin/">white supremacy fundraising</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/crypto-mining-could-hinder-battle-against-climate-change-white-house.html">escalating global warming concerns</a> and a range of other biased attacks. But in any case, I believe that, for Bitcoin adoption to grow, Bitcoiners — and, in particular, prominent Bitcoin educators, public figures, etc. — must focus on the ideals, values and benefits of Bitcoin for <em>everyone</em>. In doing so, we may build the greatest and most diverse coalition of people fighting for a cause that our nation or world have ever seen. This coalition and community should have their values rooted in the fundamentals and spirit of Bitcoin, not merely in what has been viewed as mainly conservative ideology. </p><h2>This Progressive’s Bitcoin Battle</h2><p>Speaking from my own experience, when I really began to study Bitcoin in the spring of 2021, the first place I went to to learn more and get recommendations on who to follow, which books and resources to read, etc., was Twitter. Prior to my journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I viewed crypto as something for “crypto bros,” number-go-up technology and generally something I didn’t personally align with as a progressive and nonprofit professional. </p><p>Thankfully, I soon discovered folks like Alex Gladstein, who spoke of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/alexgladstein">Bitcoin’s human-rights-promoting qualities</a>, and Willy Woo, who spoke of <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/willy-woo">Bitcoin on-chain research</a>. Soon after, I purchased “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and was captivated by the history and the argument for the economics of Bitcoin and explored more concepts in Austrian economics. I was sold on the benefits and arguments for Bitcoin, and since then I have read countless other books and articles that have deepened my knowledge and conviction for Bitcoin. </p><p>At the time, I peripherally understood that the Bitcoin community and many of its main proponents in the West and United States leaned Libertarian. Once you go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and are convicted enough to label yourself a Bitcoiner, it's hard not to accept some Libertarian-leaning arguments and become skeptical of our current system. Bitcoin is, after all, the separation of money from state, and decentralized to the point that it is censorship resistant and holds firm to many economic principles sought after by the Austrian economic camp. </p><p>As I continued to trek through a wide variety of content from Bitcoiners, I noticed many seemed to be focusing a lot of time and energy on things that had little to do directly with Bitcoin and much more to do with a disdain for progressives, vaccinations and the LGBTQ+ and trans communities, and the promotion of gun culture, a carnivore diet, many far right, anarcho-capitalist ideals and more. </p><p>For me, as a progressive, it was distracting and at times deeply infuriating. Surely everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and I personally am a bit of a free-speech maximalist, but many of these folks have prominent Bitcoin podcasts, books or articles, and have professed that they want to increase Bitcoin adoption and have the world move toward a Bitcoin standard. One such interaction early on convinced me to explore the cultural/political side of Bitcoin more, as I felt it posed a significant threat to increased adoption and was much more likely to be co-opted by political factions, partisanship and nefarious actors. </p><p>I was following Ammous on Twitter. I have since been blocked so, unfortunately, I am unable to quote the exact tweets, but he was tweeting about a carnivore diet, the benefits of this and the risks of veganism, etc. As a vegan and Bitcoiner, I responded, as I believe “thought leaders” in the space should be exposed to a wide variety of views and the experiences of their audiences and others in the community. I was respectful, but responded stating that I am a vegan and I grow weary of associating Bitcoin so strictly with any diet or lifestyle, as he was arguing, and also associating particular diets with a “fiat” mindset, as he has in countless talks, articles and his book “The Fiat Standard.” He responded by stating that, because I was vegan, I was malnourished and he seemed to have a distaste for my presence in the community of Bitcoiners. Now, with his book being the first that I read in the space, it was a bit shocking to see how quickly he attacked a view that dissentented from his own. Surely, Bitcoin is for everyone and that community is going to have a diverse set of opinions and perspectives, right? </p><p>This is just one example of many that I have witnessed. I’m not here to harp on toxic Bitcoin Maximalism, personal stories of silly, unkind interactions on a social media app, but there are questions to be asked about when and why this community evolved into its current form, dominated by right-leaning ideology, while the general population of crypto and bitcoin investors is actually quite diverse politically, ideologically, racially, etc. </p><h2>When Did Bitcoin Become Associated With The Right?</h2><p>For that, I would refer you to Jameson Lopp’s recent article, “<a href="https://blog.lopp.net/history-of-bitcoin-maximalism/">A History Of Bitcoin Maximalism</a>.” As I mentioned, I began studying Bitcoin in early 2021 — so much of this culture and evolution occurred prior to my time in the Bitcoin social space. But it’s worth noting that, circa 2018 and on, “Bitcoin Maximalism” as many know of it today really gained steam and transformed into what Lopp calls “lifestyle maximalists,” who are focused on things such as a carnivore diet, conservative Christian identities, “traditional” values, weightlifting, guns, etc. This was further amplified by COVID-19, with lockdowns, government intervention, vaccines, etc. This exists to this day, but is slowly evolving with the understanding that more diverse voices are entering the space, such as progressives and environmentalists who see the humanitarian and positive environmental benefits that Bitcoin offers. </p><p>As I’ve stated, I personally identify as a progressive, but my intention is not to have progressive voices (which span a wide variety of perspectives and opinions, I should add, for those who have cast all of “us” as the same) be the dominant voices, but rather for the Bitcoin social community to reflect a more inclusive body of constituents, regardless of their political/lifestyle choices, which can all agree on the fundamentals of Bitcoin: the non-partisan, freedom money tool. </p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone, and its loudest champions and voices with the largest audiences should keep this in mind if they profess themselves to be Bitcoin Maximalists, freedom maximalists, seeking a bitcoin standard, seeking mainstream adoption, etc. I would ask these folks (many of whom I respect): What do you value more? Bitcoin education and its increased adoption to create a better world, or your audience-capture bent towards “lifestyle maximalism”?</p><p>Since Bitcoin is for everyone, we all must be aware of the diversity of views and identities out there. If you’re immediate rebuttal is, “Well, stop trying to make Bitcoin political,” or, “If someone’s opinion gets in the way of someone getting bitcoin, then they don’t deserve it anyway,” ask yourself two things: Do you come from the “dominant” position within the outspoken Bitcoin community (right leaning and/or libertarian)? And what is your opposition to helping onboard folks to Bitcoin who may be turned off by views they consider fringe or off putting? </p><p>I fear many prominent Bitcoiners are not taking seriously enough this “social layer,” as a factor in Bitcoin’s global adoption and ultimate success, exclaiming things like, “Bitcoin has already won,” “you can’t stop Bitcoin,” “everyone gets bitcoin at the price they deserve," etc. </p><p>As great as a technology is and can be, one that all us Bitcoiners see endless possibility and hope for humanity in, I do worry that we are at a critical point — one that I believe will succeed ultimately, by the way — where culturally, the Bitcoin community must broaden its horizon, become more inclusive and mainstream with its narratives, or else adoption could slow or stop altogether. I know that many media outlets will not stop their false tirades against Bitcoin, but the community doesn’t help itself if prominent Bitcoiners continue to obsess over diets, anti-vaccine takes, patriarchal traditional values, attacking and dismissing anyone that doesn’t agree with their political perspective as “brainwashed by the fiat machine.” </p><h2>Bitcoin And The ‘Climate Crisis’</h2><p>One such example that many prominent Bitcoiners are adamant about refuting is climate change or the “climate crisis.” As a progressive, vegan and environmentalist, I am deeply concerned about the data-supported climate change that we are seeing and I do see this as a crisis that is in need of creative solutions (<a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/can-bitcoin-mining-save-the-environment">many of which, I think, can be found in bitcoin mining</a>). </p><p>I do believe there is much to be debated in terms of <em>addressing </em>this issue, but the fact of the matter is, the majority of Americans believe <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/15/poll-climate-change-americans-congress">climate change is happening</a> and that more should be done to address this. However, many prominent Bitcoiners have argued there is <a href="https://twitter.com/MartyBent/status/1645488341062676480?s=20">no climate crisis</a>, and some in fact have argued that more <a href="https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1647361326153342976?s=20">carbon is good for our planet</a>. </p><p>While I believe that much of the rhetoric from Bitcoiners combating the notion of a climate crisis is in response to governments who may be taking harsh stances against fossil fuels, which could put the stability of grids at risk or force reliance on other nations’ energy sources, this type of rhetoric can turn away large portions of the population. With increased attacks on Bitcoin from politicians like Elizabeth Warren and news outlets such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">The New York Times</a>, it’s important for Bitcoiners to set the record straight while also putting forth arguments that many Americans can grasp and understand from their political worldviews. </p><p>In fact, many environmentalists who support Bitcoin see huge potential in bitcoin mining and its ability to utilize more renewable energy sources, and more focus on this argument from folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/thetrocro">Troy Cross</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jyn_urso">Margot Paez</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten">Daniel Batten</a> is helping the mainstream audience see Bitcoin as a potential tool in the renewable energy transition. </p><p>Folks arguing against labeling our climate change as a “climate crisis” are free to express their views, but must also understand the effect this may have on increasing Bitcoin adoption among a population that predominantly believes climate change is real and that we must do more to address fossil fuel/carbon emissions. </p><p>The fact of the matter is that the average American does not care about the Bitcoin white paper, best practices for privacy, the Bitcoin block size or most of the “lifestyle maximalism” takes. And I believe many will be among the last to realize the importance of Bitcoin because they have a fairly stable currency, comfortable living standards, etc. </p><p>But what people can start to gravitate toward are what all of us gravitated toward from the beginning: Bitcoin is a great savings account, it protects human rights globally, it has a fixed supply so it’s deflationary, it’s easy to use and send domestically and globally and you can own it in self custody — no bank IOUs and no trust! </p><p>With our focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin, we may begin to move past and beyond its political, partisan takes and into mass global adoption. </p><h2>The Road To Mass Adoption</h2><p>As we’ve seen, there is evidence to suggest that support for Bitcoin from the general population is more varied across the political and identity spectrums than one might think if they only pay attention to Twitter, mainstream media articles and the loudest voices. As many know at this point, social media is a poor indicator of where the majority of people lie on issues. Social media tends to bring out the most extreme views — for instance, those from the far right and far left — creating arguments that generate engagement rather than true representation of the diverse community that tends to lean toward a moderate view. </p><p>I would argue that Bitcoin, just like many other issues in our world, has been co-opted by political extremes and by “lifestyle maximalists,” and that the road to mass adoption is in ensuring that we explain the fundamentals of Bitcoin that appeal to the masses, rather than the co-opted fringe views that have little or nothing to do with Bitcoin. </p><p>This is not about censoring views or speech, but rather about encouraging those Bitcoiners in positions of power and influence to keep in mind the diversity of our population and the hope for Bitcoin’s mass adoption. In politics and in life, those in positions of power often engage in rhetoric and topics that are actually a distraction from the real issues average citizens face. As folks continue to wake up to this reality, as inflation grows, the state of our economy continues to erode, more folks continue to ask questions — the same questions being asked after the 2008 financial crisis. Why is wealth inequality so high? Why are my savings dwindling and affording things is growing harder by the year? Do politicians even care? </p><p>As the distrust in government and financial institutions continues to grow, we have a real opportunity to present folks with the alternative and the hope that Bitcoin brings to our world — a tool that separates money from the State; doesn’t require trust; is verifiable and decentralized through the blockchain, miners and full-node operators; and provides people with savings that won’t erode over time to reward their hard work. </p><p>Bitcoin is non-partisan, and I don’t think fringe arguments from Bitcoin “lifestyle maximalists” that go against majority-held beliefs and opinions help Bitcoin’s continued widespread adoption. Luckily, more folks in the Bitcoin community are waking up to this, and more diverse opinions and perspectives are flooding into the Bitcoin community to truly represent the masses, the everyday citizen. Bitcoin is for everyone, and the more that the Bitcoin community reflects that, the closer we will be to mass adoption. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Trey Walsh.

    </figure><p>Bitcoin Magazine has announced the launch of its new book publishing branch, Bitcoin Magazine Books. The venture aims to provide readers with educational literature on Bitcoin, its impact on global economies and its role in shaping the world's financial future. As the adoption of Bitcoin increases, the need for accurate and informative resources becomes crucial in understanding the complex topics surrounding Bitcoin and navigating the rapidly evolving landscape.</p><p>The launch of Bitcoin Magazine Books is marked by the release of two new publications, "Hidden Repression" by Alex Gladstein and "A Progressive's Case for Bitcoin" by C. Jason Maier. These publications are not just for Bitcoin enthusiasts, but for anyone interested in global economic and political developments.</p><p>"<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/hidden-repression">Hidden Repression</a>" by Alex Gladstein addresses how the world's monetary system exploits the weak and how citizens in the global south are turning to Bitcoin as a way out. Gladstein states, "I’m delighted to be working with Bitcoin Magazine to publish Hidden Repression, which seeks to illuminate the true nature of the world financial system and how, at its core, it remains a mechanism of the powerful stealing from the weak."</p><p>"<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/a-progressives-case-for-bitcoin">A Progressive's Case for Bitcoin</a>" by C. Jason Maier presents a well-researched and thoughtful case for the value of Bitcoin, grounded in fact and avoiding sensationalism and hype. Maier hopes to combat some of the misinformation that people often hear about this new technology, stating, "Bitcoin is our best chance to make the world more just, equitable and peaceful, and it is critically important that more people fully understand it."</p><p>Both books are available for purchase from the Bitcoin Magazine store for $29.99, and they will also be available for purchase at the upcoming <a href="http://b.tc/conference">Bitcoin 2023 Conference</a> in Miami on May 18-20. The authors will be present at the conference's general admission days, where they can sign the books at the Book Signing booth.</p><p>Bitcoin Magazine Books aims to publish high-quality books that offer readers valuable insights into Bitcoin's role in shaping the world's economic future. With the launch of these two new publications, Bitcoin Magazine Books is off to a strong start, and readers can look forward to more exciting books in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNDgzNTg3/bitcoin-to-the-moon.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Orange Pill App Is Accelerating Hyperbitcoinization In Real Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Orange Pill App brings Bitcoiners together, demonstrates demand for adoption to local businesses and propels the bitcoin standard.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/orange-pill-app-joins-bitcoin-in-person</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/orange-pill-app-joins-bitcoin-in-person</guid><category><![CDATA[Orange Pill App]]></category><category><![CDATA[Merchants]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Meetups]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robert Hall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:01:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4MTgwMTQ4ODgzODI2NDc0/20220318_btcfinal_attendingmeetups.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Orange Pill App brings Bitcoiners together, demonstrates demand for adoption to local businesses and propels the bitcoin standard.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

But if you don’t know anything about this platform, here is a quick rundown: </p><p>It’s an app available on iOS or Android that helps you find local Bitcoiners in your area. How often have you felt like you are the only Bitcoiner in town? I know I have plenty of time. Wouldn’t it be nice to make new friends that love Bitcoin as much as you do in real life?</p><p>This is what the Orange Pill App is all about: building friendships and building a thriving Bitcoin community one meetup or connection at a time. As of this writing, there are thousands of users.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In addition to helping you to find new Bitcoiners in your area, Orange Pill App is also on a mission to orange pill businesses. How much better would it be if we could spend sats at our local bars, hotels or restaurants? That would be awesome, right?</p><p>It definitely would add some rocket fuel toward the goal of achieving a bitcoin standard. To make this happen, <a href="https://medium.com/@orangepillapp/bridging-the-gap-orange-pill-app-and-btcmap-org-3552f1766339">Orange Pill App has partnered with BTCMap.org</a> to use demand-side pressure to orange pill merchants en masse.</p><p>When this new feature is launched, the app will be able to plug the number of its users into BTC Map to show how many Bitcoiners are in a given area. This data will be shown to business owners so they can understand if there is an active group of Bitcoiners ready to spend sats at their establishments.</p><p>This is a win for small business owners, because they can instantly gain new customers without advertising. Bitcoiners are eager to spend sats and support businesses that accept bitcoin. One thing I understand about Bitcoiners is they are loyal and believe in Bitcoin to the core of their beings.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This is a win for Bitcoin educators as well. Instead of spending valuable time explaining Bitcoin's tenets to each individual business owner, those owners can see the demand with their own eyes. </p><p>And, once one business starts accepting bitcoin and seeing results, word will spread like wildfire among other business owners. It’s all about creating a network effect at the business level.</p><p>The road to hyperbitcoinization will take different methods and vectors to reach the masses. This could be a highly-effective method of orange pilling the people who we need to create a new Bitcoin-based economy!</p><p>My hat is off to the team over at Orange Pill App. I can’t wait to see what else it comes out with in the coming months and years. Remember: stacks friends who stack sats!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

The <a href="https://github.com/civkit/paper/blob/main/civ_kit_paper.pdf">paper</a> was authored by Antoine Riard, Nicholas Gregory and Ray Youssef, who have shared the paper with the Bitcoin developer community for feedback. The Civ Kit combines the Nostr architecture with the Lightning Network, prioritizing “privacy and security through escrowed trades, decentralized identity, moderation, a P2P messaging protocol, and know-your-peer (KYP) oracles for adjudication,” a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine stated. The system aims to support all kinds of trading, including goods and services.</p><p>“The researchers will gradually release code and modules, extensively building on top of the Lightning Dev Kit and Nostr libraries,” the press release explained. “Civ Kit development will bind to the same open-source and transparency standards as Bitcoin Core and libsecp256k1.”</p><p>The Civ Kit's design will emphasize trust and reputation within the marketplace, and the press release described how borrowing and lending can be added by using a universal credit score for all traders calculated by a combination of success of trades (Web-of-Stakes) and Web-of-Trust techniques that act as a “trustless source of truth.” The Civ Kit has been “peer-reviewed by some of the best minds in the Lightning and Discreet Log Contract engineering communities,” the press release said.</p><p>Nicholas Gregory, one of the authors of The Civ Kit, has been involved in developing Bitcoin infrastructure since 2016, and hopes that the initiative will boost Bitcoin's circular economy. He stated, "I truly hope this initiative serves as a unique piece of the puzzle to boost Bitcoin's circular economy, which, if we're honest, has not reached its full potential in 2023."</p><p>Ray Youssef, founder of Paxful and the Built With Bitcoin Foundation, another of the paper's authors, said he is committed to carrying on the work of Satoshi Nakamoto to provide the world with the ability to build unstoppable free markets. <br><br>“The title of the Bitcoin white paper spoke about ‘a peer-to-peer electronic cash system’ — yet the P2P industry is under attack from international powers who feed off centralized fiat currencies and the control they wield,” Youssef said. “At the same time, billions of people have been relegated to non-existence by this failed system. Bitcoin is the solution and we’re not backing down.”<br><br>The team behind the white paper is working to integrate the research into <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-entrepreneurs-introduce-noones-app-aimed-at-empowering-financial-freedom">Noones</a>, a new company dedicated to financial freedom in the Global South.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Frank Kashner, founder of UnChainDemocracy.org.</em></p><p>In 1971, I joined a communist party while working in the factory of the highest-paid General Electric (GE) defense plant in the country. I was repulsed by pictures of our military dropping napalm on Vietnamese children, convinced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/opinion/vietnam-war-necessary.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap">the justifications of our government </a>were lies, and I was drawn to the idea that “the working class” would soon take over the world and create a utopia. </p><p>The group that I joined was split off from the American Communist Party. It <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Say-Want-Revolution-Worker-Student/dp/0578406543">was supposed to be “democratic and centralist</a>.” I quit the group after two months when it tried to give me orders without understanding what was actually happening. I saw that it was all about Centralism without any democracy. But I stayed in the GE factory for 13 years, participating in movements that reformed both the worker’s union and GE.</p><p>But what about “revolution” and who are the “workers”? I did not have a violent bone in my body, and treated the terms “revolution” and “workers” like metaphors, not taken seriously by me or anyone else (including our probable FBI monitors). But the need for dramatic social and political change stayed with me, and my notion of the “workers” grew to include almost everyone who is not a billionaire or flunky. </p><p>Over the years, I have participated in personal, union, community, school, environmental and political reform efforts, always aware that, even though we often won victories, we were shoveling shit against the incoming tide of empire, greed, militarism, autocracy and disintegration. </p><p>In 2017, I met Bitcoin and was entranced by the idea of money that was independent of corporations and governments, that was limited to 21 million, created by solving math problems, guarded by vigilant nodes, decentralized and not rigged by and for the elite. Over this past year, I have learned from the brilliant Bitcoin community, including people like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50157837-the-price-of-tomorrow">Jeff Booth</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Jason Lowery</a>. Bitcoin is a tool of international, non-violent economic revolution against corruption. Bitcoin strikes at the heart of corporate and governmental theft from our families, of our labor, our property and our intellect. </p><h2>Wake Up To Bitcoin</h2><p>This applies to every governmental fiat, debt-based system in the world. In his magnificent book, “<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/statesofdamage/syllabus201516/graeber-debt_the_first_5000_years.pdf">Debt: The First 5,000 Years,”</a> David Graeber shows us how national, debt-based systems always result in inflation, and then in war and revolution. Bitcoin does not replace the need for political organizing and resistance, but I am now convinced that political and economic reform cannot succeed peacefully without Bitcoin. For the first time in history, Bitcoin offers a non-violent path to stable and increasing value of our labor, in all of its forms, for we “workers of the world.” Progressives have been slow to do the work to understand economics and Bitcoin, and to join this movement. To them, I say, “wake up!”</p><p>Many of you reading this have tried to reach friends and relatives about Bitcoin, often without success. For some of them, I have a possibly more compelling message.</p><p><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/statesofdamage/syllabus201516/graeber-debt_the_first_5000_years.pdf">Graeber</a> points out that our economy has depended upon military spending as great as all of the other nations of the world combined. This spending has in turn depended upon the dollar being the global reserve currency. Other nations are now moving away from the dollar. That movement, plus the billionaire wealth gap (grab), plus our current mountain of debt and the resulting inflation, is running out the clock of our economic system. This result follows:</p><p>Our crumbling infrastructure, insurance-dominated healthcare, insufficient housing, schools under attack, racism, misogyny, religious nationalism, an inability to respond to the destruction caused by global warming, and our dissolving social fabric are problems that cannot be solved under our current debt-based economic system. As our economy inevitably declines, every other just cause suffers. If you care about any of those things and the future of our children, then you need to learn about Bitcoin.</p><p>Every government in the world, capitalist and communist, is now deep in debt, the money stolen from current and future generations. They are all unsustainable, economically and environmentally. They are all Ponzi schemes. And like all Ponzi schemes, they depend upon our <a href="https://www.mackinac.org/OvertonWindow">knowledge, belief and acceptance</a> to keep going. Historically, systems that reached high levels of misery and inequality, ended in revolution, war or both.</p><h2>Bitcoin Changes Things</h2><p>For the first time in human history, we have a vehicle that goes to the heart of our financial and economic system. It is increasingly available for both savings and transactions. It steps around police and military batons, guns and tanks, and establishes unimpeachable value for our labor, for our remittances home, for our savings and our retirement. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Lowery posits </a>that Bitcoin can replace much of our over reliance on violent military (non)solutions.</p><p>The corruption of our political systems sits atop patronage and cultural hierarchies, some, centuries old, <a href="https://unchaindemocracy.org/democracy-in-chains-a-review">some modern</a>. The hierarchies, dominating both U.S. political parties, are designed to shield and obscure those responsible (remember <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/style/jeffrey-epstein-little-black-book.html">Jeffrey Epstein and his client book</a>?) and limit participation in organizations for change, including Bitcoin. Our ability to have a say in how we are governed, at the federal, state or city levels, is decreasing as schools and towns face budget shortfalls, in step with the declining value of the money in our pocket. </p><p>Our democracy is under attack. At every level. This decline, as measured by groups that <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/big-picture/Leveraging-big-ideas/flawed-democracy">track freedom</a> worldwide, corresponds to <a href="https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/2021?endYear=1971&amp;amount=100">the U.S. dollar’s decline in purchasing power</a>. The dollar (including the value of our labor) goes down, freedom goes down! Massive strikes, demonstrations and resistance to the disintegrating world order are occurring in other countries, but are poorly covered in our corporate media. </p><p>Teachers, medical and healthcare workers, farmers, machinists, retail workers, transportation workers, the underemployed, the unable to work, of all countries: it is time to unite. We have nothing to lose but the chains of billionaires, their flunkies, their rotten financial and political system and their often cruel or clueless managers. For the first time in history, we have a tool that values our labor and ideas, that steps around their corruption, that enables us to transfer value at the speed of light, to avoid their fees, to make use of stranded and wasted energy.</p><p>Bitcoin is a peaceful, worldwide economic revolution with profound social and political implications. No weapons other than your learning, imagination, courage and participation are required. And you will have to see through all of their propaganda, their fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) aimed to delay, devalue and defeat it.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Frank Kashner.

    </figure><p><a href="https://www.bitstack-app.com/en">Bitstack</a>, a bitcoin savings app in France, has announced a $2.1 million (€2 million) funding round. The funding comes from a range of investors, including Founders Future, Y Combinator and Kima Ventures, among others. The startup will use the funding to expand its product offerings, make strategic hires and finance customer acquisition efforts, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Bitstack will soon offer its users the ability to auto-invest a percentage of their paycheck in bitcoin, send bitcoin between friends and earn bitcoin rewards when spending with the Bitstack Card, the company says.</p><p>Bitstack was launched on the App Store and Google Play in July 2022, and has since onboarded over 25,000 users in France according to the press release. Alexandre Roubaud, CEO of Bitstack, said "We are seeing a rapidly growing interest for Bitcoin in France, with over 50% of Bitstack users being first-time bitcoin buyers." The startup has also seen its number of active users increasing by more than 20% month over month, the press release states.</p><p>Since its launch, Bitstack claims its users have unrealized gains of 30% despite bitcoin’s downward trend in 2022.

    </figure><p><a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained</a>, a financial services provider for bitcoin holders, has announced that it has raised $60 million in its Series B funding round. The funding was led by Valor Equity Partners and included participation from existing investors such as NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital and Highland Capital Partners. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, funding will be used to expand Unchained’s client base and improve its suite of financial services.</p><p>Unchained’s collaborative custody model aims to use Bitcoin’s native multisignature capabilities to provide the benefits of self-custody while mitigating risks associated with self-custody. The model allows clients to share control of their bitcoin between private keys they hold themselves and private keys held by Unchained and other financial services companies. The platform currently secures over $2 billion in bitcoin across thousands of keys worldwide, according to the press release.</p><p>Vivek Pattipati, a Partner at Valor who will be joining Unchained’s Board of Directors, described Unchained’s current position, saying that “in the midst of market chaos, Unchained has emerged as a highly trusted provider of Bitcoin custody and financial services through superior technology, risk management, regulatory compliance, and client service.”<br><br>The company has originated over $500 million in bitcoin-collateralized loans since 2017, the press release states, while experiencing zero loan losses. The Unchained trading desk allows clients to buy bitcoin directly to cold storage, and its IRA offering allows clients to hold keys to their bitcoin within tax-advantaged retirement accounts, which the release notes is an industry-first.</p><p>Unchained feels that as bitcoin continues to grow in adoption, there is a tremendous opportunity for products that bridge into the traditional dollar ecosystem around credit, trading, investment and other financial services. “Using this fresh capital investment to expand our reach and suite of services, we hope to enable new entrants to Bitcoin to leapfrog centralized custodians into our safer collaborative custody model,” said Unchained CEO Joe Kelly.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNTQ5MTIz/technical-bitcoin-development-pixel.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Anita Posch Brings Financial Education To The World: ‘Bitcoin Gives Them A Choice’]]></title><description><![CDATA[Podcaster and non-profit educator Anita Posch discusses her mission to travel the world and bring Bitcoin to those who need it most.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/anita-posch-on-global-bitcoin-education</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/anita-posch-on-global-bitcoin-education</guid><category><![CDATA[anita posch]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Africa]]></category><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[women]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Becca Bratcher]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTky/bitcoin-adoption-map.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Podcaster and non-profit educator Anita Posch discusses her mission to travel the world and bring Bitcoin to those who need it most.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>As an American who grew up in the South, I am ashamed of the lack of financial knowledge I had as a young adult. Bitcoin made zero sense to me until I understood the history of money and what it means to have a peer-to-peer, apolitical, monetary system. This knowledge has opened my mind to the many things that Bitcoin can accomplish in regards to elevating human rights around the world. </p><p>Every single day, more human rights violations are reported in the media. From the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/tag/rohingya">Rohingya genocide</a> to the Russian invasion of <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1135012">Ukraine</a> and a thousand more in between. The world we live in is corrupted by greed and those who misuse their power. Oftentimes, the power hungry use fiat currency as a means of control. That being said, Bitcoin’s case for improving human rights is the number one reason why I care about Bitcoin. </p><p>Enter Anita Posch: <a href="https://btcpodcasting.com/@anitaposch">Podcast</a> host,, <a href="https://learnbitcoin.link/">author,</a> non-profit <a href="https://bffbtc.org/">founder</a> and Bitcoin educator. Posch has a background of more than 20 years in web design and online entrepreneurship, and has made it her life’s mission to educate people who need Bitcoin the most. She has been on the ground working tirelessly, emphasizing the need for everyone, specifically women, to take control of their financial literacy through Bitcoin education and entrepreneurship. </p><p>I’m confident you will be inspired as you read her responses to my questions about how she is using Bitcoin education to empower more people around the world.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what <em>specifically</em> drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The first time I heard about Bitcoin was in 2011, I tweeted about it, but didn't really get into it, because I read an article and concluded that it's just another PayPal. </p><p>Well, it must have been a bad article. </p><p>In April 2017 I heard a talk at a conference about Bitcoin and open blockchains and their future impact on society and technology. This time, I was open and ready to learn something new. I had been an online entrepreneur and web designer for 20 years and was looking for new interesting topics as a basis for my work. I immediately understood that an uncensorable, collaborative, permissionless and open protocol to send value is a tool that can provide a level playing field for anyone globally. </p><p>I was definitely not able to verbalize this back then, because I had no clue how Bitcoin works, but my life experiences and my insights as a builder of online shops and marketplaces acted as some sort of internal compass to sense the groundbreaking importance of Bitcoin. This time, I wanted to be part of the development and decided to put all my efforts into understanding and learning to become a Bitcoin educator myself.</p><p><strong>How do you see Bitcoin positively impacting youth in the countries you serve; Ghana, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I have been working with my initiative, Bitcoin For Fairness, and from what I've learned, many young people realize how Bitcoin gives them a choice, an opportunity to participate in a global economy, to become free from financial oppression and lack of access to financial means in their home countries. </p><p>Take the people who live in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ekasi-township-one-year-later">Bitcoin Ekasi</a>, for instance. I visited and worked with them in May 2022. Bitcoin Ekasi is a township in Mossel Bay, South Africa, where 11 shops and a taxi driver are accepting bitcoin now after being onboarded by community members. Many of the 5,000 inhabitants have no access to bank accounts or chose to unbank themselves <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-enforces-universal-human-rights">because of the high fees and bureaucracy</a>. Young people living in the township are supporting their community with knowledge and practical education on how they can facilitate Bitcoin. </p><p>The coaches there earn their salaries in bitcoin and spend it in the local shops. Recently, yet another shop asked to be added to the Bitcoin economy because of the high grade of security that bitcoin offers compared to keeping cash. A few months ago, the neighborhood's supermarket, Pick n Pay, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/pick-n-pay-now-accepts-bitcoin">started accepting bitcoin</a>, too. That means the shop owners can use their earned bitcoin to restock their shops without the need to convert to the national currency, which saves fees and hassle.</p><p>A growing number of young people see how they can earn bitcoin through content creation, like on our BTC podcasting platform. It's free to host a podcast without losing your copyright (like on Anchor) and, at the same time, anyone can start earning bitcoin via <a href="https://value4value.info/">Value4Value podcasting</a> without the need to run their own Lightning nodes. </p><p>Value4Value means that the listeners can freely decide how many bitcoin, if any, they want to send to the host while listening to a podcast. As a podcaster myself, I saw the need for a platform that is not charging around $10 per month for podcast hosting, because it excludes many people from sharing their voices from the ground. </p><p>During my travels, especially to Ghana speaking at the first <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/africa-bitcoin-conference-starts-december-5">Pan-African Bitcoin conference</a>, it was amazing to meet and witness how many young people are starting educational groups, for instance, the Bitcoin Cowries in Accra, Bitcoin Mountain in Cameroon or the women-focused Bitcoin Dada in Kenya. I’m currently working on an online mentorship program called “Crack The Orange” for newbies and community leaders to gain a wider understanding of Bitcoin to share it with their community members. With my non-profit initiative, Bitcoin For Fairness, we’re supporting young women to create their own educational group in Zambia.</p><p>The four African founders of Qala, a program designed to train the next generation of African Bitcoin and Lightning developers, are inspiring, visionary young people themselves. All these initiatives contribute to job and wealth creation and will have a positive network effect on the ground.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you (such as close friends, etc.)?</strong></p><p>In the last few years, I have been trying to educate the naysayers on Twitter or other media platforms with arguments, facts and by sharing experiences of African and South American Bitcoin users on my podcast “The Anita Posch Show.” </p><p>I realized it's not easily possible to win an argument if the respondent has made up their mind already. Every answer you give will be opposed with opinions and their own perception. I never tried to convince anyone. If people show up and are interested in the topic, I'll explain and support. If not, then I won't touch the topic. The same is true for my friends. Most of them have their own ideas about Bitcoin, and don't take the time or interest to learn. A handful of my close friends have sought my guidance and done the work. I think they are very content today.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>At first, let the numbers speak. Of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-enforces-universal-human-rights">1.7 billion unbanked people around the world</a>, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1645254782263910400">57% are women</a>.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20221016">American Economic Association</a>:</p><p>"In the USA alone approximately 8.4 million US households are unbanked with an additional 24.2 million US households classified as underbanked. Black women are significantly more likely than Black men or any other group to be unbanked or to be underbanked. Further, we find limited wealth is more frequently cited by Black women as the main reason why they do not engage with the banking system."</p><p>And according to <a href="https://www.wtwco.com/en-AE/insights/2022/11/2022-global-gender-wealth-equity-report#:~:text=New%20flagship%20research%20from%20WTW,to%20our%20Wealth%20Equity%20Index">WTW</a>:</p><p>"There is a significant gender wealth gap between men and women at retirement. Upon retirement women globally are expected to accumulate only 74% of the wealth that men have.”</p><p>Seventy-five economies globally “still <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/where-world-do-women-still-face-legal-barriers-own-and-administer-assets">limit women’s rights</a> to manage assets.” There are countries in which women are not allowed to own property or inherit it — they never will be owners of land that could be used as a security to apply for a loan or support their informal businesses. This is occurring mostly in countries in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>While women have been getting the same rights in many societies in recent decades, in general, women are still facing massive discrimination on the basis of gender. This inequality leads to exclusion from the financial system, because of a lack of wealth or because women can't produce an ID, which is necessary to be banked. </p><p>Bitcoin is fair in so far as it does not discriminate. Anyone can use it without the need to show an ID or the need to be wealthy already. There is no minimum limit to use bitcoin. Anyone can earn bitcoin through their work. Earning bitcoin will become the standard. </p><p>By educating women and girls about Bitcoin, we can support them in closing the gender wealth gap, when we factor in that Bitcoin's value has only appreciated in the long term. Nonetheless Bitcoin can be only one tool, it won't magically close the wealth gap, because men have more resources now, that's why they can earn or buy more bitcoin as well. That's why it's imperative to educate women and girls as early as possible as long as bitcoin is in its infancy, hence bringing education to the Global South especially for women, the queer community and human rights activists, is a strong focus of Bitcoin For Fairness.</p><p><strong>With the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/peer-to-peer-bitcoin-exchange-paxful-suspends-marketplace">recent closure</a> of peer-to-peer (P2P) platform Paxful, what other options for buying and selling bitcoin have you found to be successful in countries where there are no centralized exchanges?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are several other P2P options to buy and sell bitcoin without the need to show your ID, which is an important privacy protection. They may not be accessible globally, that's why real, on-the-ground, peer-to-peer exchange is the number one option in African countries. Another option are bitcoin vouchers or gift cards. And the best is to earn bitcoin, by either asking your employer or clients to pay you in bitcoin or creating valuable online content like a podcast or other media.</p><p>But a list of P2P exchange projects that I have found to be successful includes:</p><ul><li>Hodl Hodl</li><li>Bisq</li><li>AgoraDesk</li><li>RoboSats</li><li>Peach Bitcoin</li><li>Noones</li></ul><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Hongumart, a frontline healthcare worker who resides in rural Midwestern America.</em></p><p>Rural America is not a monolithic entity, but rather a diverse and dynamic region that encompasses different landscapes, climates and cultures. Some rural areas are more prosperous and developed than others, depending on factors such as natural resources, infrastructure and industry. Some rural areas are more conservative and religious than others, depending on factors such as history, ethnicity and immigration. Some rural areas are more connected and integrated with urban areas than others, depending on factors such as distance, transportation and communication. </p><p>Growing up in rural America is not better or worse than growing up in urban or suburban areas. It is simply different. Each environment has its own advantages and disadvantages that shape one's life experiences and outcomes. The important thing is to appreciate the diversity and richness of rural America, and if you can do that, you will recognize the potential contributions that Bitcoin can bring to this region in particular. </p><p>Bitcoin's appeal lies in its ability to provide financial freedom, privacy and innovation to its users. Bitcoin also embodies some of the values that rural America cherishes, such as independence, self-reliance and entrepreneurship. Many rural Americans have embraced Bitcoin as a way to participate in the global economy, hedge against inflation and diversify their income sources. </p><p>Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme or a magic solution to all problems. It is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to transform the world of money and finance. But it also requires education, innovation and adoption to reach its full potential. Bitcoin will have truly made it when small-town America understands what it really is: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that empowers people to be their own banks. </p><h2>Bitcoin Mining Is Ideal For Rural America</h2><p>In fact, some of the largest and most advanced bitcoin mining facilities are located in rural areas of the U.S., particularly in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-firm-blockcap-moves-headquarters-to-texas-as-state-embraces-bitcoin">Texas</a> and the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wyoming-aiming-5-bitcoin-mining-hashrate">Mountain West region</a>. Bitcoin mining requires a lot of cheap and reliable electricity, which rural areas can provide thanks to their abundant natural resources, deregulated power markets and low population densities. Bitcoin mining also creates jobs, tax revenues and economic development for rural communities that may otherwise struggle to attract investment and innovation. </p><p>Bitcoin mining is not only a profitable business, but also a way to support the Bitcoin network and its ideals. By mining bitcoin, rural Americans are contributing to the security, decentralization and resilience of the cryptocurrency that best encompasses their values.</p><h2>Bitcoin Can Boost Small-Town America</h2><p>Bitcoin can benefit small-town America in many other ways as well. Here are some examples: </p><ul><li>Bitcoin can help small businesses compete and grow by lowering their costs and increasing their customer bases. Small businesses can accept bitcoin as a payment option and attract more customers who prefer to use digital currencies. They can also save money on fees by using bitcoin instead of credit cards.</li><li>Bitcoin can help farmers and producers sell their products directly to consumers without intermediaries or middlemen. Farmers and producers can use bitcoin to create their own marketplaces and set their own prices. They can also use bitcoin to track and verify the quality and origin of their products, enhancing their reputations and trustworthiness. </li><li>Bitcoin can help local communities fund their own projects and initiatives without depending on external sources or authorities. Local communities can use bitcoin to raise money for causes they care about, such as education, healthcare or infrastructure. They can also use bitcoin to reward volunteers or contributors who participate in their efforts. </li><li>Bitcoin can help individuals achieve financial freedom and independence by giving them access to an open, global financial system. Individuals can use bitcoin to save money for their future goals, such as buying a house, starting a business or retiring early.</li></ul><p>Of course, there are perceived challenges and risks involved in using bitcoin, such as price volatility, security, regulation and education. But these challenges can be overcome with time and effort, and that the benefits outweigh the costs. </p><p>Bitcoin is a benefit for rural America because it offers a decentralized and secure way of storing and transferring value. Unlike traditional financial institutions, bitcoin does not require physical infrastructure, intermediaries or fees. This makes it accessible and affordable for rural communities that may lack banking services or face high transaction costs. Bitcoin also empowers rural Americans to participate in the global economy and have more control over their own money. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Hongumart.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Luke Groom, a civil engineer, JD-MBA student and part-time strategy associate with Marathon Digital Holdings.</em></p><p>In the last couple of years, Jordan Peterson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZ60RbA0jI">has been diving down the sound money rabbit hole</a>, and for me it’s been a pleasure to watch from a distance. So many of the values he espouses align with the values that Bitcoin encourages, such as personal responsibility and a search for truth, so it was only a matter of time before he became interested in Bitcoin. </p><p>He has spoken with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXvQcuIb5rU&amp;t=6s"> Saefidean Ammous</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQlA-I7PXf0&amp;t=6671s"> Robert Breedlove</a> in recent years and, even as a non-Bitcoiner per se,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvpXn-Iki8o"> captivated the audience</a> at the Bitcoin conference in Miami in 2022. A<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHu5h26c4nc"> more recent conversation with Roy Sebag</a> was also enjoyable to listen to, though it illustrated for me the need to discuss the differences between gold and bitcoin, not just their properties as monetary units, but also the properties of their ledgers.</p><p>To be sure, gold bugs such as Sebag and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schiff">Peter Schiff</a> share many beliefs with Bitcoiners. I respect them and their work. There is a lot of overlap in the problems and solutions that both gold bugs and Bitcoiners address. But the arguments for bitcoin as a superior unit of account have been discussed at length. </p><h2>The Fact That Gold Has Other Tangible Uses Isn’t Relevant For Global Money</h2><p>Sebag and Schiff argue that gold is valuable, in part, because it has other uses such as in cell phone parts and dentistry, whereas bitcoin has no other uses. This is true; however, I am not sure how this is relevant. </p><p>Why do we need our money to have other features besides just being money? Where is that written? If the monetary premium for gold disappeared, and it was only used for its other tangible purposes, gold’s price would utterly collapse. Furthermore, if gold became the global unit of account as gold bugs want it to, gold would be used even less for nonmonetary purposes due to cost limitations. Its monetary premium would increase, thereby weakening their own argument about having other valuable uses. </p><p>A monetary unit need only have good monetary properties and interact well with its ledger. As the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money.asp">generally accepted properties of money dictate</a>, an ideal monetary unit would be portable, durable, accepted, scarce, fungible, divisible and resistant to counterfeiting.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As a unit, bitcoin is equal or superior to gold in all of these features, with the exception of acceptability. <a href="https://8marketcap.com/">(Gold’s market cap is still roughly 20-times that of Bitcoin’s</a>, meaning it is still more widely accepted.) Talking about the units, however, is only a fraction of the conversation. We must also look at the ledger.</p><h2>The Bitcoin Ledger Is Superior</h2><p>Our modern society requires the use of ledgers to transact money. Moving physical dollars or physical gold around the world is simply too costly, dangerous and logistically challenging. Instead, we rely on the ledgers of credit card companies, banks and central banks to facilitate the “movement” of money. Our whole system, except the relatively few physical dollars in existence, is a system of entirely ledger-based money.</p><p>Because ledgers have become necessary in modern commerce, and because no one is advocating a return to society in which all commerce is conducted exclusively by in-person exchanges of money, when analyzing monetary systems, we must not only look at the units on our ledgers but also the ledgers themselves. Bitcoin’s properties as a ledger are what make it a far superior monetary system to anything in existence.</p><p>If we were to think of the properties that make up an ideal ledger, they would be: reliable, unattackable, verifiable, global, accessible, trustworthy and able to provide fast final settlement. While the sound money properties of gold versus those of bitcoin were relatively close when considering the units behind the ledger, when comparing the ledgers themselves, Bitcoin is far superior.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>From a monetary unit perspective, Bitcoiners and gold bugs agree that a gold-based system could encourage monetary responsibility and limit inflation. However, gold bugs have not provided any prevalent suggestions to improve the U.S. dollar ledger system. That current system is flawed in that it is unverifiable for individuals, inaccessible for individuals to interact with directly, and slow to process final settlement. How would a gold-based ledger be any better? </p><p>Furthermore, the gold bugs have not provided any meaningful suggestions about how to avoid the problems of debasement, which have been a constant for centuries.</p><p>We have already run the experiment of a gold-based ledger over the past 800 years. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medici_Bank">Medici family</a> popularized the ledger-based-gold-backed-banking in Italy and throughout Europe as early as the 12th and 13th centuries. Europeans, in effect, used ledgers to “transfer” their gold great distances. People and governments continued to use the system of overlapping ledgers backed by gold for centuries and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/money/The-decline-of-gold">each of those countries</a> saw a corruption of the ledger, the failure of their currency or the <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/gold-price-history-3305646">debasement of gold</a>. So, what mechanisms do gold bugs suggest to avoid the corruption and debasement of a gold-based ledger in the future? I have not heard any.</p><p>Bitcoin is beautiful in that it provides an elegant solution to both the unit and the ledger. The unit provides all of the characteristics of sound money and the ledger is reliable, unattackable, verifiable, global, accessible, provides fast final settlement and is trustworthy. An individual can personally interact with the ledger and provide verified final settlement across the globe in a matter of minutes on a ledger that doesn’t require a trusted intermediary.</p><p>I have a lot of respect for gold bugs, and even own a modest amount of gold myself. With that respect in mind, I ask Peterson, Sebag, Schiff and the other gold bugs, when comparing monetary systems, to analyze both the unit and the ledger, then come to their own conclusions.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Luke Groom.

    </figure><p>Hyperbitcoinization is a future that all Bitcoiners hope to witness. It is defined via the <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/">Nakamoto Institute</a> as “a voluntary transition from an inferior currency to a superior one, and its adoption is a series of individual acts…” </p><p>But who are the individuals who must act to transition from using a given currency to using Bitcoin? I submit that today’s Gen Z college students will play a major role in that transition. Unfortunately, most of them are not following Bitcoin threads on Twitter, nor are they reading articles about the latest developments in monetary policy. Yet, they are the future leaders of our country and the world and possess the power to influence policy. It is crucial that we find a way to reach them and educate them about Bitcoin.</p><p>That’s why, as a passionate Bitcoin enthusiast, I am determined to make a difference and introduce this revolutionary freedom technology to college students. For me, making a difference means investing my time to impact, however slightly, those who have not yet joined the Bitcoin ranks. In this article, I share my experience and lessons learned with a recent example. My conclusion is we are empowered, obligated even, to make a difference in sharing Bitcoin with the young people in our lives.</p><h2>Visiting My Daughter With A Bitcoin Game In Hand</h2><p>I recently traveled to visit my oldest child at her college. Thankfully, she has a healthy friend group that shares traditional and respectful values. They’re good, salt-of-the-earth kids who just so happen to know nothing about Bitcoin. My perfect audience!</p><p>I arrived armed with nothing but my passion and a Bitcoin board game that I created with my husband, HODL UP. For the next two hours, I sat on a cold, hard, dorm-room floor playing the game with six students. My goal: to spark their curiosity about Bitcoin in a fun way. These students major in business, environmental science, mathematics and psychology. While they had all heard about Bitcoin through media headlines, they had no real knowledge of what it is and how it works, or even why it's important.</p><p>Explaining the game to them was fast and easy. They had no questions about Bitcoin. They just wanted to know how to play the game. So, I spent no time explaining the parts of the game and what they meant in real life. I simply told them each player’s options at each turn. The game began and the students picked up the pace quickly. </p><p>As the game progressed, the students shared friendly smack talk as they attacked and defended their play bitcoin. The room echoed with their laughter and it warmed my heart. At the same time, however, I was itching for them, any of them, to ask me anything about what they were experiencing in the game: the difficulty adjustment, the halving, the hot and cold wallets, anything. It was hard to hold my tongue and not spoil the fun.</p><p>The game ended with a three-way tie and a close fourth place. All the students had wide beaming smiles on their faces as they high-fived each other and celebrated. Then they began to help me pack up the game pieces. As the last piece was put back in the box, I was feeling anxious that <em>still</em>, no one had asked me any questions. “Oh my gosh, is someone going to ask me something?” I thought. “Somebody ask me something!”</p><h2>Now We’re Getting Somewhere</h2><p>The students all exclaimed that the game was super fun and thanked me for sharing it. </p><p>"Great, I’m glad you enjoyed it," I smiled and answered, but inwardly, I shouted: “Ask me something about Bitcoin!”</p><p>Nope!</p><p>Unable to contain myself any longer, I asked them, "Does anyone have any questions about the game?" </p><p>No response.</p><p>One more try: "Does anyone understand why Bitcoin has a difficulty adjustment?" </p><p>"What?” one student responded. “That was real?" </p><p>"Yes, everything in this game has something to do with how Bitcoin works in real life," I answered. "What did you learn about the hot and cold wallets? What's your best practice?"</p><p>One student answered, "Well, I learned that I should keep some money in cold but some in hot so I can make educated investments." </p><p>“What?” I thought. </p><p>"What do you think the hot and cold wallets represent?" I asked them.</p><p>A different student answered, "Liquid and non-liquid assets."</p><p>“Oh, now we're getting somewhere,” I thought. I clarified what cold storage really is and the importance of keeping their private keys offline. </p><p>Then I asked, “If you have a dollar and shoved it in your pocket, how can someone steal it without touching it?”</p><p>Without hesitation, one of the students replied, “Through money printing.” </p><p>I then explained that one of the best features of Bitcoin is that there will only ever be 21 million BTC, no more. No matter how much someone justifies needing more, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin with a scheduled release that is managed through halving events.</p><p>It was tough not to sound preachy. I wrapped up by telling the environmental science student how Bitcoin uses wasted energy, making it productive, and forwarded a couple of articles to him. I also gave a few book recommendations to the business student who said he wanted to read up on Bitcoin over the summer.</p><p>As I was driving home, I replayed the evening in my mind and wondered if I'd made any difference at all. Then I received a text from one of the students. He thanked me for the opportunity to play HODL UP. "It was rather insightful," he said.</p><p>“Insightful? ‘Insightful’ is good,” I thought. “I’ll take ‘insightful.’”</p><p>“I'm just there to plant a seed,” I reminded myself. Instead of focusing on trying to orange pill someone, I'm just planting a seed. In time, life and circumstances will water the seed and, hopefully, one day the person will find themselves sliding down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. But I can't insist on seeing the fruit of the seed as soon as I plant the seed. That feeds my ego but is the wrong focus for what I'm doing and will place an unnecessary and unhelpful strain on my interactions with students.</p><p>So, going forward, here are three things I plan to keep in mind and that I recommend to parents, grandparents and teachers in sharing Bitcoin with young adults:</p><ol><li>Warm up the audience and create positive association — it was infinitely easier to gain the students’ attention in discussing Bitcoin after they've associated a fun experience with Bitcoin than if I went in cold. Hence, the game first.</li><li>Focus on a good time, not on teaching the nitty gritty — keep things simple and light. Explain only as necessary or if asked and avoid <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Soap%20Box%20Syndrome">soap box syndrome</a>.</li><li>Remember, we are just planting the seed. Everyone comes to Bitcoin when they are ready. We must keep a low time preference perspective.</li></ol><p>On to the next! Game on!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tali Lindberg.

    </figure><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/foundation-devices-launches-new-bitcoin-hardware-wallet">Passport Batch 2</a> is the second-generation Bitcoin hardware wallet from <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>. Passport is built in the U.S., air gapped and utilizes open-source code. In this guide, you will see how simple self custody can be with a device like this, the differences between the Founder’s Edition and Batch 2 of the wallet and a walkthrough of select, advanced features.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIyODA0OTczMjMzNDcx/unboxing09.jpg" height="467" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>Self Custody Made Simple</h2><p>“Self custody” means that you are in control of your private keys: this is how you maintain unrestricted access to your bitcoin. By extension, unrestricted access to your bitcoin means that you can send or receive bitcoin with anyone in the world for any reason at any time. You don't need anyone's permission, you won't be held against any financial institution's moral standards and nobody can stop you from making the transactions that you want to make. </p><p>With great power comes great responsibility, however, and self custody also means that you are taking radical responsibility for your bitcoin. You and you alone are responsible for managing your private keys in a way that allows you to access them, but not your adversaries. There is no 1-800 help line, there is no reversing of transactions and there is no one who can help you recover lost or forgotten information. This may sound intimidating or complicated, but tools like Foundation's Passport make self custody very simple and relatively easy to manage. </p><p>Passport makes it possible to self custody your bitcoin on a cold-storage device; this way, your private key is kept on a device that never makes a connection to the internet. Through the use of QR codes to sign transactions and the accompanying Envoy app, using the Passport to receive, secure and send bitcoin is easy and intuitive, even without an internet connection directly to the device. </p><h2>Unboxing</h2><p>Passport is shipped in a nondescript white box. There will be a shipping label (peeled off for privacy reasons in this demonstration) and a blue, tamper-evident seal on the outside of the box. The tamper-evident seal will be placed over the opening flap of the box and the seal will have a number on it that starts with “B799,” “B862” or “B863.” The full-length unique numbers are not saved by Foundation Devices, but the prefix is used to identify the production batch that the device was manufactured in. You can find a maintained list of these prefixes <a href="https://docs.foundationdevices.com/passport/setup">here</a>.</p><p><em>Privacy tip: Consider using a P.O. Box and an alias to avoid connecting your personally-identifiable information to Bitcoin-related items.</em></p><p><em>Security Tip: If the security seal shows any signs of tampering, contact </em><a href="mailto:hello@foundationdevices.com"><em>hello@foundationdevices.com</em></a><em>.</em></p><section><figure>

This app is available for iPhone or Android and enables a secure, guided setup experience for your Passport. While it makes for a convenient companion app, it is not required to use the Passport. You can use any wallet you want to monitor balances, build transactions or generate receive addresses. </p><p>With Envoy, you can also install the latest firmware updates from your mobile device using the included micro SD adapters. The security validation to ensure that your Passport has not been tampered with in transit can also be completed from the Envoy app. There is a beginner-friendly Bitcoin wallet built into Envoy that enables you to easily receive bitcoin to your Passport. You can also create transactions in Envoy, ready to sign with your Passport using the QR code communications, all while your private keys remain secured on the Passport. Envoy connects to the internet via <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> by default. </p><p>This guide will cover how to download Envoy from the F-Droid repository on an Android mobile device. The cool thing about F-Droid is that you can get apps from it without the need for a Google Play store account. The <a href="https://f-droid.org/docs/Security_Model/">F-Droid security model</a> enforces that all apps have a valid signature over the entire contents of the Android package (APK file), so you know you are getting the app intended for you by the developers who control the signing key of the repository you are using. </p><ul><li>With your mobile device, scan the QR code on the included notecard and it will take you to the Foundation Devices start page. </li><li>Click on the device you are setting up. In this case, Passport Batch 2.</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><h2>PIN Code</h2><p>A PIN code on the Passport can be between six digits and 12 digits in length. Using a PIN that is easy to guess is not recommended. There is no way to recover a lost PIN. In the event that an incorrect PIN is entered into the Passport Batch 2 21 times, the device will self destruct and become permanently useless. If that occurs, your bitcoin is still safe, so long as you have your seed phrase (covered in the next section), it just means the device itself is ruined.</p><p>You can also enable security words which add a layer of protection in the event that your device is ever tampered with. If you enable security words, you will enter your PIN in two parts, a prefix and suffix. After entering the prefix, you will be presented with two English words, for example "moment auction." Because of the way that these words are generated, if anything has been tampered with on your Passport hardware or software, then these words will be different than the ones you were expecting. If the words are the ones you were expecting, then you enter your PIN suffix and complete the login process. </p><ul><li>On the Envoy app, you can just select “Continue” when you see the prompt to enter a six- to 12-digit PIN. The actual PIN setup will be carried out on the Passport.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><p>Next time you turn on your Passport, you should be prompted for your PIN before being able to use the device. </p><h2>Seed Phrase</h2><p>The seed phrase is a human-readable representation of the initial entropy used to generate your Bitcoin private keys. Most commonly, seed phrases will be a list of 12 or 24 words. Backing up your seed phrase in a safe and secure way will enable you to access your bitcoin in the event your wallet is lost, stolen, destroyed, etc. So long as you have your seed phrase, you have access to your bitcoin. That also means that anyone else who gains access to your seed phrase has access to your bitcoin. </p><p>Take precautions to ensure you save your seed phrase in a safe and secure way. There are several methods, ranging from encrypted micro SD cards, to paper backups, to <a href="https://econoalchemist.github.io/SeedSigner/05_Seed-Backup.html">QR codes</a> to <a href="https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/the-domino-bitcoin-steel-plate-backup">steel plates</a> or <a href="https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/backup">washers</a>. Whichever method you choose, your seed phrase will work with a wide range of Bitcoin wallets. Many industry participants have implemented the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP39</a> standard, which defines how seed phrases work. This allows users to recover their bitcoin on a number of mobile, desktop or hardware wallets, regardless of which wallet they used to generate the seed phrase. Taking a picture or screenshot of your seed phrase is not recommended. </p><ul><li>Picking up where you left off, you will probably be at the prompt on your Passport asking you to upgrade the firmware. Since the Passport has not been connected to the Envoy app yet, this step will be skipped at this point and will be revisited after the seed phrase is created. You can update the firmware using the micro SD card at this point if you would like to do so before continuing on to create your seed phrase. </li><li>If you skipped the firmware update for now, then select “Create New Seed” on the Passport. </li><li>You will be asked if you want to generate a new seed phrase now, select the check mark. </li><li>You should see the Passport save the seed and then you will be notified that the new seed has been created and saved.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><ul><li>Next, Passport will create an encrypted backup of your seed phrase and prepare to save it to the included micro SD card. Select the “&gt;” arrow.</li><li>Part of having an encrypted backup is having the code to decrypt it. Passport will generate this code and it will be required to to open your backup file in the future. Select the “&gt;” arrow. </li><li>Your Passport came with a perforated notecard, — on one side of the perforation is space to write down your seed words and, on the other side, is space to write down your code for the encrypted backup. Foundation recommends writing down the backup code on this notecard and it is considered a safe procedure because physical access to the micro SD card is required. Consider storing the notecard and the microSD card in separate locations. Select the “&gt;” arrow. </li></ul><p><em>For a more in-depth article on encrypted backups, check out </em><a href="https://foundationdevices.com/2023/01/why-we-love-encrypted-microsd-backups/"><em>this</em></a><em> resource.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>Now you have an encrypted backup of your seed phrase to keep safe and secure in case you need to recover your wallet on another Passport in the future. Ensure that you keep the backup code safe and secure as well because it is required to decrypt your backup. The encrypted backup also includes all device settings, accounts, account labels, etc. You can see all of the details <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/2023/01/why-we-love-encrypted-microsd-backups/">here</a>. </p><p>Storing the micro SD card and the backup code in the same location kind of defeats the purpose, since if they are found then an adversary could steal your bitcoin. If you want to save a plain-text copy of your seed phrase so that you have the option to recover your wallet using the BIP39 word entry on a number of other wallets, you can fill it in on the included notecard as well. </p><ul><li>From the Passport home screen, navigate to the left for the settings menu. Then navigate to “Advanced,” then “View Seed Words” and then acknowledge the warning prompting that you are about to display sensitive information. </li></ul><h2>Connecting To Envoy</h2><p>Having your Passport connected to your Envoy app enables you to retrieve the latest firmware, watch your account balances, connect to your own instance of an Electrum server, communicate over Tor and more. Your private key information never leaves the Passport, only the public information is shared with the Envoy app so that it can calculate receive addresses and monitor balances. </p><ul><li>On your mobile device, in the Envoy app, select “Connect an existing Passport.” </li><li>On the next screen, select “Get Started.” </li><li>On the next screen, select “Continue” and then your mobile device's camera should be initiated.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><h2>Firmware</h2><p>Keeping the firmware up to date ensures that your Passport has the latest bug fixes, improvements, features and security patches. However, updating the firmware is not mandatory, your Passport will still work but just won't have any updates. </p><p>There are a few different ways to get the latest firmware, from the Foundation <a href="https://docs.foundationdevices.com/firmware-update">website</a>, from its <a href="https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport-firmware">GitHub repository</a> or from the Envoy app. This guide will demonstrate the Envoy app method. </p><p>As a security precaution, the Passport will only install firmware signed by two out of four possible Foundation developer keys. Whichever method you choose, you will be saving the firmware file to the micro SD card and loading the update onto your Passport from there. This helps keep the device air gapped. </p><p>Make sure you have your micro SD card and included adaptor ready to plug into your mobile device. Also, you can always double check which firmware version your Passport has currently installed when you power the device on, it will show the firmware version number at the bottom of the screen during boot up. </p><ul><li>Insert the micro SD card into the appropriate adaptor for your mobile device. </li><li>Insert the adaptor into your mobile device.</li><li>A blue light should start flashing on the adaptor.</li><li>Open the Envoy app, you should see the latest firmware version number in the lower right-hand corner of the Passport card on the home screen. Press that firmware version number. </li><li>On the next screen, press “Continue” to confirm you want to update the firmware. </li><li>On the next screen press “Continue” to confirm you have connected the micro SD card. </li><li>Then Envoy will ask you where you would like to save the firmware. Navigate to the micro SD card folder location. </li><li>Then press “Save.” Be sure to give your Android device a moment to finish writing to the micro SD card. If you have issues with the firmware file not being written in its entirety, delete the damaged file from the micro SD card, save the firmware file again, then after pressing “Save,” manually eject the micro SD card from the notifications drop-down menu to force Android to flush to disk. </li><li>That should save the firmware file to your micro SD card and bring you back to the Envoy app. Press “Finished” to return to the homepage.&nbsp;</li></ul><section><figure>

The lithium-ion battery has a much greater battery life and an industry standard form factor known as "BL-5C" and it can be obtained from many different online vendors for less than $10. Both Passports feature a removable magnetic back piece to quickly access the batteries.&nbsp;</p><section><figure>

    </figure><h3>Software</h3><p>Most of the menu options available on the Passport Founder’s Edition version 1.1.0 are also available on Passport Batch 2. Some of the folder configurations are a little different but most of the options are there with the exception of signing a text file. Passport Batch 2 also introduces extensions for Casa and Whirlpool, which add additional accounts in Passport that you can connect to. Both Passports can be connected to the Envoy app to make monitoring balances, generating receive addresses and building transactions easier. The next firmware release for the Founder’s Edition will be identical to the Batch 2 firmware. </p><p>This completes the comparisons section. In the next section, you will see how to use select features of the Passport. </p><h2>Passport And Whirlpool</h2><p>Whirlpool is a zero-link CoinJoin implementation supported by Samourai Wallet on Android mobile devices and by Sparrow Wallet on Linux, Mac and Windows desktops. Zero-link CoinJoin means that there are no deterministic links between the inputs and outputs of the CoinJoin transaction. Because multiple entities are involved with each CoinJoin, there cannot be any certainty as to which entity owns which transaction output. CoinJoins can be used as a technique to gain anonymity on a public blockchain, putting the decision to selectively reveal details about yourself back in your hands, thus giving you a layer of privacy separating your real-world identity from the transactions on a public ledger. </p><p>Passport supports Whirlpool accounts and this section will demonstrate how to setu p and use this feature on Bitcoin’s testnet. All the steps are the same for Bitcoin’s mainnet. There will be two wallets used in this demonstration; the first is Sparrow Wallet, acting as the hot wallet which is the wallet where the CoinJoin transactions will originate from, and the second is Passport, acting as the cold wallet where the outputs from the hot wallet CoinJoins will be deposited. </p><p>Using this technique offers a couple benefits. First, each deposit to the Passport will look like every other CoinJoin output to external observers on chain and, therefore, no one except for you will know that those unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are now in cold storage. So, as other CoinJoin participants continue mixing the other UTXOs from your CoinJoin transactions, the forward-looking anonymity set of your UTXOs in cold storage continues to grow. </p><p>Another benefit is that the Whirlpool account on Passport was designed in such a way that you can import it to a hot wallet at any time in the future and continue mixing those UTXOs as free-riders in Whirlpool, thus saving yourself from paying the coordinator fees a second time. Additionally, you won't pay any additional miners fees when importing this account to a hot wallet in the future as opposed to sweeping UTXOs. Understand, though, that importing the Whirlpool account to a hot wallet exposes the seed to an internet-connected device and therefore it is recommended to use a separate seed on your Passport for any accounts you plan on doing this with.</p><h3>Hot Wallet</h3><p>This guide assumes you have already installed Sparrow Wallet on your preferred desktop. If you haven't done so already, navigate to the <a href="https://www.sparrowwallet.com/download/">Sparrow download page</a> for detailed instructions. Consider your options for connecting to a public node, your own Bitcoin Core node or your own private Electrum server carefully. </p><p>Once you have your Sparrow Wallet application installed, open it and navigate to “File,” then “New Wallet”:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Next, you will have the opportunity to adjust a few settings. Unless you have a good reason to change these settings and you know exactly what you are doing, then it is probably a good idea to just leave the policy type, script type and script policy descriptor in their defaults, as demonstrated here. Then, click on “New or Imported Software Wallet”:</p><figure>

    </figure><div><em>View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/foundation-passport-bitcoin-wallet-guide">original article</a></em></div></section><p>You can add a passphrase or leave that field blank. This is kind of like having a 13th or 25th word added to your seed phrase that only you know. There is no way to recover a lost or forgotten passphrase and this will be necessary to access your bitcoin going forward if you decide to use it. </p><p>Make sure to write down your seed phrase words in order and keep them safe. Also write down your passphrase if you decided to use one. Consider keeping your seed phrase and passphrase separate from each other to help prevent loss of funds in the event that your secrets are discovered. Writing this information down in a notebook or stamping it into metal to protect it against environmental hazards are common ways that Bitcoiners keep their backups safe and secure. Anyone who gains access to this information will be able to steal your bitcoin, so make sure you keep it safe. Double checking your backup information is a good way to ensure you have copied it all down correctly. </p><p>Once you are ready, click on “Confirm Backup...,” then you will be asked if you have written this information down. When you click on “Re-enter Words…” you will then prove you have written your seed phrase down correctly by entering the words in order.</p><figure>

The first one is the deposit account where you will want to send bitcoin that you want to CoinJoin. From the deposit tab, you can click on the receive sub-tab to display a QR code for one of your receiving addresses and you can send bitcoin to it.</p><figure>

This transaction is called "tx0" and you will notice that all of the selected inputs of various sizes and from various addresses are consumed in this transaction and 20 like-sized outputs are created. These like-sized outputs from tx0 will be used as eligible inputs to Whirlpool CoinJoin transactions. There are three other outputs in a tx0 as well; the coordinator fee, the toxic change and the miners’ fee. If everything looks good, then click on “Broadcast Premix Transaction”:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>So long as your wallet is connected to the internet, then your available like-sized outputs in your premix account will be registered as eligible inputs for the coordinator to use in CoinJoin rounds. As more participants add liquidity, more of your premix outputs will be CoinJoined. After going through a CoinJoin round, each UTXO will appear in your post-mix account, which you can view from the post-mix tab and the transactions sub-tab. So long as you leave your wallet open and connected, the UTXOs in your post-mix account will remain available as eligible inputs to CoinJoin rounds as free-riders, where they get mixed again and again with no added fees to you:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The toxic change from tx0 is sent to your “badbank” account, which you can view from the badbank tab and transactions sub-tab. You want to be cautious about how you handle these outputs because they are linked on chain to any inputs used in the related tx0 they came from. For example, don't send some Whirlpool outputs and some toxic change to the same address because that would undo the anonymity benefits gained by using Whirlpool.</p><figure>

This will be the account you are sending your CoinJoined outputs to for long-term cold storage. Using a separate seed from your primary cold storage seed for this process is recommended. If you want to import it to a hot wallet at any time in the future and continue mixing those UTXOs as free-riders, it will expose the seed to an internet connected device.</p><ul><li>Power on your Passport and log into it.</li><li>From the main menu, navigate to “Extensions.”</li><li>Then toggle on “Postmix.”</li><li>With the right arrow control, navigate over to the newly-added post-mix account and scroll down to “Connect Wallet.”</li></ul><figure>

class="subtitle">When users search for $BTC on Twitter, they will now be able to invest into bitcoin via eToro.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>eToro has partnered with Twitter to allow users to invest into assets with $Cashtags, in addition to expanding the number of financial assets that users can see real-time prices for when using the feature. Currently users can see live price charts for a select few financial assets. After the eToro partnership, the list of $Cashtags that produce live price charts will be “hugely expanded,” according to a <a href="https://www.etoro.com/news-and-analysis/press-releases/etoro-partners-with-twitter-cashtags-to-further-financial-education/">press release</a>, while users will also be able to click through to the eToro platform to see more information on the asset and have the option to invest. The partnership will cover $Cashtags representing a wide range of instruments on the eToro platform, including Bitcoin.</p><p>Twitter added pricing data for $Cashtags in December 2022 and the feature has since seen widespread adoption with more than 420 million searches for $Cashtags since the start of the year, according to the press release. On average, the release says, there are 4.7 million $Cashtag searches a day with activity increasing around prominent earnings announcements. The most commonly used $Cashtag was $TSLA (Tesla), with $BTC (bitcoin) ranking in the top five.</p><p>Yoni Assia, CEO and co-founder of eToro, said, "Financial content on social media has provided education to many who have felt excluded by more traditional channels. Twitter has become a crucial part of the retail investing community — it’s where millions of ordinary investors go every day to access financial news, share knowledge and converse.”</p><p>"We believe real change starts with conversation and finance and investing is a growing part of that conversation,” said Chris Riedy, vice president, global sales and marketing at Twitter. “We are pleased to partner with eToro to provide Twitter users with additional market insights and greater access to investment capabilities. Twitter will continue to invest in growing the #FinTwitter community."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Policy UK Launches With Goal Of Capturing Bitcoin’s Opportunity For The UK]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin-focused policy group aims to educate policymakers on the benefits Bitcoin can provide.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-policy-uk-launches-with-aim-to-educate-policymakers</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-policy-uk-launches-with-aim-to-educate-policymakers</guid><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Policy]]></category><category><![CDATA[UK]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 16:59:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNTM3MTYyODg3OTk2OTY0/individual-challenge-climb-peak-flag-mountain-top-photo.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Bitcoin-focused policy group aims to educate policymakers on the benefits Bitcoin can provide.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin Policy UK has launched with the stated aim of unlocking the potential of Bitcoin for the UK economy. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, The organization seeks to unite diverse stakeholders, such as policymakers, environmentalists, businesses, energy producers and Bitcoin experts, to explore how Bitcoin can benefit UK households, businesses and communities. The ultimate goal, according to the release, is to attract investments to the UK, generate jobs and drive new industries while tapping into wasted and stranded energy resources.</p><p>According to co-founder Krista Edmunds, "The UK has an immense opportunity to become one of the first jurisdictions globally to embrace Bitcoin. We have seen what is possible in El Salvador, which is experiencing huge gains due to its forward-thinking approach to Bitcoin. The UK can secure a similar competitive advantage and we hope to support the British people in making that happen."</p><p>The organization's creation was inspired by The Bitcoin Collective's first Bitcoin-only conference in Edinburgh, where it identified the unique opportunity presented by Bitcoin's creation and global adoption. Bitcoin Policy UK is eager to collaborate with like-minded parties and work on initial projects, including responding to the UK government's call for evidence on industry regulation and CBDC proposals.</p><p>The organization is also launching two projects on the UK-founded Bitcoin fundraising platform, Geyser. Those interested in contributing to the projects can visit<a href="https://geyser.fund/profile/3519"> https://geyser.fund/profile/3519</a>. To become a member or support Bitcoin Policy UK's initiatives, registration is open on their website,<a href="https://bitcoinpolicy.uk/"> https://bitcoinpolicy.uk</a>, or by emailing contact@bitcoinpolicy.uk.</p><p>The launch of Bitcoin Policy UK marks the first Bitcoin-only policy organization in the UK.

    </figure><p>A new reference implementation (SRI) update for Stratum v2 has been announced by developers of the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the new update is “a major milestone in democratizing transaction selections in pooled mining and decentralizing bitcoin,” as it allows miners to select transactions via a new sub-protocol and their node.<br><br>The developers are inviting miners, pools, firmware makers and the community to test the new implementation using the <a href="https://stratumprotocol.org/getting-started/#config-d-sv1-firmware--translation-proxy-jn-job-negotiator--sv2-pool">getting starting guide</a> they’ve put together, with CPU or actual mining devices. They also invite users’ feedback after testing using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1is27h37PtsXtXC9zSbweNfxcyEtHzATjdJphIy8hArw/">this form</a>.</p><p>It is recommended that new users test the software using SV1 mining devices by connecting to an SV2 pool via Translation Proxy. “Miners will run their own template provider (bitcoind) with the max fee policy,” the release describes. “Within the translation proxy sits a Job Negotiator that runs a sub-protocol responsible for distributing miner’s templates to the pool.”</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIzMTI4MTY4OTMyNjcx/image1.png" height="714" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>“Configuration allows mining devices running SV1 firmware to connect to an SV2 pool, and select their transactions locally via the Template Provider, further sending them to the pool via the Job Negotiator.”</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>The press release describes how the Job Negotiator “in combination with a template provider, gives the responsibility back to miners or an independent third party to provide a new template (select transactions), thereby making bitcoin pool infrastructure more decentralized.”</p><p>According to the description of <a href="https://youtu.be/nOIAhRVCThs">how a Job Negotiator (JN) works</a>, the downstream mining farm runs a JN that connects to a JN run by the pool, and requests a unique identifier for mining jobs using the AllocateMiningJobToken message. The pool sends back a unique token and a coinbase output used for payouts. The downstream JN then connects to a template provider, which sends a new template and SetNewPrevHash to the downstream JN. With these, a new job can be constructed and the downstream JN sends a CommitMiningJob message containing a proposed set of transactions to the pool. The pool always accepts the miner's proposal in the current iteration, but in the next release, miners will have the ability to fall back to a different pool or solo mine if the pool fails to accept transactions selected by the downstream's template provider. The Translation Proxy then sends a SetCustomMiningJob message to the pool, which verifies the work and sends back a SetCustomMiningJobSuccess message. The Translation Proxy then translates the message and sends the mining.notify message to mining devices, which submit shares to the pool through the Translation Proxy.<br><br>With the current industry-adopted mining protocol Stratum V1, the handful of mining pools participates in transaction selection, which makes bitcoin more prone to <a href="https://youtu.be/tFAC04jMUbU">censorship</a>. Stratum v2 is an updated protocol, which ensures that transaction selection is done by miners themselves. </p><p>The community has already tested the software on several popular mining devices; the press release encourages anyone who tests on different platforms to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1is27h37PtsXtXC9zSbweNfxcyEtHzATjdJphIy8hArw/https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1is27h37PtsXtXC9zSbweNfxcyEtHzATjdJphIy8hArw/">fill a form out</a>.</p><p>“With the next update,” the press release says, “we will add a fallback functionality that would allow miners to fall back to a different pool or solo mine in case the pool chooses not to accept their suggestion. Miners would, in that case, disconnect and fall back.”</p><p>Other updates include the aim to improve encryption and ensure compliance with the latest spec updates, in addition to plans to enable pools to perform spot-checks on block validity. The most significant development will be submitting a pull request for the template provider in Bitcoin Core.</p><p>The developers thank the Stratum v2 <a href="https://opensats.org/projects/stratumv2">crowdfunding</a> supporters and include a link to their <a href="https://discord.gg/UHckbC7x58">Discord</a> for those interested in being involved in the community.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5MzcyOTEy/network-nodes.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIzMTI4MTY4OTMyNjcx/image1.png" height="714" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘A Better World Through Financial Freedom’: Why Preston Pysh Is Bullish On Bitcoin 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[For Preston Pysh, the Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami is a chance to showcase a solution for the crumbling global financial system.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/preston-pysh-is-bullish-on-bitcoin-2023</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/preston-pysh-is-bullish-on-bitcoin-2023</guid><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Freedom]]></category><category><![CDATA[preston pysh]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 13:52:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3MjIxODg3NzI4NjkwMjU5/preston-pyshbitcoin-2022.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">For Preston Pysh, the Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami is a chance to showcase a solution for the crumbling global financial system.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>As part of an investment-focused podcast that recently <a href="https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh/status/1586126918881275904">surpassed 100 million downloads</a>, Preston Pysh describes the basics of Bitcoin and explores its investment case, distilling some of the most prescient aspects of the technology for listeners who might not realize how important it is. He has a knack for hosting the most knowledgeable guests to break down the most pressing topics. </p><p>For instance, Pysh has released recent episodes describing Texas’ evolving Bitcoin mining policy with <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/bitcoin-is-a-strategic-national-necessity-pierre-rochard/">Pierre Rochard</a>, one exploring the state of the legacy financial system with <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/legacy-banking-system-alf-peccatiello/">Alf Peccatiello</a> and one explaining decentralized social media platform Nostr with developer <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/nostr-decentralized-social-media-william-casarin/">William Casarin</a>.</p><p>Pysh consistently hosts timely, in-depth conversations with insightful guests, producing one of the best outlets for exploring how Bitcoin is changing our world. Now, he’ll be bringing that insight to the stage at Bitcoin 2023, where his combination of traditional investment expertise and holistic understanding of Bitcoin’s implications will grapple with a global financial environment that seems to be spinning out of control.</p><p>“I suspect one of the hot topics that will be discussed is the central banks’ inability to get inflation under control and what that means for Bitcoin,” Pysh said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “It seems like OPEC+ and BRICS nations are trying to exercise their control of energy production and distribution in the face of western central bank policies that attempt to control interest rates and sanctions. I expect this situation to get really intense in the second and third quarters of 2023 and the knock-on effect is going to demonstrate the lack of control that policymakers have over the price of fiat currency.”</p><p>While such a precarious economic situation is wreaking havoc in the form of wealth debasement and uncertainty across the world, Pysh remains optimistic about bitcoin the asset as a solution and bullish about its path for 2023.</p><p>“Bitcoin’s long-term HODLers display a level of conviction I’ve rarely witnessed in any other asset class,” he explained. “As central bank policies grow increasingly manipulative, I anticipate that by the end of 2023, we’ll witness these institutions lose a degree of control, injecting an unprecedented volume of fiat currency into the global economy. Consequently, I expect bitcoin to thrive and yield substantial gains relative to any other asset class as the year draws to a close.”</p><p>Perspective on the technical advancements of Bitcoin and their implications, in addition to his well-demonstrated expertise on more traditional finance, is what makes Pysh such a unique and powerful advocate. And it is with this perspective that he highlighted the progress made with one project in particular since the Bitcoin 2022 event.</p><p>“Since the last conference, I am thrilled by the ongoing developments in the Bitcoin community, particularly those related to Fediments, or ‘Federated Mints,’” Pysh reflected. “These implementations operate with a federation of guardians to manage funds, rather than a centralized entity, and integrate seamlessly with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network… The impressive progress on this front has been made amid bitcoin price dips, demonstrating the ingenuity and unwavering commitment of the Bitcoin community in driving substantial software infrastructure development and other essential building blocks.”</p><p>Like Pysh’s podcast, the Bitcoin Conference is designed to showcase the most insightful voices on any and every front of this monetary, technical revolution. It is a place where problems are exposed and a foundational solution is explored. For Pysh, Bitcoin 2023 will be the chance to do what he does best as a content creator: discourse with the brightest minds on earth and help others learn from them as he does.</p><p>“These gatherings offer a chance to unite with individuals who share a profound understanding and appreciation for a better world through financial freedom and empowerment,” he concluded. “All of the panel discussions are thought provoking and important for my own personal growth. Not to mention, how can you not love Miami?”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3MjIxODg3NzI4NjkwMjU5/preston-pyshbitcoin-2022.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take It Easy, Man: The Philosophies Behind Bitcoin And ‘The Big Lebowski’]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dudeism, a philosophy inspired by “The Big Lebowski,” shares some core tenants that should intrigue Bitcoiners.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-the-big-lebowski-philosophy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-the-big-lebowski-philosophy</guid><category><![CDATA[religion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movie]]></category><category><![CDATA[philosophy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Taoism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hongumart]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5OTM5OTMwMzk3NDE5MjYy/guy-fawkes-zen-meditation-calm.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Dudeism, a philosophy inspired by “The Big Lebowski,” shares some core tenants that should intrigue Bitcoiners.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Hongumart, a frontline healthcare worker.</em></p><p>Inspired by The Dude, the main character of the 1998 movie “The Big Lebowski” by the Coen Brothers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudeism">Dudeism</a> is a way of life, philosophy and religion. The main goal of Dudeism is to apply a modern version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism">Taoism</a>, an ancient Chinese teaching attributed to Laozi (rising to prominence in the 6th century), combined with ideas from the Greek thinker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus">Epicurus</a> (who lived form 341 to 270 BC), in a manner that reflects the personality of Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski from the film. </p><p>Dudeism emphasized the practices of relaxing, keeping calm and taking it easy when faced with life's challenges, guided by a belief that this is the best way to live in harmony with ourselves and others. </p><p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network without relying on any intermediary or authority. It was created by an unknown person or group that used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. The main idea behind Bitcoin is to enable online payments that are direct, secure and independent of any financial institution. Bitcoin is the most popular and widely-used cryptocurrency in the world. It has inspired many other cryptocurrencies that offer different features or use cases. Bitcoin's value and adoption have fluctuated over time, depending on various factors such as regulation, innovation, competition and market sentiment. </p><p>Bitcoin and Dudeism are two seemingly unrelated phenomena, but they share some surprising similarities: </p><ul><li>Both are decentralized and operate peer to peer: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that operates without a central authority or intermediary, relying on a network of nodes to validate transactions and maintain consensus. Dudeism is a religion that rejects dogma and hierarchy, encouraging its followers to find their own paths and to live in harmony with themselves and others. </li><li>Both are inspired by cult movies: Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, which, by my estimation, could be a reference to the character Toshiro Mifune in the film “Yojimbo.” As noted above, Dudeism is based on the philosophy of the protagonist of “The Big Lebowski,” who embodies the principles of Taoism and Zen Buddhism. </li><li>Both are adaptable and resilient: Bitcoin is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for innovation and improvement through forks and upgrades. Dudeism is open to interpretation and integration, allowing for diversity and creativity among its adherents.</li><li>Both are countercultural and revolutionary: Bitcoin challenges the status quo of the traditional financial system, offering an alternative that is more transparent, democratic and inclusive. Dudeism challenges the norms of the modern society, offering a lifestyle that is more relaxed, authentic and peaceful. </li></ul><p>Dudeism and Bitcoin also share some similarities in their underlying principles and values. Both are inspired by ancient philosophies that emphasize simplicity, harmony and freedom. Both are also based on decentralized systems that do not rely on any external authority or intermediary. Both aim to provide alternatives to the conventional ways of living and transacting that are often seen as stressful, complicated and oppressive. Both also have a loyal and passionate community of followers who identify with their respective ethos and cultures. </p><p>These are just some of the similarities between Bitcoin and Dudeism. Perhaps they are not so different after all. Maybe they are both ways of abiding by the same universal truth: that nothing is fixed (except the bitcoin supply), everything flows and we should just take it easy, man.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Hongumart.

"Together, we are pursuing the goal of hyperbitcoinization," he added. The conference's previous lineup of speakers included Alex Gladstein, Bert and Peter Slagter, Stella Assange and Adam Back.</p><p>Sebastiaan van Erne, who is helping to organize Bitcoin Amsterdam, said the aim was to attract 150,000 visitors to Amsterdam over the next five years.

    </figure><p>Block’s <a href="https://www.tbd.website/">TBD</a>, a Bitcoin-focused developer platform, has partnered with <a href="https://yellowcard.io/">Yellow Card</a> to unlock a network of fiat on- and off-ramps and payments via Bitcoin in 16 African countries. This aims to make cross-border payments and liquidity exchanges more accessible and affordable, and provide compliant cross-border payments and fiat off-ramps, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Yellow Card will be a launch partner for the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jack-dorseys-tbd-presents-bitcoin-based-decentralized-web5">Web5</a> protocol and the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jack-dorsey-square-decentralized-bitcoin-exchange-proposal-announced-tbdex">tbDEX</a> liquidity network. </p><p>Currently, cross-border payments in Africa can incur fees of almost 10% and take several days to clear using available systems. In March 2023, TBD and Yellow Card conducted a successful proof of concept for payment rails from the U.S. to Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya, in real time. Senders can initiate remittances in USD, while recipients can receive local fiat currency into bank accounts or mobile money wallets, such as M-PESA and MTN. TBD converts the USD into Bitcoin or stablecoins and facilitates the exchange between digital assets and local fiat currencies.</p><p>Alternatively, recipients can opt to hold their value in Bitcoin or USD stablecoins, which is “particularly valuable if they live in regions impacted by local currency volatility or hyperinflation,” the press release describes. TBD's next goal is to establish decentralized identity, trust and transaction protocols that enable a ubiquity of decentralized and trusted exchanges to occur.</p><p>Yellow Card will be one of TBD’s first partners to enable global payments and fiat off-ramps for end consumers to send USD or Bitcoin and receive payments in local fiat currencies. TBD provides APIs and developer services that make it easy for app developers to embed functionality that enables these transactions to happen in real-time for their end consumers.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Katie The Russian, CEO of Plan B Passport.</em></p><p>It’s been almost two years since<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-declare-bitcoin-as-legal-tender"> the announcement that El Salvador would make bitcoin legal tender</a>. Since then, the government of El Salvador, led by President Nayib Bukele, has taken many more steps to attract capital to the country — offering <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-03-23/el-salvador-president-readies-bill-to-eliminate-taxes-on-tech">favorable tax policies, streamlining business regulations</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-one-year-later">generally developing a more positive reputation</a>.</p><p>But can El Salvador go even further and launch a citizenship by investment (CBI) program? </p><p>For those who don’t know, a CBI program allows capitalism to be applied to a government service. In this case, individuals can donate or invest money in the nation’s economy and, in return, they receive a passport for that nation.</p><h2>The Risks Of Running CBI Programs</h2><p>El Salvador definitely has the legal authority to operate a CBI program, however, launching one can potentially open up a can of worms that it would have to deal with. While leading the way in the Bitcoin revolution has earned it the respect of Bitcoiners, some groups, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, see El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption as a threat and have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-60135552">publicly expressed their concerns</a>. The same could be true for a CBI program.</p><p>El Salvador's passport is already powerful, providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to <a href="https://visaindex.com/country/el-salvador-passport-ranking/">about 150 countries</a>, including the EU, the U.K., all of Latin America and most of Eastern Europe. However, all of these relationships could be at risk if a CBI program causes concerns within the countries that have treaties with El Salvador. <br><br>Pressure from political allies has pushed previously-popular investment migration options, such as those in <a href="https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/cyprus-ends-citizenship-investment-program/">Cyprus</a>, <a href="https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/malta-citizenship-by-investment-changes/">Malta</a> and <a href="https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/portugal-golden-visa-changes/">Portugal</a>, to re-think their offerings. As a result, these countries missed unique opportunities to serve as pioneers and create fully-integrated, customer-centric instruments.</p><h2>What A CBI Program Could Mean For El Salvador</h2><p>Now, El Salvador has the opportunity to completely disrupt the CBI market. </p><p>If done right, the country could become the preferred choice among wealthy migrants who view themselves as sovereign individuals. If done well, it also presents the opportunity to orange pill a great deal of high-net-worth individuals globally.</p><p>El Salvador stands to lead the way in a new era of citizen-government relationships, where citizens are treated as customers and governments are treated as service providers. And, luckily for El Salvador, this isn’t the first time a CBI program has been done. For instance, some Caribbean islands that are leading the CBI industry provide insightful data. <br><br>Based on some publicly-available information I’ve accessed and my personal experience in the industry, the combined revenue from the CBI programs of Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia contributed about $2.5 billion for the region in 2022 alone.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that the populations of all of those islands combined is only 10% of the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">population of El Salvador</a>. </p><p>A similar CBI revenue would add more than 7% to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=SV">El Salvador’s GDP</a>.<br><br>But would there be demand for such a program, coming from a Latin American country? </p><p>At Plan B Passport, we have seen a large amount of requests about this specific jurisdiction, which is not a surprise, considering that we cater specifically to Bitcoiners and that there are multiple factors that bring this community’s attention to El Salvador. <br><br>Of course, the tax regime and regulatory environments for businesses are a top priority, however, a country’s political stance plays a huge role in a Bitcoiners’ decision making process as well.</p><p>El Salvador is perfectly positioned across all of these factors and its president is boldly <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1571250107500175362?lang=en">taking a stance against</a> the World Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) 2030 agenda of “<a href="https://twitter.com/wef/status/808328302213689344?lang=en">you will own nothing and be happy</a>.” The geographical location of El Salvador is also increasing the value of its passport. Unlike the Caribbeans, it’s not an island and it allows access by land while also allowing access by water. </p><h2>What Should El Salvador’s CBI Program Look Like?</h2><p>If the program is implemented correctly, El Salvador will win a lot of business over the Caribbean CBI options. Considering the similarities between the power of El Salvador’s passport and the countries where CBI programs currently exist, it would make sense to establish the pricing close to what the market currently offers. </p><p>To give you some examples:</p><ul><li>Saint Kitts currently requires a $125,000 donation for a single applicant, or a $200,000 investment for government-approved properties, or a $400,000 investment into any real estate. </li><li>Saint Lucia requires a $100,000 donation for a single applicant. </li></ul><p>And let me clarify: Families that apply together do not have to donate that amount per each family member, but rather, the main applicant applies with dependents.<br><br>As a CBI service provider, we’ve noticed there are many roadblocks that clients run into. Solving those would benefit El Salvador’s CBI in favor of existing CBIs.</p><h3>Proof Of Funds</h3><p>Leading the way in transitioning from traditional finance toward a better monetary system, El Salvador can offer the first CBI program to officially accept self-custodied bitcoin holdings as proof of funds. This can be done easily with a “signing a message” process to confirm ownership of BTC conducted by the applicant, but I have yet to succeed in explaining it to Caribbean CBI representatives.</p><h3>Payment Method</h3><p>El Salvador can also be the first jurisdiction to accept bitcoin directly for donation and bond investment options. Currently, CBI applicants have to utilize traditional financial assets to transfer funds. Some jurisdictions allow intermediaries, however, it will cost an applicant 5% conversion fees. <br><br>We ran a poll within Plan B passport email subscribers and got some interesting data around this. When it comes to payment methods, our audience indicated the following preferences:</p><ul><li>USDT: 6%</li><li>USD (via bank transfer): 9%</li><li>BTC: 37%</li><li>Any: 48%</li></ul><p>We also asked what investment options the audience would want to see:</p><ul><li>Real estate investment: 39%</li><li><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">Volcano bond</a>: 42%</li><li>Non-refundable donation: 19%</li></ul><h3>Additional Investment Options</h3><p>Of course, we’ve already heard about the volcano bonds, which would be the first bitcoin-denominated bond option to ever exist. Also, seeing Bukele make moves toward incentivizing tech companies to headquarter and incorporate in El Salvador reminds us of <a href="https://www.imidaily.com/editors-picks/armenian-govt-unveils-decision-to-offer-citizenship-for-150000-investment-in-property-bonds-shares-funds-and-more/">Armenia’s “golden visa,”</a> and this definitely puts the right motivations in place for investors. <br><br>For example, Armenia grants a golden visa to those who establish an IT business with a $1,000,000 capitalization or establish a venture capital firm with $80,000,000 in assets.</p><p>El Salvador could direct capital toward innovation by implementing such options into a CBI program.</p><h2>A CBI Program In Bitcoin Country</h2><p>Bitcoin enthusiasts also see CBI programs as ways to bring power back to the individual. These programs are seen as a form of pure capitalism applied to government services, allowing individuals to choose their "state service provider" based on the price and services offered, and take their funds with them. With competition between nation states for capital and talent on the rise, the mobility of capital and people has the potential to transform the way we think about citizenship and national identity, and CBI programs may be at the forefront of this transformation.<br><br>Allow me to remind you that throughout 2021 to 2023, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_in_El_Salvador">El Salvador’s government continuously purchased bitcoin</a> and put it on the country's balance sheet and, as of July 2022, it was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-buys-the-dip-adds-80-btc-to-treasury">holding 2,381 bitcoin</a>. Launching the CBI program could be yet another opportunity for the country to acquire more bitcoin.<br><br>While a CBI program could be a productive move for El Salvador, it is not without risks. However, with a powerful passport, favorable tax policies, a positive reputation and support from Bitcoin enthusiasts, El Salvador is well positioned to attract foreign investment and talent. If done correctly, a CBI program could be the next step in its transformation, bringing power back to the individual and changing the way we think about citizenship and national identity.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Katie The Russian.

    </figure><p>Developers are exploring the use of hierarchical channels to help speed up and make the Lightning Network (LN) more scalable. <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-March/003886.html">Hierarchical channels</a> allow for flexible off-chain resizing of channels, enabling quick and cheap resizing, without on-chain transactions which add delays and costs. In contrast, resizing channels on-chain can cause delays of several months and increases fees. The current proposals for resizing channels off-chain involve creating a channel factory or CoinPool and exchanging capacity between channels within the same factory or pool. Hierarchical channels allow for flexible off-chain resizing of channels without requiring an exchange of capacity within a limited pool of users. The hierarchical channels enable the creation of a two-party channel with two main outputs, one per party, plus zero or more Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) outputs.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Each output from a hierarchical channel funds another channel that can be viewed as the root of an off-chain tree of outputs where the leaves are owned by single users. The parties can use a hashed timelock contract (HTLC) to exchange bitcoin, linking their HTLC to HTLCs in other (potentially hierarchical) channels, thus making payments over the LN.</p><p>With hierarchical channels, developers are proposing to solve two problems. Firstly, it allows for flexible resizing, near-instantly and off-chain, which is similar to the Lightning Network’s aim of allowing for near-instant off-chain payments. Secondly, hierarchical channels could be used by casual users who can send and receive bitcoin in a watchtower-free manner while the dedicated users can use all of their channel capacity to route payments, even while the casual user is inactive. Hierarchical channels would enable casual users to operate in a watchtower-free manner without stranding any capital.</p><p>The implementation of hierarchical channels could help overcome one of the biggest limitations of the Lightning Network, which is its scalability. It is expected that hierarchical channels would provide the necessary support for efficient Lightning Network payments without introducing additional delays, adding costs, and limiting scalability. The development of hierarchical channels does not require any changes to the underlying Bitcoin protocol.</p><p>Developers are proposing that hierarchical channels are an effective way of enabling flexible and off-chain resizing of channels within the Lightning Network. The ability to resize channels quickly and efficiently will enable the Lightning Network to continue to scale and meet the increasing demand for more efficient payment channels.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjU5NjI0MzI1MDk2NjEw/lightning-network.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spiral Releases Q2 Update Detailing Bitcoin Development Kit Milestone, Among Other Advances]]></title><description><![CDATA[The update illustrates that the Bitcoin builder community surrounding Spiral is hard at work.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spiral-releases-q2-update-detailing-bdk-milestone-other-advances</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spiral-releases-q2-update-detailing-bdk-milestone-other-advances</guid><category><![CDATA[Block]]></category><category><![CDATA[Spiral]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[BDK]]></category><category><![CDATA[LDK]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 19:08:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2NDMxNzI4/bitcoin-painting-orange.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The update illustrates that the Bitcoin builder community surrounding Spiral is hard at work.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="http://spiral.xyz/">Spiral</a>, the Bitcoin-focused subsidiary of Block, has released its quarterly update. The projects Spiral has launched have released new updates and features for various products, including Lightning Development Kit (LDK), Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), Bitcoin Design Community and Bitcoin Product Community. <br><br>The <a href="https://spiral.xyz/blog/spiral-quarterly-update-q2-2023/">update</a> described how the Lightning Development Kit's LDK Node implementation aims to simplify the full suite of LDK APIs, allowing for an easier payment experience for users. Conor Okus, one of LDK Node's creators, shared a sneak peek of the technology during the Advancing Bitcoin 2023 conference in London. At the end of the workshop, all 30 attendees built a Lightning Wallet from scratch and made a successful payment.</p><p>On the other hand, the Bitcoin Development Kit saw a big milestone with the tagging of its 1.0 alpha release. This release included the new 1.0 framework and integration testing while APIs and internals are still under active development. This quarter, Kotlin, Swift, and Python language bindings can now broadcast raw transactions, create descriptors for BIP44/49/84 templates, access blockchain fee estimation and see more transaction and address info.</p><p>The Bitcoin Design Community has adopted Nostr Nets for community calls, and they also recently switched from Slack to Discord, though their Slack is still active. The community has also started a new series called Merchant Product Review, which analyzes bitcoin products and tools for merchants. They went deep on Tiankii, a merchant platform for El Salvadorians, along with the POS terminal functional on Breez.</p><p>Lastly, the Bitcoin Product Community was launched this quarter to encourage product managers to shepherd bitcoin projects from inception to completion. They held a Twitter Space to announce the community's formation and what to expect from it.</p><p>Developers Alekos Filini and Daniela Brozzoni announced their new hack.bs hacker space in Brescia, Italy. They teamed up with BitGeneration to bring bitcoin education to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitgeneration-is-bringing-bitcoin-education-to-italian-high-schools">Italian high school students</a> via talks and the BDK-based training wallet Padawan. Speaking of, this quarter, Thunderbiscuit listed Padawan on the Google Play store.

The company expects all units to be delivered by the manufacturer by the end of September, with a 95% increase in computing power once deployed according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>CleanSpark has approximately 15.9 EH/s of machines on hand or under contract for delivery this year, edging closer to its year-end guidance of 16 EH/s. The company will deploy all of the acquired units at its bitcoin mining facility in Sandersville, Georgia, which is currently undergoing a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-buys-bitcoin-mining-facility-from-mawson-infrastructure">planned 150 MW expansion</a>. The machines will be deployed in multiple batches as they arrive on site and new rack-space becomes available, with all machines expected to be fully operational before year-end.</p><p>Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, stated, “As bitcoin’s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark’s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America.” Gary Vecchiarelli, CleanSpark’s CFO, added, “Securing XPs at these prices means we have one less variable in our capital expenditure equation and puts us well on our way to achieving our year-end guidance of 16 EH/s.”</p><p>According to the press release, CleanSpark predominantly mines bitcoin with low-carbon energy sources, which account for over 90% of its energy mix, and the company follows what it describes as a “balanced capital management strategy” by selling some of its mined bitcoin to reinvest in growth. </p><p>This most recent miner purchase is in addition to a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-20000-bitcoin-miners">20,000 machine purchase</a> announced in February, with those machines fully paid for and in the process of being delivered to the company’s Washington facility.

"We have been working hard to create an easy-to-use, secure, and reliable bitcoin-only wallet app that can help newcomers get started with bitcoin," said the founder of Bitkipi. The app will continue to be available on both the App Store and Google Play, and current users can expect to see continued updates.</p><p>According to the press release, in almost two years, PocketBitcoin has already exchanged over ~$54 million (€50 million) in bitcoin for customers from all over Europe and paid them out on self-custodial wallets.</p><p>Anyone interested in learning more about Pocket Bitcoin's bitcoin-only platform can visit their website at <a href="https://pocketbitcoin.com/">pocketbitcoin.com</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMDc2OTYwOTgwNDQ0NTI2/handshake-spending-transaction.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Open Letter To Texas State Senator Lois Kolkhorst]]></title><description><![CDATA["We encourage you to engage further with bitcoin miners to better understand the matter generally and the consequences of your legislation."]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/open-letter-to-texas-sen-lois-kolkhorst</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/open-letter-to-texas-sen-lois-kolkhorst</guid><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Texas]]></category><category><![CDATA[energy consumption]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Parker Lewis,Will Cole]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 23:53:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMTY0MTc2/legal-justice.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">"We encourage you to engage further with bitcoin miners to better understand the matter generally and the consequences of your legislation."</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This letter was originally published on <a href="https://bitcoiner.ghost.io/open-letter-to-texas-senator/">bitcoiner.ghost.io</a>.</em></p><p>Dear Senator Kolkhorst,</p><p>As native Texans, we are writing to express concern regarding Texas Senate Bill (SB) 1751, which you co-sponsored and which recently passed a <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/SB01751S.pdf?ref=bitcoiner.ghost.io">Business &amp; Commerce Committee vote</a> on April 5, 2023. This open letter follows a private appeal submitted via your office in March. We write as concerned Texas citizens who are independent and do not represent any company or lobby.</p><p>From the outside looking in, you seem to be a proud Texan who fights for the rights of all Texans, promoting liberty and freedom consistent with Texan values. SB 1751 is a notable departure, at least in critical aspects, from your past track record. It is misinformed, discriminatory, anti-competitive, harmful to the interests of grid stability, bad for consumers and a strategic setback for Texas.</p><p>For context, the bill concerns “virtual currency” mining and demand response. It seeks to limit the ability of bitcoin miners to participate in compensatory ERCOT programs, which incentivize load reduction, to 10% across all bitcoin miners in total. Prior to sponsoring SB 1751, it is unclear whether you engaged in discussions with bitcoin miners to better understand the matter or expressed any opinions on bitcoin or bitcoin mining at all. It is also unclear whether special interests lobbied for this bill, given you do not appear to have previously taken any positions on bitcoin, but on the merits alone, SB 1751 is problematic.</p><h2>Misinformed</h2><p>The bill concerns “virtual currency mining as demand response.” Really at issue is bitcoin, not “virtual currency” broadly. There are no miners of any currency other than bitcoin that could be of note participating in demand response programs or promoting grid reliability. Bitcoin is also definitionally not comparable to any other currency, and it is not virtual. Bitcoin is not “crypto”. Bitcoin is bitcoin, and if bitcoin is at the heart of your bill, a better understanding before legislating would be beneficial.</p><p>Bitcoin is a form of money with a fixed supply, which is global and permissionless. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. That is the basis of its value to the world. As was apparent from a recent tweet, you seem to recognize that inflation is a problem. Inflation is not a political phenomenon. Money is created by the Federal Reserve (“Fed”). The Fed has increased the money supply <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WTFSRFA?ref=bitcoiner.ghost.io">by $8 trillion</a>, or 8x since the Great Financial Crisis, which causes inflation and destroys savings. Bitcoin is designed to fix the problem of money printing, but nothing of value comes without cost. Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed supply is secured by energy, specifically power. In short, energy innovation has always been strategic to Texas. Energy is strategic to bitcoin and bitcoin will become increasingly strategic to Texas as a result. However, it is not just about power generation and demand. It is about the problems of printing money, which undermine the interests of all Texans and the state of Texas.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/loiskolkhorst/status/1528895479479934976"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Texas is a leader in energy and all Texans need a form of money that the government cannot print out of thin air and at no cost. Texas power is securing the bitcoin network, which not only promotes grid stability and creates jobs and economic development, but it also secures the interests of all Texans, even those who do not yet use bitcoin as a superior form of money. We would be happy to hear your concerns and discuss this in more detail if it would be valuable.</p><h2>Discriminatory</h2><p>SB 1751 singles out bitcoin miners from all other industries. Setting everything else aside, this is discriminatory and creates an unlevel playing field. While other sources of demand have been identified as critical infrastructure, no other industry, including battery operators, have been restricted. Why bitcoin mining?</p><h2>Anti-Competitive</h2><p>Bitcoin miners compete in various ancillary services which ERCOT uses to compensate flexible loads to ensure grid stability. The entrant of bitcoin miners has made the bidding process more competitive, reducing prices. Restricting the ability of bitcoin miners to participate is anti-competitive and will result in marginally less participation in ancillary services by bitcoin miners which will marginally increase cost for ERCOT to achieve its reliability mandate.</p><h2>Harmful To Grid Stability</h2><p>SB 1751 disincentivizes bitcoin miners from participating in ancillary services, which promote grid stability. More participation in ancillary services not only reduces costs but also allows for ERCOT to have more resources at its disposal to achieve grid stability. As Texas power demand grows, more flexible resources will be needed to achieve grid stability. Why disincentivize large flexible loads, which are most often more efficient and lower cost than using peaker plants?</p><h2>Bad For Consumers</h2><p>Access to ancillary services creates marginal economic incentives for miners to come to Texas. Over time, more miners in Texas will lead to more power generation, more demand response and more participation in ancillary services. All three, individually and in aggregate, promote cheaper and more stable power prices for all Texas consumers.</p><h2>Strategic Setback For Texas</h2><p>Due to the fundamentals of energy development and as socialist-leaning states like New York have restricted mining, there has been a significant shift of bitcoin mining to Texas. From a mining perspective, Texas is known as the “center of hash.” Austin is also an emerging hub for bitcoin development. SB 1751 sends loud signals that Texas is not the free, deregulated market everyone believes it to be and that the state of Texas is antagonistic to bitcoin broadly.</p><p>Bitcoin mining incentivizes cheap power and its unique ability to respond at scale to all other sources of power demand helps achieve grid stability far more effectively and efficiently than any other single resource. Willingness by miners to shut down and NOT mine bitcoin in the interest of grid stability is a benefit to ERCOT and all Texans, which should not be economically disincentivized or disadvantaged relative to other industries. Mining projects are also highly capital intensive. Rash legislative action can have immediate impacts in dissuading miners to pursue large, long-term capital projects in Texas.</p><p>Even if you might not be concerned with its broader significance, this legislation will harm Texas strategic interests, beyond just ancillary services.</p><h2>Appeal To Reason And Reasonability</h2><p>Before moving forward with harmful legislation, we encourage you to engage further with bitcoin miners to better understand the matter generally and the consequences of your legislation specifically. Pausing work on SB 1751 is the only sensible and reasonable course. Please do not shoot and aim later. Additionally, we would ask that you engage with the Texas bitcoin community to understand the importance of bitcoin and why it is strategic to Texas and all Texans.</p><p>Bitcoin needs no favors nor competitive advantages. It just should not be subject to regulatory discrimination. The rights of Texan bitcoin holders, including miners, should be protected. <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/HC00089I.htm?ref=bitcoiner.ghost.io">House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 89</a> sponsored by Cody Harris, Texas House of Representatives, District 8 is a great example. It aims to protect the rights of Texan interests in bitcoin, rather than advantaging bitcoin in any way. That is all we ask of you and your colleagues.</p><p>It is clear you are a proud Texan and your values align with the ethos of bitcoin. Most importantly, we simply wish you to engage with the citizenry prior to legislating. But rest assured, regardless of how you proceed, <em>everything is good for bitcoin</em>, which is a theory formally known in Keynesian economics as the Nakamoto Paradox. If you would like to discuss SB 1751 or bitcoin more generally, we are in Austin or would come to Brenham.

    </figure><p>Even among hundreds of speakers, unique activations and viral moments, Max Keiser has become a can’t-miss aspect of the Bitcoin Conference event series. During Bitcoin 2019, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lq7ri0/max_keiser_tears_up_a_10_dollar_bill_screams_that/">he emphatically ripped up a $10 bill for CNBC Africa</a>, he was labeled “crypto Willy Wonka” on the “Daily Show” following his <a href="https://twitter.com/neiljacobs/status/1406240586525511685?s=21">energetic appearance at Bitcoin 2021</a> and he set a probable record for on-stage f-bombs during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXAtm6-tA4Y&amp;list=PLe0djdakvnFZ2C7DMjQfiuqCtbxk0ZTsz&amp;index=81">“F*ck You Money” panel at Bitcoin 2022</a>.</p><p>Keiser’s unique stage presence might seem improvised, but a media career that has spanned decades and produced television content for the BBC, Al-Jazeera and RT <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/max-keiser-stacy-herbert-bitcoin-lifestyle">alongside his wife and business partner Stacy Herbert</a> indicates that he knows what he’s doing. As does his current mission with Herbert, working alongside El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to make one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_59hrgTiRJU">Bitcoin Conference’s most promising announcements</a> an effective reality for millions: In November 2022, Bukele announced that the two would <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-establishes-national-bitcoin-office-to-manage-all-projects-related-to-the-cryptocurrency/">help establish the country’s National Bitcoin Office</a>.</p><p>“You know in ‘Star Wars,’ when they jump to hyperspace? That’s what’s happening in El Salvador,” Keiser explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “Bitcoin plus Bukele, with some help from Max and Stacy, has catapulted the country into becoming Bitcoin Maximalist Country.”</p><p>Keiser is quick to note that Bukele, who “is everywhere and pushing everything forward 24/7” is “almost impossible” to keep up with, but he evangelizes the president’s country with equal vigor.</p><p>“El Salvador is the ark,” Keiser said. “All are welcome while there’s still room. I expect the airport to be packed with fiat money refugees soon. Give us your tired, your weary, your banked-to-death poor, huddling in the casino gulag.”</p><p>This anti-central-banking message, which Keiser has been sharing in some form or another throughout much of his career, seems particularly prescient in the run up to Bitcoin 2023, given the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-surges-past-24000-as-major-banks-fail">ongoing banking crisis and accompanying bitcoin price surge</a>. For someone who has been preaching about the inequalities of fiat banking for so long, the current climate is coming as little surprise.</p><p>“I read the news about how banks are collapsing and I feel nothing,” Keiser recalled. “The current collapse is no surprise, of course. In 2008, there was a catastrophic global credit freeze; the financialized, post-WWII economy effectively died; and the financial taxidermists and bankers moved in to stuff it with lots of new, worthless fiat money. And now, in 2023, the stuffed, dead moose has caught fire and the whole global house of deceit and unpayable financial claims is a bonfire of epic proportions visible from other galaxies.”</p><p>It all seems like the perfect recipe for yet another unforgettable on-stage moment for Keiser at Bitcoin 2023. But if you were looking for some details as to how he will attempt to grab headlines again this year, you’ll have to be content to wait until May, just like everyone else.</p><p>“I plan to channel Satoshi live on stage, as always,” he teased. “I only speak the truth. I am bound by the protocol and the power vested in me as the Bishop of Bitcoin to elevate the masses and mass orange pill them whenever possible.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3MTUyNzMzMzg2NTE1Nzc1/max-kesier-bitcoin-2021.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Can Academia Give Bitcoin A Fair Shake?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Members of academia are inherently biased against Bitcoin, but there are intelligent and curious members who could change that.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/do-academics-treat-bitcoin-fairly</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/do-academics-treat-bitcoin-fairly</guid><category><![CDATA[Bias]]></category><category><![CDATA[School]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Academia]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hannah Wolfman-Jones]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMDg3MjE2OTA1NTk0NTI2/20220609_btcfinal_academicsurpressionofbitcoin_014159-1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Members of academia are inherently biased against Bitcoin, but there are intelligent and curious members who could change that.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Hannah Wolfman-Jones, author of “System Override: How Bitcoin, Blockchain, Free Speech, &amp; Free Tech Can Change Everything” and founder of We The Web.</em></p><p>Can academia fairly consider Bitcoin?</p><p>No. Or at least, not yet.</p><p>Academia has a huge and inherent bias against Bitcoin that it has yet to acknowledge. Academics — particularly academic economists — are the central planners who advise and run fiat monetary institutions. As such, they are often blind to the drawbacks of decentralization. Bitcoin not only threatens academic economists’ <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-academia-have-a-bias-against-bitcoin">revolving door</a> with fiat monetary institutions, but their egos and research too. As <a href="https://heterodoxacademy.org/hxannouncements/qa-with-hxa-member-ashley-hodgson/">Ashley Hodgson</a>, associate professor of economics at St. Olaf College and moderator of the HxEconomics Community at Heterodox Academy, explains in a draft chapter of an upcoming book:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“To consider Bitcoin, one must change the question from, ‘What would I do if I controlled the money supply?’ to ‘Should anyone (including economists like me) be able to control the money supply?’ In this way, Bitcoin is potentially disempowering to the economist thinker… Even for the thought experiment to limit the power and status of one’s profession (academic economists) and one’s peers is something that may have a negative taste for people who spent so many years and gave up so many other life opportunities to enter this profession.</p><p>“Academics work hard in their early careers to publish and bring new ideas to bear… The newest, freshest ideas can sometimes knock the old ideas aside, which is against the interests of the senior academics, whose own sense of identity rests on the importance and correctness of their ideas. As such, cunning new ideas and brilliant young academics pose a threat to more senior academics in their roles as thought leaders, particularly if the new ideas displace the prestige of the old… Egos play a big role in the academic setting, particularly because we are essentially paid in prestige instead of money. Most economists could make more money by moving to industry. They stay in academia for the glory and influence… (Junior economists) know that they are most likely to rise within their profession if their ideas and research topics support the existing paradigm, therefore not posing too big of a threat to the senior colleagues deciding on their tenure case. By the time anyone is up for tenure, they have built a body of thought that they now identify with. While they have the freedom, potentially, to stray from that, the ideas may have solidified in their worldview.”</p></blockquote><p>Unsurprisingly, academia’s study of Bitcoin thus far has been sorely lacking and what research has taken place has — with few exceptions — been cursory, unreliable and decidedly anti-Bitcoin. <a href="https://medium.com/@nic__carter/comments-on-the-white-house-report-on-the-climate-implications-of-crypto-mining-8d65d30ec942">Flawed research</a> based on misunderstandings about how Bitcoin works are being used as the basis of peer-reviewed, academic and government research papers and ossified within academia as these error-ridden papers are cited in subsequent academic research. </p><p>Actual experts in Bitcoin, who overwhelmingly are not in academia or government, are not considered “peers” by the credential-focused, hierarchical academic system and thus cannot contribute to academia’s peer review. There have been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8">egregious examples</a> of academia publishing research into reputable journals that are, as <a href="https://reason.com/video/2021/11/16/the-fake-environmentalist-attack-on-bitcoin/">Reason had noted</a>, “outlandish and provably false.” This “logically flawed” research (conducted and reviewed by academics who do not adequately understand the basic workings of Bitcoin) gets published and propagated widely within academia and the media. Reason surmises that “apocalyptic” and “fundamentally wrong” Bitcoin research is given a veneer of credibility by academia “as a strategy by economic, media, and political elites to undermine a powerful new form of money that they can't control.”</p><h2>Is Academia A Lost Cause For Understanding The Future Of Economics?</h2><p>In some ways, yes. Academics are mostly ignorant of the paradigm shift brought on by Bitcoin and how it provides an alternative to (and thus is a threat to) authoritarian global monetary forces, including the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-hidden-costs-of-the-petrodollar">petrodollar</a>, subjugation of the developing world via IMF and World Bank loans (see the book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#:~:text=Confessions%20of%20an%20Economic%20Hit%20Man%20is%20a%20semi%2Dautobiographical,Perkins%2C%20first%20published%20in%202004.&amp;text=The%20book%20provides%20Perkins'%20account,Main%20in%20Boston.">Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man</a>” for more), the Cantillon effect and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) advancing social credit systems and “The Great Reset.” </p><p>Academics often summarily dismiss such authoritarian fiat forces as “conspiracy theories” — a realm they don’t consider worthy of inquiry. Since academics are nearly universally from the developed world and in good standing with powerful governments (having high social credit) they are never confronted with the oppressive nature of fiat control in their own lives. Thus, academics are largely blind to the pitfalls of fiat and the benefits of Bitcoin as an uncontrollable monetary system. </p><p>In other ways, though, no, it’s not a lost cause. The professoriate is far from a monolith and most of them are highly intelligent and curious people dedicated to pursuing truth who sincerely want to better the world. Most economic professors have no intention of working for the IMF, Federal Reserve or similar fiat institutions, so they are not particularly conflicted themselves. </p><p>Bitcoin has made some inroads into universities already, as there are many independent thinkers within academic ranks. For example, Texas A&amp;M does astute and extensive technological and economic research into Bitcoin, even having a “<a href="https://www.publish0x.com/sidou/texas-a-and-m-university-has-approved-a-bitcoin-class-xmywnzy">Bitcoin class</a>” dedicated to it. Academics from many different universities have banded together in the <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/">Bitcoin Policy Institute</a> resulting in high-quality and in-depth Bitcoin research. </p><p>There are also some academics who do not understand/appreciate Bitcoin, but find value in increasing viewpoint diversity in order to improve the quality of research produced and may be receptive to more inclusion of Bitcoin as a topic. Notably, there are thousands of professors with Heterodox Academy, a nonprofit dedicated to viewpoint diversity, whom <a href="https://www.wetheweb.org/post/open-letter-to-heterodox-academy">I hope will soon recognize academia’s yet-unacknowledged strong bias against Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>While these newer research pursuits will not be incorporated into formal economic curricula anytime soon, they are discussed extensively in academic spheres. Bitcoiners have much they can learn from academia about the fiat system, which will continue to dominate for a long time. Professors are actual experts in the fiat system and often influential advisors to it. Notably, they will advise government officials and the unelected global elite on CBDCs and policies dealing with cryptocurrency and managing the fiat system through upcoming challenges. Bitcoiners can also cognitively benefit from listening to informed opinions that run contrary to their own.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Hannah Wolfman-Jones.

Today, both Russia and China are part of a global cadre known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS">BRICS</a>, which includes Brazil, India and South Africa — with other countries, such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, perhaps waiting in the wings to join as well. </p><p>In case you haven’t been paying attention, the world is undergoing a major paradigm shift, with BRICS at the center. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-trust-banks-choose-bitcoin">Banks across the world are failing</a>, Saudi Arabia and Iran are <a href="https://time.com/6262985/china-saudi-arabia-iran-ukraine-peace-talks/">negotiating historic peace talks</a> and countries are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-turns-to-chinas-yuan-in-effort-to-ditch-the-dollar-a8111457">beginning to deviate from the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency</a>. </p><p>An important question to consider, then, is how does the current state of geopolitics and macroeconomics shape the future of a hyperbitcoinized world? I acknowledge that nobody can predict the future with any real certainty, however, I would like to share my vision of how game theory plays out over time. </p><p>I believe that, over the next few decades, the emergence of BRICS as an alternative to U.S. hegemony will cause the global economy to evolve in three phases: Phase one will be a pivot from a unipolar financial world to a multipolar one. In phase two, Bitcoin becomes a medium of exchange and unit of account for many nations. In the third and final phase, we experience real hyperbitcoinization. </p><h2>Phase One: From USD To Gold</h2><p>Most people have no idea that this is even happening, but we are already in the early stages of phase one and the creation of a multipolar world. </p><p>In the 1970s, under President Nixon, Saudi Arabia <a href="https://www.energyintel.com/00000184-15bf-df66-a797-ddffc2380000">agreed to price its oil in U.S. dollars in exchange for military defense</a>. Essentially, every other country was forced to hold U.S. dollars as a result, thereby making it the global reserve currency. Having such an exorbitant privilege means that every time the U.S. government decides to print money, it can essentially purchase oil for free. As a result of being the global reserve currency, U.S. treasuries became the safest asset for investors to own (I know this statement seems comical today). The consensus has been that there is zero chance that the United States will default on its own debt, since it can print ad infinitum. Nation states have purchased <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFIN">enormous levels of U.S. debt for over 50 years</a>. </p><p>This is no longer true for all nations, however. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3213701/chinese-holdings-us-treasury-securities-falls-us8594-billion-lowest-2009-amid-rate-hikes-and-tension">China</a> and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226054/value-of-united-states-treasury-securities-held-by-russia/">Russia</a> have been purchasing fewer treasuries over the past decade. Rather than holding U.S. debt as an asset, they have been <a href="https://financialpost.com/commodities/mining/central-banks-buy-gold-fastest-pace-55-years">increasing their gold reserves</a>. <a href="https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/why-central-banks-are-stockpiling-gold-11675912492641.html">India</a>, too, is amassing a stockpile of gold. It appears that the BRICS nations are working toward returning to a gold standard. Under this regime, currencies would once again be pegged to a scarce commodity that many have used as a store of value for thousands of years. But it is unlikely that these states will settle the majority of transactions using physical gold, given the difficulty of transporting and securing it. What is certain, though, is that Russia is now allowing countries to purchase its oil in<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/indias-oil-deals-with-russia-dent-decades-old-dollar-dominance-2023-03-08/"> rubles, yuan and, perhaps soon, rupees</a>. In this phase, a minority of nations will continue to decrease their U.S. treasury holdings, transact in foreign currencies and acquire as much gold as humanly possible. </p><p>The rest of the world, particularly in the West, will continue to function as they have since the 1970s. Many countries will still be forced to hold U.S. dollars to purchase oil. American debt, equities and real estate will continue to serve as a store of value for most citizens. And fiat currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, will serve as the dominant units of account. I predict that this first phase will last no longer than 20 more years. </p><p>During the course of this phase, many countries will likely default on their debts and experience currency collapses. They will start transacting locally in U.S. dollars the way that some nations do even today. Rising debt-to-GDP and inflation levels, coupled with tax increases and unemployment, will lead to massive unrest. Governments will be in desperate need of a solution to an unsolvable problem. </p><h2>Phase Two: The Beginning Of A New Era</h2><p>Phase two marks the beginning of a new era; this is when there will be no other choice but to switch to a fundamentally different monetary system. At this point in time, the non-BRICS nations will quickly adopt bitcoin as both a medium of exchange and unit of account. This means that everyone is paid in bitcoin and uses it as a store of value. Real estate will still be owned, but people will buy it as a place to call home, rather than as a place to park their wealth. Equities will still be bought and traded, but bitcoin will be regarded as the primary savings vehicle for everyone. Sovereigns and individuals (like yourself, most likely) that have stacked bitcoin for years will become insanely wealthy within a very short timespan. </p><p>In this phase, globalization will not be as impactful as it is today since the BRICS countries will be alienated from the rest of the world. China and Russia will be conducting trade almost exclusively with their allies, which will ultimately weaken their economies. These states will compete in gold production, and the dominant unit of exchange will vary from time to time. Phase two will happen more quickly than phase one, perhaps in as little as 10 years.</p><h2>Phrase Three: Hyperbitcoinization</h2><p>The third and final phase is less complicated. Most of the world will have already transitioned to a bitcoin standard. For nations that have not already done so, they will notice the increased wealth and standard of living abroad. By this point in time, El Salvador will have become one of the richest countries on earth. Nations still on a gold standard will suffer as a result of being isolated from the rest of the world. Trust in the current system will disappear. </p><p>Additionally, people will recognize that, compared to bitcoin, gold is an inferior store of value. Verifying the authenticity of gold is difficult. Transporting and securing it is even more burdensome. Russia, China and its allies will have no other option but to embrace bitcoin as their local medium of exchange and unit of account. Phase three will also happen rapidly. I predict this will occur over five to 10 years. </p><p>This is how I envision the game theory playing out over the next 20 to 30 years. Perhaps most, if not all, of my predictions will be wrong. What I am certain of, however, is that our world is indeed changing rapidly. Our monetary system is broken. This is reflected in the current banking crisis. </p><p>Even if most of my predictions are incorrect, we are in desperate need of a return to a sound money system. Bitcoin is the only viable solution in my humble opinion. It may be wise to stack a few sats now while you still can. You or your children may benefit from it greatly in the future.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Milan Stanojevic.

When we started, it was just “schooling.” But thanks to going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, we now have a more precise framework to explain “self custody of education” and its significance. </p><p>The ways that Bitcoiners and homeschoolers think are incredibly similar for reasons I’ll explain here. I am more bullish on this community than ever, but we have work to do.

    </figure><div><em>View the 3 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/parallels-between-homeschool-and-bitcoin">original article</a></em></div></section><p>Think how it feels to share good things with close friends. Can you recall finding a thoughtful, personal gift and feeling giddy with excitement as you presented the wrapped present to its recipient? How excited were you about sharing something wonderful with another person and watching their eyes light up when they “got it”? Leading someone to the Bitcoin rabbit hole is like this. </p><p>This is the level of excitement that Tali and I felt <em>before</em> the convention. Homeschoolers are our people. In our hearts, we know how aligned they are with Bitcoin. Here are 10 reasons why our passion and excitement were so high:</p><h2>One: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Prefer Decentralization</h2><p>Many Bitcoiners are surely familiar with “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Federal-Reserve/dp/091298645X">The Creature From Jekyll Island</a>” and the continual expansion of the power of central planners. The cancer of fiat does not discriminate. Both homeschoolers and Bitcoiners understand the burden of increasingly-centralized agencies, woke policies and socialist philosophies. Government and central-planning bureaucracies have entangled themselves deeper and deeper into education. </p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education">U.S Department of Education</a> (DOE) was created in 1979 and has an annual budget of $68 billion (this excludes state and local education budgets). Where does the money go? As the insane budget grows, the beneficiaries are not students or even teachers. Increased spending goes to bureaucratic administrators. In Bitcoin speak, it goes to rent seekers. From <a href="https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/education-as-a-battleground/">2000 to 2019</a>, the increase in the number of students was 7.6%, the increase in the number of teachers was 8.7% and the increase in district administrators was a stunning 87.6%. </p><p>Once you control the purse strings, you control policy. Dare go against the approved narrative from central-planning-know-it-alls and your school or college risks losing federal, state and local funding. Individuals within institutions risk losing their jobs (and power) if they fight to protect against environmental, racial, sexual or political agendas in curricula. </p><p>As the top-down statists feed the bureaucracy machine, the trend is for more families to pursue exiting the traditional educational system. Draconian COVID-19 policies showed many what was possible in the way of resources too, driving the percentage of school-aged children being homeschooled to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/03/homeschooling-on-the-rise-during-covid-19-pandemic.html">over 11%</a>.</p><p>Homeschooling is decentralized education. There are co-operatives which are like nodes, running their own education programs, support organizations and a growing number of resources. But at the core of homeschooling is the home. The family unit is as fully decentralized as you can get for education. </p><h2>Two: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Embrace The Principle Of Self Custody</h2><p>It’s hard to conceive, but our society once was on a gold standard. Sound money is not a new concept from a long-term historical perspective. It’s just new to us. Bitcoiners have embraced sound money and the need to protect it. If everyone followed the advice of “not your keys, not your coins,” then criminals like Sam Bankman-Fried couldn’t hurt them. </p><p>Homeschoolers have trust issues with education, just as Bitcoiners have trust issues with money. Homeschooling is not a new concept, historically speaking. It’s new to us. Here are <a href="https://www.aop.com/blog/100-famous-homeschoolers">some influential leaders who were homeschooled</a>: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, Leonardo Da Vinci, Thomas Edison, Douglas MacArthur, Charles Dickens, C.S. Lewis and so many more.</p><p>We protect ourselves from the risk by controlling our own keys. Whether these are the keys to your bitcoin or the keys to your kids’ education, self custody is a core principle to embrace.</p><h2>Three: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Understand Proof Of Work</h2><p>Time is the only thing in the universe more valuable than bitcoin. Therefore, there’s an opportunity cost to investing one’s time to stay home and teach. One could instead get a job and let someone else deal with textbooks, grading tests, etc. It goes deeper, though. It’s not just time. Homeschooling is tough, 24/7 work. It has emotional volatility. There are days when the stress makes you question what you’re doing. </p><p>The tradeoff decision is not unlike bootstrapping a Bitcoin startup. To <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/citadel-dispatch/id1546393840?i=1000605787077">steal a phrase from Christian Keroles and Matt Odell</a>, there is a sat opportunity cost when investing in a Bitcoin company. The alternative is to HODL. The expected return on the investment must be greater than other options like stacking sats.</p><p>Homeschoolers are simply making the decision that making their kids’ education a rock-solid foundation for a happier, more successful future is the best return on their time. They are making the decision to persevere through an emotional rollercoaster of a journey. This incredible investment of their time, energy and love is their proof of work. </p><h2>Four: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Fight FUD</h2><p>The most common FUD about homeschooling is socialization. When Tali first suggested staying home with our firstborn, I questioned whether doing so would negatively impact her socialization experiences. My concern was unfounded. The reality is that homeschooled kids are like all other kids. They play sports; participate in theater, robotics and other activities; have social dances; etc. As our kids grew through their teenage years, I started to question if they were too social. </p><p>Additionally, my observations are that homeschooled kids excel at thinking for themselves. They grasp concepts like “don’t trust, verify.” Contrast this with compliance, the backbone of State-driven education institutions. </p><p>The reason is that homeschooled kids are getting lessons 24/7. Something as small as the chore of taking out the garbage is an opportunity to discuss personal responsibility, integrity, trust and other non-academic subjects. Show me the proof of work of where and how such topics are discussed outside of the home. </p><h2>Five: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Gravitate To Libertarian Ideas</h2><p>It’s a first principles idea that parents are first and foremost responsible for teaching their children. Marxists, socialists and communists, on the other hand, repel this basic concept. They want the State to decide what’s acceptable, the “teachers” to indoctrinate and the kids to comply.</p><blockquote><p>“Who ‘owns’ the child, then? The choice is between the parents, who have taken the trouble to have and raise the child — and who, in almost cases, will give their lives to support the child for as long as it takes and longer — or the educational bureaucracy, which is more likely than a parent to look upon the child as an asset in a social-engineering project to rearrange government and society.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/education-as-a-battleground/">Larry Arnn, President of Hillsdale College</a></p></blockquote><p>Homeschoolers, like Bitcoiners, realize that our freedoms are under attack. Homeschoolers risk becoming a target of the State because of their beliefs, so it is logical for them to align with a political philosophy that upholds liberty. It makes sense to align with those who value individual political freedoms. The thought of the State deciding what and how children should be taught — at the exclusion of the parents — is as appalling to homeschoolers as a central bank digital currency (CDBC) is to Bitcoiners. </p><h2>Six: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Value Personal Responsibility</h2><p>Homeschoolers take action. They invest time in researching options, curricula and activities that will most benefit their children. They read books. They listen to podcasts. And they are even willing to pay to attend a homeschooling convention, in addition to the travel and lodging expenses to get to it. They do not expect handouts. They are not asking for big government solutions. They do not trust that bureaucrats will avoid fiat temptations, e.g., promoting curricula based on political agendas. </p><p>Sound familiar? Taking action is a ubiquitous Bitcoiner trait. Bitcoiners research their options, read books, listen to podcasts and even pay to attend conferences. They do not wait for handouts, nor expect big government help, nor trust bureaucrats to avoid fiat temptations, e.g., endless printing and money debasement. </p><h2>Seven: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Believe In Hope And Freedom</h2><p>This concept is not as obvious as the others, but you can find it hidden behind feelings of frustration (and perhaps some heated yelling) about current events, broken systems and the state of our high-time preference world. I’m talking about optimism.</p><p>If one did not believe in a better future, it would be pointless to invest and sacrifice to pursue homeschooling. Yet, homeschooling parents go to extraordinary lengths. Tali and I made the conscious decision to live on one income, even if it meant a smaller house and missing fancy vacations. We are not atypical. Homeschooling is a calling worthy of sacrificing short-term desires for long-term benefits. (More on low time preference shortly.) </p><p>Bitcoin is hope. Michael Saylor’s use of <a href="http://www.hope.com/">www.hope.com</a> is brilliant. If it wasn’t for Bitcoin, our national debt spiral would depress me to the point of giving up. If it wasn’t for Bitcoin, the statists’ push to replicate China’s CDBC would make me believe George Orwell’s “1984” future was inevitable. If you didn’t have hope in Bitcoin’s future, you wouldn’t have decided to read this article. </p><h2>Eight: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Push Education</h2><p>Education at a homeschooling convention really doesn’t need clarification. I haven’t met a Bitcoiner yet who doesn’t believe Bitcoin education is key. Nevertheless, I’m going to share a couple of examples. </p><p>For homeschooling, we may have been the only exhibitor at the convention focused on sound money literacy, but we found another focused on teaching liberty and freedom. If you have small children, or are looking for gifts for small children, check out the books by the Tuttle twins.</p><p>For Bitcoin, the example to call out is <a href="https://miprimerbitcoin.io/en/my-first-bitcoin/">Mi Primer Bitcoin</a>. This group recently translated its program from Spanish to English. This is an absolutely wonderful teaching resource and it’s free.</p><h2>Nine: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Are Entering The Then-They-Fight-You Stage</h2><p>President Biden’s administration is no friend of Bitcoin, nor are other government agencies or the Federal Reserve. While I believe in the “then-we-win” stage, it doesn’t mean the current “then-they-fight-you” stage won’t be painful. They are attacking. Here’s an excerpt from <a href="https://custodiabank.com/press/custodia-stands-firm-in-response-to-the-fed/">Custodia Bank’s website</a> that makes my blood boil:</p><blockquote><p>“Historic bank runs in the last two weeks underscore the dire need for fully solvent banks that are equipped to serve fast-changing industries in an era of rapidly improving technology. That is the exact model proposed by Custodia Bank — to hold $1.08 in cash to back every dollar deposited by customers. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve took its eye off the ball and allowed bank-run risks to build at traditional banks – while simultaneously engaging in a crackdown against the digital asset industry at large and Custodia Bank in particular.”</p></blockquote><p>This example reminds us of what <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block">Satoshi Nakamoto put on the genesis block</a>. Bailing out failed institutions creates moral hazard. This creates bigger problems later, which creates an incentive for even greater bailouts and greater moral hazard. Not approving Custodia Bank, with healthy risk policies, is purely an attack on those who do not comply with the central planning gods.</p><p>Now for an education example. I picked this one not because it focuses on homeschooling, but because it shows how far those in control will go to protect their power. </p><p>In 2021, the Loudoun county school district in Virginia <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/10/12/father-loudoun-county-schools-hid-daughters-bathroom-assault-by-boy-wearing-skirt/">covered up</a> the rape of a female student by a skirt-wearing male student. It was not the assailant’s first assault. He was allowed to be in the girl’s bathroom because the school was following woke liberal policies. </p><p>While this is horrendous, it actually gets worse. Here’s where the “then they attack you” hits education and not just homeschoolers. This is an attack on education and an attack on parents. The father of the rape victim was essentially labeled a terrorist because he spoke out at a school board meeting. <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/05/20/loudoun-county-schools-sues-shut-down-rape-coverup-investigation/">The father was arrested</a>. The school administrators who pushed critical race theory and other radical policies, who covered up assaults, were able to silence a father exercising his right to speak, a father whose daughter suffered unnecessarily because of a political agenda. </p><h2>10: Homeschoolers And Bitcoiners Have Low Time Preferences</h2><p>Deciding to homeschool is a long-term undertaking. It is filled with uncertainty and emotional volatility. I wish there was an equivalent of the “stay humble, stack sats” meme for homeschooling... For the moment, I’m going with “take action, self-custody education.” </p><h2>Game Day: Observations And Lessons Learned</h2><p>According to veteran homeschooling conventioneers, our neighbors in the exhibition hall, the St. Louis event was bigger and more energetic than in prior years. Yet, Tali and I were surprised by some of the less-than-enthusiastic reactions of attendees to Bitcoin. </p><p>For all of the reasons I covered above, we expected mostly open discussions with those curious about adding sound money to their curriculum. We did have some interactions like this, which were uplifting. But many attendees avoided eye contact altogether, as if Tali and I were aliens. </p><p>Here are our top three lessons learned and what we’re changing because of them:</p><h2>First Lesson Learned: Homeschoolers Confuse ‘Sound Money’ With Dave Ramsey Personal Finance</h2><p>Most of the 5,000 people who attended the convention didn’t have a sound money framework. This led to curious and sometimes even scoffing looks at our booth, the sole exhibitor with educational Bitcoin games and books.</p><p>Using sound money to lead homeschoolers to Bitcoin is less effective than being direct. </p><p>We are changing our presentation for an April homeschooling convention to be more direct. Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology. Bitcoin is hope for us and future generations. It is critical to teach our kids about it. If you don’t want to use our educational resources, that’s fine, but just start educating yourself and your kids ASAP.</p><h2>Second Lesson Learned: Develop More Breakout Workshops To Address Different Audiences </h2><p>I presented an overview of Bitcoin using our game, HODL UP, in a workshop session. Through play, you learn Bitcoin mechanics and terminology. I limited the discussion examples to three things: mining, the 21 million bitcoin cap and wallets. </p><p>It’s difficult to reach a split audience. Even simplifying and connecting the gameplay concepts to real Bitcoin was too much for half the audience. It needs to be even simpler. The other half was curious about investment advice. </p><p>Tali and I are increasing the number of workshop sessions from one to four at the April homeschooling convention. We are creating customized content to address different audience interests and knowledge.</p><h2>Third Lesson Learned: Moms Are (A Lot) More Likely To Say Their Spouse Is The ‘Money Person’</h2><p>There was a distinct trend based on gender. We had many discussions with homeschooling moms who said their spouses were the one who understood finances or who took an interest in Bitcoin. We had zero homeschooling dads say the same.</p><p>We need to understand what is driving this. We do not fully know. It’s not something limited to homeschoolers either. Why is it that Bitcoin meetups typically seem to be comprised of 80% men? Bitcoin is good for everyone, so why don’t we see more women in the space? What can we do to reach them?</p><p>We will gather additional data as we travel and meet more people face to face. </p><h2>Next Steps: A Positive Mental Attitude And Another Convention</h2><p>Tali and I know homeschoolers are ready for Bitcoin, they just don’t know it yet. We’re on a mission to guide them on the journey to figure it out. It may take years but that’s okay. This is a low-time preference endeavor. It’s better to let others decide for themselves, e.g., by asking questions rather than forcing them to experience a catastrophic failure of our money system. </p><p>As of this writing, our next homeschooling conference is only weeks away. Based on the experience from the March event, we’re modifying our approach. We look forward to sharing lessons learned with fellow Bitcoiners. </p><p>Tali and I would like to express our gratitude to “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thank-God-Bitcoin-Corruption-Redemption/dp/1641991216">Thank God For Bitcoin</a>” and <a href="https://shamory.com/">SHAmory</a>, both of whom helped with our March event. We also want to express gratitude to the St. Charles Bitcoin Meetup. It held a special Bitcoin game event the day after the convention and we spent five amazing hours connecting with humble and awesome people! We hope to make this an annual event!</p><figure>

Already passed by the State Senate, the bill now heads to the governor’s office for approval. The Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 would create guidelines for bitcoin miners and would aim to prevent fraudulent business practices.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill proposes that a Bitcoin mining business may operate in the state if it complies with state laws concerning business guidelines and tax policies, any ordinances concerning operations and safety, any rules or rates for utility service provided by or on behalf of a public entity, and state and federal employment laws. The bill also proposes that miners will be required to pay applicable taxes and government fees in acceptable forms of currency and operate in a manner that causes no stress on an electric public utility’s generation capabilities or transmission network. The bill further allows individuals to operate home Bitcoin mining according to applicable utility rules and rates.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The bill aims to recognize that data centers create jobs, pay taxes and provide general economic value to local communities and the state. It clarifies the guidelines needed to protect Bitcoin miners from discriminatory industry-specific regulations and taxes. The proposed bill has defined several key terms such as "digital asset" that means Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. It also defines "digital asset miner" as an individual who mines for digital assets and "digital asset mining" as the use of electricity to power a computer for the purpose of securing or validating a blockchain network.</p><p>The proposed bill further clarifies that "digital asset mining business" means a group of computers working at a single site that consumes more than one megawatt (1MW) on an average annual basis for the purpose of generating digital assets by securing a blockchain network. It also defines "node" as a computational device that contains a copy of blockchain-distributed ledger technology. The bill defines "residence" as a permanent dwelling place, unit, or accessory structure.</p><p>The bill has proposed that the legislative body means the quorum court of a county or the city council, board of directors, board of commissioners or similar elected governing body of local government, and that a person may have a digital asset mining business in an area that is zoned for industrial use that has not been designated by the local government for other uses.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MDg3OTU3NzYzNDk5MDkx/ftivcfpxoawxuve.jpg" height="766" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ordinals Are Good For Bitcoin, But More Standards Are Needed]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ordinals are driving a Bitcoin popularity surge, but for that to continue the protocol will need to integrate more standards.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ordinals-need-standards</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ordinals-need-standards</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[NFT]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Danny Yang]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNDg3NTU3/melting-time-art.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Ordinals are driving a Bitcoin popularity surge, but for that to continue the protocol will need to integrate more standards.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorially by Danny Yang, founder of the Stanford Bitcoin Meetup, who has inscribed the OnChainMonkey NFT collection on Bitcoin.</em></p><p>In the last few years, NFTs have been the breakout application for Ethereum and other blockchains. While much of this mainstream user base did leave with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ftx-nft-nonfungible-token-crypto-prices-bored-ape/">the drop in NFT prices</a>, many have stayed. But the initial surge in NFT interest drew most of these users to blockchain projects aside from Bitcoin, even though BTC is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">which is twice the size of Ethereum’s</a>) and it has the highest level of security and the most proven capacity as a store of value. Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-inscriptions-impact-bitcoin-block-space">a protocol like Ordinals</a> arrived to make it possible for NFTs to exist on Bitcoin. It was only a matter of time until someone recognized that Bitcoin’s staying power could underpin a truly “killer” app.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-implications-of-bitcoin-inscriptions">Contrary to some complaints</a>, the Ordinals protocol and the capacity to create NFTs on Bitcoin is remarkably great for the future of Bitcoin. With ordinals, we can now inscribe and store non-fungible digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. More value stored means even more incentive to participate in the network — we’ve seen this reflected in the <a href="https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/90d/">increase in Bitcoin nodes operating</a> — further driving up the competitiveness of the bitcoin miners and the value of bitcoin.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/quantifying-bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals">It’s not a fad, either.</a> NFT collectors rushed to pay more than<a href="https://twelvefold.io/"> $16 million in bitcoin for 288 Yuga Labs ordinals</a>. Bitcoin NFTs are the new “gold standard” and only strengthen bitcoin’s place as the global standard for a store of value. </p><h2>What Are Ordinals?</h2><p>The first Ordinals inscription was added to Bitcoin in <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/6fb976ab49dcec017f1e201e84395983204ae1a7c2abf7ced0a85d692e442799i0">December 2022</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinals-launch-nft-on-bitcoin">and started to gain traction in early 2023.</a> An ordinal is composed of two parts: an individual satoshi (the smallest unit of bitcoin), and an inscription. Each satoshi is identified by the order in which it was created in the Bitcoin protocol, and the Ordinals protocol tracks each satoshi as they are transferred between wallets.</p><p>The inscription is data that is written (or inscribed) on the Bitcoin blockchain and is associated with an individual (“marked”) satoshi at the time of the inscription. This allows people to inscribe data on Bitcoin, and assign and transfer ownership of that on-chain data or inscription using the “marked” satoshi.</p><p>The first ordinal created is numbered “ordinal 0” and each subsequent ordinal increments the counter by one. All ordinals form a single ordinals NFT collection. There was an initial rush to create the lowest-numbered ordinals, motivated by the collectibility of very low ordinal numbers. The value of these early ordinals was mostly in the low ordinal number, and the actual data inscribed was not as important (many were just copy-pasted images of existing works, often done without permission from the original creators).</p><p>In other words: An ordinal is like a digital postage stamp, and the protocol allows anyone to print their own stamps. Just like with real, physical stamps, these digital stamps are assets that can be owned, sold and transferred. The stamp or ordinal has the advantage of being digital, stored and secured on the Bitcoin blockchain. Both Bitcoin and Ordinals are open, permissionless protocols, so anyone can use Ordinals to print whatever stamps they want. </p><p>In the last few weeks, <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/4d7636515375e970496400df63906de099ee3b079aa4360b38251431591fd8fci0">we have seen over 750,000 “stamps” printed on Bitcoin</a>. And, just like with physical stamps, some are worth more than others. One of Yuga Labs’ “stamps” sold for more than<a href="https://twelvefold.io/"> 7 BTC</a>, worth over $150,000 at the time.</p><h2>Why Ordinals Are Good For Bitcoin</h2><p>The major criticism of ordinals is that storing additional digital assets on Bitcoin means more block space must be used to store these digital assets. Each year, the Bitcoin blockchain can only store a little over 200 gigabytes of data as its theoretical maximum (as each Bitcoin block has a theoretical maximum size of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-records-largest-mined-block-to-date-4-mb-block-containing-nft-causes-unease-among-small-block-supporters/">4 megabytes</a>, with miners adding one block roughly every 10 minutes, and thus, roughly 210 gigabytes’ worth of data per year), which includes all regular bitcoin transactions in addition to marked satoshis and the accompanying inscription data.</p><p>Storing ordinals can easily use up a lot more block space than regulator transactions do, crowding out these regular transactions and driving up transaction fees. But this isn’t bad. Fees going up indicate demand for and use of Bitcoin, and that money goes straight to the bitcoin miners who secure the blockchain. That incentivizes more miners and nodes to join, further strengthening the blockchain. Critics also forget that bitcoin is a true free market. Higher fees should mean that the ordinals being written to Bitcoin are of higher value than regular transactions are, just by the nature of their existence. If they aren’t, they won’t sell and won’t be created.</p><p>I do agree with critics who point out that most of the NFT collections going to Bitcoin are wasting space — in their rush to be trendy, they’re bloating the blockchain with transactions that I do not see as truly valuable. When I inscribed a 10,000-image collection of ordinals, our team decided<a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/fb162a46943e5d7d31d72ee2c8c850e66c1ca5d0d453068aa63883528285ed21i0"> to intentionally use only 20 kilobytes</a> of Bitcoin blockchain data total, thus minimizing disruption of the rest of the mempool. Consideration of block space should be a standard for any NFT collection launching on Bitcoin.</p><h2>Ordinals Does Need a Standard</h2><p>The Ethereum NFT market had several years to develop — at the time of writing, two of the top three most-used applications on Ethereum (by the amount of gas paid) are NFT marketplaces<a href="https://etherscan.io/gasTracker"> (on Etherscan, as Blur and OpenSea’s Seaport).</a> Bitcoin is the biggest blockchain by market cap, so it stands to reason that there will be a Bitcoin NFT marketplace (or several) soon. However, where Ethereum got it right was <a href="https://hackernoon.com/non-fungible-token-nft-standards-an-overview-w71y34y3">in its NFT standards</a>, and that’s what Bitcoin NFTs are still missing.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, all ordinals are part of a single NFT collection on Bitcoin. One important NFT standard available on Ethereum, and not yet on Bitcoin, is the ability for a specific creator to define a custom NFT collection of just their NFTs. The NFT collection standard is vitally important for provenance, security, interoperability and growth. On Ethereum, there are many NFT explorers, wallets and marketplaces, and they can all interoperate and understand which collection any NFT belongs to.</p><p>This searchability does not exist for ordinals on Bitcoin yet. To be fair, ordinals are brand new. Ethereum had several years to develop NFT standards, such as <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC-721</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/">ERC-1155</a>. But now that Bitcoin NFTs are here, we need to create these standards as soon as possible.</p><p>Ordinals, the protocol, is also not a finished product. In fact, it is still very much an alpha release. The protocol is being actively developed and upcoming updates will give it more power and make it more efficient.</p><p>One important upcoming feature is “<a href="https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/783">collections and provenance</a>.” This will allow creators to clearly authenticate that a group of ordinals are part of the same collection. The technique used to enable this feature is in itself a powerful feature: the ability for an ordinal to reference another ordinal. The collection provenance is established by having a parent collection ordinal that is referenced by its many children ordinals that are all members of the collection. This has two significant advantages: provenance for the collection is very clear, and storage space required to store all of the data for the child ordinals can be greatly reduced by reusing data in the parent. </p><p>This is what we did with our ordinal inscription: you can see what collection provenance looks like for yourself in<a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/fb162a46943e5d7d31d72ee2c8c850e66c1ca5d0d453068aa63883528285ed21i0"> Ordinal inscription 20219.</a> This standard will improve security and provenance for everyone, and we need that to keep people from being scammed. Right now, creators are passing around ad-hoc lists of ordinals that they say are “a collection.” Because marketplaces and explorers only get some of this metadata, they have a hard time verifying the provenance of these lists.</p><p>If we can get a standard set up and running, it can always be improved. In the interim, it will give the teams building Bitcoin NFT DApps (like wallets and explorers) the infrastructure they need. </p><p>Ordinals is kickstarting a new renaissance of Bitcoin development and bringing in a new wave of Bitcoin users.<br></p><p>We have seen this on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. Except this time, it’s happening on the most decentralized, most secure and highest-valued blockchain. Bitcoin could easily have the highest-valued individual NFTs, and even the highest market cap overall for all NFTs. And as more users come to Bitcoin, it will only become more secure. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Danny Yang.

This year, he’ll be participating in a panel discussion, “<a href="https://twitter.com/TheBitcoinConf/status/1643333785189228545">Bitcoin’s Biggest Bulls</a>,” alongside Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Strike CEO Jack Mallers, two of the Bitcoin industry’s most notable and influential executives.</p><p>“Bitcoin 2023 feels slightly different from past years,” Odell said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “The stakes have never been higher.”</p><p>As an emcee and speaker at the Bitcoin Conference, Odell routinely advocates for projects working to advance Bitcoin privacy, security and functionality. And as an advisor to the event’s programming, he ensures that those advancing Bitcoin on a technical level have the opportunity to demonstrate the importance of their work on stage themselves. </p><p>“The industry moves so fast, it is hard to keep up, and that is beautiful,” Odell reflected. “We need these tools and we need them to be easier to use, and fortunately, we have open-source contributors around the world dedicated to building them out. It is easy to dismiss Bitcoin as tech, as code, but ultimately, it is a movement of individuals. This movement will succeed on the shoulders of those individuals who choose to stand up and contribute.”</p><p>Odell’s advocacy for the developers who make Bitcoin one of the most critical open-source protocols ever invented is well known among listeners of his popular podcasts “<a href="https://www.podpage.com/citadeldispatch/">Citadel Dispatch</a>” and “<a href="https://rhr.tv/">Rabbit Hole Recap</a>.” He also works to highlight Bitcoin’s technical progress in person at <a href="https://bitcoinpark.com/">Bitcoin Park</a> in Nashville and through the donation platform <a href="https://opensats.org/">OpenSats</a>. </p><p>Most recently, he launched “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe0djdakvnFZXeCfiUCHBkglIYaTm7etw">Freedom Money</a>,” a documentary series produced by Bitcoin Magazine as another way to showcase privacy advocates and the emerging importance of Bitcoin. The six-episode series has featured <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-financial-freedom-in-afghanistan">Afghan pioneer Roya Mahboob</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ihate1999?lang=en">Nigerian Bitcoin Core contributor Abubakar Nur Khalil</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jewherilham?lang=en">Uyghar human rights advocate Jewher Ilham</a>, among others.</p><p>“My guests on ‘Freedom Money’ were particularly impressive, they all put their lives on the line to fight for freedom every day,” Odell explained. “Working with activists is truly humbling and really makes you appreciate why this mission is so important. My focus will continue to be freedom tech, forever. Our politicians are corrupt and our institutions are broken, freedom tech is the only real option we have.”</p><p>Indeed, Odell’s commitment to showcasing advocates of freedom technology has made him a rare and cherished personality within the Bitcoin space — so much so that the very idea that he would pursue selfish ends has become <a href="https://the-bitcoin-bugle.ghost.io/matt-odell-accidentally-tweets-from-alt-account-revealed-to-be-living-top-g-lifestyle/">the stuff of satire</a>. This is what makes him such an integral aspect of the Bitcoin Conference, an open tent where the loudest and brightest voices in Bitcoin could easily overshadow the builders if organizers didn’t advocate for them so fiercely.</p><p>And, in a year that has already demonstrated why individuals need a tool for preserving their wealth outside of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/little-known-surveillance-program-captures-money-transfers-between-u-s-and-more-than-20-countries-11674019904">government control</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-trust-banks-choose-bitcoin">centralized banking promises</a>, Odell is ensuring the Bitcoin 2023 platform showcases this way out.</p><p>“Bitcoin 2023 will celebrate the power of Bitcoin as a defensive tool for anyone who chooses to use it and should help many see they have the ability to opt out of our broken system without permission,” he concluded. “Bitcoin is a lifeboat, but it is up to individuals to get off the sinking ship themselves.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3MDYzODQyNTk1ODczODc1/image.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Magic Eden Announces Ordinals Launchpad For Bitcoin Inscription Collections]]></title><description><![CDATA[The new Launchpad will provide those looking to inscribe directly onto Bitcoin an easy way to build their collection.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/magic-eden-announces-ordinals-launchpad</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/magic-eden-announces-ordinals-launchpad</guid><category><![CDATA[Inscriptions]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[NFT]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 18:08:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5MzcyOTEy/network-nodes.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The new Launchpad will provide those looking to inscribe directly onto Bitcoin an easy way to build their collection.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>, an NFT platform, has announced the opening of a Launchpad to inscribe collections using the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>This comes shortly after the platform's launch of an Ordinals marketplace, which has helped Magic Eden become the “top marketplace for trading Bitcoin inscriptions,” according to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magic-eden-introduces-launchpad-for-bitcoin-ordinals-creators-301791692.html">press release</a>.<br><br>The press release describes the company’s goal of offering a safe and secure platform for creators to launch their collections, with the first collection launch scheduled for April 7, 2023.

The BTFP allows banks to borrow money from the Fed at a predetermined interest rate with the goal of ensuring that banks can continue to lend money to households and businesses. In particular, the BTFP allows qualified lenders to pledge Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to the Fed at par, which allows banks to avoid realizing current unrealized losses on their bond portfolios, despite the historic rise in interest rates over the past 18 months. Ultimately, this helps support economic growth and protects banks in the process.</p><p>The cause for the tremendous amount of unrealized losses in the banking sector, particularly for regional banks, is due to the historic spike in deposits that came as a result of the COVID-induced stimulus, just as bond yields were at historic lows. </p><p>Shown below is the year-over-year change in small, domestically chartered commercial banks (blue), and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (red). </p><p><em>TLDR: Historic relative spike in deposits with short-term interest rates at 0% and long-duration interest rates near their generational lows.&nbsp;</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>The reason that these unrealized losses on the bank’s security portfolios have not been widely discussed earlier is due to the opaque accounting practices in the industry that allow unrealized losses to be essentially hidden, unless the banks needed to raise cash. </p><p>The BTFP enables banks to continue to hold these assets to maturity (at least temporarily), and allow for these institutions to borrow from the Federal Reserve with the use of their currently underwater bonds as collateral. </p><p>The impacts of this facility — plus the recent spike of borrowing at the Fed’s discount window — has brought about a hotly debated topic in financial circles: Is the latest Fed intervention another form of quantitative easing?<em><br></em></p><p>In the most simple terms, quantitative easing (QE) is an asset swap, where the central bank purchases a security from the banking system and in return, the bank gets new bank reserves on their balance sheet. The intended effect is to inject new liquidity into the financial system while supporting asset prices by lowering yields. In short, QE is a monetary policy tool where a central bank purchases a fixed amount of bonds at any price.</p><p>Though the Fed has attempted to communicate that these new policies are not balance sheet expansion in the traditional sense, many market participants have come to question the validity of such a claim.</p><p>If we simply look at the response from various asset classes since the introduction of this liquidity provision and the new central bank credit facility, we get quite an interesting picture: Treasury bonds and equities have caught a bid, the dollar has weakened and bitcoin has soared.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MDYxNjk4NjAxOTUyMzM5/treasury-bond-index-vs-dxy.png" height="315" width="620">

        <figcaption>Bitcoin soared with the liquidity being added into the system from the BTFP.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>On the surface, the facility is purely to “provide liquidity” to financial institutions with constrained balance sheets (read: mark-to-market insolvency), but if we closely examine the effect of BTFP from first principles, it is clear that the facility provides liquidity to institutions experiencing balance sheet constraint, while simultaneously keeping these institutions from liquidating long-duration treasuries on the open market in a firesale.</p><p>Academics and economists can debate the nuances and intricacies of Fed policy action until they are blue in the face, but the reaction function from the market is more than clear: Balance sheet number go up = Buy risk assets.</p><p>Make no mistake about it, the entire game is now about liquidity in global financial markets. It did not used to be this way, but central bank largesse has created a monstrosity that knows nothing other than fiscal and monetary support during times of even the slightest distress. While the short-to-medium term looks uncertain, market participants and sidelined onlookers should be well aware as to how this all ends. </p><p>Perpetual monetary expansion is an absolute certainty. The elaborate dance played by politicians and central bankers in the meantime is an attempt to make it look as if they can keep the ship afloat, but in reality, the global fiat monetary system is like an irreversibly damaged ship that’s already struck an iceberg. </p><p>Let us not forget that there is no way out of 120% debt-to-GDP as a sovereign without either a massive unforeseen and unlikely productivity boom, or a sustained period of inflation above the level of interest rates — which would crash the economy. Given that the latter is extraordinarily unlikely to occur in real terms, financial repression, i.e., inflation above the level of interest rates, appears to be the path going forward.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>CPI continues to run hot at the same time the debt-to-GDP ration is incredibly high.</figcaption>
    </figure><h4>Final Note</h4><p>For the layman, there is no dire need to get caught up in the schematics of the debate whether recent Fed policy is quantitative easing or not. Instead, the question that deserves to be asked is what would have happened to the financial system if the Federal Reserve didn’t conjure up $360 billion worth of liquidity from thin air over the last month? Widespread bank runs? Collapsing financial institutions? Soaring bond yields that send global markets spiraling downwards? All were possible and even likely and this highlights the increasing fragility of the system. </p><p>Bitcoin offers an engineering solution to peacefully opt out of the politically corrupted construct colloquially known as fiat money. Volatility will persist, exchange rate fluctuations should be expected, but the end game is as clear as ever.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Blockworks highlighted<a href="https://blockworks.co/news/tokenized-home-nets-thousands"> this “advancement”</a> in technology without properly addressing the potential side effects that widespread asset tokenization may cause. In the comments section, tokenization is touted as a means for individuals who are unable to purchase a home of their own to participate in the real estate market. But why are houses so expensive in the first place?</p><p>Because they are being used as stores of value, a former function of fiat money that is no longer possible due to decades of fiscal and monetary alchemy that has decimated peoples’ purchasing power. </p><p>Tokenizing assets like real estate will only make matters worse as crowds shove money into the market, driving prices higher. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. People buy houses because they know the prices will go up, then the prices do go up and more demand comes in to chase the gains. Every investor following their individual incentives puts owning a home further out of reach for the average citizen. This is not a solution. </p><p>Furthermore, a “blockchain” is simply a ledger, or record of who owns what. With Ethereum especially, there is no meaningful link to the real world which would allow for native contract enforcement, preventing rug pulls of these token holders. The whole system ultimately relies upon legacy law enforcement and the judicial system to uphold the property rights of these investors — a system that appears to be increasingly hostile in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/dr-doom-economist-nouriel-roubini-says-the-crypto-apocalypse-is-coming-as-sec-chair-gensler-asks-for-more-funding-to-catch-bad-actors/ar-AA19hlO8">enforcement actions</a> against the crypto industry writ large. </p><p>Bitcoin adoption is fundamentally different, a fact that crypto folks seem to misunderstand completely. Rather than mindlessly tokenizing assets, Bitcoin seeks to fix the monetary issues that drive a desire to do so in the first place. By serving as an actual store of value, bitcoin will drain the monetary premium that real estate has accrued over the past decades due to the broken monetary system. Under a bitcoin standard, housing will ultimately collapse to its utility value, making houses affordable once more to the everyday citizen. </p><p>Tokenization is just another perpetuation of the current system in a faux peer-to-peer wrapper, disguised as financial innovation. Don’t let the new shiny thing distract you from what’s broken. Fix the money, and all of these things become meaningless. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.
