A successful flip of this level into a support zone could potentially pave the way for further gains.  Market analysts speculate that should this support level be reclaimed, DOT could make strides towards $5.50 and potentially reach $6. However, a rejection at these levels could send DOT on a downward trajectory, with a potential dip towards the $4.5 range. $DOT #Polkadot If it goes down to the last low at $4 it would be a 16% loss.
