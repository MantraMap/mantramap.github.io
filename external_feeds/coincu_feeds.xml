<ul>
<li><em>Worldcoin published the security audit report on its official blog on July 28.</em></li>



<li><em>The report stated that 92.6% were identified as fixed, with the remaining bugs either mitigated or re-verified.</em></li>



<li><em>Regulators previously reviewed the protocol due to concerns about potential privacy risks associated with the collection and storage of sensitive biometric data.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Worldcoin published a security audit report on its official blog that starting April 2023, audit firms Nethermind and Least Authority conducted two independent security audits of the protocol.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learn more about the results of two separate security audits of the Worldcoin protocol, performed by <a href="https://twitter.com/NethermindEth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@NethermindEth</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/LeastAuthority?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@LeastAuthority</a>.<a href="https://t.co/fXa50wNBYE" target="_blank">https://t.co/fXa50wNBYE</a></p>&mdash; Worldcoin (@worldcoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1685017542484541441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Among them, Nethermind focused on examining the smart contract of the agreement and found a total of 26 issues. Of these, 92.6% were fixed after the verification phase, one bug was mitigated, and the other was confirmed.</p>



<p>The Least Authority focused on examining the cryptographic usage of the protocol, found three problems, and made six recommendations. All issues are &#8220;solved or planned to be solved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Worldcoin first surfaced in 2021 when it announced that it would give away free tokens to any user who verified their humanity, which they could do by scanning their irises with a device named &#8220;The Globe&#8221;. The project was co-founded by Sam Altman, the co-founder of AI developer OpenAI. The project started going public on July 25 after nearly two years of development and beta testing.</p>



<p>The crypto community was split when the project launched, with some participants seeing it as the beginning of a dystopian future where privacy would be eliminated. On the contrary, others see it as a necessary step to protect humans from malicious AIs.</p>



<p>Previously, the French and UK watchdogs had also warned that they would scrutinize the protocol with concerns about potential privacy risks associated with data collection and storage of sensitive biometrics.</p>

<p>The initiative is led by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), and supported by Senators Joe Manchin (<a href="http://d-w.va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D-W.Va</a>.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Their proposal, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, aims to enforce stricter regulation of digital assets to fortify national security and align the crypto ecosystem with the existing frameworks that oversee the broader financial system.</p>

To eliminate these illicit activities, the proposed measures would extend the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) responsibilities, including the Know-Your-Customer requirements, to various digital asset network participants, such as wallet providers, miners, and validators. Additionally, the bill plans to strengthen the enforcement of BSA compliance and mitigate the illicit finance risks of digital asset ATMs.</p>

<p>According to reports, in 2022, illicit digital asset transactions reached an all-time high of $20 billion. This alarming statistic highlights the need for more stringent regulations around cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, the bill has garnered support from unlikely sources in the banking world, such as the Bank Policy Institute and the Massachusetts Bankers Association. Senator Warren, a known critic of Wall Street and the crypto industry, has found common ground with these former adversaries on this issue &#8211; a mutual desire to steer cryptocurrencies into safer harbors.</p>

<p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is a critical step towards combating the misuse of digital assets and ensuring greater security for the nation. The proposed measures will bring digital assets in line with existing financial regulations, thereby reducing the risks of illicit activities while also promoting safer and more transparent practices in the crypto industry.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Attorneys representing the US Department of Justice (DOJ) want the court to recover the bail and remand Sam Bankman-Fried before the October trial.</em></li>



<li><em>In the letter, Friday stated that Bankman-Fried had a history of witness tampering.</em></li>



<li><em>Before that, Bankman-Fried had &#8220;many times&#8221; tried to influence witnesses and interfere with a fair trial.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/doj-sbf-bail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockwork</a>, a letter from attorneys representing the US Department of Justice (DOJ) pushed to recover Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bail and put him in jail ahead of his trial in October.</strong></h5>

<p>Attorneys representing the US Department of Justice are formally seeking a &#8220;retention order&#8221; against former FTX Sam Bankman-Fried, according to a new court letter.</p>



<p>In federal court on Wednesday, prosecutor Danielle Sassoon said there were &#8220;no conditions of release that would guarantee public safety,&#8221; a week after the US Justice Department charged Bankman-Fried with leaking the private diary of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison to the media.</p>



<p>The letter on Friday claimed that Bankman-Fried had a history of witness tampering. Specifically, the government said Bankman-Fried contacted Witness-1, &#8220;the current General Counsel of FTX US, who may be a witness at the trial&#8221; through the Signal messaging app.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2196.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2196-1024x684.png" alt="DOJ Seeks Detention Order With Sam Bankman-Fired For Witness Impact" class="wp-image-207015" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2196-1024x684.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2196-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2196-768x513.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2196-750x501.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2196-1140x761.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2196.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DOJ Seeks Detention Order With Sam Bankman-Fired For Witness Impact 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The government does that Bankman-Fried has the &#8220;right to speak and defend himself to the press, even on hundreds of occasions as [is] the case here&#8221; but that Bankman-Fried has &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; sought to &#8220;corruptly influence witnesses and interfere with a fair trial through attempted public harassment and shaming.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a result, the letter continued, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s inability to comply with any condition or combination of release and bail conditions proved &#8220;insufficient.&#8221;</p>



<p>On November 11, 2022, FTX declared bankruptcy after reports of financial vulnerabilities were published. Before its collapse, FTX was valued at $32 billion and had more than a million users. Sam Bankman-Fried currently faces eight counts, mostly related to fraud and financial conspiracies, with a maximum sentence of life in prison. But so far, he has denied all related allegations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to the WSJ, Binance CEO and Changpeng Zhao (CZ) have been reviewed by the German regulator, but the exchange has denied the information.</em></li>



<li><em>German Federal Finance (BaFin) advised Binance to withdraw its license application based on concerns about the complex structure of Changpeng Zhao and Binance.</em></li>



<li><em>The cryptocurrency exchange said it has actively withdrawn its license application and will continue to cooperate with the country&#8217;s regulatory authorities.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Germany&#8217;s financial regulator advised <a href="https://coincu.com/206974-sec-and-binance-unite-to-thwart-eeon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> to withdraw its license application because of concerns about founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and the cryptocurrency company&#8217;s complex structure, according to people familiar with the decision and an internal Binance document <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binances-founder-drew-scrutiny-from-german-regulator-2e890a31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viewed</a> by the Wall Street Journal.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a July 28 report from The Wall Street Journal, BaFin advised Binance that CZ may not have passed a &#8220;fit and proper&#8221; test under the financial watchdog&#8217;s regulatory guidelines. According to the regulator&#8217;s requirements for a license application, managing directors CZ must have the necessary professional credentials, be in good standing, and commit enough time to carry out their duties in order to manage an institution.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Binance <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/german-regulator-raised-concerns-binance-ceo-license-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told </a>Cointelegraph that The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s story was incorrect and said the exchange had actively pulled back and cooperated with regulators. The exchange should have given specific feedback on CZ-related details at the time of publication.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange announced on July 26 that it had withdrawn its application in Germany, saying at the time that the decision was based in part on centralizing the company&#8217;s efforts into compliance with the European Union&#8217;s Crypto Asset Market (MiCA) framework.</p>



<p>The move comes after pulling out of markets including Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands and when regulators sued its US arm for operating an unregistered exchange.</p>



<p>Currently, Binance and its CEO are facing legal actions brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allegedly violating securities laws and corresponding transaction instructions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In addition to the hype of Liquid Staking after the 2nd largest network Ethereum market successfully implemented the Shanghai upgrade, LSD and LST present unprecedented new opportunities in the DeFi market, something that every stakeholder of DeFi will need to understand to keep up. However, many people still need to understand these two concepts well and need to know which term is correct. So let&#8217;s find out in the article below.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The concept of LSD and LST appeared</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2155.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="740" height="492" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2155.png" alt="Is There A Difference Between LSD And LST Terms?

Which Right? 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If you hold a staking cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum, Tezos, Cosmos, Solana, Cardano or others), you can stake a portion of your holdings and earn rewards.</p>



<p>Your cryptocurrency earns you staking rewards because the blockchain makes it work. Cryptocurrency staking uses a &#8220;consensus mechanism&#8221; known as Proof of Stake, which allows them to ensure that all transactions are verified and secure without needing an intermediary bank or payment processor. If you lock it, your cryptocurrency is part of the process.</p>



<p>LSD and LST have emerged due to the growing popularity of the Liquid Staking market among crypto investors. This hype must make us reiterate the Ethereum network&#8217;s transition to Proof-Of-Stake on September 15, 2022, and at this point it is still not possible to cancel the already staked ETH staking. This is a pretty big deal, as some bettors have been waiting since December 2020 to start claiming their rewards. However, this issue was resolved with the Shanghai Upgrade, which took place on April 12, 2023. The Shanghai Upgrade <a href="https://coincu.com/181294-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-liquid-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allows</a> validators to cancel their ETH staking at any time, providing family of higher liquidity options.</p>



<p>This creates a dilemma for ETH validators. By keeping their ETH staked, they lost the opportunity to use it for other profitable activities, however, by canceling the staking, they lose the passive income they received from transaction fees. In an ideal world, they would be able to keep their ETH staking, while still having the liquidity to deploy it in additional revenue-generating DeFi operations.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that two competing terms are being thrown around: Liquidity Staking Derivatives (LSD) and Liquidity Staking Tokens (LST). It refers to encrypted representations of staking assets in the blockchain network, providing flexibility and liquidity while earning staking rewards. LST can be traded or used in DeFi protocols.</p>



<p>Liquid Staking Tokens (LST) could be tokens issued on another layer or chain (e.g., an Ethereum token representing staked assets on a different Proof-of-Stake blockchain). These LSTs would be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). They can be used as collateral or participate in other DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications, offering more flexibility to token holders while their original staked tokens continue to earn staking rewards.</p>



<p>Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) might refer to financial instruments or derivatives products built on top of Liquid Staking solutions. These derivatives would be linked to the underlying staked assets and their associated rewards. By using derivatives, investors can gain exposure to the staking benefits without directly participating in staking themselves.</p>



<p>Many long-term crypto holders see staking as a way to put their assets to work by generating rewards rather than letting crypto wallets collect dust. Staking also contributes to the security and efficiency of the blockchain projects you support. Blocking some of your funds makes the blockchain more resistant to attacks and enhances its transaction processing capabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Is there a difference between LSD and LST?</h2>



<p>LSD is the most widely used term today, so we included it in this introductory article, but everyone agrees that the word is not technically correct.</p>



<p>The idea of LSD as derivatives has helped many users understand the concept by being similar to traditional financial derivatives. One could speculate that the familiarity of the acronym due to a well-known hallucinogen also contributed to the enduring strength of the moniker.</p>



<p>In practice, however, the analogy with derivatives is not entirely accurate, and the Proof Of Stake Alliance <a href="https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/22123-posa-liquid-staking-legal-white-paper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has called</a> for a switch to using the more technically correct term &#8220;Liquid Staking Tokens&#8221; (LST) instead of LSD.</p>



<p>One of the main goals of this change is to have greater adoption of liquid staking technology and blockchain innovation. The name of the liquid staking receipt token should accurately reflect its underlying asset &#8211; it is incorrect to name a liquid staking token an LSD or liquid staking derivative.</p>

Which Right?" class="wp-image-206904" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2159-1024x482.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2159-300x141.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2159-768x362.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2159-750x353.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2159.png 1093w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Is There A Difference Between LSD And LST Terms?

<p>LSTs act as a blockchain-based record verifying that the holder has staked the corresponding token, owns that token, and can present the record to unstake it whenever required. With the lack of regulatory and tax clarity surrounding liquid staking tokens, it is important to avoid using phrases like LSD and instead use accurate and clear terminology to describe the nature of activities.</p>



<p>The Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) published two landmark white papers in February 2023, providing the first legal research and analysis that identifies and examines key questions around regulation and taxation for liquidity staking in the United States.</p>



<p>The articles, created by the first working group to bring together policy and legal experts, business leaders, and competitors to address key liquidity staking issues, were published and released together with LST-related industry best practice guidelines.</p>



<p>Research by the working group of legal, policy, and industry experts reason that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Liquid staking receipt tokens (LSTs) for digital commodities should not be considered investment contracts or notes, and, therefore, should not be treated as securities under the U.S. federal securities laws;</li>



<li>LSTs should not be considered swaps under U.S. federal commodity law;</li>



<li>The conversion&nbsp;of cryptoassets&nbsp;for receipt tokens should not be considered a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;</li>



<li>It is important to name tokens appropriately based on the reality of the nature of the relationship between the underlying token and the receipt token. The group recommends accurately and appropriately describing liquid staking receipts as “Liquid Staking Tokens”or “LSTs” instead of the inaccurate but commonly used term “Liquid Staking Derivatives” or “LSDs.”</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In short, LSD or LST are both terms that unlock the staked tokens held by stakers and allow them to be traded and used as collateral in DeFi protocols. The terms LST and LSD have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably. However, regulatory uncertainty encourages the community to use the word LST.</p>



<p>2023 will see LSD/LST go from hype to the foundation of the new DeFi economy. To achieve this, new options must emerge to unlock only revenue-generation opportunities that LSD/LST offers.</p>



<p>LSD/LST offers one of the most exciting new opportunities for DeFi investors right now, offering the opportunity to receive passive income from staking ETH while also putting it to work in operations and other profit through LSD/LST.</p>



<p>The key to increasing the TVL of staking ETH lies in expanding the utility of LSD/LST. While the liquidity provided by LSD/LST, in principle, offers limitless potential, the options available to put them to work in profitable operations are still limited at the moment.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>There is a clear opportunity for the traditional finance industry to bring tremendous value to the crypto market by adopting Real world assets (RWA) with blockchain technology. So how is this combination created, and does its applicability really meet expectations?</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How did Real World Assets (RWA) enter the blockchain world?</h2>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/205716-real-world-assets-rwas-integrated-defi-protocols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Real World Assets (RWA) </a>are assets that possess a value that is inherent, tangible, or physical in nature and resides in the physical world. RWA&#8217;s scope is broad and includes everything from actual items such as real estate, liquor, merchandise, artwork, and vehicles, to contractual or legal rights such as patents and copyrights.</p>



<p>Tokenization is the process of representing ownership of RWA as digital tokens on a blockchain. This method transforms physical assets like real estate, precious metals, and commodities into digital tokens with unique attributes, allowing them to be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. Tokenization brings RWA into the crypto space, breaking down barriers that previously hindered access to these lucrative markets.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2174.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2174.png" alt="Real World Assets (RWA) And Applications In Blockchain" class="wp-image-206947" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2174.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2174-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2174-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2174-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Real World Assets (RWA) And Applications In Blockchain 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why RWA needs to combine with blockchain</h2>



<p>Real World Assets is a <a href="https://www.rwa.xyz/blog/primer-on-real-world-assets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bridge </a>between the current cryptocurrency market, real-world assets and resources, and the mainstream financial market, as a mechanism that benefits all participants.</p>



<p>By encrypting these assets, RWA creates a transparent and secure environment where ownership is recorded on an immutable ledger. This ensures trust and reduces counterparty risk, enhancing the overall security of the asset class.</p>



<p>Tokenization of these assets on a blockchain platform allows partial ownership, allowing investors to buy and sell smaller portions of these assets. This process dramatically increases liquidity in the market, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions without going through intermediaries or complicated legal procedures.</p>



<p>In addition to stability, Profitable RWA (yRWA) provides an additional avenue for income generation in the crypto market. yRWAs allow investors to earn a stream of interest or income from the underlying asset. This income can be derived from rental payments, dividends, interest, or other sources of revenue related to the property.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has undergone significant infrastructural development, with robust blockchain networks and decentralized exchanges. These advancements provide a solid foundation for the tokenization and trading of real-world assets, allowing for seamless integration of RWAs into the existing ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Applications of RWA in blockchain</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Real Estate Investment</strong></h3>



<p>One significant application of real world assets in crypto is the tokenization of real estate properties. Due to high capital requirements and illiquidity, real estate investment has been limited to high-net-worth individuals or institutional investors. However, tokenization allows for fractional ownership, enabling multiple investors to own a property jointly.</p>



<p>Fractional ownership opens the doors for an overall range of investors to participate in real estate investments, making it easier for individuals with limited capital to diversify their portfolios. In addition, tokenization streamlines the process of buying and selling real estate assets, as ownership transfer becomes as simple as transferring tokens on the blockchain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Forex Trading</strong></h3>



<p>Commodities like gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products are essential components of traditional investment portfolios. Integrating these assets into the crypto space through tokenization offers numerous benefits. Tokenization liquidity enables users to trade commodities 24/7 on cryptocurrency exchanges. It also facilitates fractional ownership, making it possible for investors to own a portion of valuable commodities that may have been out of reach in the traditional market.</p>



<p>Furthermore, tokenization reduces the complexity of traditional commodity trading, as it relates to transparent intermediaries, and provides a decentralized platform for transactions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Art and Collectibles</strong></h3>



<p>The world of art and collectibles has always been exclusive, with only a select few having access to valuable artworks and rare collectibles. Tokenization presents a groundbreaking opportunity to democratize this space. Investors can own fractional shares of these assets by tokenizing valuable art pieces and collectibles.</p>



<p>This newfound accessibility allows a wider audience to invest in art and collectibles and liquidity in the market. Tokenized assets can be easily traded on various crypto platforms, making it more convenient for art enthusiasts and investors to buy, sell, or exchange their shares.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venture Capital and Private Equity</strong></h3>



<p>Traditionally, investing in private companies or venture capital funds has been reserved for accredited investors and institutions. However, tokenizing real-world assets in the form of equity shares brings innovation to this space. Startups can raise capital by selling tokens that represent equity in their retail ventures, opening up opportunities for investors to participate in early-stage investments.</p>



<p>Tokenization also enables easier and faster transfer of ownership, allowing investors to exit their investments more smoothly than in traditional private equity markets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></h3>



<p>The realm of intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, can greatly benefit from blockchain-based tokenization. Creators and inventors can tokenize their intellectual property assets, granting them greater control over their creations and enabling transparent monetization.</p>



<p>By using smart contracts, tokenization ensures that creators receive royalties and licensing fees automatically when their work is used or reproduced, reducing overhead and protecting the intellectual property rights of creators.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Debt Instruments</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond equity, tokenization also extends to debt instruments. RWA, like mortgages, loans, and bonds, can be transformed into digital securities. Tokenizing debt instruments provides various advantages, including improved liquidity, easier transferability, and reduced transaction costs.</p>



<p>For tokenized debt instruments present an opportunity to diversify their investment portfolios further and participate in fixed-income assets with greater ease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong></h3>



<p>Blockchain technology has already proven its worth in enhancing supply chain transparency, traceability, and efficiency. By integrating real-world assets into the blockchain, companies can offer consumers more insights into the origins and journey of products.</p>



<p>Tokenization can be used to represent physical assets at different stages of the supply chain, ensuring that the product&#8217;s authenticity and quality are maintained and that consumers can trust the information provided.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stablecoins</strong></h3>



<p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their worth to a reserve of real-world assets. These assets can include fiat currency, precious metals, or other commodities. By backing stablecoins with tangible assets, users can have confidence that their value will not be subject to extreme volatility, making them more practical for daily transactions and as a store of value.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The integration of real-world assets into the crypto space through tokenization represents a groundbreaking leap in finance. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can democratize investment opportunities, increase liquidity, and promote transparency in traditional markets. These applications of real-world assets in crypto are not only reshaping finance but also contributing to the wider adoption of blockchain technology across various industries. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative applications that bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>CoinsPaid, a major crypto payments provider, reports a $37 million hack by North Korea&#8217;s Lazarus Group.</em></li>



<li><em>The hack led to a temporary suspension of operations, but customer funds were unaffected.</em></li>



<li><em>The company collaborates with law enforcement and blockchain security firms to mitigate the impact.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinsPaid, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency payments provider, disclosed a staggering $37 million hack, attributing the cyber attack to the infamous Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked hacking organization, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/crypto-firm-turns-to-estonian-authorities-after-37-million-hack#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192-1024x512.png" alt="CoinsPaid Battles Hackers In $37M Crypto Attack With Support By Estonian Authorities" class="wp-image-207000" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2192.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="CoinsPaid Battles Hackers In $37M Crypto Attack With Support By Estonian Authorities 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The incident was promptly reported to Estonian police for investigation, with the company working closely with law enforcement and enlisting the assistance of various blockchain security firms to minimize the fallout from the exploit, which occurred on July 22.</p>



<p>While CoinsPaid refrained from detailing the exact method used to siphon the funds, the breach forced the platform to temporarily suspend its operations for four days. Fortunately, the hack did not compromise any customer funds, but it did inflict significant damage to its internal systems and balance sheet.</p>



<p>Despite the massive sum stolen, the company believes the hackers had even grander ambitions, aiming for a much larger haul. In response to the breach, the company filed an official report with Estonian authorities and embarked on a preliminary investigation with the help of blockchain security firms like Chainalysis, Match Systems, and Crystal.</p>



<p>The hack on CoinsPaid is part of a larger trend in the cryptocurrency industry, with damages from such cyber attacks reaching a record $3.8 billion in 2022, attributed to a surge in activities linked to North Korea, according to Chainalysis Inc.</p>

<p>As the investigation continues, the company is now back in operation within a new, limited environment. The company expressed optimism that its systems are functioning normally, and it is actively devising new initiatives to fortify its security measures and prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>



<p>The hacking incident involving CoinsPaid was not isolated in Estonia, as the nation&#8217;s police were also looking into a suspected $100 million crypto theft from Atomic Wallet in June. Moreover, the blockchain security firm SlowMist has <a href="https://coincu.com/206197-lazarus-group-supposed-behind-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> a possible connection between the CoinsPaid hack and two other recent breaches, one involving <a href="https://coincu.com/197061-atomic-wallet-0-1-of-users-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Wallet</a> and another concerning <a href="https://coincu.com/205773-alphapo-hot-wallet-losses-surge-to-60m-zachxbt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alphapo</a>, which saw losses of $100 million and $60 million, respectively.</p>



<p>CoinsPaid, based in Tallinn and boasting a workforce of 230 employees, has weathered the storm with its customers&#8217; funds remaining unscathed, although the company admits to incurring undisclosed revenue losses due to the attack. The firm&#8217;s resilience and cooperation with law enforcement and blockchain security experts demonstrate its commitment to safeguarding its platform and the interests of its users in an increasingly challenging cybersecurity landscape.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>US House Committee passes landmark crypto self-custody bill.</em></li>



<li><em>The legislation ensures investors&#8217; control of digital assets in their wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>Bill defines crypto classification and enhances regulatory oversight.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, the US House Financial Services Committee has passed a groundbreaking bill known as the &#8220;Keep Your Coins Act of 2023.&#8221;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2190.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1002" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2190.png" alt="US House Committee Now Passes Landmark Crypto Self-Custody Bill" class="wp-image-206994" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2190.png 1002w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2190-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2190-768x511.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2190-750x499.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px" title="US House Committee Now Passes Landmark Crypto Self-Custody Bill 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Spearheaded by Republican congressman Warren Davidson, the legislation aims to safeguard the right to crypto self-custody, allowing investors to maintain custody of their digital assets in their own wallets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States has been marked by inconsistency, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopting an enforcement-first approach and targeting major cryptocurrency exchanges through lawsuits. However, the passage of the &#8220;Keep Your Coins Act&#8221; marks a notable step in the right direction for crypto enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1684887973769199616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed</a> his satisfaction with the bill&#8217;s passage, underscoring its significance in upholding individual freedom and protecting against centralization risks that the market may pose.</p>



<p>The legislation also addresses one of the key risks identified by the FTX Failure, ensuring investors&#8217; right to retain control of their own cryptocurrency. It explicitly prohibits Federal Agencies from restricting the use of convertible virtual currency for purchasing goods and services and other personal purposes.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-1024x681.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="681" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-1024x681.jpeg" alt="US House Committee Now Passes Landmark Crypto Self-Custody Bill" class="wp-image-206995" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-1024x681.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-1536x1022.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-2048x1362.jpeg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-750x499.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/t-scaled-1-1140x758.jpeg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US House Committee Now Passes Landmark Crypto Self-Custody Bill 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Moreover, the bill seeks to define when a cryptocurrency is classified as a security or a commodity, enhancing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight of the cryptocurrency industry while clarifying the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some crypto advocates have raised concerns about the SEC&#8217;s aggressive approach, and this bill attempts to strike a balance.</p>



<p>However, not all voices are in support of the bill. Democrats have criticized it, arguing that it grants the CFTC more regulatory power over the digital asset space without increasing the agency&#8217;s funding. They fear that this could potentially facilitate future fraud, as the CFTC has historically taken a softer stance on crypto companies compared to the SEC.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the passage of the bill is a significant milestone for the crypto industry in the US. It provides a comprehensive framework that blends securities and commodities regulations for digital assets, adding clarity to the regulatory landscape. Furthermore, it comes alongside the US House Agriculture Committee <a href="https://coincu.com/206631-house-agriculture-committee-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advancing</a> a separate crypto market regulation bill, showcasing bipartisan support for tackling key issues in the digital asset space.</p>



<p>With multiple <a href="https://coincu.com/206380-crypto-regulatory-framework-bill-house-financial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar bills</a> gaining traction in Congress, including the <a href="https://coincu.com/206573-house-lawmakers-locked-in-battle-stablecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023</a>, the cryptocurrency industry in the US is set to witness notable advancements in terms of regulatory clarity and investor protection. The &#8220;Keep Your Coins Act of 2023&#8221; could mark a turning point in how digital assets are treated in the country, promoting innovation while safeguarding the interests of consumers and investors alike.</p>

<p>The private preview, held in Studio City, California on July 27, gave 40 Voyagers a glimpse into the evolution of <a href="https://coincu.com/136429-otherside-metaverse-expected-launch-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Otherside</a> over the past year.</p>



<p>During the exclusive event, participants were treated to concept art showcasing the ongoing development of Otherside, along with a walk-through of a section of the metaverse&#8217;s central island. The demo showcased the impressive 3D versions of <a href="https://coincu.com/202762-bayc-announces-apefest-in-hong-kong-nov-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BAYC</a> profile pictures (PFPs), giving a glimpse of the avatars ahead of the official release. Additionally, attendees were treated to a teaser of Yuga&#8217;s 2D strategy game, Legends of the Mara.</p>



<p>Michael Figge, Yuga Labs&#8217; Chief Creative Officer, emphasized that Otherside is designed to be a diverse and inclusive space where various communities can create content that resonates with their respective audiences. While Otherside is a product of the Yuga universe, the company aims to allow other communities to contribute and make their own unique choices in shaping the metaverse.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188-1024x544.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="544" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188-1024x544.png" alt="Yuga Labs Unveils New Development For Otherside: Era Of Immersive In Web3" class="wp-image-206988" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188-1024x544.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188-300x159.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188-768x408.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188-1536x816.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188-750x398.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188-1140x605.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2188.png 1919w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Yuga Labs Unveils New Development For Otherside: Era Of Immersive In Web3 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>Figge addressed the challenges of creating a vast game world with significant technical and player support requirements. Despite the challenges, Yuga is striving to foster a densely populated metaverse where users can immerse themselves in meaningful experiences. Figge compared the excitement and connection that Otherside aims to evoke to the early days of the internet, with its forums and chatrooms serving as platforms for interaction.</p>



<p>One of the key reasons behind the trust garnered by Yuga Labs from its holders and the wider community lies in its IP licensing conditions. To strengthen this trust, the company recently introduced the Made by Apes platform, allowing BAYC holders to request unique on-chain licenses, certifying their product offerings.</p>



<p>The scaled-down, in-person demo provided <a href="https://coincu.com/203769-yuga-labs-demands-1-79m-for-counterfeit-rr-bayc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuga Labs</a> with valuable feedback on the technical and creative challenges they are currently addressing. By concentrating on a more focused experience with fewer features, the company seeks to ensure that Otherside becomes an enjoyable destination in its own right.</p>

<p>Yuga Labs&#8217; vision for Otherside has captured the interest of both participants within the Web3 space and those observing from outside. The metaverse represents a promising concept, offering immersive digital experiences, but finding a successful and meaningful implementation has proved elusive until now.</p>



<p>Yuga&#8217;s dedication to creating a densely populated and engaging Otherside may be a significant step toward realizing the full potential of the metaverse. As development continues, the community eagerly anticipates the official launch, excited to explore the diverse possibilities that Otherside has to offer.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>SEC and Binance oppose Eeon&#8217;s bid to intervene in lawsuit on behalf of customers, citing a lack of requirements under the law.</em></li>



<li><em>Eeon&#8217;s counter-claim deemed vague and unrelated to the lawsuit, further weakening its case for intervention.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance files a motion to dismiss the CFTC lawsuit, intensifying regulatory challenges and impacting the crypto market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and cryptocurrency exchange Binance have <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.91.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined</a> forces to oppose a petition submitted by third-party entity &#8220;Eeon,&#8221; seeking intervention in an ongoing lawsuit on behalf of customers.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183-1024x576.png" alt="SEC And Binance Unite To Thwart Eeon&#039;s Intervention Bid In Lawsuit" class="wp-image-206979" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2183.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC And Binance Unite To Thwart Eeon&#039;s Intervention Bid In Lawsuit 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>The dispute has brought to light several critical issues surrounding the legal status and jurisdiction of <a href="https://coincu.com/206699-binance-accuses-cftc-overruling-stop-the-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, one of the world&#8217;s leading crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>The District Court for the District of Columbia received the joint response from both defendant Binance and plaintiff US SEC, firmly opposing Eeon&#8217;s attempts to intervene in the ongoing legal battle. The exchange presented three primary reasons for dismissing Eeon&#8217;s petition.</p>



<p>Firstly, Eeon failed to obtain the necessary consent from the SEC, an essential requirement for intervention under the law. Secondly, the third-party entity did not sufficiently establish itself as a real party with a legitimate interest in the matter. Lastly, Eeon failed to meet the legal criteria for intervention, casting doubts on its eligibility to participate in the proceedings.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2184.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="738" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2184.png" alt="SEC And Binance Unite To Thwart Eeon&#039;s Intervention Bid In Lawsuit" class="wp-image-206981" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2184.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2184-300x216.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2184-768x554.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2184-120x86.png 120w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2184-750x541.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC And Binance Unite To Thwart Eeon&#039;s Intervention Bid In Lawsuit 25"></a></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, Eeon&#8217;s counter-claim was deemed problematic as it presented vague allegations unrelated to the actual lawsuit. These shortcomings led both the SEC and Binance to contend that Eeon&#8217;s involvement would have no tangible impact on the case and is, therefore, unnecessary.</p>



<p>The SEC, in its opposition to Eeon&#8217;s petition, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.92.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised</a> concerns about the entity&#8217;s track record as a serial pro se litigant whose previous causes have failed to gain traction in federal courts. Citing the Exchange Act, the <a href="https://coincu.com/206747-sec-warns-accounting-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> argued that private litigants&#8217; intervention is prohibited, emphasizing that Eeon&#8217;s claims closely align with the defendants&#8217; arguments and, as such, would not contribute to the lawsuit in a meaningful way. Furthermore, Eeon&#8217;s counterclaims seeking relief against both the SEC and Binance were found to be contradictory and untenable.</p>



<p>Thus, both the plaintiff (SEC) and defendants (Binance) firmly stand against any intervention by Eeon in the ongoing lawsuit concerning Binance and its CEO, Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Binance has taken another legal step by <a href="https://coincu.com/205581-binance-cz-file-a-petition-dismiss-cftcs-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing</a> a motion to dismiss the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) lawsuit, contesting the jurisdiction of the global crypto exchange and its ability to sue its CEO, CZ. However, this legal process is expected to extend well into the following year, given the court&#8217;s deadlines for the submission of responses by the CFTC and Binance.</p>



<p>As the legal battle unfolds, the cryptocurrency industry will be closely monitoring the outcome of the SEC lawsuit and the CFTC&#8217;s response to Binance&#8217;s motion to dismiss, as these developments could have far-reaching implications for the sector&#8217;s regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that Binance&#8217;s regulatory challenges and the increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators have already started to impact trading volumes and liquidity on the exchange, affecting the broader cryptocurrency market as a whole.</p>
