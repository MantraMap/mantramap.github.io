<p>Recent regulatory headwinds in the U.S. may have played a significant role in suppressing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-and-cardano-lead-market-weekly-gains-as-market-cap-breaks-1-2-trillion/">Cardano&#8217;s (ADA)</a> price but did little to stop the cryptocurrency&#8217;s adoption.  </p>



<p>Cardano has recorded impressive growth in the past year and a half, with the adoption of ADA nearly doubling in the United States. According to crypto analytics firm “Morning Consult” data, 7% of Americans (roughly 10 million people) currently hold ADA. Notably, as recently as January 2022, that figure stood at 4%, reflecting growth of almost 100%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XxTe3GAjnF2bkUBUvNI5Al0KaoJCBgnFctgiFWZWXBp_YduoUQL-HRukWsx1_v2Tt1Gao3KiNkCsHvwySD1Ld0K1ZnEfyMwRq9_-HAVujm2Iy9mp8lPxAKtZsuqk1PeYskdqXOCgNIbXFXVjn5Q2Ig" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The surge in Cardano&#8217;s adoption can be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-reveals-exciting-vision-for-cardano-ada-this-summer/">attributed</a> to its unique staking capabilities, which have attracted a growing number of users seeking to profit from their holdings. Staking is a decentralized financial service that allows users to earn rewards by holding and validating transactions on a blockchain network. In the past two or so years, staking has gained traction to generate passive income, with Cardano offering an attractive reward of just over 3% per year.</p>



<p>According to data from Staking Rewards, about 62% of all ADA in circulation is currently staked, showing that the practice has become an attractive option for investors. Now, Cardano ranks third after Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in terms of crypto networks with the highest staking rewards. Furthermore, the popularity of centralized exchanges among U.S. users has further contributed to the significant number of stakers, with tens of millions of people potentially staking ADA through these platforms.</p>



<p>Cardano has also maintained a clear advantage over other cryptocurrencies in terms of decentralisation. The Cardano community has actively pushed for more decentralization through various platform advancements, particularly the Cardano Improvement Proposal CIP-1694. In late May, Charles Hoskinson emphasized the importance of decentralization, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hoskinson-cardano-to-achieve-unrivaled-decentralization-in-crypto-after-major-project-developments/">arguing</a> that their goal is to construct Cardano in a manner that serves as a wake-up call for other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>On Friday, June 23, Cardano developer Input Output Global (IOG) launched &#8220;Project Catalyst&#8221;, a decentralized innovation fund of the Cardano ecosystem, to bolster the Cardano network&#8217;s development and growth. A significant sum of 50 million ADA tokens was also allocated for that purpose, making it the largest funding pool for the ecosystem to date.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The Cardano ecosystem needs decentralized funding and innovation mechanisms for its future. We are in the age of Voltaire, and we think a lot about how people govern themselves and the entire ecosystem…when you&#8217;re building from the ground, you need a mechanism to enable that sort of innovation and growth, and that is the role of catalysts,&#8221;</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1672327030069772288">said</a> Tamara Haasen, CEO of IOG.</p>



<p>Cardano&#8217;s architecture has also attracted large numbers of developers, primarily due to its enticing features, such as low fees and rapid transaction speeds. As a result, developers have been increasingly drawn towards the platform, with 1,259 projects now building atop the network and 130 already launched. </p>

<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s senior macro strategist, Mike McGlone, has cautioned that Bitcoin may slide further, despite BlackRock&#8217;s recent application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) boosting BTC’s price.</p>



<p>In the latest monthly report shared on Friday, McGlone highlighted the potential challenges Bitcoin could encounter, including a possible equity bear market and the watchful eye of central banks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin $20,000 or $40,000? Facing the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fed</a>, Recession, Nasdaq &#8211; Potential launch of US ETFs won&#39;t shield <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> from facing its first US <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/recession?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#recession</a>, a potential equity bear market and vigilant central banks. Lessons of risk-assets vs. negative liquidity &amp; economic contraction <a href="https://t.co/plM5c5ihsg">pic.twitter.com/plM5c5ihsg</a></p>&mdash; Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11/status/1672219457513463809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>He emphasized that the launch of US Bitcoin ETFs will not shield the cryptocurrency from the aforementioned risks. According to him, although the advent of physical Bitcoin ETFs in the United States is deemed inevitable, he cautioned that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-triggers-massive-btc-accumulation/">BlackRock&#8217;s</a> application, which has expedited the process, may not lead to an actual launch in 2023.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Physical Bitcoin ETFs in the US are a matter of time, we believe. BlackRock&#8217;s application to start such a fund appears to have expedited this process, but a launch may not come in 2023</em>,&#8221; said McGlone, echoing the <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1671605278465196033">sentiments</a> of Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Additionally, McGlone predicted that the US economy might lean towards recession in the coming months, further complicating the outlook for Bitcoin. Drawing attention to the relationship between risk-asset performance, negative liquidity, and economic contraction, the pundit suggested that Bitcoin will likely gravitate towards the $20,000 support level rather than the $40,000 resistance level.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Our graphic shows Bitcoin trailing the recent Nasdaq 100 Stock Index gains, which may have peaked. Federal funds futures in one year (FF13) show little potential for additional liquidity fuel</em>,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iT4DNZFevhx5PyQekryxKIKk5KwjyKm455yNv6N83N3hujxNG-hcLrXmxiSI7tST1cYo_ZBH9jb-6Qh8JJu73JivvJTUA5seRQ8KgirP9y6-JTW0fTcUqoerIzQRMTZ0biq0Rvk4EiReAQJ-BjnL6g" alt=""/></figure>



<p>McGlone&#8217;s analysis comes days after the Fed declared a pause in interest rate increases, ending a streak of 10 successive hikes within a compressed timeframe of 15 months. The Fed responded to a decrease in inflation, providing investors with relief. As a result, markets experienced a significant upswing, leading Bitcoin to reclaim the $30,000 threshold once more.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the decision, Fed chair Jeremy Powell signalled that they could resume their aggressive anti-inflation policies stating, <em>&#8220;Inflation pressure continues to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>According to McGlone, despite Fed&#8217;s decision to halt <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-prices-dwindle-as-ecb-hikes-interest-rates-while-us-fed-hits-pause/">rate hikes</a>, the &#8220;liquidity rug-pull&#8221; is likely to continue, with most central banks continuing to tighten in June, creating more headwinds for risk assets. Despite McGlone&#8217;s warnings, some experts are convinced that the bottom is already in for Bitcoin, and the bull market is on course.</p>



<p>Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested on Friday that the price would likely push towards $35,000, citing the lack of significant barriers ahead.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Bitcoin is set for a clear run, with major supply barriers only appearing close to the $35,000 mark! Conversely, he tweeted that critical support levels for BTC are within the $29,260-$30,200 and $26,500-$27,400 range,&#8221; </em>he <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1672300357328748591">tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>Bitcoin traded at $30,385 at press time, down 2.74% in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the top cryptocurrency grew by an impressive 15.23%</p>

<ul>
<li>Changpeng Zhao has argued that multiple reports of mass withdrawals from Binance are a misrepresentation in the light of new facts.</li>



<li>On-chain analytics firms like Nansen and DefiLlama reported net outflows from the digital exchange giant post the SEC lawsuit.</li>



<li>Binance’s BNB token plummeted 10% in the aftermath of recent developments leaving investors in panic.</li>
</ul>



<p>Binance has been in the crosshairs of regulators across several jurisdictions with many analysts predicting a dwindling market share for the exchange this year.</p>



<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that the reports on the exchange’s outflows this past week are not a correct reflection of the state of things. Zhao noted that some on-chain analytics firms measure changes in assets under management (AUM) as outflows which include crypto price drops.</p>



<p>Last week, both Nansen and DefiLlama reported billions of outflows from Binance after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the company. According to DefiLlama, $3.35 billion was withdrawn from the exchange in the past week. Glassnode also reported that the exchange’s balance had recorded a sharp decline of $1 billion or around 5.7%.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Nansen reported a net outflow of $2.36 billion, along with $123.7 million withdrawn from Binance US in the past seven days. Despite this, Zhao remains positive about the exchange’s strength. He claimed that the outflow recorded on June 9 is $392 million which is nothing compared to the $7 billion withdrawn from the exchange in the aftermath of the FTX collapse. </p>



<p>He explained that in times of volatility, outflows are pretty expected.</p>



<p>“<em>Some even only measure outflow, net inflows. On a sharp price movement day like today, many arbitrage traders move a lot of funds between exchanges, usually exponentially more than on normal days,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-effects-bite-harder"><strong>The effects bite harder</strong></h2>



<p>The market has lost gains recorded in previous months since the lawsuit by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase. According to CoinGecko, the market capitalization plunged over $80 billion, about 7%. Due to reduced activity, Binance’s BNB token has plummeted by 10% since the lawsuit.</p>



<p>The harsh effects can also be seen in declining volumes recorded by centralized exchanges (CEX). The <a href="https://twitter.com/kaikodata/status/1653783407502012419?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">decline</a> in CEX volumes started before the lawsuits, as Kaiko reported a 46% decline in April, but things have heightened since then.</p>



<p>DeFi volumes have surged 444% from last week as investors turn to decentralized exchanges (DEX) and other products to protect their assets, with an attack-inclined SEC on the market’s neck.</p>

<p>The biggest cryptocurrency asset trading platform, Binance, and its American partner BAM Trading and founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), have been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for breaking several securities laws.</p>



<p>The SEC alleges that despite publicly stating limits, Binance and Zhao permitted high-value U.S. clients to trade on Binance.com. Additionally, they contend that Binance.US was not as independent as was promised and that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">customer assets were mismanaged</a>.</p>



<p>The SEC also charges Binance and BAM Trading with running unlicensed broker-dealers, clearing agencies, and securities exchanges. Inconsistent practices, conflicts of interest, and a lack of transparency are highlighted in the complaint. The lawsuit has been filed in the District of Columbia&#8217;s U.S. District Court.</p>



<p>However, Crypto attorney James Murphy, also known as MetLawMan on Twitter, has clarified the reasoning behind Binance&#8217;s aggressive stance towards the SEC. The defendants filed a motion to accuse the SEC of acting unethically.</p>



<p>Binance accused the SEC of breaking court regulations by making false remarks outside of court. According to Binance, the SEC is allegedly trying to hurt the trading firm deliberately. Binance asked the court to uphold the relevant laws and order the SEC to follow them, arguing that the jury pool is tainted and the SEC&#8217;s actions hurt US customers.</p>



<p>According to Binance, the SEC misled the public by claiming that emergency relief was necessary, alleging that CZ, the company&#8217;s founder, had mixed up and misdirected customer funds and that the order was essential for safeguarding investor assets. When questioned by the judge, Binance claims that the SEC attorneys could not present any proof of CZ diverting or combining customer assets.</p>



<p>According to MetaLawMan, it is significant that Bill McLucas and George Canellos, who both led the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement in the past, have also signed these charges of wrongdoing. These lawyers&#8217; accusations of unethical behaviour will undoubtedly not go unnoticed by SEC officials.</p>



<p>MetaLawMan said: <em>“The SEC will come back swinging. They will argue their press release was fine because: (a) they did not concede what Binance says was conceded; (b) they are allowed to repeat allegations from their own complaint; and (c) Binance’s own post-hearing statements were improper.”</em></p>



<p>MetaLawMan concludes that this is just the beginning of the fight for Binance against the righteousness of the SEC. Like Ripple, Binance is in it for good and is not backing away from the battle.</p>



<p>In 2020 the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc., Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen on the grounds that they sold XRP, the cryptocurrency linked to Ripple, in an unregistered securities offering. The SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple is noteworthy because it raises critical issues regarding how cryptocurrencies are classified and governed in the United States. A judgment by Judge Torres is<strong> </strong>expected anytime soon now, with many claiming settlement is currently out of the question.</p>

<ul>
<li>This week, BTC, ETH, ADA, and other top assets record massive surges following institutional demands for digital assets.</li>



<li>The price of Bitcoin moved past $31,000 for the first time in one year, hitting $31,300 temporarily before a slight correction. </li>



<li>Market bulls are relishing the present status quo as the total market capitalization tops $1.2 trillion after weekly gains.</li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market has made a huge recovery since the start of the year following a turbulent 2022 that saw top coins lose nearly 60% of their market capitalization.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins remain in the green zone <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">recording</a> huge wins in the market over the past seven days. Bitcoin has surged over 4% in the last 24 hours, pushing up its weekly gains above 20% thanks to a renewed institutional rush.</p>



<p>Trading at $17,000 at the start of the year, the market leader has made an astronomical 87.1% year-to-date (YTD) increase and a 46% 12-month rise. Trading above $31,000, BTC has hit a 12-month high after it slipped from that benchmark in May 2022. This week, BTC also reclaimed its 50% market share after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hit Coinbase with a lawsuit over offering trading services to several altcoins it described as securities.</p>



<p>Bitcoin Cash, a Bitcoin spin-off, has skyrocketed over 30% to become the best-performing asset in the past 24 hours. The entire digital asset market cap now stands at $1.23 trillion after a daily 2.34% rise. Although there is a slight resistance, Bitcoin bulls have refused to cede grounds to bears after reports that ETFs will not be approved or declined until early next year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altcoins-led-by-eth-follow-btcs-steps"><strong>Altcoins led by ETH follow BTCs steps</strong></h2>



<p>The ripple effect of Bitcoin’s performance can be seen across the market as several altcoins post weekly gains of over 20%. Ethereum trades at $1,904 at press time after a seven-day gain of 10.9%. ETH is way above its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $1,804, with bulls signalling a $2,000 target. </p>



<p>Cardano (ADA) exchanges hands at $0.299, increasing this week by 12.98%. Similarly, Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Polkadot (DOT) have spiked 19.6%, 11.17%, 15.19%, and 15.02% in the last seven days. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has led the meme coin weekly rally, recording over 18% this week. Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin rose 10% in the same timeframe. </p>



<p>The bullish outlook in the market was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-investors-sentiment-for-crypto-surges-following-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-filing/">sparked</a> by BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF followed by similar applications for top firms and the launch of a digital asset exchange, EDX, backed by big Wall Street firms.</p>

<li>Bitcoin options contracts worth over $3.3 billion exchanged hands within 24 hours across major crypto exchanges. </li>



<li>Analysts on Deribit describe it as the largest trading volume recorded in three months as the price of the asset nears a two-month high.&nbsp;</li>



<li>On the flip side, Bitcoin bears suggest that the surging price will cool as the BTC spot ETF will not be approved in the short term.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The surging prices in the digital asset market are visible as several sectors are recording growth not seen in months. Derivatives trading among top assets will continue to rise with recent trends, according to market pundits.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) trading above $30,000 has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-taps-30k-bears-record-highest-short-squeeze-of-the-month-with-bulls-pushing-for-35000/">sparked</a> demand for the asset in the options market with surging bullish bets for two straight days. The boosted activity in the market comes as the BTC nears its two-month high following renewed institutional demand sparked off by BlackRock&#8217;s ETF filing.</p>



<p>Over the past 24 hours, BTC option contracts worth a little over $3.3 billion have been traded across many derivatives exchanges. The figure marks the highest daily performance of BTC options in three months. Popular options exchange Deribit stated that there’s more room for growth after it recorded 80% of the total volume.</p>



<p>“<em>We have seen the biggest trading volume in three months. There is a lot of interest in buying call options,&#8221; </em>Lin Chen Deribits Asia’s business personnel said. In the past week, call spreads have made up 45% of total block flows. Patrick Chu, the director for institutional sales at Paradigm explained that surging price has led to call overwriters reducing risk by buying back the bullish exposure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Mostly, people have been buying back the topside, especially option overwriters given the rapid upward move,&#8221; </em>he noted.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-demand-raises-the-bullish-index"><strong>High demand raises the bullish index</strong></h2>



<p>The activities of traditional finance (TradFi) players have set the tone for an <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-investors-sentiment-for-crypto-surges-following-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-filing/">uphill</a> climb in the prices of digital assets. The push for a spot BTC ETF among major financial market players has led to a scramble between retail and institutional investors for the asset driving up major index ratings.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index has moved into the greed zone at 65 with bulls keen on more price surges to mark a good run in Q2 2023. In the derivatives market, Deribit’s Bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) measures the 30-day volatility of the asset. According to Amberdata, the DVOL stands at 59.24 the biggest recorded since April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chen commented that the DVOL index was pushed up as a result of rising prices and a “<em>the increased demand for options.”</em></p>

<p>Indonesia&#8217;s markets regulator has declared Cardano&#8217;s native token ADA as a commodity, signalling a significant milestone in the global cryptocurrency arena.</p>



<p>Through an amendment to the country’s former Trade Controlling Agency Regulations Commodity Futures Number 11 of 2022, on June 9, Bappebti, the agency responsible for regulating commodity futures trading in Indonesia, classified over 450 cryptocurrencies, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-reveals-exciting-vision-for-cardano-ada-this-summer/">Cardano (ADA)</a> as commodities, allowing them to be traded within established regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>According to the document’s preamble, extensive evaluations were conducted before listing the cryptocurrencies, considering utility, functionality, and intrinsic value within their respective blockchain ecosystems. By subjecting these cryptocurrencies to such scrutiny, Bappebti noted that it aimed to provide clarity and investor protection while promoting innovation and technological advancement in the cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>Notably, the regulator recognized ADA&#8217;s value, given its utility and pivotal role within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Cardano&#8217;s ADA token holds significance within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem due to its utility and functionality. It plays a crucial role in facilitating transactions, staking, and participating in the governance of the network.</p>



<p>However, Bappebti&#8217;s decision to classify these cryptocurrencies as commodities stand in stark contrast to the perspective of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has predominantly categorized ADA and other cryptocurrencies primarily as securities, a stance that was reaffirmed in its recent case against Binance.US, drawing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-community-mount-offensive-against-the-u-s-sec-for-naming-ada-a-security/">criticism</a> from the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>That said, the Indonesian government&#8217;s classification of ADA and other cryptocurrencies as commodities reflects a potential powershift in the cryptocurrency landscape, with countries like Indonesia and China embracing and recognizing cryptocurrencies as tradable assets.</p>



<p>Although the West, particularly the United States, has traditionally played a dominant role in shaping technological advancements, experts in the industry have asserted that the East&#8217;s forward-thinking regulatory frameworks and embrace of technological innovation may position these countries at the forefront of the next technological revolution, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-risks-losing-global-technology-leadership-role-to-china-due-to-restrictive-crypto-policies-coinbase-ceo/">leaving the US behind</a>.</p>



<p>Already, amidst the regulatory crackdowns on US cryptocurrency companies, industry leaders like Coinbase and Gemini have begun looking elsewhere. Recently, Coinbase entered Bermuda, while Gemini seeks a license in the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Bittrex ceased operations in the US in April, saying the US regulatory environment was “not viable” for business.</p>



<p>The Indonesian government&#8217;s recognition of ADA as a commodity also opens up possibilities for neighbouring countries to reconsider their regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. Observing the success and acceptance of ADA in Indonesia, these countries may likewise adopt a commodity-based approach to cryptocurrencies, fostering regulatory clarity, innovation, and investment.</p>

<p>Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democrat, came out swinging on behalf of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Bitcoin</a> on Thursday while criticizing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Kennedy, a member of one of the most famous U.S. political families, believes CBDCs pose a risk of oppressive control and are likely to be misused.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-friend-of-bitcoin"><strong>A Friend Of Bitcoin&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has shared his opinion on cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (AI), among other things, in his latest interview.</p>



<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/22/robert-f-kennedy-jr-interview-why-im-not-an-anti-vaxxer/">Speaking to</a> <em>The New York Pos</em>t on June 22, Kennedy — an environmental lawyer, son of former U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew to United States’ 35th president John F. Kennedy and former Sen. Ted Kennedy — outlined planned crypto policies he would introduce if he took office.</p>



<p>“I will make sure that we have policies that support Bitcoin and the freedom to transact and that allow individuals to manage their own Bitcoin wallets, nodes, and passwords,” Kennedy stated.</p>



<p>The candidate indicated that he would support a permissive regulatory environment in the United States that “only allow the narrowest controls that are necessary to prevent money laundering.”</p>



<p>Kennedy, who officially announced his 2024 presidential bid on April 19, grabbed the headlines last month when he <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1653808786577010697">lambasted </a>President Joe Biden’s proposal for an excise duty that would charge cryptocurrency miners in the U.S. 30% of their energy costs — a move that cited the environmental and societal harm caused by crypto mining operations.</p>



<p>Moreover, he told attendees during a May 19 keynote speech at the Bitcoin Miami Conference that he would accept donations for his presidential campaign in bitcoin — which will essentially make him the first presidential candidate in US history to accept campaign donations in the flagship cryptocurrency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Foe Of CBDCs</strong></h2>



<p>During the interview with <em>The New York Post</em>, Kennedy also weighed in on the debate over CBDCs, saying such government-backed tokens are “instruments of control and oppression, and are certain to be abused.”</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, CBDCs are digital forms of national fiat currencies, which a country’s central bank issues. The United States Federal Reserve has not yet announced plans to roll out a digital dollar. However, presidential candidates in 2024’s U.S. election, like Kennedy, are already sounding an alarm.</p>



<p>Kennedy’s staunch anti-CBDC view echoes that of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Republican U.S. presidential candidate earlier this year proposed a law to ban the use of CBDCs as money within Florida.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears to be adopting a more measured approach towards cryptocurrencies as the digital assets landscape evolves.</p>



<p>In a blog post published Thursday, June 22, the global lender discussed the potential effectiveness of banning crypto assets calling for a more receptive approach to managing them. Delving into Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, the lender highlighted the progress made by countries such as Bahamas, Brazil and Jamaica, stating that LAC countries are leading the way in crypto adoption, with several nations introducing CBDCs to enhance financial inclusion, strengthening payment systems, and reducing cross-border remittance costs.</p>



<p>According to the lender, their potential benefits fueled the demand for crypto assets, including protection against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/zimbabwe-defies-imf-directive-to-sell-millions-of-gold-backed-crypto-assets-terms-it-a-success/">economic instability</a> and improved financial inclusion. However, despite this growth, the lender warned that adopting crypto assets also comes with challenges and risks stating that countries with a history of instability, low institutional credibility, corruption, and extensive informal sectors face particular risks.</p>



<p>The blog went on to point out the risks associated with adopting crypto assets, such as Bitcoin, even when supported by the government, as, in its opinion,  their acceptance as a medium of exchange may not be widespread.</p>



<p><em>“El Salvador’s experience with Bitcoin suggests there are risks to adopting unbacked crypto assets—those that rely on supply and demand rather than on any asset for value and that are subject to significant price volatility—even when explicitly supported by the government,” </em><a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/06/22/cf-interest-in-cb-digital-currencies-picks-up-in-latam-the-caribbean-while-crypto-use-varies">said</a> the IMF.</p>



<p>Despite the outlined risks, the lender acknowledged the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and emphasized the importance of tailored regulation and policy frameworks to manage risks effectively.</p>



<p><em>“While a few countries have completely banned crypto assets given their risks, this approach may not be effective in the long run. The region should instead focus on addressing the drivers of crypto demand, including citizens’ unmet digital payment needs, and on improving transparency, by recording crypto asset transactions in national statistics,” </em>it added.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>IMF&#8217;s recent blog builds upon its previous work on effective policies for crypto assets. In a February guidance report,&nbsp; the lender addressed member countries on the importance of an appropriate policy response to crypto assets arguing that “<em>doing nothing is untenable as crypto assets may continue to evolve”</em> despite the recent industry headwinds.</p>



<p>That said, IMF&#8217;s evolving stance on crypto assets, considering its past concerns about crypto assets, especially after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvador-ignores-imf-set-to-open-second-bitcoin-embassy-in-the-us/">El Salvador’s</a> move to make Bitcoin legal tender, reflects its recognition of the importance of tailored regulation and policy frameworks for the sector. This shift indicates progress for the industry as a whole.</p>

<ul>
<li>The price of Bitcoin has surpassed $31,000 for the second time this year, with experts predicting a higher push should institutional investors maintain their current pace.</li>



<li>The latest surge comes as Tradfi players flood into the digital asset market, setting up exchanges and filing ETFs.</li>



<li>BTC drags the rest of the market up as altcoins recover lost ground following the SEC sting on Binance and Coinbase.</li>
</ul>



<p>Institutional investors have triggered another bull run in the market, as predicted by bulls at the start of the year. How long will Wall Street’s thirst last for what they term the “digital gold?”</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has hit another milestone this month after it soars past the $30,000 level for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">second</a> time this year. The last time BTC was at $30,000 was in April and has since suffered a rough patch since then as a result of harsh regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), leading to surging outflows.</p>



<p>The dark days of the market leader look behind it as recent wins have wiped away its losses. On Wednesday, BTC hit $28,000, a milestone it has remained shy of since May and has moved uphill. The market leader has recorded a 16.5% growth in the past week and a 7% increase in the last 24 hours to shoot past $30,000.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC trades at $31,117, with experts predicting further strength to stamp its reclaim of over 50% of the market capitalization. At the start of the year, BTC was valued at $16,615 but has rallied over 80% in the past six months. Altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano have also surged 5.67% and 6.87%, respectively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tradfi-goes-hungry-btc-goes-up"><strong>Tradfi goes hungry, BTC goes up</strong></h2>



<p>Traditional finance has been instrumental to the rise in the market, with several firms investing in diverse products. The whole phase kicked off when BlackRock, the largest asset management firm, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-investors-sentiment-for-crypto-surges-following-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filed</a> for a Bitcoin ETF, a move that the SEC has consistently rejected previous applicants.</p>



<p>Following the footsteps of BlackRock, Wisdom Tree and Invesco also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Apart from this, a significant entrant by institutional investors was the launch of EDX, a digital asset exchange backed by several giants on Wall Street, including Fidelity Investments, Citadel Securities, and Charles Schwab. Deutsche Bank has also applied for a cryptocurrency custody license in Germany.</p>



<p>Ruslan Lienkha, YouHodler’s chief of markets, stated that the market will be structured by big firms in the future, adding that “<em>more investors will have access to crypto investments with much lower risks. Important to notice that a very small percentage of BlackRock or Fidelity clients interested in spot BTC ETFs are enough to move the price further north.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-and-sec-align-on-hinman-emails-as-case-takes-interesting-turn/">Ripple</a>, made key revelations regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a rare video address, providing light on what he believes to be a purposeful effort to stifle innovation in the crypto space and control through enforcement. The documents associated with the notorious 2018 Hinman speech, which covered the standards for establishing if a token is a security, were recently unsealed, prompting the Chief Executive to make his remarks.</p>



<p>Highlighting the contents of the unsealed documents, Garlinghouse stated, <em>&#8220;At best, these documents show that senior officials at the SEC couldn&#8217;t agree on the law and told Bill Hinman directly he would confuse the public even more about the rules for crypto. At worst, they show that Hinman deliberately ignored the law and tried to create new laws, something only Congress can do.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Garlinghouse further emphasized that while the SEC put on a front of openness and direction, the findings were not limited to any token or blockchain and instead served as proof of the agency&#8217;s tenacious pursuit of enforcement actions against the sector. He mentioned Ripple&#8217;s aggressive interaction with the SEC, including private meetings with Jay Clayton and Bill Hinman, during which no objections to the token <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-joins-the-ranks-of-licensed-payment-institutions-in-singapore-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-its-conclusion/">XRP</a> being categorized as a security were voiced.</p>



<p>&#8220;We were fully transparent, not knowing they would then use this information against us,&#8221; Ripple’s CEO said in the Video message. He criticized the unexpected SEC Wells notification, citing violations of the Securities and Exchange Act without offering details and reiterating the experiences of others who had faced similar legal procedures.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse alleged that the SEC tried discouraging American crypto innovation by pointing out the regulatory body&#8217;s purported contradictions and ambiguities. He called out the current SEC chair as an unelected bureaucrat. He accused the SEC of utilizing the lack of regulatory clarity to seize control of the whole cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The SEC tried to bully us into acquiescing,&#8221; Garlinghouse stated. &#8220;Thankfully we have had the resources to fight back, and now we can all see what they&#8217;ve fought so hard to hide. They knowingly created confusion about the rules and used that confusion to regulate through enforcement. That&#8217;s bad faith, plain and simple.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The Ripple CEO noted that there is still much to be done in the struggle for regulatory clarity as the SEC&#8217;s action against Ripple approaches its conclusion. He expressed his gratitude to those who supported Ripple throughout the process, including his co-workers, friends, family, and the larger XRP community.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s approach to cryptocurrency has been the subject of increased debate since Garlinghouse&#8217;s discoveries, which have also called into question the agency&#8217;s transparency and regulatory aims. The need for transparent legislation and an environment that fosters innovation is still at the forefront of the continuing discussion as the crypto community waits for new developments.</p>

<p>The race to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States is heating up, with a new filing submitted in the past 24 hours. Crypto asset manager Valkyrie Digital Assets has also moved to file for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the wake of Invesco, WisdomTree, and BlackRock making similar applications recently. In the June 21 filing, Valkyrie revealed that it would seek to list its fund on the Nasdaq exchange under the clever ticker “BRRR”. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-valkyrie-refiles-for-physically-backed-bitcoin-etf-with-sec"><strong>Valkyrie Refiles For Physically Backed Bitcoin ETF With SEC</strong></h2>



<p>Valkyrie, which already offers a Bitcoin Strategy ETF and a Bitcoin Miners ETF, updated its filing for the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund on Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The company’s filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713123007682/valkyrie-s1a_062123.htm#valkyries1aa018">states </a>that “the Trust will hold bitcoin and will value its Shares daily based on the value of bitcoin as reflected by the Index, which is an independently calculated value based on an aggregation of executed trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anddd we have anotha one! Most interesting here with this updated Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund prospectus &#8212; they have changed their exchange to Nasdaq (same as BlackRock) anddd they gave us a ticker <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRRR&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BRRR</a>. <a href="https://t.co/3QxeFRfLPy">pic.twitter.com/3QxeFRfLPy</a></p>&mdash; James Seyffart (@JSeyff) <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1671599801761161235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The firm says the ETF will hold bitcoin to reflect the price of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate &#8211; New York Variant (BRRNY), a figure estimated based on trading data collected across a number of leading bitcoin exchanges, including Coinbase, Bitstamp, Gemini, itBit, Kraken, and LMAX Digital. The filing notes that BRRNY is the exact figure that Bitcoin futures contracts are settled on, which trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>



<p>Valkyrie’s fund ticker BRRR is known within the crypto community as the sweet, sweet sound made by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s money printer.</p>



<p>In its previous filing in January 2021, Valkyrie had proposed its fund be listed on NYSE Arca. But with the new prospectus, the firm is now looking at the Nasdaq.</p>



<p>The move comes after BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management firm, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">applied for a spot ETF</a> last week — a move that shook up the market. Another comically large financial services firm Invesco <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shoots-up-with-30000-in-sight-following-fresh-wave-of-spot-etf-applications/">refiled </a>for a spot bitcoin product on Tuesday. The less-comically large U.S.-based asset manager WisdomTree, also reapplied for permission to offer a physically-backed bitcoin ETF, after getting rejected by the SEC in 2022.</p>



<p>So far, the SEC hasn’t indicated when it plans to make an announcement regarding a bitcoin ETF. In fact, Grayscale has even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">sued </a>the SEC over its denied bitcoin spot ETF. While the SEC has rejected all previous spot bitcoin ETF applications, market onlookers are liking BlackRock&#8217;s chances given its reputation and track record with the regulator.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Resurgence</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto prices have punched higher in the wake of BlackRock’s bid to establish the first spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The top cryptocurrency has rocketed by over 20% to cross the $30,000 mark for the first time since April.</p>



<p>Bitcoin was lagging at the start of the year when it was changing hands at only $16,615 per coin. It&#8217;s now up over 80% since the beginning of 2023, suggesting big investors are feeling bullish about the dominant cryptocurrency — and the rest of the crypto market in general.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, BTC is still well below its $69,044.77 all-time high registered in November 2021.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the board of directors of Alibaba Group Holding Limited made a significant announcement regarding the company&#8217;s management. In a press release via Business Wire, the Company noted that current Executive Vice Chairman Joseph C. Tsai will follow Daniel Zhang as Chairman of the Alibaba Group. Mr Zhang will step down as CEO and be replaced by Eddie Yongming Wu, Chairman of Taobao and Tmall Group, on the board of directors. The new leadership will take over on September 10, 2023.</p>



<p>Daniel Zhang, the outgoing Chairman and CEO, expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to lead Alibaba Group over the past years. Zhang stated, <em>&#8220;It has been an incredible honor and privilege to lead Alibaba Group as CEO over the past eight years and Chairman over the past four years. This is the right time for me to make a transition, given the importance of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group as it progresses towards a full spin-off. I look forward to working closely with Joe and Eddie in the coming months to ensure a seamless transition.&#8221;</em> Zhang will continue to lead Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group as its Chairman and CEO.</p>



<p>Regarding the leadership change, Joseph Tsai acknowledged Daniel Zhang&#8217;s exceptional contributions to the company. Tsai said, <em>&#8220;Daniel has made exceptional contributions to the development of Alibaba Group since joining the company in 2007, and he demonstrated extraordinary leadership in navigating unprecedented uncertainties affecting our business over the past few years. We believe there is no better leader than Daniel to steer Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group into the next chapter of its journey and future growth.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Eddie Yongming Wu, who will assume the role of CEO, expressed his gratitude for the trust placed in him by the board of directors. Wu stated, <em>&#8220;I am grateful for the trust of the Alibaba Group board of directors and am honored to succeed Daniel as Alibaba&#8217;s CEO. Over the past 24 years, Alibaba has consistently innovated through evolution and breakthroughs from within, and each transformation has catalyzed new growth. While our current transformation brings in a new corporate organizational and governance structure, Alibaba&#8217;s mission remains unchanged.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Wu, an Alibaba co-founder and part of the Alibaba Partnership, has a strong history in technology and executive leadership inside the business. He was Alibaba&#8217;s first technical director when it was founded in 1999, and he has since held several important positions, including chief technology officer of Taobao and Alipay. Alibaba&#8217;s success is mainly due to Wu&#8217;s experience and skill in guiding technology platforms and strategic direction.</p>



<p>The leadership transition at Alibaba Group represents the organization&#8217;s dedication to sustained development, innovation, and adjustment to the changing business environment. In September 2023, the new leadership will officially take over, beginning a new era for the Alibaba Group under the direction of Chairman Joseph Tsai and CEO Eddie Yongming Wu.</p>

<p>San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-vs-ripple-hinman-documents-release-is-a-boost-to-ethereum-jpmorgan-analysts-share-opinion/">Ripple</a> has gained in-principal approval from the top financial regulator in Singapore.</p>



<p>The in-principal approval is for a Major Payments Institution License from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The permission is for Ripple to offer digital asset payments and token products in the nation, the company said in a June 21<a href="https://ripple.com/ripple-press/ripple-obtains-in-principle-regulatory-approval-in-singapore/"> press release</a>.</p>



<p>“Singapore is a leading global financial center and a prominent gateway to business in Asia Pacific,” Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse posited. “We’re incredibly proud to receive an in-principle license from the MAS, reaffirming our commitment to the region and ongoing proactive engagement with regulators globally.”</p>

<p>The approval places Ripple’s Singapore branch, Ripple Markets Asia Pacific, in a stronger position to further expand its customers’ use of the XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which saw a 5X growth in the republic year-on-year.</p>



<p>Ripple has been operating its Asia-Pacific headquarters out of Singapore since 2017. In a separate <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-deepens-roots-in-apac-by-obtaining-in-principle-regulatory-approval-in-singapore/?utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=twitter">announcement</a>, Ripple revealed that it had managed to double the number of employees at the Singapore base, totalling 50 full-time staff.</p>

<p>Speaking on approval from MAS, Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty observed that Singapore’s “early leadership” is setting an example for other countries aiming to create a “clear taxonomy and licensing framework.”</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that Ripple is the latest company to obtain a license for digital payment token services in Singapore in June. <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-obtains-major-payment-institution-licence-from-monetary-authority-of-singapore">Crypto.com</a> and <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/circle-singapore-obtained-major-payment-institution-license">Circle </a>received their Major Payment Institution (MPI) licenses earlier this month.</p>



<p>Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse also commended the Singaporean regulator on Thursday, noting that it was “a global leader in establishing clear rules of the road to recognize the innovation and real-world utility of digital assets”.</p>



<p>Although Ripple’s compliance journey in Singapore has been rather easy without legal hurdles, this has not been the case back home in the U.S. The fintech firm has been enmeshed in a courtroom war with the Securities and Exchange (SEC) since late 2020 after the commission filed a suit against them for selling the XRP cryptocurrency via an unregistered securities offering. The case is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-expects-final-decision-in-weeks/">expected </a>to come to a conclusion in the coming weeks — if not <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-sec-director-says-judgment-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-to-come-within-days-xrp-to-10/">days</a>.</p>
