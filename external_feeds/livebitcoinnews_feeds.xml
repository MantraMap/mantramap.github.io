										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite everything that’s happened in 2022, Mark Cuban is <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mark-cuban-defends-bitcoin-says-230258502.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">doubling down on his love</a> of bitcoin and says he’s hoping to purchase more of the world’s number one digital currency by market cap should it drop even lower.</p>
<h2>Mark Cuban Doesn&#8217;t Like Gold That Much</h2>
<p>2022 was a rough year for bitcoin and the crypto space. Bitcoin fell by more than 70 percent in value and ended the year trading in the high $16,000 range. This is way off the mark from the $68,000 per unit that it achieved in November of 2021. Overall, the crypto space lost more than $2 trillion in overall valuation and was also marred by several scams and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">bankruptcies</a>.</p>
<p>But Cuban is trying his best to put all this aside. He still believes in the asset, even more so than he does gold. In a recent podcast, he commented that anyone who owned gold was “dumb as f*ck” and that having bitcoin as part of their portfolio was the smartest move to make. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more. If you have gold, you&#8217;re dumb as f***.</p></blockquote>
<p>The host of the podcast was Bill Maher, formerly of the show “Politically Incorrect.” Maher claimed to be a big fan of gold, and said it was a hedge against all the economic problems people have been seeing over the last few years. However, Cuban begged to differ, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, but it&#8217;s not a hedge against anything, right? What it is, is the stored value, and you don&#8217;t own the physical gold, do you? Gold is a stored value and so is bitcoin… It’s a digital transaction and it&#8217;s a stored value&#8230; So, people perceive that there is value associated with gold, that there&#8217;s value associated with bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>He stated that just because a person invests in gold doesn’t mean they truly own it. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t own the gold bar, and if everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f*** out of you or kill you and take your gold bar.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time that Cuban has bashed gold. In an interview in the year 2019, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hate gold. Gold is a religion.</p></blockquote>
<h2>He Still Believes in BTC</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Cuban also discussed the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/mark-cuban-is-mad-about-whats-happened-with-ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">recent collapse of FTX</a> and the disaster surrounding former crypto head Sam Bankman-Fried. He said that while the situation was no doubt hairy, he isn’t allowing what happened to affect his opinion of the crypto space or bitcoin and stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Separate the signal from the noise. There’s been a lot of people making a lot of mistakes, but it doesn’t change the underlying value.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2022 was a year of loss, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2022/12/24/these-crypto-founders-and-bitcoin-moguls-lost-116-billion-in-2022/?sh=276675c742b2" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">many crypto billionaires</a> – from Changpeng Zhao of Binance fame to the Winklevoss Twins who run the Gemini exchange – have lost a ton of money. So much in fact, that in just nine short months, many of them have seen their net worth virtually collapse – in some cases, to zero.</p>
<h2>Changpeng Zhao and Others Have Lost Tons of Money</h2>
<p>Changpeng Zhao, for instance, had a net worth of approximately $65 billion in March of last year. By the end of December, that worth had dropped to less than $5 billion. This should give you a  clear idea of just how bad the previous year was for crypto. Matt Cohen – founder of Ripple Ventures – commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re now at the breaking point in crypto where everyone will have to take a pause and say, ‘Okay, we&#8217;ve seen a ton of economic wealth destroyed in the last couple of months. We need to start taking this seriously. A lot of blockchain technologies and companies… built solutions for problems that didn&#8217;t need fixing, and I think we&#8217;re now going to have a hard reset.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lisa Ellis – an equity analyst at Moffett Nathanson – took aim at Binance and claimed it had a “dodgy operating model.” She said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t believe a business can persist, operating in this amorphous way, not governed by anyone or anywhere, especially when it&#8217;s run by a public individual.</p></blockquote>
<p>There has been plenty of speculation as to whether Binance is in trouble. Recently, Zhao took to social media to explain the firm was not experiencing any difficulties and that it had enough reserves in its pockets to stay afloat. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are quite a unique organization. We don’t have loans from any other organizations. We will prove all the FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] is wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brian Armstrong – CEO of Coinbase – also struck at Zhao, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase and Binance are following different approaches. We&#8217;re trying to follow a regulated, trusted approach. To look at it intellectually honestly, we&#8217;re choosing to follow the rules. It&#8217;s a more difficult path and sometimes your hands are tied, but I think that&#8217;s the right long-term strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Changpeng Zhao was number one in the crypto wealth category, but a close second was Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX fame. In his early 30s, SBF was lauded as a genius by many as his company rose through the ranks to become one of the world’s top five crypto exchanges in three years.</p>
<h2>SBF: Riches to Rags</h2>
<p>Sadly, his <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/john-ray-iii-ftx-is-the-most-mismanaged-company-ive-ever-seen/" data-wpel-link="internal">poor accounting skills</a> and Ponzi-like behavior led to the complete collapse of his company, and he recently served time in a Bahamian jail <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/judge-tells-30-year-old-sbf-to-move-back-in-with-parents-on-250-million-bail/ar-AA15zWM3" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">before being extradited</a> back to the U.S. where he now awaits trial.</p>
<p>His net worth prior to FTX’s fall from grace was $24 billion. It is now zilch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s happened again, folks. Another crypto hack has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ae/money/news/hackers-steal-8m-worth-of-cryptocurrency-from-bitkeep-wallets/ar-AA15FTOr" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">been recorded to the</a> digital currency books. This time, the alleged victim is Bit Keep, a virtual wallet provider, and more than $8 million in crypto funds have gone missing.</p>
<h2>Bit Keep Compromised; A Lot of Money Missing</h2>
<p>To be fair, this is a small number compared to the many digital currency hacks and scams that have occurred in the past, but it’s another clear reminder that the space is not where it needs to be, and that people and companies are just as vulnerable as ever. The time has come to take these threats seriously and ensure proper security protocols are in place to keep people’s money out of the wrong hands.</p>
<p>As a decentralized network, Bit Keep is not governed by a group of executives. This is a good thing in that it provides people with more privacy and autonomy, but it’s also rough in that a decentralized company often sees to it that its customers or those it does business with are on their own. That’s one of the downsides to not having a set of prying eyes watching your every move; there’s no one in charge to make sure you stay safe.</p>
<p>Many users of Bit Keep took to social media to explain that they saw many of their funds being moved without their consent. At the time of writing, it’s unclear how many users have been affected by the event. Based in Singapore, Bit Keep is alleged to have as many as 6.3 million users.</p>
<p>It is believed that the assets taken include Binance Coin, Ethereum, Tether, and Dai. Bit Keep confirmed the breach on Telegram and says it’s now taking necessary action to fix the issue. It said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is suspected that some APK package downloads have been hijacked by hackers and installed with code implanted by hackers. If your funds are stolen, the application you download or [that] update may be an unknown version [unofficial release version] hijacked.</p></blockquote>
<p>The crypto space has been a haven for theft and similar crime since it first came to fruition roughly 14 years ago. Among the biggest digital currency exchange hacks to ever occur include <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/mt-gox/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mt. Gox</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coincheck/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coincheck</a>. Both took place in Japan roughly four years apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mt. Gox happened in February of 2014 and resulted in roughly $400 million in bitcoin funds being stolen overnight. Four years later, in January of 2018, more than half a billion dollars in crypto funds were stolen from Coincheck, a fellow trading platform.</p>
<p>The latter resulted in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/japans-cryptocurrency-association-to-vote-on-new-regulations-this-month/" data-wpel-link="internal">Japanese financial agencies</a> getting involved in crypto and working to make sure all digital currency businesses stationed in the country followed certain protocols to ensure traders’ funds remained in the right hands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another crypto mining firm is in trouble. This time, the alleged victim is Greenidge Generation (GREE), <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-miner-greenidge-reaches-debt-124316270.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">which has hinted that</a> it could file bankruptcy in the coming weeks if its present deal with NYDIG doesn’t work out.</p>
<h2>Greenidge Generation Could Be the Next to Go</h2>
<p>The company is struggling to restructure its nearly $75 million debt. By doing this, the company could avoid a long bankruptcy line that initially began last summer with firms like Celsius, though Greenidge is not out of the woods yet. Even if the plan goes through, the company is still required to garner at least $20 million in new funding before the end of 2023. This could prove challenging if the crypto space does not heal by then.</p>
<p>To say 2022 was a bad year for crypto would be a terrible understatement. The world’s biggest digital currency – bitcoin – fell by more than 70 percent from the all-time high of $68,000 per unit it achieved in November of 2021. By the time the year ended, the currency was trading in the high $16K range.</p>
<p>Several other leading tokens followed in the asset’s footsteps. The crypto space ultimately lost more than $2 trillion of its overall value and there were several companies that went under or were forced to file bankruptcy due to the weak sentiment surrounding the space.</p>
<p>Celsius is arguably the firm that started the trend. The company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/another-mega-bitcoin-crash-is-in-the-books/" data-wpel-link="internal">halted all withdrawals</a> in the summer of 2022 and caused everyone to raise eyebrows when they suddenly couldn’t access their funds. From there, the company engaged in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">bankruptcy proceedings</a> to protect itself against angry creditors and customers, all the while dealing with a very unstable market.</p>
<p>Other enterprises followed suit, including <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-is-now-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">Three Arrows Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-lender-voyager-digital-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Voyager Digital</a>, and then <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a>, which appears to have engaged in various criminal acts including using traders’ assets to fund personal ventures such as buying luxury condominiums in the Bahamas for Sam Bankman-Fried – the head executive of the exchange – and other employees.</p>
<p>The company is now at the center of a huge scandal and Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">is out on bail while</a> he awaits trial in California after spending time in a Bahamian jail cell.</p>
<h2>You Can&#8217;t Just Make Money Mining</h2>
<p>To try and survive for the next 12 months, Greenidge will no longer be hosting its own digital currency mining machines. Instead, it will play host to the machines of NYDIG. The company must also run completely on natural gas as a means of reducing its costs, and it must also sell energy produced in a natural gas plant and not just rely on crypto mining to make ends meet.</p>
<p>This is a huge change for a company that just last October and November, was driving through more than $8 million each month. Of that money, $5.5 million went to NYDIG payments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bankman-Fried – the disgraced head executive of the now defunct crypto exchange FTX – is out of <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-gets-out-250-million-bail" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">prison on a $250 million</a> bond. While awaiting trial, he will live at his parents’ house in California.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Is Temporarily Out of Jail</h2>
<p>Bankman-Fried made his way back to the United States from a Bahamian jail in late December of last year. He also made a court appearance on January 3. The bond in question is different from bail. What it means is that if Bankman-Fried attempts to flee the country while awaiting trial or if he engages in any activity that authorities find suspicious, those closest to him can expect to be charged $250 million.</p>
<p>Right now, his parents have offered their home and other personal items as collateral should their son try to tuck tail and run from the U.S. court system. Other friends and family members also have various items on the line if Bankman-Fried tries to flee.</p>
<p>The FTX case is already significantly underway. Several former executives of the now collapsed trading platform have pled guilty to assorted crimes including former FTX co-founder and chief technology officer Zixiao Wang (age 29) and Caroline Ellison, the 280-year-old former CEO of Alameda Research, which was also founded by Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>U.S. attorney Damian Williams, who is overseeing the case, explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>As I said last week, this investigation is very much ongoing. Let me reiterate a call I made last week. If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda, now is the time to get ahead of it. We are moving quickly, and our patience is not eternal.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FTX debacle will likely go down in crypto history as one of the most embarrassing events to occur within the space’s borders. The collapse happened back in mid-November. Bankman-Fried complained of a “<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">liquidity crunch</a>” on social media and said he was now turning to his biggest rival, Binance, to buy his company out and save it from financial disaster.</p>
<h2>Things Fell Very Quickly</h2>
<p>While things were looking good for the company in this department for a while, Binance later went back on its <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">deal to buy out the company</a>, claiming the problems FTX was facing were simply too big for it to handle. From there, the company had no choice <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">but to engage in bankruptcy</a> proceedings, and Bankman-Fried resigned from his post.</p>
<p>Things didn’t end there, however. It turned out that Bankman-Fried had allegedly used traders’ funds stored on the exchange to purchase luxury condominiums for himself and other members of the FTX team in the Bahamas. The situation has been labeled one of the biggest crypto Ponzi schemes to ever occur, and Bankman-Fried was later arrested and spent time behind bars for his role in the firm’s crash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian law enforcement agents are claiming that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/23/cryptocurrency-becomes-mainstream-option-for-money-laundering-and-funding-of-terrorism-austrac-says" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">crypto has become the number</a> one go-to tool for those looking to commit money laundering or financial fraud.</p>
<h2>Australian Authorities Issue Crypto Warning</h2>
<p>Senior executives of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (AUSTRAC) claim <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto</a> has become part of the “money laundering tool kit,” and that using digital currency technology to sneak and hide funds from prying eyes has become standard behavior in the world of criminality. John Moss – head of the Australian agency – claimed in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are now seeing more traditional money laundering being displaced into cryptocurrency, particularly to send money offshore.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, Chainalysis – a blockchain analysis firm – said that approximately $2.2 million in crypto has been sent over this year alone to Russian paramilitary groups, and that the money is being used to purchase weapons and other items to fund and boost Russia’s side of the war. Moss explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>This shows how easy it is to use crypto as a fundraising source, and when you mix it with social media, you get a big reach. You’ve got a technology that’s easy to use, and if you’re flexible in the type of cryptos you take, you can do quite well out of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michael Tink – the national manager of intelligence operations at AUSTRAC – also threw his two cents into the mix, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have seen evidence of Australians sending money to offshore cryptocurrency accounts linked to al-Qaida [and] ISIL, and this is largely organizational support for travel, training, the salaries of fighters, and uniforms. It doesn’t take a lot of money to have an impact on a terrorist organization in a conflict zone, and small amounts of money can buy weapons and result in attacks, so it’s still a significant risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, it’s being said that many of these criminals and potential warmongers are using digital currency ATMs to get their hands on funds. Moss is concerned that these machines could eventually give way to a crime web that spreads across the globe. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>These machines are not seen in places like the UK. When you look at the reporting, you see lots of fraud victims. Very vulnerable people put large amounts of cash into these ATMs, which is essentially immediately gone offshore.</p></blockquote>
<h2>ATMs Are Often Looked To</h2>
<p>Tink also said that ATMs are often the first method of converting crypto into cash so that illicit purchases and deals can be made. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the key vulnerabilities for a crime group laundering money is the placement stage of the money-laundering cycle, so that’s trying to get cash into cryptocurrency. [These ATMs] are a good way to do that. There is a perception that if you are putting money through a hole in the wall, or a box in a shopping center, that it will be more anonymous.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warren Buffett is telling all his followers that <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/warren-buffett-cautioned-against-stockpiling-113345846.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">buying bitcoin or gold during</a> times of war is a terrible mistake. He is telling them all to avoid these assets and to avoid hoarding cash and to put all their money into stocks, as these are the only safe assets that can assuredly build wealth in the long-term.</p>
<h2>Warren Buffett: Stocks Are the Only Answer</h2>
<p>Buffett has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/warren-buffett-explains-his-hate-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">never been a big bitcoin</a> fan. He has often referred to it as “rat poison squared” and applied other derogatory terms to the world’s number one digital currency by market cap, but ever since Russia reportedly invaded Ukraine in March of last year, the idea is that bitcoin cannot be trusted along with other assets, and stocks are the only real answer towards staying financially put.</p>
<p>He said that when Russia first invaded Ukraine, he wasn’t prompted to sell his stocks like other people even though the market was taking several drastic hits. He stated in an interview during that time:</p>
<blockquote><p>If stocks are cheaper, I&#8217;ll be more likely to be buying them.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further commented that even if World War III were to potentially break out, he still wouldn’t sell his stocks and he would stay completely still unless prices dropped further. If that were the case, he would simply buy up more units. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, if you tell me all of that is going to happen, I will still be buying the stock. You’re going to invest your money in something over time. The one thing you could be quite sure of is if we went into some very major war, the value of money would go down. I mean, that&#8217;s happened in virtually every war that I&#8217;m aware of, so the last thing you&#8217;d want to do is hold money during a war.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further mentioned that stocks in American businesses ultimately went up drastically during World War II and they’ve done nothing but become stronger and bigger with time. Buffett said:</p>
<blockquote><p>American businesses are going to be worth more money. Dollars are going to be worth less, so that money won&#8217;t buy you quite as much, but you&#8217;re going to be a lot better off owning productive assets  over the next 50 years than you will be owning pieces of paper, or I might throw in bitcoins.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Staying On an 80-Year Course</h2>
<p>Buffett was 11 years old in 1942 when he bought his first stock shares, and he hasn’t looked back since. At an annual shareholder meeting in 2018, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>All you had to do was figure that America was going to do well over time [and] that we would overcome the current difficulties. You didn&#8217;t have to pick out winning stocks. You didn&#8217;t have to pick out a winning time or anything of the sort.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shaktikanta Das – the governor of India’s central bank – says <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/12/21/mark-my-words-surprise-crisis-prediction-sends-shockwaves-through-crypto-markets-as-the-price-of-bitcoin-and-ethereum-swing-wildly/?sh=547117e45e57" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">that the 2008 financial crisis</a> could happen all over again if people don’t start cracking down on the world’s leading digital currencies. He says another financial disaster is right around the corner, and a lot of it will likely be attributed to bitcoin and its altcoin cousins.</p>
<h2>Shaktikanta Das Is Not a Crypto Fan</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Das said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our view is that it should be prohibited because if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow, please mark my words the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Great Recession – as the financial crisis of roughly 15 years ago is called – is responsible for the birth of bitcoin and the digital market space. It was during this time that the whitepaper for bitcoin was unveiled to the public, and just a few months later, bitcoin was mined for the first time.</p>
<p>It has also widely been said that young people – such as millennials and Generation Z – are big fans of bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies because they <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/millenials-are-investing-more-in-grayscale/" data-wpel-link="internal">grew up during the time</a> of the recession. They saw firsthand what centralized money and financial institutions did to their parents and adult friends. They saw how many banks and businesses went under and they saw how quick the government was to bailout the firms that directly benefited its members while letting others die out.</p>
<p>As a result, many of these young people have come to distrust things like stocks and standard financial investing tools, and they’ve since turned to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to establish their wealth and bring themselves up the monetary ladder. What a horrible stroke of irony it would be if another financial recession is caused by the asset its predecessor birthed.</p>
<p>Das says bitcoin and many other forms of crypto don’t have any real, actual value to them. By contrast, he believes that all they do is expose investors to unnecessary risks and give people the impression that they own something that could be taken from them at any moment. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies] have no underlying value. They have huge inherent risks for our macroeconomic and financial stability. I [have] yet to hear any credible argument about what public good or what public purpose [they] serve.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, Das is confident that CBDCs – central bank digital currencies – could pave the way for a new future in the world of finance, and he thinks more banks will come to embrace the technology behind digital assets for their own well-being. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You will see in days to come more and more central banks will embrace digital currencies, and India has been in the forefront of the digital revolution in the current century.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Core Scientific – one of the largest digital currency mining firms in the world – has announced it’s filing <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-files-for-bankruptcy/ar-AA15wSpC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">for chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> protection. The proceedings took place in a federal bankruptcy court in southern Texas.</p>
<h2>Core Scientific Is Filing Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Core Scientific has been hinting <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-firm-core-scientific-says-its-considering-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">at potential bankruptcy</a> for some time. It stated in its official court documents that the declining price of bitcoin, as well as rising electricity prices to run its mining centers have become too difficult and heavy to contend with. At the time of writing, shares in the publicly traded company are down roughly 25 percent.</p>
<p>2023 was supposed to be the year in which bitcoin and crypto got the time they needed to heal and recover from the ravaging trends of 2022. During the latter year, bitcoin – the world’s largest and most popular digital currency – dropped more than 70 percent in value from its most recent all-time high of $68,000 per unit. This number was achieved in November of 2021, though about one year later, the currency had fallen into the mid-$16,000 range, and 2022 has been nothing but an embarrassment of sorts for all digital assets.</p>
<p>In addition, Core Scientific is neither the first, nor the only crypto-centered firm to file bankruptcy over the last six months. Others have come along in the form of the Celsius Network, for example, which last summer, caused many eyebrows to raise when the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/another-mega-bitcoin-crash-is-in-the-books/" data-wpel-link="internal">company announced it</a> was going to be halting all withdrawals and preventing customers from gaining access to their money.</p>
<p>From there, the problem got even worse when it was said that the firm <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">would be entering bankruptcy</a> proceedings to prevent vulnerability to angry customers and/or lenders that wanted to be paid back. Other firms – from <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-is-now-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">Three Arrows Capital</a> to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-lender-voyager-digital-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Voyager Digital</a> – later followed suit.</p>
<p>Matthew Sigel – head of digital assets research at Van Eck – commented in a recent interview that he thinks things will get a lot worse with bitcoin before they get better. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We think it&#8217;s possible, and possibly likely that bitcoin will test the $10,000 to $12,000 level amidst a wave of [bitcoin] miner bankruptcies.</p></blockquote>
<h2>FTX Is Still the Biggest Bankruptcy Story</h2>
<p>The biggest bankruptcy story of 2022 arguably came about with FTX, a once respected digital currency exchange that has since fallen into oblivion and may go down in history as a nothing but a criminal haven. First coming to fruition in 2019, the exchange was run by Sam Bankman-Fried and rose through the ranks over the next three years to become one of the biggest digital currency trading platforms in the world.</p>
<p>However, after experiencing <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">a liquidity crunch</a> in November of last year, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">company sought</a> aid from Binance and a possible bailout, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">though this never happened</a>. From there, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">company filed bankruptcy</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftxs-disgraced-founder-has-been-arrested/" data-wpel-link="internal">SBF was arrested</a>.</p>
