					<description><![CDATA[Quant (QNT), an Ethereum-based token, has experienced a 15.15% increase in its price over the past seven days. QNT plays a vital role in Quant Network&#8217;s Overledger, a suite of enterprise software solutions designed to connect public blockchains and private networks seamlessly. By enabling the creation of multi-chain decentralized applications (mDapps), Quant Network empowers developers to build and operate applications that span across multiple blockchains simultaneously. With its focus on interoperability, Quant Network&#8217;s Overledger solution provides a framework for bridging different blockchain networks, fostering connectivity and facilitating efficient data exchange between disparate systems. The use of QNT within the Overledger ecosystem not only powers these interoperability capabilities but also plays a crucial role in securing and incentivizing participants within the network. As the price of Quant (QNT) continues its upward trajectory, the growing interest in the token reflects the recognition of its importance in enabling the seamless operation of mDapps and facilitating cross-chain communication. With Quant Network&#8217;s innovative approach to interoperability, the future holds promising possibilities for enhanced collaboration and integration across various blockchain platforms. Related Reading: Injective Protocol (INJ) Tallies 23% Price Surge In Past 7 Days – Here’s Why Why’s There A Strong Bullish Sentiment For QNT?  The recent price surge of Quant (QNT) can be attributed to the transformative power of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the unique features offered by the Quant platform. DLT, surpassing the limitations of traditional blockchain, provides solutions to unanswered questions, enabling secure and cost-effective asset exchange while driving value, opening new markets, and increasing efficiency for enterprises, governments, and individuals worldwide. Founded in 2015 by Gilbert Verdian, Quant emerged as a pioneer in harnessing the potential of DLT to empower and expedite people&#8217;s lives. As the genesis of Quant, DLT addresses scalability issues by ensuring faster and more affordable transactions, offering a promising alternative to traditional blockchain networks. The unique utility of Quant (QNT) makes it a very interesting project. And, since utility is one of the major factors that affect the growth of a crypto project, it’s no surprise that investors are turning toward QNT. What’s Next For Quant? Quant has caught the attention of investors with its impressive market capitalization of $1,408,329,718 and a notable trading volume of $25,330,831. While it may have been considered the slowest in terms of price movement, Quant has consistently demonstrated growth in the cryptocurrency market.  Related Reading: Floki Inu Gains Momentum As Chinese E-Commerce Giant Recognizes Its Utility The optimistic founders of Quant believe that as a leader in the industry, the mass adoption of Quant holds great promise for its supporters.

					<description><![CDATA[Arbitrum (ARB), a prominent governance token in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, recently witnessed a decent surge in price following renewed buying activity from a well-known DeFi whale address.  Large-scale investors often influence market sentiment and can significantly impact the price of a given asset. However, as the rally unfolds, questions arise about the sustainability of this upward momentum and its implications for the future of Arbitrum. Related Reading: Floki Inu Gains Momentum As Chinese E-Commerce Giant Recognizes Its Utility Whale’s Unusual Buying Activity Coincides With ARB’s Rally Arbitrum&#8217;s (ARB) current price of $1.24 on CoinMarketCap highlights its remarkable performance, with a noteworthy 3.4% rally witnessed within the past 24 hours, followed by an impressive seven-day climb of 7%. Interestingly, this surge in value coincided with unusual buying activity associated with renowned trader Andrew Kang&#8217;s crypto addresses. Source: CoinMarketCap Particularly noteworthy is the fact that Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, has been making some interesting movements within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Kang put $1 million worth of stablecoins into Arbitrum pools and allocated nearly a quarter of the funds to the purchase of RDNT tokens. RDNT is the native token of the DeFi lending platform Radiant Capital. BTCUSD currently trading at $27,150 on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: XRP $1 Threshold On The Horizon? Noted Trader Fuels Speculation After filling his bags with RDNT, Kang subsequently exchanged his newly acquired tokens and existing RDNT reserves for $867,000 worth of ARB. These transactions were further followed by Kang depositing the proceeds into Radiant Capital, where he borrowed Circle&#8217;s USD Coin. These details have been revealed through data obtained from Lookonchain, a reliable data resource. Seems like Andrew Kang is using leverage to go long $ARB on @RDNTCapital. Buy $ARB → Deposit $ARB → Borrow $USDC → Buy $ARBhttps://t.co/PQwi0Zj9TT pic.twitter.com/afXjeRtTpv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2023 Multiple Whales Seize Opportunity As ARB Price Improves In addition to Kang&#8217;s intriguing buying activity, another significant player, known by the address &#8220;0xf59b,&#8221; has also recognized the potential in ARB&#8217;s upward trajectory. This whale made a strategic move by depositing 1.2 million ARB tokens, equivalent to $1.5 million, into the popular cryptocurrency exchange OKX. Whale&#8221;0xf59b&#8221; finally waited for the rise of $ARB and deposited 1.2M $ARB ($1.5M) into #OKX 30 minutes ago. He withdrew 1.2M $ARB from #OKX on May 8th, and the buying price may be around $1.2.https://t.co/cJReZfg007 pic.twitter.com/jFwBRtPUpK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2023 This whale&#8217;s decision to pull the tokens out from OKX on May 8 and potentially purchase them at around the $1.2 mark suggests a deliberate strategy of waiting for a price increase before taking advantage of their holdings. By carefully timing their actions, this entity sought to maximize their potential gains as ARB&#8217;s value climbed. These recent large-scale investments signify a growing optimism surrounding Arbitrum&#8217;s Layer 2 solution, despite the challenges it has faced in the market recently. The renewed interest from both Kang and the whale behind the address &#8220;0xf59b&#8221; reflects a belief in the long-term viability and potential profitability of ARB. Furthermore, these strategic moves by multiple whales indicate a broader sentiment within the crypto market. As the Ethereum network gradually recovers from the recent drop, there is a growing expectation of increased activity on Layer 2 networks. This anticipation sets the stage for a potentially bullish cycle for these networks, including Arbitrum. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice.

<h2><strong>Multiple Whales Seize Opportunity As ARB Price Improves</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to Kang&#8217;s intriguing buying activity, another significant player, known by the address &#8220;0xf59b,&#8221; has also recognized the potential in ARB&#8217;s upward trajectory. This whale made a strategic move by depositing <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1664569055746093060" rel="nofollow">1.2 million ARB tokens</a>, equivalent to $1.5 million, into the popular cryptocurrency exchange OKX.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Whale&#8221;0xf59b&#8221; finally waited for the rise of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$ARB</a> and deposited 1.2M <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$ARB</a> ($1.5M) into <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OKX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#OKX</a> 30 minutes ago.</p>

<p>This whale&#8217;s decision to pull the tokens out from OKX on May 8 and potentially purchase them at around the $1.2 mark suggests a deliberate strategy of waiting for a price increase before taking advantage of their holdings. By carefully timing their actions, this entity sought to maximize their potential gains as ARB&#8217;s value climbed.</p>
<p>These recent large-scale investments signify a growing optimism surrounding <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-arbitrum" rel="nofollow">Arbitrum&#8217;s Layer 2 solution</a>, despite the challenges it has faced in the market recently. The renewed interest from both Kang and the whale behind the address &#8220;0xf59b&#8221; reflects a belief in the long-term viability and potential profitability of ARB.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these strategic moves by multiple whales indicate a broader sentiment within the crypto market. As the Ethereum network gradually recovers from the recent drop, there is a growing expectation of increased activity on Layer 2 networks. This anticipation sets the stage for a potentially bullish cycle for these networks, including Arbitrum.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Celsius, a popular lending platform, has made significant moves in staking Ethereum (ETH) as they stake almost $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. According to the Blockchain intelligence company Arkham Intel, In the past 24 hours alone, Celsius has staked over $600 million worth of ETH, with no signs of slowing down. This represents a massive on-chain flow, and the rate of deposits continues to increase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Becoming Greener At An Unexpected Pace, Good For BTC Price? Celsius Goes All-In On ETH Celsiu&#8217;s address was the largest withdrawer when Lido (LDO) opened withdrawals in mid-May, withdrawing over 400,000 ETH, worth $800 million. They held this ETH in the &#8216;Unstaking&#8217; wallet for two weeks, declaring their intent to stake with institutional provider Figment instead. Around 24 hours ago, Celsius separated the ETH from the unstaking wallet into two separate deposit wallets. One wallet is marked Celsius&#8217;s ETH2 Deposit wallet, while the other wallet is labelled &#8220;Staked ETH&#8221; and deposits to Figment. Celsius&#8217;s staking wallet has seen over $400 million worth of ETH inflows over the past 24 hours, with continual deposits made every few minutes. Figment is a staking and infrastructure provider for blockchain networks, including Ethereum. The company provides institutional-grade staking infrastructure and tools for investors and companies looking to participate in the proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. Furthermore, the infrastructure provider offers a range of staking services, including delegated staking, which allows investors to delegate their tokens to a validator node to generate rewards without having to run their own node. The company also provides a range of developer tools, APIs, and analytics to help users better understand and manage their staking activities. Morevoer, the wallet provided to Celsius by Figment has seen over $215 million worth of ETH. In total, Celsius has deposited over $600 million worth of ETH, with the Celsius Staking wallet still holding over $150 million worth of ETH, and around $60 million worth of ETH left in the wallet they used to unstake from Lido. This means that Celsius still has a significant amount of ETH that they can potentially stake with another provider or use for other purposes. It also highlights the confidence that Celsius has in the staking services provided by Figment, as they have entrusted them with a large amount of their ETH holdings. Celsius&#8217;s move to stake such a large amount of ETH is a testament to the growing trend of staking in the crypto market. With more investors looking for ways to earn passive income on their holdings, staking is becoming an increasingly popular option. As more companies like Celsius enter the market, it can be expected to see even more growth in the staking sector in the coming months and years. Ethereum Market Poised For Major Move On the other hand, crypto analyst Jackis has recently shared insights on the current state of the Ethereum market, stating that there is potential for things to get exciting very soon. Despite the market remaining stagnant over the past few weeks, Jackis believes that Ethereum could be gearing up for a major move. According to Jackis, Ethereum has broken out of its downtrend and has successfully retested the breakout demand. If the cryptocurrency manages to flip the $1,887 resistance level, then there could be nothing stopping it from retesting the yearly range high at $2030. If Ethereum manages to reach and surpass this level, it could potentially continue to climb higher, possibly even reaching new yearly highs later down the line. Related Reading: Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist Predicts More Pain Ahead For Bitcoin At the time of writing, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading at $1,905, which represents a 2% surge in the last 24 hours.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celsius, a popular lending platform, has made significant moves in staking Ethereum (ETH) as they stake almost $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1664669447880048644?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According </a>to the Blockchain intelligence company Arkham Intel, In the past 24 hours alone, Celsius has staked over $600 million worth of ETH, with no signs of slowing down. This represents a massive on-chain flow, and the rate of deposits continues to increase.</p>

<h2>Celsius Goes All-In On ETH</h2>
<p>Celsiu&#8217;s address was the largest withdrawer when Lido (LDO) opened withdrawals in mid-May, withdrawing over 400,000 ETH, worth $800 million. They held this ETH in the &#8216;Unstaking&#8217; wallet for two weeks, declaring their intent to stake with institutional provider Figment instead.</p>
<p>Around 24 hours ago, Celsius separated the ETH from the unstaking wallet into two separate deposit wallets. One wallet is marked Celsius&#8217;s ETH2 Deposit wallet, while the other wallet is labelled &#8220;Staked ETH&#8221; and deposits to Figment. Celsius&#8217;s staking wallet has seen over $400 million worth of ETH inflows over the past 24 hours, with continual deposits made every few minutes.</p>

<p>Figment is a staking and infrastructure provider for blockchain networks, including Ethereum. The company provides institutional-grade staking infrastructure and tools for investors and companies looking to participate in the proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the infrastructure provider offers a range of staking services, including delegated staking, which allows investors to delegate their tokens to a validator node to generate rewards without having to run their own node. The company also provides a range of developer tools, APIs, and analytics to help users better understand and manage their staking activities.</p>
<p>Morevoer, the wallet provided to Celsius by Figment has seen over $215 million worth of ETH. In total, Celsius has deposited over $600 million worth of ETH, with the Celsius Staking wallet still holding over $150 million worth of ETH, and around $60 million worth of ETH left in the wallet they used to unstake from Lido.</p>
<p>This means that Celsius still has a significant amount of ETH that they can potentially stake with another provider or use for other purposes. It also highlights the confidence that Celsius has in the staking services provided by Figment, as they have entrusted them with a large amount of their ETH holdings.</p>
<p>Celsius&#8217;s move to stake such a large amount of ETH is a testament to the growing trend of staking in the crypto market. With more investors looking for ways to earn passive income on their holdings, staking is becoming an increasingly popular option. As more companies like Celsius enter the market, it can be expected to see even more growth in the staking sector in the coming months and years.</p>
Ethereum Market Poised For Major Move
<p>On the other hand, crypto analyst Jackis has recently shared <a href="https://twitter.com/i_am_jackis/status/1664568909993762816?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insights </a>on the current state of the Ethereum market, stating that there is potential for things to get exciting very soon. Despite the market remaining stagnant over the past few weeks, Jackis believes that Ethereum could be gearing up for a major move.</p>
<p>According to Jackis, Ethereum has broken out of its downtrend and has successfully retested the breakout demand. If the cryptocurrency manages to flip the $1,887 resistance level, then there could be nothing stopping it from retesting the yearly range high at $2030.</p>
<p>If Ethereum manages to reach and surpass this level, it could potentially continue to climb higher, possibly even reaching new yearly highs later down the line.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading at $1,905, which represents a 2% surge in the last 24 hours. It is yet to be seen if Ethereum can consolidate above this key level to breach the psychological barrier of $2,000 and continue its upward trend.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, is going green, and the pace at which the network has reduced its carbon emissions in the past three years has been noted by climate activists. Nonetheless, how this could impact BTC prices and attract technology firms like Tesla, the electric automobile manufacturer, is yet to be seen. Carbon Emission Associated With Bitcoin Miners Rapidly Falling As of late May, on-chain data from Woonomic shared by Daniel Batten, a climate technology investor, and activist, noted that the amount of Carbon emission associated with Bitcoin mining has fallen by nearly 50% from 601g/kWh to 299g/kWh in three short years. It should be observed that the Bitcoin hash rate and prices have been rising steadily during this time. In the last quarter of 2021, the Bitcoin price soared to as high as $69,000 before collapsing to below $16,000 in November 2022. Although prices have since recovered, soaring to as high as $31,000 in April 2023, the hash rate has been steadily rising over the years.  In proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin, the hash rate relays the computing power dedicated to the network in real time. It is a variable that makes the network secure and robust against third-party attacks, and can also be used to gauge the pace at which the Bitcoin platform consumes energy. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Schwartz Reveals Insights Into AMM Trading Strategy Miners channel computing power as “hash rate” to secure the Bitcoin network. They need this to verify transactions in exchange for network rewards. The more the hash rate, the higher the chance of earning a block and, thus, the 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes.  However, the tough competition for the block rewards has been partly blamed for environmental degradation and carbon emissions from miners. To stay competitive, Bitcoin miners have to operate gear that is energy-intensive. Critics have always maintained that electricity powering them is from coal and other non-renewable sources. As of June 2, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index shows that 105.23 TWh powers Bitcoin. It is the same amount of electricity consumed by Kazakhstan. The resulting Carbon emission, they add, stands at 58.69 Mt CO2, comparable to that emitted by Libya. However, data from the Bitcoin Mining Counsel, a group comprised of some of the largest BTC miners in the world, provides more insight into the cryptocurrency&#8217;s energy consumption after conducting a study on its members: (&#8230;) the members of the BMC (Bitcoin Mining Council) and participants in the survey are currently utilizing electricity with a 63.8% sustainable power mix. Based on this data, the global bitcoin mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix has improved marginally to 58.9% and remains one of the most sustainable industries globally. Will Green Mining Support BTC Prices? In that sense, Woonomic data coincides that emissions have fallen drastically over the last three years. It has nearly halved to 299g/kWh, suggesting miners switched to greener energy sources to power their rigs. Related Reading: Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist Predicts More Pain Ahead For Bitcoin Technology companies would likely consider adopting BTC as payment as carbon emissions fall. Earlier, Tesla reneged on their decision to accept BTC for payment, citing the impact of Bitcoin mining on the environment. With Carbon emissions decreasing, this could positively impact BTC as major entities worldwide will embrace the coin and network. Feature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In his latest report titled &#8220;Crypto Outlook, June 2023,&#8221; Bloomberg&#8217;s Senior Macro Strategist, Mike McGlone, predicts more pain ahead for Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market. McGlone argues that despite a rebound in prices in 2023, the risks for the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index remain tilted downward. Related Reading: No More Crab: Bitcoin Poised For Explosive Move Above $30,000 Is Bitcoin Doomed? According to McGlone, cryptocurrencies face several headwinds, including the potential for a US recession, a potential stock bear market, vigilant central banks, and high interest-rate competition. These factors, combined with the speculative excesses that led to the 2021 peak, suggest that the outlook for the crypto market is bearish. Furthermore, McGlone points out that Bitcoin weakening in May, along with copper and equities in China, is unusual compared to the stalwart Nasdaq 100 Stock Index. While the potential for the Nasdaq to lift all boats exists, it may contrast with still-rising Fed rate-hike expectations.  Additionally, McGlone suggests that Bitcoin, which is often referred to as digital gold due to its perceived status as a store of value, may not be able to outperform the traditional safe-haven asset in a US economic contraction. This is because Bitcoin is still relatively young compared to gold, which has been used as a store of value for thousands of years. As a result, investors may be more likely to flock to gold during times of economic uncertainty, rather than newer assets like Bitcoin. Moreover, plunging commodities, producer prices, and bank deposits may serve as deflationary omens of the lags to Federal Reserve tightening. These factors suggest that the risks for the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index are tilted downward, and investors should be cautious. As reported by NewsBTC on May 22nd, Mike McGlone highlighted the historical patterns of boom and bust in Bitcoin, which are closely tied to liquidity. According to McGlone, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price level of around $27,000 may be at risk of reversion, considering that it was only $7,000 at the end of 2019 before the massive liquidity pump in 2020. McGlone&#8217;s analysis also indicates that Bitcoin&#8217;s downward trajectory, as demonstrated by its 52-week moving average, contrasts with the upward trend it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. This suggests that the cryptocurrency is susceptible to booms when liquidity is abundant but vulnerable to busts when liquidity is removed. McGlone&#8217;s latest analysis aligns with his previous thesis that the outlook for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market is bearish, given the potential for a US recession, a potential stock bear market, vigilant central banks, and high interest-rate competition.  Is BTC About To Take Off? On the other hand, Crypto Con, a well-known crypto analyst, has recently expressed his continued bullishness on Bitcoin, citing the Pi Cycle Top indicator as evidence of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s potential for a continued uptrend. According to Crypto Con, the Yellow 111days Moving Average (MA) has started to uptick, indicating that Bitcoin is experiencing a positive trend. Additionally, Bitcoin has been retesting the 111DMA line as support, rather than continuing on a parabolic trajectory, which is typically a sign of a market top. &#160; Crypto Con acknowledges that sometimes the bounce can take some time, but he maintains that this is nothing but bullish for Bitcoin. This is because the Pi Cycle Top indicator is a reliable tool that has historically predicted major market tops and bottoms in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Schwartz Reveals Insights Into AMM Trading Strategy The Pi Cycle Top indicator measures the relationship between the 111DMA and the 350DMA, and when the two lines cross, it can suggest a potential market top or bottom. The fact that the Yellow 111DMA is showing an uptick suggests that Bitcoin may be headed for a market bottom, which is a bullish sign for investors. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin, is trading at $27,000. Over the past 24 hours, BTC’s price has remained relatively stable, exhibiting sideways price action with a minor increase of 0.1%.

					<description><![CDATA[Here are the pricing model lines that Bitcoin might have to stay above if the bullish momentum of the cryptocurrency has to continue. These Bitcoin Pricing Models Are Currently Near The Spot Price In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out how the three pricing models, the adjusted realized price, the short-term holder cost basis, and the 200-week MA, are all close to the asset&#8217;s value right now. To understand the first and second models here, the &#8220;realized price&#8221; needs to be looked at first. The realized price is a pricing model derived from the realized cap, which is a capitalization model that assumes that the &#8220;real&#8221; value of each coin in the circulating supply is not the spot price, but the price at which it was last moved. When this cap is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the average cost basis or acquisition price in the market is obtained. This value, which the average holder on the network bought their coins at, is known as the realized price. Now, the first pricing model, the &#8220;adjusted realized price,&#8221; is a modification of this indicator that drops from the data all holders who haven&#8217;t moved their coins since more than seven years ago. Related Reading: Why This Is The Most Important Bitcoin Chart You’ll See This Week Such old supply usually consists mostly of the coins that have been lost (perhaps due to the wallet keys no longer being accessible), which means that this part of the supply wouldn&#8217;t be relevant to the current market, hence why the indicator cuts it out. As for the second model of interest here, the &#8220;short-term holder (STH) cost basis,&#8221; this metric keeps track of the realized price of specifically the investors who have been holding their coins since less than 155 days. Here is a chart that shows how these Bitcoin pricing models have compared with the spot price during the past year: The price seems to be just above these models at the moment &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin adjusted realized price currently has a value of $25,300, while the short-term holder cost basis has a value of $26,000. Historically, these models have acted as both resistance and support for the price, depending on the wider trend. In bullish periods, they usually act as support so it&#8217;s possible that if the price drops deep enough to hit them, a rebound may happen. The third line on the chart, the 200-week moving average (MA), is a model that aims to find the baseline momentum of the four year Bitcoin cycle. This line has also had some similar interactions with the price as the other two models. The 200-week MA has a value of $26,300 right now, implying that it&#8217;s currently the closest line to the spot price. It now remains to be seen how the price interacts with these lines, starting with the 200-week MA, if a drawdown extended enough happens.

BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,000, up 1% in the last week.

<h2>These Bitcoin Pricing Models Are Currently Near The Spot Price</h2>
<p>In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1664217187047940097" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Glassnode</a> has pointed out how the three pricing models, the adjusted realized price, the short-term holder cost basis, and the 200-week MA, are all close to the asset&#8217;s value right now.</p>
<p>To understand the first and second models here, the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-under-realized-price-163-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">realized price</a>&#8221; needs to be looked at first. The realized price is a pricing model derived from the realized cap, which is a capitalization model that assumes that the &#8220;real&#8221; value of each coin in the circulating supply is not the spot price, but the price at which it was last moved.</p>
<p>When this cap is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the average cost basis or acquisition price in the market is obtained. This value, which the average holder on the network bought their coins at, is known as the realized price.</p>
<p>Now, the first pricing model, the &#8220;adjusted realized price,&#8221; is a modification of this indicator that drops from the data all holders who haven&#8217;t moved their coins since more than seven years ago.</p>

<p>Such old supply usually consists mostly of the coins that have been lost (perhaps due to the wallet keys no longer being accessible), which means that this part of the supply wouldn&#8217;t be relevant to the current market, hence why the indicator cuts it out.</p>
<p>As for the second model of interest here, the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-short-term-holder-profit-nov-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">short-term holder</a> (STH) cost basis,&#8221; this metric keeps track of the realized price of specifically the investors who have been holding their coins since less than 155 days.</p>
<p>Here is a chart that shows how these Bitcoin pricing models have compared with the spot price during the past year:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fxh8jKRXwAEulRa?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Bitcoin Realized Price" width="3428" height="1974"/></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin adjusted realized price currently has a value of $25,300, while the short-term holder cost basis has a value of $26,000.</p>
<p>Historically, these models have acted as both resistance and support for the price, depending on the wider trend. In bullish periods, they usually act as support so it&#8217;s possible that if the price drops deep enough to hit them, a rebound may happen.</p>
<p>The third line on the chart, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-hangs-on-26200-why-this-crucial-support-level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">200-week moving average (MA)</a>, is a model that aims to find the baseline momentum of the four year Bitcoin cycle. This line has also had some similar interactions with the price as the other two models.</p>
<p>The 200-week MA has a value of $26,300 right now, implying that it&#8217;s currently the closest line to the spot price. It now remains to be seen how the price interacts with these lines, starting with the 200-week MA, if a drawdown extended enough happens.</p>

<p>A successful retest of these lines would naturally be a positive sign for the rally, but a drop under them may be a signal that a transition back towards a bearish regime has occurred.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,000, up 1% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent post, Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, explained Automated Market Makers (AMMs) &#8211; a vital component in the decentralized finance (DeFi) framework, and their trading strategies for profit. Related Reading: Litecoin Breaks $95 As Whale Transactions Spike Schwartz states that AMMs thrive when an asset is volatile but does not change its price direction much. Schwartz explained further that an asset whose volatility exceeds its long-term trend would have a positive average percentage movement. However, if the long-term trend is negative, it will reduce the average slightly and vice-versa.  It’s Not Difficult to Create A Trading Strategy, Ripple CTO According to the Ripple CTO, it is not difficult to create a trading strategy to track the average percentage movement of an asset.  He further explained that the trading strategy of an AMM is advanced compared to a simple trading strategy and focuses on price volatility. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Says This Will Kickstart The Bitcoin Bull Market Schwartz, however, added a disclaimer at the end of his analysis. He stated that the AMM trading strategy only works for an AMM between an asset with a fixed price and one whose price is volatile enough to overcome its long-term trend.  Also, he believes that although AMM works even when the assets don&#8217;t meet the stated conditions, their behavior is different. From his analysis, a notable deviation will only occur with a long-term negative price movement that exceeds the volatility. Crypto Enthusiast Reacts To Analysis Reacting to Schwartz&#8217;s AMM analysis, Molly Elmore asked if XRP would be the asset with a fixed price paired with every other asset on the XRP ledger (XRPL). In response, Schwartz stated that the AMM is not exclusive to XRP and can function between any asset pair. However, the trading strategies will differ mathematically if both assets are volatile.  Citing the BTC/XRP pair as a reference, Schwartz stated that although both assets are volatile, the pairing is still great. Additionally, he stated that if you are bullish on XRP and BTC, investing in an XRP/USD AMM implies holding much USD that can go up. Notably, holding shares of an XRP/BTC AMM captures more of the upward price movement of XRP and BTC if the bullish sentiment is correct. Schwartz continued his analysis, stating that if XRP and BTC&#8217;s price doubles, an XRP/USD AMM has a worst-case (no volatility and no market making) yield of around 40%. In comparison, an XRP/BTC AMM has a worst-case yield of 100%. On the flip side, Schwartz noted that the outcome is worse if your bullish sentiment is wrong.  If both XRP and BTC reduce by 50%, the worst case loss is 50%, while for an XRP/USD AMM, the worst case loss is about 30%. So he believes XRP USD is safer while XRP/BTC is volatile. Schwartz noted that his analysis seemed complex and explained further in a tweet.  He stated that AMMs charges trading fees, and volatility causes people to trade with AMMs. Therefore, AMMs turn volatility into fees.
