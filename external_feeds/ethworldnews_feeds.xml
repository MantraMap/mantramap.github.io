<ul><li>FTX CEO John Ray has testified before the U.S House Committee on Financial Services</li><li>John Ray criticized former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for his unacceptable business practices.&nbsp;</li><li>The new management has recovered over $1 billion of the lost funds.&nbsp;</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried has blamed John Ray and his team for jeopardizing the funds of FTX US customers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>John Ray III, the current CEO of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWAnrigAO3I" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">testified</a>&nbsp;before the U.S House Committee on Financial Services earlier today. This much anticipated congressional hearing was originally meant to feature former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried as well, but given that he is currently under arrest in The Bahamas, Mr. Ray has given lawmakers and creditors some key insights into the controversial business activities that transpired at what was once the world’s second-largest crypto exchange.</p>



<h2><strong>Unacceptable management practices at FTX</strong></h2>



<p>According to John Ray, FTX had “unacceptable management practices” which ultimately led to its collapse. The current CEO revealed that there was literally no record keeping within the company whatsoever. The man who was brought in to clean up the controversial Enron scandal, testified that he had never seen such an utter lack of record keeping at a company.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The owners, business, and senior management had virtual control of all the accounts and could move money or assets as they desired, undetected by customers.” John Ray stated.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>As for the funds lost due to the poor management that went on with FTX and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-knew-more-about-alameda-research-than-let-on/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alameda Research</a>, Mr. Ray stated that the funds lost were in excess of $7 billion. He added that his team had successfully recovered more than $1 billion of those funds. John Ray has estimated that it will take several months to secure the bankrupt exchange’s assets. The lack of proper financial records will be a major hindrance in this process. “‘I don’t trust a single piece of paper at this organization,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried’s congressional testimony</strong></h2>



<p>The former CEO was also expected to testify before the congressional committee. The testimony was canceled following his arrest by Bahamian authorities last night. However, a transcript of his intended testimony was published by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/?sh=2f1ecc3c3c47" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>&nbsp;earlier today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to SBF’s testimony, “American customers were protected, at least until Mr. Ray’s team took over.” The document further reveals that FTX US had separate order books and funds from the parent company. Sam Bankman-Fried was confident that the customers of the American subsidiary could be made whole immediately since FTX US is still solvent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried on Tuesday.</li><li>The unseal indictment order detailed eight counts including fraud, conspiracy, and violation of U.S. Campaign Finance Laws.</li><li>Other authorities like the CFTC and SEC filed charges against Bankman-Fried following his arrest by Bahamian law enforcement. </li></ul>



<p>The United States of America charged FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried on eight counts including in the Southern District of New York. United States Attorney Damian Williams previously announced SBF’s arrest in the Bahamas ahead of formal criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An indictment document unsealed on Tuesday revealed eight charges against SBF built around the operations of crypto exchange FTX, and Alameda research.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Counts Against Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<ul><li>Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on Customers&nbsp;</li><li>Wire Fraud on Customers&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on Lenders</li><li>Wire Fraud on Lenders</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Commodities Fraud</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Defraud the United State of America and Violate the Campaign Finance Laws</li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23450344-unsealed-indictment-in-us-v-bankman-fried-22-cr-673-abrams-as-sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-heads-to-sdny-echoes-of-onecoin-and-un-bribery-cases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indictment</a> means that Federal prosecutors have evidence that Sam Bankman-Fried used deceived customers and investors alike. U.S. Attorneys filed that SBF used customer funds from the FTX exchange to finance Alameda’s trading position and loan obligations. This means that customer deposits and assets were exposed to substantial losses worth billions. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried notably denied defrauding customers of their crypto assets during several public interviews. SBF also claimed that Alameda had limited access to assets deposited on the FTX exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>U.S. prosecutors filed that Bankman-Fried knowingly comingled funds between FTX deposits and Alameda.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>BANKMAN-FRIED agreed with others to defraud customers of FTX.com by misappropriating those customers’ deposits and using those deposits to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research, BANKHAN- FRIED&#8217;s proprietary crypto hedge fund, and to make investments.</p></blockquote>



<p>FTX CEO John Ray’s scathing testimony before House Committee on Financial Services <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankruptcy-documents-fraud/">echoed</a> concerns from users and authorities alike that FTX, under SBF’s leadership, funded Alameda with stolen FTX user deposits. SBF was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-testify-senate/">scheduled</a> to testify at the same hearing prior to his arrest.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Authorities Crackdown On Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Southern District of New York (SDNY) have both <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/">charged </a>Sam Bankman-Fried for the collapse of FTX. Another regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), announced a lawsuit against the former crypto billionaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was arrested in the Bahamas on Tuesday. At press time, it’s unclear if or when extradition to American soil will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The FTX founder stands accused of diverting customers from the crypto exchange FTX to his trading firm Alameda Research.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried also allegedly defrauded equity investors from around May 2019 till November 2022.</li><li>The SEC announced charges against SBF hours after Bahamian authorities arrested the fallen FTX founder and Southern District of New York prosecutors filed criminal charges.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding equity investors and customers of the bankruptcy cryptocurrency exchange. SBF was also arrested in the Bahamas after authorities received formal confirmation of criminal charges against Bankman-Fried in the United States.</p>



<p>Southern District of New York prosecutors charged Sam Bankman-Fried with wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering, per the New York Times.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">USA Damian Williams: Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY.  We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.</p>&mdash; US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1602451395910803457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>SEC vs Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>According to the SECs <a href="https://t.co/w2kZOfN7He" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filing</a>, SBF deceived equity investors of FTX Trading Ltd while also defrauding retail customers as well. The commission noted that Bankman-Fried raised over $1.8 billion from around 90 U.S.-based investors between May 2019 and November 2022. </p>



<p>The SEC said SBF branded himself as a “responsible leader of the crypto community” while “orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud”.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform. But from the start, Bankman-Fried improperly diverted customer assets to his privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC (“Alameda”), and then used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tuesday’s filing noted that Bankman-Fried continued funding Alameda with FTX customer deposits when his trading giant was unable to meet loan obligations after the crypto crash in May 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SECs filing argued that Alameda was bolstered with FTX customer assets in order to keep up appearances and maintain access to cash injections from investors and lenders. Also, the charges <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankruptcy-documents-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that company assets were used to fund personal loans to SBF and other top FTX executives.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>But Bankman-Fried did not stop there. Even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Through the summer of 2022, he directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for “loans” to himself and other FTX executives.</p></blockquote>



<p>SEC prosecutors further opined that Sam Bankman-Fried remained active in decision-making at Alameda despite appointing Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco as joint heads of the company. The allegations threw more doubt on claims from SBF that he had little knowledge of day-to-day operations at Alameda. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bankman-Fried remained the ultimate decision-maker at Alameda, even after Ellison and Trabucco became co-CEOs in or around October 2021. Bankman-Fried directed investment and operational decisions, frequently communicated with Alameda employees, and had full access to Alameda’s records and databases.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was the first to face charges following FTX’s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankrupt-sam-bankman-fried-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collapse</a> in November 2022. The fallen crypto tycoon was in custody and awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. at press time. </p>

<h2><strong>Binance takes a step towards customer education</strong></h2>



<p>Binance revealed this program in a blog post, which stated that it will be available to interested students across the world. The program will be taught in English as well as French. It is scheduled to launch in February next year and marks an important step towards customer education and crypto adoption. According to the announcement, it has already been tested on a group of 1000 participants.</p>



<p>This program will last for three months, but students will have the opportunity to learn at their own pace. As per the official website of <a href="https://founderz.com/program/online-master-blockchain-web3" rel="nofollow noopener">Founderz</a>, the program will feature a virtual campus for students to network and attend events. The Online Master in Blockchain and Web3 course is based on a microlearning concept which means that it is suitable for students without a technical background as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program is set to cost €650, but <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/billions-transfered-binance-ftxs-collapse/">Binance</a> users who sign up before the end of the year will get a 50% discount. In a bid to attract potential students, the program will also roll out special edition NFTs for the first 7500 students. These NFTs will be minted over the first 3 months of the program and will grant the holders access to exclusive events and program contents.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The blockchain startup suggested connecting Uniswap V3 to BNB Chain, the second-largest DeFi ecosystem with over a million active user addresses and $5 billion in total value locked.</li><li>0xPlasma Labs argued that deploying on BNB will expand utility and trading on the decentralized exchange beyond Ethereum&#8217;s network. </li></ul>



<p>0xPlasma Labs <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-to-bnb-chain-binance/19734" rel="nofollow noopener">submitted</a> a governance proposal aimed at deploying Uniswap v3 on DeFi’s second-largest blockchain network by trading volume and active users &#8211; BNB Chain. The startup, 0xPlasma Labs, builds tools to complement the crypto decentralized exchange (DEX).</p>



<p>Ilia Maksimenka, the CEO of 0xPlasma  who published the proposal, argued that Uniswp could onboard more than a million active users and an additional $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Ethereum topped the TVL on the DEX with $2.3 billion out of $2.5 billion when this report was written. </p>



<p>DeFiLlama data showed Ethereum Layer 2 protocols Polygon ($26.7 million) and Arbitrum (83.5 million) were the second and third largest by TVL on the DEX. Maksimenka’s plan added that bringing BNB Chain into the fold will earn the respect of decentralized finance solution builders and boost adoption for Uniswap’s NFT platform. </p>



<p>The proposal was in discussion at press time. It’s unclear whether the community will agree with 0xPlasma Labs that Uniswap&#8217;s third iteration or V3 should deploy on BNB Chain.  Notably, the move could intensify competition with Pancakeswap, the leading DEX on Binance&#8217;s blockchain.</p>

<p>BNB Chain was launched in September 2020 by leading crypto exchange Binance. The BNB token initially lived on Ethereum’s network before Binance migrated the coin to its own decentralized network.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Ethereum’s Most Active Smart Contract &#8211; Uniswap V3</h2>



<p>Data from Tokenterminal showed that Uniswap topped other protocols in terms of gas consumption. Gas refers to the fees paid by traders when sending cryptocurrencies. The smart contract code powering the DEX used around $4.4 million in gas fees, making Uniswap the most active smart contract on Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Reuters reported that the U.S. Justice Department remained undecided about charging Binance with fraud and money laundering.</li><li>About a dozen prosecutors reportedly advised actions against the leading crypto exchange, its founder Changpeng Zhao, and other executives at the company.</li><li>Other lawyers proposed delaying any decision till more evidence can be reviewed.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Reuters reported that a “split” between prosecutors in the U.S. Department of Justice impeded a decision on whether criminal charges should be brought against crypto exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-probed-anti-money-aundering/">opened</a> investigations into Binance and several executives at the company in 2018, including CZ. Reports said that Zhao and his company were under probe due to suspicions of “unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations”.</p>



<p>Around a dozen prosecutors on the case proposed “aggressively moving” against Zhao’s company, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N3321X6" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> on Monday. The U.S. Justice Department was unable to reach a consensus on the matter as other lawyers said more time was needed to review evidence. </p>

</figure>



<p>Furthermore, Reuters claims that lawyers from Gibson Dunn met with Justice Department officials to discuss possible plea deals. Gibson Dunn represents the cryptocurrency exchange as a U.S. law firm. </p>



<h2>Binance Calls Out Reuters</h2>



<p>Friction between Binance and Reuters erupted following a series of reports from the media company that accused CZ’s exchange of violating U.S. sanctions and laundering $10 billion for criminal organizations. Binance said the reports leveraged outdated information and contested the claims.</p>



<p>On Monday, Reuters quoted a company spokesperson who said the crypto exchange had no “into the inner workings of the US Justice Department, nor would it be appropriate for us to comment if we did.”</p>



<p>Shortly after the story broke, Binance called out Reuters for cherry-picking their words in Monday’s report. The company published its full statement on the matter, claiming to have a good relationship with law enforcement and prosecutors. </p>



<p>While the response cites a blog post on a so-called law enforcement team started in 2021, the statement did not address claims of plea talks between CZ&#8217;s company and with the Department of Justice. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reuters has it wrong again. <br><br>Now they&#39;re attacking our incredible law enforcement team. A team that we&#39;re incredibly proud of &#8211; they&#39;ve made crypto more secure for all of us. <br><br>Here’s the full statement we sent the reporter and a blog about our remarkable law enforcement team.</p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1602287184400326656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>Crypto Industry On High Alert</h2>



<p>The news comes on the heels of FUD around CZ’s company in the wake of FTX’s collapse. Users expressed skepticism about the company’s proof-of-reserves and proof-of-liabilities audit which was recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-bitcoin-reserves-collateralized/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-bitcoin-reserves-collateralized/" rel="noreferrer noopener">attested</a> by Mazars.</p>



<p>Indeed, scrutiny of industry players and crypto companies surged after consecutive meltdowns in the crypto markets where entities like BlockFi, Celsius, FTX, Terra, and Three Arrows Capital wiped out billions in retail investments.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>SBF tweeted approval for a social media post suggesting restarting FTX and issuing new FTT tokens to users.</li><li>Bankman-Fried hailed the proposal as a &#8220;productive path for parties to explore&#8221;.</li><li>The suggestion was tweeted by Ran Neuner, a crypto influencer and coin Shiller who goes by CryptomanRan.</li></ul>



<p>Fallen crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried opined that restarting bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and issuing a new version of the FTT token to users could facilitate relief for users frozen out of their assets. </p>



<p>Indeed, SBF agreed with a post from Ran Neuner who tweeted an FTX “recovery proposal. CryptomanRan, as Neuner is known on Crypto Twitter, also proposed distributing the new FTT tokens to FTX clients. “Accrue 100% of profits to token holders” Neuner added.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>CT Backlash</h2>



<p>Crypto Twitter was awash with skepticism and critique for the <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1601129063221202945?s=20&amp;t=1yN6YZmGMw65-Amh5ITPcQ" rel="nofollow noopener">suggestion</a>.

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried traded jabs with other crypto CeFi execs from rival companies and bankrupt entities alike. SBF and Binance Changpeng Zhao engaged in heated replies after CZ called out Kevin O’Leary for accepting $15 million to promote FTX.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted that he will be in Washington DC on December 13, 2022 to testify before the House Committee on Financial Services. Bankman-Fried claimed that his knowledge of the FTX crash was limited and he expects to be of little use to the committee, per his Friday Twitter post. </p>

<p>Chairwoman Maxine Waters invited SBF to testify regarding FTX before the committee. Bankman-Fried drew heavy backlash from the public after turning down the request.</p>



<p>The crypto exchange founder was supposedly “reviewing what happened” and said his knowledge of the matter was insufficient, a claim refuted by Rep. Waters who reminded SBF of his comments in the media after FTX <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-letter-ftx-employees/">collapse</a>. Waters also pointed out that SBF had enough insight, seeing as he was at the helm of affairs from the firm’s inception to its bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, Bankman-Fried’s media tour following FTX’s collapse has both infuriated begrudged users and left questions unanswered. At press time, the former tech tycoon admitted to loose financial control at the crypto exchange during an interview with The Block. SBF did not however clarify whether or not customer funds were used to backstop Alameda Research.</p>



<h2>3AC’s Su Zhu And Kyle Davies Blame FTX For Luna Crash</h2>



<p>SBF was embroiled in Twitter spat with Three Arrows Capital’s co-founder over accusations that FTX crashed LUNA in May. “you also have to be afraid of highly conflicted industry players working to destroy your assets” 3AC’s Su Zhu tweeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhu also suggested that 3AC trading positions were “hunted” by SBF through his crypto exchange and his trading giant. Bankman-Fried refuted the allegations, claiming that it never happened.&nbsp;</p>

The auditor reported full collaboration after verifying the company’s proof-of-reserves and proof-of-liabilities.&nbsp; Mazars audit also included customer assets, per details from the <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total platform liabilities,&#8221; said Mazars in an announcement. The exact percentage was 101%.</p></blockquote>



<p>As of November 3, 2022, on-chain data showed that the leading crypto exchange boasted the single largest BTC wallet with around 252,597 Bitcoin. The wallet held an estimated $5 billion in crypto, around 1.3% of BTC’s circulating supply.</p>

<h2>Binance and Kucoin Tap Same Auditor</h2>



<p>Notably, Kucoin also hired Mazars to verify its reserves in line with the trend among crypto exchanges. Mazars’ audit on Kucoin was not published at press time. Sam Bankman-Fried invested in Kucoin via FTX. </p>

<p>Third-party audits like these have become almost mandatory for crypto exchanges in particular following the FTX debacle. Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange and his trading outfit Alameda allegedly defrauded users of their assets and filed for bankruptcy after incriminating evidence was leaked to the public. </p>



<p>The resulting fallout <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-reserve/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivized</a> other centralized trading platforms like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cz-binance-issues-another-warning-directed-at-exchanges-crypto-com-and-gate-io/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cz-binance-issues-another-warning-directed-at-exchanges-crypto-com-and-gate-io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/changpeng-zhao-takes-a-dig-kraken-kucoin/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/changpeng-zhao-takes-a-dig-kraken-kucoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kucoin</a>, and Kraken to publish proof of their reserves, showing customer assets as well as liabilities. On-chain data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and Nansen also launched dashboards where users can view exchange reserves for themselves.</p>



<p>Not every crypto exchange had published proof-of-reserves, proof-of-liabilities, and third-party audits. However, Binance and Kraken were quick to act in the wake of FTX&#8217;s crash. Users also pointed out that reserve audits and reports should be published regularly by exchanges and companies.</p>
