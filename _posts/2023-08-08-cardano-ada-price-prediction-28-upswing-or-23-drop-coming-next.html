Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at a pivotal $0.291. The question is: Will ADA experience a 28% upswing or is a 23% drop on the horizon? Remarkably, the ADA price still remains in bearish territory, but the potential for a trend reversal is palpable. Price Analysis: 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart paints a picture of ADA trading just a smidge above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at $0.286. Notably, on Monday, ADA briefly dipped below this level but was buoyed by the ascending trend line (black line) that was established in mid-June. This trend line is the bulls&#8217; last stand; a breach could see a bearish descent to the year&#8217;s low of $0.22. Adding another layer of complexity, the 200-EMA (blue line) on the 4-hour chart is converging towards the 23.6% Fibonacci level. ADA&#8217;s recent inability to surpass the 20-EMA (red line) is concerning. With the moving averages trending downward, a compression between $0.28 and $0.30 seems inevitable. However, if ADA remains resilient above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level and the trendline, and manages to break the moving averages, especially the 200-EMA, then the bulls might just have a fighting chance.

In this scenario, the 38.2% Fibonacci at $0.319, the 50% Fibonacci at $0.346, and the 61.8% Fibonacci at $0.378 become the next logical targets. A daily close above $0.38 (July&#8217;s high) would be a clarion call for the bulls, marking a 28% rallye from the recent price. Bullish Arguments for Cardano The recent price movements by Cardano might be bearish, but there are compelling arguments in favor of ADA&#8217;s potential resurgence. Santiment, a renowned analytics platform, recently tweeted: As Cardano sits just above $0.29, whales and sharks holding between 100K-10M ADA have accumulated back to their highest level since September, 2022. Additionally, on-chain transaction volume has been rising nearly every week for the past 6 months. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Price Remains Muted Despite Significant Milestones, Why? This statement is supported by data indicating ADA&#8217;s transaction volume surged above a staggering 67 billion ADA in consecutive weeks, a peak not seen since September 2021. Such heightened network activity is often interpreted as a bullish sign, indicative of increased user engagement and interest. Furthermore, ADA wallets holding between 100K-10M ADA now account for a significant 34.04% of all circulating tokens, suggesting strong confidence among larger investors. Also, Messari&#8217;s recent report on Cardano offers more reasons for optimism. The report delves deep into Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem, financial trends, and network performance. One of the standout revelations is the surge in decentralized app (dapp) activities. For the third consecutive quarter, Cardano has seen a remarkable uptick in dapp transactions, boasting a 49.0% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q2, averaging 57,900 daily transactions.
