These will be related to the termination of derivatives with clients and arrangements to compensate retail customers.</strong></p>
<h2>ASIC Revokes Financial Services License of Crypto Exchange FTX Subsidiary</h2>
<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced it had canceled the financial services license of FTX Australia, a company owned by the failed crypto exchange FTX which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy in the United States last fall.</p>
<p>“ASIC has cancelled the Australian financial services (AFS) license held by FTX Australia Pty Ltd (FTX Australia), effective from 14 July 2023,” the regulatory body said in a <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-193mr-asic-cancels-afs-licence-of-ftx-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> published Thursday on its website.</p>
<p>Under the cancellation terms, FTX Australia will be permitted to provide limited financial services related to the termination of existing derivatives with clients until the end of July 12, 2024, the Commission noted and also highlighted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cancellation has no effect on requirements for FTX Australia to continue as a member of Australian Financial Complaints Authority, and to have arrangements for compensating retail clients.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bahamas-headquartered FTX, which was one of the world’s largest digital asset exchanges, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the State of Delaware on Nov. 11, 2022, amid liquidity issues. Its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was extradited to the U.S. where he faces a lawsuit for alleged fraud.</p>
<p>Also on Nov. 11, Australian authorities appointed three voluntary administrators of FTX Australia and its subsidiary, FTX Express Pty Ltd which, according to the securities regulator, operates a digital currency exchange not regulated by ASIC.</p>
<p>FTX Australia’s AFS license was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/australia-suspends-financial-services-license-of-local-ftx-entity/">suspended</a> by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on Nov. 14, 2022. The suspension, initially imposed until May 15, 2023, was later extended to July 24, 2023.</p>

The round, led by Dragonfly, aims to help issue Ethena&#8217;s decentralized stablecoin product in Q3 2023, which was inspired by an article written by former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoin Protocol Ethena Raises $6.5 Million in Seed Funding Round</h2>
<p>Ethena, an Ethereum stablecoin protocol, has <a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs/status/1681592637537816578?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $6.5 million in its seed round. The funding round led by Dragonfly Capital also had the participation of former Bitmex CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-predicts-bitcoin-bull-market-as-us-economy-worsens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Hayes</a> and some derivatives exchanges such as Deribit, Bybit, Okx, Gemini, and Huobi. Ethena&#8217;s goal is to bring to fruition a stablecoin that has no connection with the traditional financial system.</p>
<p>The protocol was inspired by the &#8220;<a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/dust-on-crust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dust on Crust</a>&#8221; Arthur Hayes article, where he explains how a stablecoin can be constructed using <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delta-neutral</a> techniques, derivatives, and onchain collateral. Ethena uses the concept of the &#8220;Nakadollar,&#8221; which Hayes proposed using Bitcoin, and applies it to Ethereum instead, looking to turn this cryptocurrency &#8220;into the first crypto-native yield-bearing stablecoin which is not reliant on the banking system.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Ethena, this stablecoin has a potential market of more than 130 billion, given that they view their permissionless savings return product as &#8220;the largest market opportunity that crypto can provide for the world.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Usde and the Internet Bonds</h2>
<p>Ethena projects to issue their financial instruments in two phases. The first one includes the rollout of usde, an on-chain collateral derivatives-based stablecoin product, estimated to be available by Q3 2023, using the funds raised during this round.</p>
<p>A later phase will include issuing what Ethena calls the internet bond. The internet bond is projected to behave as a traditional U.S. treasury without being linked to any central bank or financial institution, building on staked Ethereum deposits and usde, developing &#8220;the first globally accessible and permissionless crypto savings instrument.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dragonfly general partner Tom Schmidt reinforced the relevance of a truly decentralized, stable, and capital-efficient stablecoin product due to the growth of the usage of stablecoins around the world for savings and remittance-related uses.</p>
<p>Schmidt stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethena has a breakthrough design that remedies these issues while also benefiting a broad user-base. We&#8217;re thrilled to be partnering with them to bring their vision to life.</p>
</blockquote>

According to importers, the Argentine government considers freight costs exceeding 15% of the value of the merchandise imported as an inconsistency.</strong></p>
<h2>Central Bank of Argentina Delays Dollar Disbursements to Importers</h2>
<p>The government of Argentina is now being accused of delaying the delivery of dollars to Argentine importers by using freight costs as an excuse. According to Argentine economist Ignacio Olivera Doll, the government is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/gobierno-niega-dolares-que-dio-para-importar-mercado-sin-bozal#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using</a> a limit for the cost of freights that hadn&#8217;t been applied before, as a basis for these actions.</p>
<p>The government has denied dollar requests for freight payments whose costs exceed 15% of the value of the merchandise transported. Argentine importers, as a result of exchange controls, need to receive dollars via government approval to conduct their operations.</p>
<p>Customs General Manager Guillermo Michel denied this, stating that the payments system was working as usual. Nonetheless, he explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>It happens some parameters are distorted with reality and historical margins. Some importers want to transfer transport amounts higher than those authorized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Numerous payments have been delayed due to this inconsistency during the last two weeks, as the government is being drained of its dollar and yuan reserves to provide importers with already approved resources. According to recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentinas-reserves-bleed-central-bank-of-brazil-would-be-able-to-manipulate-digital-real-in-cbdc-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, Argentina&#8217;s net reserves have touched historically low levels, reaching -$7 billion.</p>
<h2>Chinese Yuan-Based Sales Also Rationed</h2>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not only dollar-based disbursements that are being affected by the measures put in place by the Argentine government regarding reserve expenditures. The allocation of yuan reserves to companies that have adopted it as a settlement currency to pay providers has also slowed.</p>
<p>Ambito <a href="https://www.ambito.com/economia/el-banco-central-regula-la-venta-yuanes-mientras-se-negocia-el-fmi-n5773465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that yuan-based allocations have also been reduced in the last few days, going from an average of $90 million per day to less than $10 million daily on July 14 and 17. This reduction might be related to the failure of the government to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about the anticipated disbursement of at least $4 billion.</p>
<p>Argentina has to pay $2.7 billion to the IMF by the end of July. If the government does not reach an agreement for the anticipated disbursement, it might have to use part of the approved Chinese swap line to pay, as it did last month when it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentina-settles-imf-payment-in-yuan-brazilian-cbdc-to-be-launched-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> $1 billion in yuan to complete a payment to the IMF.</p>

<h2>BRICS Group Attracts More Than 40 Nations</h2>
<p>Anil Sooklal, South Africa&#8217;s top diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, and officials from the South African foreign affairs department shared the latest stats on BRICS membership applications in a press conference in Johannesburg on Thursday. South Africa will host this year’s BRICS summit. The economic bloc comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Sooklal revealed that 22 countries have formally asked to join the BRICS. He was also quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>An equal number of countries … have informally expressed interest in becoming BRICS members &#8230; (including) all the major global south countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Countries interested in joining the BRICS include Argentina, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Comoros, Gabon, and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The BRICS leaders’ summit will take place on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg, with one of the key topics on the agenda being the discussion of BRICS expansion. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, will not be attending in person.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sooklal emphasized the rapid expansion of the BRICS bloc. The diplomat was quoted by IOL news outlet as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the expansion of BRICS, it could increase to include more than 50 countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the topics that has received worldwide attention is the proposed common BRICS currency. Russian news outlet RT recently <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that the BRICS nations are launching a gold-backed currency that will be announced at the August summit. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, has insisted that the BRICS <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">does not have an immediate plan</a> to create a common currency to challenge the dominance of the USD.</p>
<p>According to IOL, Sooklal said the topic of BRICS currency is not on the summit agenda. He further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will expand on addressing the idea of deepening interaction in trading in local currencies. Countries want to have greater flexibility and to be less dependent on the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in June that he intends to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-to-push-de-dollarization-agenda-at-brics-meeting/">raise the issue of de-dollarization</a> at the summit. He has been vocal about countries ditching the U.S. dollar in global trade and using their national currencies instead. The Brazilian leader has also expressed support for the creation of a common BRICS currency.</p>

The global investment bank&#8217;s strategists anticipate &#8220;partial de-dollarization,&#8221; in which the Chinese yuan gradually assumes a more significant role in global trade.</strong></p>
<h2>JPMorgan on De-Dollarization Threat</h2>
<p>Global investment bank JPMorgan has warned that the dominance of the U.S. dollar could be at risk due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as concerns about political instability within the United States.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s strategists, led by Jan Loeys and Joyce Chang, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/jpmorgan-strategists-says-market-fails-to-reflect-threats-to-dollar-dominance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> in a report published on Tuesday that the markets are not adequately factoring in the risk of a “rapid and deep” decline in the U.S. dollar&#8217;s status as the preferred currency for global reserves and trade. They detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>If U.S.-China tensions intensify and we get more global fragmentation, it would likely lead to de-globalization in trade and finance … In finance, it could also lead to de-dollarization.</p></blockquote>
<p>The strategists pointed out that the main factor that could jeopardize the dollar&#8217;s dominance is the political dysfunction within the U.S. They cautioned that this dysfunction could hinder efforts to manage the national debt and prevent the government from stabilizing the economy during a crisis. The U.S. recently averted <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">defaulting</a> on its debt obligations at the last minute as politicians sparred over debt ceiling limits.</p>
<p>Moreover, the JPMorgan strategists emphasized the potential danger arising from an intensifying rivalry between the U.S. and China, which they described as a possible &#8220;Cold War 2.0.&#8221; They noted that China&#8217;s ambitious economic reforms, which include measures like easing capital constraints and promoting market liquidity, could erode the dollar&#8217;s dominance.</p>
<p>JPMorgan has also warned that a shift away from the U.S. dollar or destabilizing shocks to its value could have broad consequences across multiple asset classes. The bank noted that this could lead to a decrease in the dollar&#8217;s value, lower equity multiples, and higher bond yields.</p>
<p>While the USD may lose its dominance, the strategists believe that it is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-expects-dollar-dominance-to-persist-even-if-china-overtakes-us-as-worlds-largest-economy/">unlikely to be completely replaced</a> as the primary reserve currency within the next decade. Instead, they anticipate a more plausible scenario of “partial de-dollarization,” in which China gradually assumes a more significant role in place of the greenback among nations that are not aligned with the U.S.</p>
<p>Various individuals, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-predicts-end-of-us-dollar-dominance-as-more-countries-de-dollarize/">S&amp;P Global economist</a> Paul Gruenwald, have foreseen the potential decline of the dollar&#8217;s dominance. Nobel laureate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nobel-laureate-paul-krugman-says-us-dollar-dominance-wont-last-forever-but-doubts-chinese-yuan-can-replace-usd/">Paul Krugman</a> also recently said the dollar&#8217;s dominance won&#8217;t last forever but he doubts that the Chinese yuan could replace the greenback.</p>

<h2>Fednow Officially Live</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230720a.htm">announced</a> Thursday that its new system for instant payments, the Fednow Service, has launched with 35 participating banks and credit unions, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and 16 service providers. Participating financial institutions include BNY Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, Peoples Bank, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank.</p>
<p>“The Fednow Service is designed to maintain uninterrupted 24x7x365 processing with security features to support payment integrity and data security,” the Federal Reserve detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fednow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented Thursday: “The Federal Reserve built the Fednow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient.” He continued: “Over time, as more banks choose to use this new tool, the benefits to individuals and businesses will include enabling a person to immediately receive a paycheck, or a company to instantly access funds when an invoice is paid.”</p>
<p>Functioning as an interbank payment system, the Fednow Service operates alongside other well-established Federal Reserve payment services like Fedwire and FedACH. The Fed’s announcement described:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve is committed to working with the more than 9,000 banks and credit unions across the country to support the widespread availability of this service for their customers over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people took to Twitter to comment on the new Fednow Service. A number of individuals believe that its launch paves the way for a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-fednow-the-first-step-towards-a-central-bank-digital-currency-speculations-rise-ahead-of-launch/">central bank digital currency</a>. However, the Federal Reserve has insisted that the Fednow Service is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/not-related-to-a-digital-currency-us-central-bank-addresses-concerns-over-fednow-payment-network/">not related</a> to a CBDC.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the Fednow Service eliminates the need for cryptocurrencies. Omid Malekan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, <a href="https://twitter.com/malekanoms/status/1682056456529387520">explained</a>: &#8220;Arguing that Fednow eliminates the need for crypto (or even stablecoins) is like arguing in 2005 that replacing VHS rented from Blockbuster with DVDs eliminated the need for streaming. P.S. Fednow is 25 year old tech. America is just really late to the game.&#8221;</p>

The authority also emphasized the importance for businesses to inform customers about potential “risks that may arise” with dealing with crypto assets not prohibited outside of Kuwait. </strong></p>
<h2>Kuwait&#8217;s Regulator Warns Businesses of Consequences for Non-compliance Toward Crypto Ban</h2>
<p>On July 18, 2023, Kuwait&#8217;s Capital Markets Authority, the regulator for financial instruments and securities in the Gulf nation, <a href="https://www.cma.gov.kw/en/web/cma/cma-board-releases/resolutions-and-regulations/-/cmaboardreleases/detail/1384960">reiterated its ban</a> on crypto assets. The authority states the rules align with enhancing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The regulations also comply with Financial Action Task Force recommendations and standards.</p>
<p>Kuwait&#8217;s regulator underscores five critical rules which stipulate an “absolute prohibition of using virtual assets as a payment instrument/method.” Moreover, Kuwaiti businesses are forbidden from engaging with virtual assets as an investment vehicle, requiring firms in the Gulf state to avoid “offering this type of service to any customers.” Crypto asset mining and related activities are also strictly prohibited, and Kuwaiti citizens and businesses must abstain from participation.</p>
<p>Any business violating the regulator&#8217;s rules may face penalties, including the potential loss of their business license. The regulator also urges Kuwaiti businesses to educate customers about the purported risks of crypto assets. The bulletin indicates that crypto assets are utilized beyond the borders of the Gulf nation. The regulator emphasizes that these rules are articulated in Article 15 of Law No. 106 of 2013.</p>
<p>Kuwait’s Capital Markets Authority insists crypto assets “are not legal tender, are not issued or supported by any government, are not tied to any asset or issuer, and their prices are always driven by speculation that exposes them to sharp drops.”</p>

Moscow will send Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov instead, the Kremlin confirmed, emphasizing that Putin will join the event via video link. </strong></p>
<h2>Putin to Take Part in BRICS Talks on Enlargement, Currency Matters on Conference Call</h2>
<p>Russia’s head of state will not be among the leaders of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a> nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) when they meet in person next month, Russian media reported, quoting the office of the South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The statement elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>By mutual agreement, President Putin will not attend the summit. The Russian Federation will be represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.</p></blockquote>
<p>Putin’s attendance has been in question since his indictment by the International Criminal Court (ICC). In March, the Hague-based intergovernmental organization issued an arrest warrant for him and Russia’s Commissioner for Children’s Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova.</p>
<p>Both have been accused of deportation of Ukrainian children from the conflict zone, among other charges. While Russia does not recognize the authority of the ICC, the Republic of South Africa is under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The summit will be held on Aug. 22 &#8211; 24 in South Africa’s largest city, Johannesburg, and will focus on important issues such as the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-to-talk-expansion-at-august-summit-host-confirms/">bloc’s expansion</a> and the use of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">national currencies</a> of the member states in trade.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin will take part in the BRICS forum in South Africa via video link, his Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told the RIA Novosti news agency, confirming Pretoria’s announcement.</p>
<p>“President Putin has decided to participate in the BRICS summit in the format of a video conference call. This will be a full-fledged participation. Minister Lavrov will be present at the meeting itself,” the Kremlin’s spokesman explained.</p>

<p>South Africa’s commitment to the successful holding of the upcoming “historic” BRICS summit and the recognition of the country’s legal obligations under the ICC’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rome Statute</a> determined the format of Russia’s participation, according to Vincent Magwenya, spokesman for Ramaphosa’s office.</p>
<p>Quoted by Russia’s Radio Sputnik, Magwenya added that he believes that Vladimir Putin’s absence will not interfere with the planned event since the Russian Federation will be represented by Foreign Minister Lavrov.</p>

Until now, there were no confirmed applications of the technology. Techinsights found Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm chip in the Whatsminer M56S++ bitcoin mining rig from Microbt, a bitcoin mining machine that produces an estimated 230 to 254 terahash per second (TH/s).</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Report Shows Microbt Leverages Samsung&#x2019;s Advanced 3nm GAA Chip</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Microbt&#x2019;s next-generation mining rig, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">Whatsminer M56S++</a>, reportedly employs Samsung&#x2019;s latest semiconductor technology. Techinsights <a href="https://www.techinsights.com/blog/samsungs-3nm-gaa-process-whatsminer-asic-disruptive-event">discovered</a> the mining machine&#x2019;s application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was made using Samsung&#x2019;s SF3E process. The report highlights that although Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm GAA semiconductor process has been available for about a year, no chips utilizing this technology have been found in the market until now.&#13;<br />

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="Samsung's 3nm GAA Chip Discovered in Microbt&#x2019;s Next-Gen Bitcoin Mining Rig" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cheechs.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230720%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230720T135421Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=07d251f04a0c121b808fe5e46c58423c13d0bb75791543b0c99ef0539547f2bb" alt="Samsung's 3nm GAA Chip Discovered in Microbt&#x2019;s Next-Gen Bitcoin Mining Rig" width="1280" height="400">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Techinsights researchers state that the commercialization of GAA technology can aid in the production of 2nm chips and more. &#x201C;This development is crucial because it has the potential to enhance performance, improve energy efficiency, keep up with Moore&#x2019;s Law, and enable advanced applications,&#x201D; Techinsights <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/techinsights-samsungs-3nm-gaa-process-identified-in-a-crypto-mining-asic-designed-by-china-startup-microbt-301880726.html">detailed</a>. The report elucidates further, confirming suspicions that Microbt&#x2019;s semiconductor supplier is indeed Samsung &#x2014; a fact that has long been a subject of speculation.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On the other hand, it is assumed that Bitmain, Microbt&#x2019;s rival, utilizes chips supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). This isn&#x2019;t the first time cutting-edge chip technology has been discovered in bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) mining machines. Techinsights found the SMIC 7nm process in a Minerva bitcoin mining chip. Eric Chen, a semiconductor research analyst with Digitimes Asia, noted that while this discovery could be classified as commercialization, its scale may be small.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Getting revenues from shipment can be defined as &#x2018;commercialization&#x2019;, but ASIC is a relatively simple kind of chip to produce, in terms of architecture,&#x201D; Chen remarked. Analyst John Wang from Digitimes emphasized that the yield from Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm GAA process remains low. Consequently, Wang believes the tech giant aims to attract a broad customer base to refine its procedures and enhance yield. The report from Techinsights concludes by noting the uncertainty surrounding the use of Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm chips in any additional hardware devices in the market today.&#13;<br />
