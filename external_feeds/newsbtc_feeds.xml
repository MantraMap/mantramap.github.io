					<description><![CDATA[PEPE surged remarkably in the past week posting gains of approximately 20%. The $0.0000011079 support level on the daily chart acted as a price pivot for the gains in the last few days, indicating an attempt to enter the buy zone.  PEPE&#8217;s previous attempts to break above the $0.0000015440 resistance zone between July 19-24 were unsuccessful. However, the bulls are in control, driving PEPE to attempt another break above the $0.0000015440 resistance.  Related Reading: US Prosecutors Accuse FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Of Using $100M To Curry Political Favors The rally in the past 7-days indicates a momentum shift for PEPE to a more positive outlook as the bulls attempt to seize control again.  PEPE Bulls Forcing Another Rally, But Bears Still Active Price volatility is evident when comparing price data for PEPE on the daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes. It trades at $0.000001348 on August 15 with a 6.03% price drop in 24 hours, while it has dropped 17% on the monthly time frame.   However, PEPE shows a more positive outlook on the weekly timeframe, although traders must tread cautiously as a price drop remains a possibility due to volatility.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is 55.71 in the neutral zone reflecting traders&#8217; indecision in the market. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the signal line, confirming the return of the bulls.  However, the size of the candles indicates low trading activity despite the gains making the price action moving forward quite tricky. The close of the August 15 candle will bring confirmation of the next price direction.  PEPE Shows Resilient Above $0.00000120 As Whale Comes Onboard In recent days, there has been a resurgence in PEPE&#8217;s performance. This trend is attributable to substantial investments from prominent investors and a rise in social engagement. According to Lookonchain data, there is a significant surge in whale attention to the PEPE token. The data shows a whale spent $ 1 million to acquire 807 billion PEPE tokens at $0.000001239. This whale involvement will likely have positive impacts on the price of PEPE. Another instance of this type of Whale involvement occurred on August 7. A holder of PEPE tokens sold a substantial amount of 2.26 trillion tokens at the price of $0.000001121 per token. Unfortunately, this action resulted in a significant decrease of $707,000 in the token&#8217;s overall market capitalization. Such contrasting maneuvers taking place in a short period might carry potential consequences for individual investors over an extended duration.

					<description><![CDATA[Hedera (HBAR) has stolen the limelight by becoming the highest-gaining cryptocurrency in the past 24 hours. As investors eagerly accumulate, the token&#8217;s price exhibits a roller-coaster ride of volatility. While optimism fuels the anticipation of a price rally, caution is advised as HBAR&#8217;s Bollinger Bands cast a shadow of uncertainty over its immediate future. At the time of writing, HBAR&#8217;s price is recorded at $0.071 according to CoinGecko, reflecting an 8.1% rally over the past 24 hours. Impressively, the token has experienced a seven-day surge of 21.3%, underlining its significance in the market&#8217;s recent performance. Hedera price action today.

Bollinger Bands, a widely-used technical analysis tool, serve as a flashing signal of HBAR&#8217;s ongoing turbulence.  A price analysis notes that token is currently trading above the upper band of the indicator, implying a potential overbought situation.

					<description><![CDATA[The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has unveiled the features of a new regulatory framework aimed at ensuring a high degree of stability for stablecoins in the country. This is the outcome of the central bank’s public consultation, which commenced in October 2022. Feedback from this public consultation was considered during the design of this new set of stablecoin rules in Singapore. According to MAS, these rules will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore dollar or any G10 currency &#8211; including the US dollar. MAS Releases “Key Requirements” For Stablecoin Issuers In Singapore In a media release published on Tuesday, August 15, the Monetary Authority of Singapore outlined key requirements for issuers of single-currency stablecoins in the country. The new regulatory framework for stablecoins consists of various provisions relating to value stability, base capital, redemption timeframes, and disclosure. Related Reading: US Congresswoman Raises Concerns About Paypal Stablecoin In The Absence Of Regulation The central bank stated that reserve assets &#8211; of a stablecoin &#8211; will be subject to requirements relating to their composition, valuation, custody, and audit, to give a high level of assurance on value stability.  Meanwhile, issuers are required to maintain minimum base capital and liquid assets to lower the risk of bankruptcy. This is to also facilitate an “orderly wind-down” of business &#8211; if the need arises. Additionally, SCS issuers in Singapore must refund the equivalent value of the stablecoins to holders within five business days after a redemption request is submitted.  Finally, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has mandated all stablecoin companies to provide appropriate disclosures to their users. Some of the information they are expected to disclose to their customers include SCS’ value stabilizing mechanism, the rights of SCS holders, and the audit results of reserve assets. The MAS noted that only issuers that fulfill all requirements under this new regulatory framework can apply for their stablecoins to be recognized as “MAS-regulated stablecoins.”  However, the financial regulator also warned issuers against misrepresenting their tokens as MAS-regulated stablecoins, as it may result in penalties under the revised stablecoin regulatory framework. MAS&#8217; Stablecoin Regulatory Framework &#8211; A Positive Sign For Global Adoption? In the press release, the MAS defined stablecoins as digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one of more specified fiat currencies. “When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the “on-chain” purchase and sale of digital assets,” it added. Meanwhile, Ms. Ho Hern Shin, MAS’ deputy managing director, reacted to this development in a statement:  MAS’ stablecoin regulatory framework aims to facilitate the use of stablecoins as a credible digital medium of exchange and as a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems. We encourage SCS issuers who would like their stablecoins recognized as “MAS-regulated stablecoins” to make early preparations for compliance. Taking these statements into account, this new regulatory framework represents a positive attitude by the Singaporean authorities towards the use of stablecoin as a trusted means of payment. Moreover, it is expected to provide the needed clarity for stablecoin companies to operate in the country. It is worth mentioning that Singapore is not the only country making positive strides in terms of stablecoin regulation. There have also been discussions on regulating these digital payment tokens in the United States. Related Reading: Can PayPal’s PYUSD Be Frozen In Your Wallet Like Tether’s USDT?

<h2>MAS&#8217; Stablecoin Regulatory Framework &#8211; A Positive Sign For Global Adoption?</h2>
<p>In the press release, the MAS defined stablecoins as digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one of more specified fiat currencies. “When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the “on-chain” purchase and sale of digital assets,” it added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ms. Ho Hern Shin, MAS’ deputy managing director, reacted to this development in a statement: </p>
<blockquote><p>MAS’ stablecoin regulatory framework aims to facilitate the use of stablecoins as a credible digital medium of exchange and as a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems. We encourage SCS issuers who would like their stablecoins recognized as “MAS-regulated stablecoins” to make early preparations for compliance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taking these statements into account, this new regulatory framework represents a positive attitude by the Singaporean authorities towards the use of stablecoin as a trusted means of payment. Moreover, it is expected to provide the needed clarity for stablecoin companies to operate in the country.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Singapore is not the only country making positive strides in terms of stablecoin regulation. There have also been discussions on regulating these digital payment tokens in the United States.</p>

<p>In what was dubbed a &#8220;momentous move&#8221;, the US House Financial Services Committee<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/stablecoin/paypal-pyusd-launch-triggers-calls-for-stablecoin-bill/amp/"> recently advanced a bill titled “Clarity for Payments Stablecoin.”</a> This proposed bill, if passed, will regulate the issuance and use of payment stablecoins in the United States.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In today’s micro update from Capriole, founder Charles Edwards presented a compelling analysis that draws parallels between the current low volatility of Bitcoin and its historical behavior in 2016. With Bitcoin&#8217;s price stagnating around the $29,000 mark, experts are closely watching for signs of a potential bullish breakout. &#8220;Bitcoin’s price remains at $29K, in a sideways consolidation that has created one of the absolute lowest volatility periods in Bitcoin’s 14 year history,&#8221; Edwards states. This prolonged period of low volatility is reminiscent of 2016, suggesting that a significant price movement could be imminent. Bitcoin Breakout Imminent? While the technicals indicate a bearish breakdown from the $30,000 mark, the absence of a downward momentum offers a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. &#8220;If price was going to collapse, we would usually have seen that follow through by now,&#8221; the report notes. However, for a more concrete bullish sentiment, &#8220;a close back above $30K on the daily timeframe is required at the minimum as a technical confirmation of a failed breakdown.&#8221; Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit On the fundamental front, Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain data continues to contract, albeit at a decelerating rate. The imminent decisions on several Bitcoin ETF approvals could potentially disrupt the current low volatility phase. &#8220;An approval could cause a break from the current low volatility range. Best not to pre-empt this though, as these decisions often get pushed. Confirmations are key to mitigate risk,&#8221; Edwards cautions. Diving deeper into the technicals, the report highlighted two key observations: Since 2010, Bitcoin’s historic volatility has only been lower than today in 2016. Suggesting a big price move is on the horizon when volatility expansion (reversion to the mean) occurs. Bitcoin’s $30K breakdown has (so far) failed to follow through&#8230; A close back into the Wyckoff structure at $30K would signify a failed breakdown and therefore be a very positive technical signal. BTC On-Chain Indicators Are Neutral Capriole&#8217;s Bitcoin Macro Index, a comprehensive tool that amalgamates over 40 Bitcoin on-chain, macro market, and equities metrics into a machine learning model, currently scores at -0.36, indicating &#8220;Contraction&#8221;. This suggests that while the short-term outlook remains neutral, the long-term perspective appears bullish. Remarkably, this strategy takes long-only positions in Bitcoin. In slowdowns and contractions, cash is held. &#8220;The Macro Index today remains in a period of relative value (below zero), suggesting decent long-term value for multi-year horizon investors,&#8221; the report elucidated.

Currently, this model indicates that Bitcoin is trading within a long-term value region, with the report speculating, &#8220;I would be surprised if this holds into 2024.&#8221; In conclusion, the analysis from Capriole paints a picture of potential long-term value amidst the current bearish technicals. Drawing parallels with 2016, the report suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s current low volatility phase could be a precursor to a bullish breakout. &#8220;All else equal, Bitcoin is like a beach ball submerged underwater. Nonetheless, we remain in a technical breakdown. We don’t know how long that hand will hold the ball underwater for.

					<description><![CDATA[The drama surrounding FTX and founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) continues to unfold almost a year after the crypto exchange collapsed. This time around, prosecutors are coming after the former CEO for allegedly using customer funds to buy the favor of politicians. SBF Used Customer Funds For Campaign Contributions The latest indictment filed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) details how Bankman-Fried embezzled customer deposits and used these stolen funds towards various ventures, including funding the political campaigns of several politicians in the Democratic and Republican parties.  Related Reading: BALD Deployer Moves Proceeds Of The Rug From Base To Ethereum According to the filing, SBF did this to lobby for crypto regulations that could favor him and his company. His plan was to get Congress and regulators to make laws and regulations that make it easier for FTX to accept customers’ deposits, consequently allowing his embezzlement to continue without getting noticed.  SBF also apparently broke several campaign finance rules to maximize his influence on politicians by using straw donors as some of these political contributions were allegedly made in the names of FTX executives. The founder also made to conceal the fact that the source of these donations was customer funds, as he directed that the customer deposits be paid into the executives’ bank accounts, who then made the donations in their names.  SBF had been publicly known to make contributions to the Democratic party while secretly funneling funds to the GOP. He previously admitted that he made “significant” donations to both parties before the midterm elections last year.  At the time, the funds he reportedly donated totaled over $40 million, making him the seventh-highest political donor between 2021 and 2022. However, the latest indictment filing reveals that he could have well been the second-highest political donor with over $100 million in political contributions.  While SBF made these donations and portrayed himself as the “savior of the cryptocurrency industry” (in reference to SBF bailing out crypto firms that were struggling financially), there were gaps in FTX’s finances resulting from his alleged misappropriation.  FTT Token struggles as SBF case intensifies &#124; Source: FTTBUSD on Tradingview.com Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Seven Counts Of Fraud Despite this latest revelation, prosecutors will no longer be charging SBF with violation of campaign finance rules.

					<description><![CDATA[On August 14, Kevin Kelly, Co-founder of prominent crypto research firm Delphi Digital provided some interesting insights on Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. According to Kelly, the crypto market moves in consistent cycles, and we are currently in the initial stages of a new cycle based on market evidence. Using the premier cryptocurrency as a benchmark, Kelly states a crypto cycle usually begins with Bitcoin attaining a new all-time high (ATH) value, followed by an 80% loss in the next year. Thereafter, BTC would experience a market recovery over two years before embarking on a bullish run to attain a new ATH.  The Interplay Between The Crypto Cycle And Macroeconomic Signals Based on Kelly’s analysis, a typical crypto cycle occurs within four years, and its events are triggered by some factors in the bigger macro business cycle.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Relatively Muted – What Could Trigger A Sharp Decline? The analyst noted that, for example, Bitcoin usually attains new price peaks at the same period as the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Index &#8211;  an economic indicator that tracks the manufacturing sector’s health in the United States. He said: BTC price peaks occur around the same time the ISM shows signs of topping out. Active addresses, total transaction volumes, total fees – they all peaked alongside tops in the ISM too. As the business cycle shows signs of recovery, so too does network activity levels… Due to this similarity in market movement, Kevin notes that turning moments in a typical business cycle have proven to be a favorable period to increase one’s exposure to risk assets such as Bitcoin.  Source: Delphi Digital Bitcoin Poised To Attain New ATH By Q4 2024, Kelly Says Interestingly, Kevin Kelly stated in his analysis that the ISM is currently heading toward the end of a two-year downtrend, indicating that BTC’s prices may soon start surging in the coming months. To back his long-term bullish price prediction, Kelly highlights several other factors, including the Bitcoin Halving event coming up in April 2024.  The Delphi Digital Co-founder stated that the last two Bitcoin halvings had occurred 18 months after BTC’s price tanked and 7 months before rallying to a new ATH. Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit Based on this historical data, BTC could well attain a new ATH by Q4 2024. However, as with all predictions, Kelly stated that are certain risk factors involved.  Firstly, he predicted that the BTC market is likely to soon witness a modest selling pressure or price consolidation, especially following the market&#8217;s strong recovery in the last 9 months. In addition, he also highlighted the possibility of the business cycle presenting a false bearish end &#8211; as seen in March 2020 &#8211;  or not reaching its bearish end as soon as predicted.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading around $29,333.89, with a 0.12% decline on the last day. However, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 26.38% and is valued at $12.2 billion BTC trading at $29,322 on the daily chart &#124; Source: BTCUSD chart on Tradingview.com Featured image from LinkedIn, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

<p>Firstly, he predicted that the BTC market is likely to soon witness a modest selling pressure or price consolidation, especially following the market&#8217;s strong recovery in the last 9 months.</p>
<p>In addition, he also highlighted the possibility of the business cycle presenting a false bearish end &#8211; as seen in March 2020 &#8211;  or not reaching its bearish end as soon as predicted. </p>
<p>According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading around $29,333.89, with a 0.12% decline on the last day. However, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 26.38% and is valued at $12.2 billion

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent revelation, Lookonchain, the on-chain analysis service, reported that Voyager Digital, the now-bankrupt crypto lending platform, has been offloading its crypto assets on Coinbase in recent days. Over the past four days, the defunct lender has sold 49 different crypto assets, netting approximately $63 million. For the SHIB army the most notable sale was the 1.4 trillion Shiba Inu tokens, which amounted to nearly $14.4 million. Beyond SHIB, Voyager&#8217;s sales included significant amounts of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Polygon (MATIC), and Decentraland (MANA). &#8220;Voyager has been selling assets on #Coinbase for the past 4 days and has sold 49 tokens for ~$63M. Including: 781 BTC ($23M); 9,570 ETH ($17.6M); 1.4T SHIB ($14.4M); 234,660 LINK ($1.74M); 1.87M MATIC ($1.27M); 3M MANA ($1.1M);&#8221;, Lookonchain tweeted. The sales have significantly reduced Voyager&#8217;s crypto holdings. However, they haven&#8217;t entirely emptied their coffers. The on-chain analysis service further detailed Voyager&#8217;s remaining assets: &#8220;Voyager currently holds $11.3M worth of assets, including: 52.4M VGX ($8.27M); 55 BTC ($1.62M); 537K KNC ($371K); 1.18 FTM ($286K); 20.7M STMX ($140K); 4.85M GALA ($111K).&#8221; Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Golden Cross – How Will Prices React? While the sales have drawn attention, there&#8217;s a silver lining for the SHIB community. According to Lookonchain&#8217;s data, Voyager&#8217;s SHIB holdings have been completely liquidated. Thus, Voyager&#8217;s SHIB holding have gone to zero, suggesting a potential reduction in sell pressure on the Shiba Inu token in the future. Shiba Inu Price Shows Resilience Despite the massive sell-off by Voyager, SHIB&#8217;s price remained resilient. The token has seen a surge of over 14.2% in the past week. This bullish momentum is largely attributed to the forthcoming Shibarium mainnet launch at the Blockchain Future Conference, starting today. Investors seem optimistic about SHIB&#8217;s potential, believing that if the layer-2 scaling solution delivers on its promises, the SHIB token could witness even more substantial gains. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges At press time, the Shiba Inu price stood at $0.00001019 after finding support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.00001007). The key resistance on a daily basis is currently the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.00001121. Should a breakout occur, SHIB could rise 21% from its current price to follow through to the 61.8% Fibonacci level. Major resistance is expected at this price level ($0.00001235). The RSI on a daily basis has been in an ascending trend since the annual low on June 10 and was at 65 at press time. This leaves the SHIB bulls with further room to run. For an explosive double-digit move, the RSI should enter deep overbought territory. For investors, today&#8217;s or tomorrow&#8217;s Shibarium launch should be taken with a grain of salt. As usual for the crypto market, it could be a &#8220;buy the rumor, sell the news&#8221; event, as the impact of the launch might only be seen in the long term over the coming months. In this case, the 200-day EMA at $0.00000938 will be a key support to defend for the bulls. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

The coin, which had been confined within a price range of $1.31 to $1.49, broke free from this range-bound pattern, but not without facing its share of challenges.

<p>A successful break above the $0.6650 resistance level might send the price toward the $0.70 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $0.720 resistance.</p>
<h2>More Losses in XRP?</h2>
<p>If ripple fails to clear the $0.650 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.620 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5926 swing low to the $0.6654 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is near $0.60. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.60 level, XRP’s price could extend losses. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.585 support zone.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $0.62, $0.60, and $0.585.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $0.628, $0.650, and $0.665.</p>
