					<description><![CDATA[Even if the cryptocurrency industry crashed in 2022, Bitcoin&#8217;s status as the &#8220;alpha coin&#8221; has remained remarkably stable. With a market capitalization of over $398 billion and a trading volume of $24,180,295, Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the last 24 hours has increased by 43%. According to market watchers, the BTC bull market officially began in 2023 and is expected to increase in value. In addition, the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) was issued earlier this week, showing that the U.S. dollar&#8217;s value is decreasing relative to other currencies. On the other hand, the CPI data gave the market the confidence it needed to follow inflation&#8217;s downward trend.

This upswing encouraged traders and investors worldwide to re-enter the Bitcoin market and make some quick bucks.

On Friday evening, the price of BTC surged beyond $18,000, then $19,000, and finally pumped to $20,000. The next hours saw a rise initiated by the bulls, which ultimately pushed BTC up to near $21,000 on Sunday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze: $93 Million Shorts Liquidated In One Hour At this price, bitcoin has made up all of its ground since the FTX-Alameda Research meltdown more than two months ago. Even if it has dropped from its local peak, the price is still well above $20,000. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s market valuation is close to $400 billion, with many investors hoping for a new bull run to begin any day. Fundstrat&#8217;s head of digital asset strategy Sean Farrell stated to Bloomberg: Cryptoassets performed well following the soft CPI print, suggesting that crypto’s correlation to macro is not going away anytime soon As Bitcoin Surges, Altcoins Retreat On yesterday&#8217;s daily charts, most altcoins showed gains, but those figures are now negative. After increasing by more than 35% in a day and nearly 70% in a week, it has turned bullish and is now moving in that direction. However, it is currently sitting below that level due to the daily decline of 4.5%. The top 10 daily cryptocurrencies that lost value are Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). The value of alternative cryptocurrencies like ADA and DOGE have dropped, by 0.34% and 0.08%, respectively, from their respective 24-hour highs. The value of ADA and BNB has decreased marginally over the previous day. Both coins, however, have seen substantial gains during the past week, rising by more than 21% and 11%, respectively.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market has started the year 2023 with a remarkable, bullish run. Over the last few days, several assets have recorded significant profits and are starting to pull through the crypto winter. Most notably, Bitcoin, the market leader and the world’s biggest digital asset, has been one of the top-performing coins this year. In the last seven days, BTC gained by more than 17%, allowing the coin to surpass the $20,000 price mark for the first time since the start of the FTX crisis. Bitcoin’s impressive price rally has generated much excitement among the crypto community, along with a significant rise in the positive sentiment around the entire crypto market. However, it appears there might be a need for alertness among investors in the coming days.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Touches $20,000 For First Time Post-FTX Collapse Bitcoin Records Highest Funding Rates In Over A Year  According to a post by Maartun, a top analyst on the crypto analytics platform Crypto Quant, Bitcoin funding rates have attained their highest values in 14 months. The Crypto Quant contributor further stated that the occurrence of high funding rates such as these usually resulted in Bitcoin experiencing a price pullback.  Funding rates are recurring payments made to either traders in a long or short position, depending on the difference between perpetual contract markets and spot prices. In essence, these payments serve as a method of maintaining the price of perpetual contracts close to the spot price of an asset &#8211; in this case, Bitcoin. That said, when there are highly positive funding rates on crypto exchanges, it indicates that traders are betting on the BTC/USD market to attain higher prices and are paying to go really long on BTC.  Trading positions such as these can be quite risky, as any slight price drop might lead to high levels of liquidation or force these traders to close their positions.  Therefore, these funding rates are definitely something that all BTC investors should keep their eyes on in the coming days. For now, Bitcoin is holding its ground, having gained by 1.83% in the last 24 hours, according to data by CoinMarketCap. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency is trading at $20,722.66, with a market cap value of $399.23 billion.  BTC Trading at $20,716 &#124; Source: BTCUSD Chart on Tradingview.com.  Related Reading: Whale Moves Huge Amount Of Shiba Inu Tokens As SHIB Unveils To Metaverse What To Expect From Bitcoin In 2023? According to the popular price prediction site, BitNation, Bitcoin could attain a peak price of $37,307.77 before the years run out. Their price forecast also states that BTC investors should expect an average price of $31,084.84.  However, the team at Tradingbeasts are predicting a rather bearish Bitcoin market for 2023. According to their price projections, BTC is expected to record slight losses all through the year, closing its annual market with a maximum price of $18,339 and an average price of $14,671. So far, Bitcoin has shown a strong performance in 2023, gaining by over 25% since the beginning of the year. No doubt, the premier cryptocurrency is one asset to look out for in 2023.  Featured Image: Forbes, Chart from Tradingview.com &#160;]]></description>

Their<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-price-prediction/#:~:text=Bitcoin%20(BTC)%20Price%20Predictions&amp;text=According%20to%20our%20Bitcoin%20price,%2420%2C121.56%20by%20January%2022%2C%202023." target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> price forecast</a> also states that BTC investors should expect an average price of $31,084.84. </p>
<p>However, the team at Tradingbeasts are predicting a rather bearish Bitcoin market for 2023. According to their <a href="https://tradingbeasts.com/price-prediction/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price projections,</a> BTC is expected to record slight losses all through the year, closing its annual market with a maximum price of $18,339 and an average price of $14,671.</p>
<p>So far, Bitcoin has shown a strong performance in 2023, gaining by over 25% since the beginning of the year. No doubt, the premier cryptocurrency is one asset to look out for in 2023. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Out of 8 billion people living on the planet, only 43 million people own Bitcoin &#8212; which amounts to less than 1% of the population. Despite the success of the cryptocurrency, a minuscule number of the world’s current inhabitants holds ownership of Bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap. Are there specific reasons why this is happening? Or is there something going on in the world of cryptocurrency that contributes to this current trend? Confusion Over &#8216;Ownership&#8217; And &#8216;Creation&#8217; Before anyone can have access to any form of cryptocurrency online, a user must create their own online wallet for the specific cryptocurrency they want to invest with. It is the same case with Bitcoin, as specific blockchain wallets are created for BTC.

This is where possible confusion might occur to those who are not familiar with the difference between creating a cryptocurrency wallet versus uniquely owning certain amounts of cryptocurrency. The unique ownership of the cryptocurrency itself (meaning that they have at least 1 or more BTC in their wallet) is only 43 million worldwide, despite that 46 million Americans have a share when it comes to BTC investment, according to ExplodingTopics.com. Current data on Bitcoin (BTC) ownership, source: CoinMarketCap Lack Of Confidence In The Current Crypto Market Although a growing number of people worldwide (especially in prominent countries such as the United States) are getting more interested in the potential of the power of cryptocurrency and its market, the lack of confidence hinders its potential growth. Due to the recent crypto market crash of 2022, many potential investors became paranoid about losing their money in an uncertain market at the moment.

					<description><![CDATA[Following the heavy market crash late last year, the crypto landscape has been on a steady path to recovery, with the altcoins leading the way. Solana(SOL) is one of these many altcoins, and it has kicked off the weekend with an explosive start.  According to data by CoinGecko, SOL has gained 40% in the last 24 hours, sparking excitement across the entire Solana ecosystem. Although it remains unknown how long the altcoin can sustain such momentum, these significant price gains indicate an increasing positive sentiment from investors. Interestingly, as a result of its price rally, Solana (SOL) even surpassed Polygon (MATIC) in market cap, becoming the 10th biggest cryptocurrency. However, this was only for a short time, as the Ethereum-based token has since reclaimed its position. At the time of writing, SOL trades at a price of $23.75 with a 24-hour trading volume of $2,499,092,493 based on data from CoinGecko. That said, the token’s market cap is set at $8,820,357,518, with a circulating supply of 370,622,211.  SOL trading at $22.42 &#124; Source: SOLUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: This Crypto Influencer Predicts Bitcoin Price At $25,000-$30,000 Soon Solana Has Been In The News Lately  Prior to today&#8217;s development, Solana has been one of the altcoins in the headlines mainly due to its impressive price action. On Dec. 30, 2022, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted a statement expressing support for Solana after the token’s value plummeted as much as 20% at the end of last year due to the FTX crisis. In the next 24 hours following Buterin’s tweet, SOL’s price surged by 12% from around $8.19 to $9.50. At the start of the second week of 2023, SOL was trading at a value of $17.1, representing a price increase of about 80.63% in just over a week. Since then, SOL has been moving sideways till its price surge today.  Asides from the tweet from Buterin, another propelling force behind Solana&#8217;s price actions were the massive price movements of the Solana-based meme coin BONK. Early this year, BONK, a new meme coin launched on December 25, gained over 2000% in the first week of the year, becoming the biggest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem.  Although BONK soon crashed 50% following its tremendous bullish run, there is still much optimism surrounding the meme coin as many investors expect it could return to the previous high price levels in the coming weeks.  Related Reading: Polkadot Shows No Sign Of Slowing, As DOT Gains 33% In Last 7 Days Price Prediction For Solana In 2023 According to top price prediction site, Wallet Investor, the price of SOL could fall as low as $5.875 in 2024, indicating a plausible 73.836% decrease from the current market price. However, Coincodex is predicting an overall bull market for Solana this year. The team expects SOL to trade at a value of $67.64 by 2024 if the altcoin follows the growth trajectory of the internet over the next 12 months.  Regardless of the price predictions, Solana has started the year strong and appears to be one of the most promising projects for 2023. That said, investors are reminded not to rely on price predictions when making investment decisions; rather, they should do their due diligence while consulting market financial experts.  Featured Image: Solana.com, Chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

<p>In the next 24 hours following Buterin’s tweet, SOL’s price surged by 12% from around $8.19 to $9.50. At the start of the second week of 2023, SOL was trading at a value of $17.1, representing a price increase of about 80.63% in just over a week. Since then, SOL has been moving sideways till its price surge today. </p>
<p>Asides from the tweet from Buterin, another propelling force behind Solana&#8217;s price actions were the massive price movements of the Solana-based meme coin BONK.</p>
<p>Early this year, BONK, a new meme coin launched on December 25, <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/amp/article/cryptocurrency/bonk-has-returned-2220-percent-to-traders-in-the-last-week/82365/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gained over 2000%</a> in the first week of the year, becoming the biggest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem. </p>
<p>Although BONK soon <a href="https://newsbtc.com/altcoin/bonk-crashes-50-in-24-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crashed</a> 50% following its tremendous bullish run, there is still much optimism surrounding the meme coin as many investors expect it could return to the previous high price levels in the coming weeks. </p>

<h2><strong>Price Prediction For Solana In 2023</strong></h2>
<p>According to top price prediction site, <a href="https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/solana-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wallet Investor,</a> the price of SOL could fall as low as $5.875 in 2024, indicating a plausible 73.836% decrease from the current market price.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://coincodex.com/crypto/solana/price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Coincodex</a> is predicting an overall bull market for Solana this year. The team expects SOL to trade at a value of $67.64 by 2024 if the altcoin follows the growth trajectory of the internet over the next 12 months. </p>
<p>Regardless of the price predictions, Solana has started the year strong and appears to be one of the most promising projects for 2023. That said, investors are reminded not to rely on price predictions when making investment decisions; rather, they should do their due diligence while consulting market financial experts. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The start of 2023 is bringing a different phase in the crypto market. Over the past few days, most crypto assets have regained value. The bullish trend has spiked a new sentiment in the market as several positive predictions have emerged. Ben Armstrong, a popular YouTuber known as BitBoy, predicted a bullish trend for Bitcoin in a few weeks. Armstrong, the author of a new book &#8220;Catching Up To Crypto&#8221; took to Twitter to express his views on BTC’s future price surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze: $93 Million Shorts Liquidated In One Hour Bitcoin Price Rally Triggers Bullish Sentiment According to Armstrong, the primary crypto asset has triggered a bullish sentiment in the crypto community with its recent uptrend. Finally, BTC broke the barrier and climbed to the $18,000 level. As of January 12, the leading token reached $19K during trading hours. A review of the price history indicated that BTC reached the $15K region in November 2022. Notably, Bitcoin started alternating between $16,000 and $17,000 in December 2022. But this 2023, the primary crypto asset is showing impressive price movement. According to BitBoy’s post on Twitter, Bitcoin will gradually reach $25,000 or $30,000 this year. He forecasted that BTC would attain this new price rally within the next 10 to 15 weeks. Also, several people are becoming bullish in their trades with Bitcoin. On January 11, Armstrong posted about his belief in Bitcoin’s price explosion in 2023. However, the controversial YouTuber noted that the primary cryptocurrency might not hit a new all-time high (ATH) this year. On January 12, Bitcoin slightly hit the $19,000 level before retracting to the $18K level. BTC&#8217;s new price rally is likely due to the risk-on sentiments associated with other markets. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is hovering around $20,627. This shows that the token increased by 3.50% within 24 hours. Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap is about $366.43 billion having a surge of 4.62% in the past day. Also, its dominance over altcoins is 40.26%. Recall that in December 2022, Armstrong gave a forecast for Bitcoin. According to BitBoy’s tweet, the end of 2023 will see BTC reaching the $30,000 level. Also, he predicted the token would finally hit a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of 2024, while a new cycle of bearish trend would break out in 2025. But now, analysts believe BTC will reach the price mark in a few weeks. Crypto Whales Resume Transactions In Bitcoin With the recent BTC price rally, some crypto whales have resumed massive transactions in BTC. Some of the on-chain data providers have recorded huge BTC transactions recently. According to WhaleAlert, an unknown whale moved 5,545 BTC tokens to another anonymous wallet. The value of coins is worth over $104.3 million in the current market prices. On January 12, 4.000 BTC tokens worth $72.51 million were moved from an unknown wallet to the Huobi crypto exchange.

Whales are beginning to take interest and are likely perpetuating this climb, with $1M+ $BTC transactions rebounding to November, 2022 levels. https://t.co/UuH8aFUmh3 pic.twitter.com/2oeIyi3xSV &#8212; Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 12, 2023 The data provider reported that the BTC whale transactions average had exceeded 1,700 daily.

					<description><![CDATA[With Bitcoin surging past $20,000, altcoins like DOT (Polkadot) have been riding the broader crypto rally which started since the beginning of 2023. According to CoinGecko, the token is trading at $5.94, and has risen by more than 12% in the past 24 hours and 33% in the weekly.  This was caused by market optimism caused by positive Consumer Price Index (CPI) data that was released Thursday.

					<description><![CDATA[Due to the Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto market uncertainty, predicting the following trend pattern for crypto assets is usually difficult. However, analysts have always released predictions for most crypto assets. While some projections turned out to be accurate, some still failed to happen as predicted. One analyst became popular for releasing an accurate prediction for Bitcoin&#8217;s 2018 bottom six months before the period. However, the pseudonymous analyst and trader, Smart Contracter, is suddenly bullish in his recent predictions. Analyst Scraps Bearish Stance On Bitcoin (BTC) Smart Contracter took to Twitter to inform his followers about his plan to scrap his bearish bias on the BTC/USD trading pair. His new decision was based on the recent Bitcoin price breaking out to a higher range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze: $93 Million Shorts Liquidated In One Hour Smart Contracter noted that Bitcoin could perform better than other cryptocurrencies in the future. He explained that the BTC&#8217;s price action is currently more impressive due to the impulsive disposition. The analyst disclosed that he desired to shift to long positions in his trades once the opportunity came through a breakdown. Further, Smart Contracter projected charts to explain the possible price trend for the leading crypto asset. For example, he predicted that Bitcoin would surge by more than $18,800. Also, he used Elliot Wave Theory to support his technical analysis for BTC. Smart Contracter reported that BTC would display a 5-wave pattern for its primary trend, but its corrective movement will follow a 3-wave way. Also, he predicted that Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance over the altcoins would hit 43%. now that #btc broke out of this slow choppy grind up, im scrapping bearish bias and looking to long pullbacks. Price action looks impulsive to me now and i also believe with btc on the cusp of taking out the december high btc dominance will rise and btc outperform alts. pic.twitter.com/3oOYmky5Pb &#8212; Bluntz (@SmartContracter) January 12, 2023 Following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the growing intensity of the crypto winter, crypto prices dropped drastically. BTC lost its value as the pressure in the entire market kept increasing. With growing fear and uncertainty, the price of Bitcoin dropped to the $15K region in November 2022. But the trend is getting bullish as volatility is now on the increase. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $19,275, indicating an increase over the past 24 hours. Its market cap sits at $366.43 billion, signifying a growth of 4.62% in the past day. Also, BTC’s dominance over altcoins is 40.26%. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal: LINK Address Activity Returns To 2021 Levels Analyst Seeks Opportunity To Buy Avalanche (AVAX) Smart Contracter gave some striking points concerning Avalanche (AVAX), the smart contract blockchain. The analyst mentioned that AVAX seems to have hit bottom following its 90% correction from its all-time high (ATH). For him, a future downward correction from Avalanche will be a buying opportunity.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to the Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto market uncertainty, predicting the following trend pattern for crypto assets is usually difficult. However, analysts have always released predictions for most crypto assets. While some projections turned out to be accurate, some still failed to happen as predicted.</p>
<p>One analyst became popular for releasing an accurate prediction for Bitcoin&#8217;s 2018 bottom six months before the period. However, the pseudonymous analyst and trader, Smart Contracter, is suddenly bullish in his recent predictions.</p>
<h2>Analyst Scraps Bearish Stance On Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>
<p>Smart Contracter <a href="https://twitter.com/SmartContracter/status/1613378927116029958" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">took</a> to Twitter to inform his followers about his plan to scrap his bearish bias on the BTC/USD trading pair. His new decision was based on the recent Bitcoin price breaking out to a higher range.</p>

<p>Smart Contracter <a href="https://twitter.com/SmartContracter/status/1613378927116029958" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">noted</a> that Bitcoin could perform better than other cryptocurrencies in the future. He explained that the BTC&#8217;s price action is currently more impressive due to the impulsive disposition. The analyst disclosed that he desired to shift to long positions in his trades once the opportunity came through a breakdown.</p>
<p>Further, Smart Contracter projected charts to explain the possible price trend for the leading crypto asset. For example, he predicted that Bitcoin would surge by more than $18,800. Also, he used Elliot Wave Theory to support his technical analysis for BTC.</p>
<p>Smart Contracter reported that BTC would display a 5-wave pattern for its primary trend, but its corrective movement will follow a 3-wave way. Also, he predicted that Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance over the altcoins would hit 43%.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">now that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/btc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#btc</a> broke out of this slow choppy grind up, im scrapping bearish bias and looking to long pullbacks.</p>
<p>Price action looks impulsive to me now and i also believe with btc on the cusp of taking out the december high btc dominance will rise and btc outperform alts. <a href="https://t.co/3oOYmky5Pb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3oOYmky5Pb</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the growing intensity of the crypto winter, crypto prices dropped drastically. BTC lost its value as the pressure in the entire market kept increasing. With growing fear and uncertainty, the price of Bitcoin dropped to the $15K region in November 2022. But the trend is getting bullish as volatility is now on the increase.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $19,275, indicating an increase over the past 24 hours. Its market cap sits at $366.43 billion, signifying a growth of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">4.62%</a> in the past day. Also, BTC’s dominance over altcoins is 40.26%.</p>

Analyst Seeks Opportunity To Buy Avalanche (AVAX)
<p>Smart Contracter gave some striking points concerning Avalanche (AVAX), the smart contract blockchain. The analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/SmartContracter/status/1613399892743041024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that AVAX seems to have hit bottom following its 90% correction from its all-time high (ATH). For him, a future downward correction from Avalanche will be a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>At the press time, the price of Avalanche is hovering around $15.53, showing a surge of 4.19% in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Avalanche&#8217;s market cap is 4.92 billion, and the token is ranked as the 17th top crypto asset. Its market dominance is now at 0.54%.</p>
<p>Besides Smart Contracter, another crypto analyst has predicted a price rally for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. A crypto analyst known as Kaleo <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKaleo/status/1610063872811012096" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> closely monitoring the stock market.
