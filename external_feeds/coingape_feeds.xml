<p>Although the video dates back to 2018, Gensler explicitly says that ‚ÄúOver 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They‚Äôre not securities.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to a related report by Cointelegraph, back then, Gary Gensler held a faculty position at the esteemed Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The footage dates back nearly two years prior to his eventual ascension to the Chair of the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-lawsuit-sec-hinman-docs/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>.</p>
<p>In a stark juxtaposition to his previous stance, Gensler‚Äôs subsequent actions at the SEC paint a different picture. The recent months have witnessed the regulatory body plunge into a wave of enforcement initiatives within the cryptosphere.</p>
<p>Last week, Gensler listed 68 cryptos as securities, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) in the most recent lawsuits. Moreover, the regulatory chair once declared that all cryptocurrencies apart from <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-at-a-crossroads-despite-bear-market-stability-us-sec-triggers-altcoins-uncertainty/?utm_source=24hrsupdatebitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin are securities</a>, which contradicts his statement in the 2018 video.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2>Evaluating The Ethereum Price Profitability This Week</h2>
<p>Ethereum, like many of its peers, started the week while consolidating losses after a gruesome week in the wake of the intensified crackdown on the crypto market by the US SEC.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-defies-us-sec-bitcoin-ethereum-and-coinbase-coin-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase, Binance</a>, and the foundations of selected cryptos like ADA, SOL, and MATIC start their respective legal battles, investors may want to know how to adjust their crypto portfolios.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,750 with support at $1,730 holding firmly. Aayush Jindal, an analyst at NewsBTC believes Ether only needs to reclaim support at $1,800 to validate a bigger recovery move to $2,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_151558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151558" style="width: 1142px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/13130343/ETHUSD_2023-06-13_10-13-39.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-151558" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/13130343/ETHUSD_2023-06-13_10-13-39.png" alt="Ethereum price prediction" width="1142" height="597" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-151558" class="wp-caption-text">ETH/USD four-hour chart | Source Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, Ethereum must first deal with resistance at $1,760 to close the gap to $1,800. On the bright side, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator dons a vivid buy signal.</p>
<p>Traders eyeing new long positions in <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum price</a> would be encouraged to activate their orders as long as the MACD line in blue holds above the signal line in red.</p>
<p>Insights from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment suggest that the crypto market could start to rise, now that the <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-us-hires-former-sec-director-in-defence-to-fraud-and-manipulation-charges/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dust lifted by the SEC going after Binance and Coinbase has settled</a>. The rebound is expected to continue ‚Äúuntil the next development with the lawsuits.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Until the next developments with the lawsuits, we could see some gradual rising of prices back to pre-crash levels. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://t.co/Za7tchgeUx">https://t.co/Za7tchgeUx</a> <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://t.co/BSZEHrjQNP">pic.twitter.com/BSZEHrjQNP</a></p>

<p>Moreover, most altcoins experienced extreme capitulation last week, leaving many traders and investors in losses. The sharp price drop will likely trigger increased accumulation among whales. If this accumulation trend continues, ‚Äúthere is reason to believe a strong rebound can occur,‚Äù <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1667785187172966401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santiment states</a>.</p>

<p>Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple‚Äôs CEO treated XRP fans to a tantalizing hint that the documents containing the speech by William Hinman, a former director of the <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-us-sec-lawsuit-crypto-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), would be unsealed on Tuesday.</p>
<h2>The Hinman Documents are ‚ÄúWell Worth The Wait‚Äù ‚Äì Ripple CEO Garlinghouse</h2>
<p>XRP price reacted positively to the new revelation that the popular Hinman docs would be released on Tuesday, climbing 2.2% to trade at $0.5281. Garlinghouse said on Monday while replying to a question by Jungle Inc, a renowned YouTuber that the documents are ‚Äúwell worth the wait.‚Äù</p>
<p>In response to a question posed by crypto influencer Jungle Inc on Twitter on June 12, Brad Garlinghouse expressed cautious optimism. Without intending to overreach, both he and Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Counsel, Stuart Alderoty, believe that the more than a year and a half battle to unlock these documents was justified.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wish I could go in depth now, but we&#8217;ve waited this long (18+ months), I don&#8217;t want to overstep‚Ä¶ suffice it to say <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@s_alderoty</a> and I believe they were well worth the wait.</p>

<p>The highly contested Hinman documents, which the SEC wanted to keep sealed, contain a speech made by Hinman in 2018. In the speech, the former director categorically singled out Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) to have the potential to transform into something much more than securities ‚Äì a commodity as long as they achieve adequate decentralization.</p>
<p>Ripple and XRP enthusiasts believe that the release of the documents would be a valuable insight into the determination of the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc. and its top executives.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-lawsuit-sec-hinman-docs/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC alleged in the lawsuit filed in December 2020 that XRP</a> was sold to investors as an unregistered security, thus breaking the US Securities Exchange Act. Ripple has vehemently fought these claims, hence the long-standing court battle.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Teases 45% Move To $0.8</h2>
<p>XRP price is trading at $0.5281 towards the end of the Asian session. The daily timeframe chart, as observed below shows the formation of a crucial cup and handle pattern. If validated with a break above the neckline resistance at $0.55, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> would be in a better position to push to higher levels, starting with $0.8 and later to $1.</p>
<figure id="attachment_151543" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151543" style="width: 1142px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/13103743/XRPUSD_2023-06-13_07-57-29.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-151543" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/13103743/XRPUSD_2023-06-13_07-57-29.png" alt="XRP price | Ripple vs SEC" width="1142" height="591" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-151543" class="wp-caption-text">XRP/USD daily chart | Source Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>The cup and handle is a chart pattern resembling a teacup. The &#8216;cup&#8217; forms during a price drop followed by a recovery. Similarly, the forms &#8216;handle&#8217; during a smaller subsequent drop and recovery.</p>
<p>Traders buy when the price rises above the handle&#8217;s resistance level ($0.55 for XRP), anticipating further increases, hence yielding profits.</p>
<p>The anticipated bullish breakout would be accompanied by a spike in volume. XRP can validate the massive 45% move to $0.8 riding on the building momentum ahead of the release of the Hinman documents.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, XRP‚Äôs downside is protected by short-term support at $0.5. It is essential this buyer congestion remains intact to prevent losses from extending to $0.44. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has a slightly bearish outlook, implying that traders should tread carefully.</p>

<p>Binance.US faces charges of operating as an illegal securities exchange. Canellos is currently the global head of the litigation and arbitration group at Milbank. He has previously supervised over 1,300 attorneys at the SEC on several investigations. Commenting on hiring George Canellos, John Reed Stark, former head of SEC‚Äôs Office of Internet Enforcement <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/binance-us-hires-former-sec-enforcement-co-director-as-it-fights-charges-1.1932139" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúCanellos possesses a rare and remarkably special combination of skill sets ‚Äî having served as both an SEC prosecutor and a DOJ prosecutor. Think Liam Neeson meets Perry Mason&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>As said, three other attorneys will also be joining the defense team for Binance.US. On June 5, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance.US, the global Binance exchange, and its owner Changpeng Zhao. The lawsuit accuses them of breaking securities laws in the US by mishandling customer funds and misleading investors and regulators. To protect customer funds, the SEC asked the court to freeze Binance.US&#8217;s assets temporarily. Binance has denied the allegations made by the SEC.</p>
<p>Following the SEC action, several banks showed the intent to <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-us-signals-cutting-off-from-banking-partners-liquidity-crisis-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut ties with Binance.US</a> after which it decide to suspend USD deposits.</p>
<h3>Binance.US Defends Fraud and Manipulation Charges</h3>
<p>On Monday, Binance.US submitted a new court filing wherein they noted that the exchange has ‚Äúmade significant efforts‚Äù in order to cooperate with the US SEC since December 2020.</p>
<p>It is the first time the company has disputed the claims made by the SEC, which accused Binance.US and its parent company of redirecting over $12 billion in customer assets to funds controlled by Changpeng &#8216;CZ&#8217; Zhao, the owner and founder.</p>
<p>The US SEC has also accused Zhao of commingling customer assets along with funds controlled by the Binance chief. Responding to it, lawyers representing Binance.US&#8217;s parent company, BAM Trading, said it &#8220;<span id="page41R_mcid4" class="markedContent"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">maintains its customers‚Äô fiat currency in segregated accounts maintained¬†</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">with its banking partners, separate from any corporate funds.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p>Binance.US acknowledged that Changpeng &#8216;CZ&#8217; Zhao owns the bank account of BAM Trading but denied that he has signatory authority over the account. The SEC, on the other hand, argues that Zhao has control over those bank accounts, which indicates a lack of separation between Binance and Binance.US. It is believed that Zhao owns a controlling stake in both entities.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a glimpse into the share of Binance.US has tanked over the last two months, now at just 4.8%.</p>

Binance‚Äôs US arm has argued that freezing its assets would cripple its business and hurt customers, Bloomberg <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-12/binance-us-says-asset-freeze-sought-by-sec-will-cripple-exchange?leadSource=uverify%20wall#xj4y7vzkg">reported</a>.</p>
<h2>‚ÄúOperations would quickly grind to a halt‚Äù</h2>
<p>Without the ability to pay employees, vendors, suppliers and professionals or to maintain the trading platform, the operations will quickly grind to a halt, Binance.US attorneys said Monday in a court filing. ‚ÄúWith a freeze of all corporate assets, banking partners would most likely cease to honor requests to transfer funds for any purpose, including customer redemptions,‚Äù the exchange added.</p>
<p>The SEC had <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-asks-to-freeze-binance-us-assets-funds-are-safu-says-binance/">requested the federal court to seize assets</a> of¬† Binance.US, after it sued Binance entities and founder Changpeng Zhao last week, alleging ‚Äúblatant disregard of US securities laws‚Äù and ‚Äúyears of violative conduct‚Äù that puts customer funds at risk.</p>
<h2>Binance assures US customer assets are safe</h2>
<p>Binance.US attorneys further argued in their court filing that US customer assets are safe and said ‚Äúthere is no need for the draconian relief sought by the SEC.‚Äù As reported earlier, the US SEC had filed an emergency action application for a temporary restraining order to freeze Binance.US‚Äôs assets in an attempt to protect customer funds, including through repatriation of client investments held abroad. Binance has aggressively disputed the allegations.</p>
<h2>Proposed Bill Seeks To Fire SEC Chair</h2>
<p>On Monday, Republican lawmaker Warren Davidson <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-introduce-bill-remove-sec-chair-gary-gensler">introduced</a> the ‚ÄúSEC Stabilization Act‚Äù into the House of Representatives. One of the bill‚Äôs main provisions is to fire the SEC chair Gary Gensler. Along with removing the SEC chair Gary Gensler, the bill would redistribute the power between SEC chair and commissioner. Though the Republican lawmakers did not specifically mention cryptocurrencies in their statements, both the lawmakers Warren Davidason and Tom Emmer have a positive stance on crypto.</p>

But looking past that, the Polygon team has recently unveiled Polygon 2.0 to build the Value Layer of the Internet.</p>
<p>Thus, Polygon 2.0 will serve as a fundamental layer to create, exchange, as well as program value. The team claims that Polygon 2.0 will help democratize the global economy just as the internet helped in democratizing information access.</p>
<p>Polygon 2.0 brings decentralized finance, digital ownership, and innovative coordination methods to the forefront. It fills the gap in creating an Internet that prioritizes users rather than gatekeepers, rent-seekers, or intermediaries.</p>
<p>The new and upgraded Polygon version will serve as the blueprint for building the Value Layer. It features a set of proposed upgrades bringing a major shift in the protocol&#8217;s architecture, tokenomics, and governance.</p>
<p>The team shall reveal more details regarding Polygon 2.0 in the coming weeks. They will detail the future of the Polygon PoS chain, as well as the utility and the evolution of the MATIC token.</p>
<p>Also, the upgraded Polygon network will transition to greater community governance of the protocol and treasury. The team shall unveil a roadmap of how Polygon 2.0 will become the Value Layer of the internet while offering unified liquidity using ZK technology and unlimited scalability.</p>
<p>After facing a <a href="https://coingape.com/ada-sol-and-matic-tank-10-each-after-robinhood-delisting-will-more-exchanges-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy correction</a> last week, the MATIC price is finally up by 2.5% in the last 24 hours. Still, it is 22 negative on the weekly chart.</p>
<h3>More About Polygon 2.0 &#8211; The Value Layer of the Internet</h3>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain network was the first to demonstrate the concept of a value layer by allowing users to create, exchange, as well as program value in a secure and seamless way. As said, Polygon 2.0 will adopt the concepts of infinite scalability and unification from the internet.</p>
<p>Polygon 2.0 is a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-2-0-the-value-layer-of-the-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special network</a> made up of different chains that work together. It&#8217;s a network of ZK-powered Layer-2 chains to make it seem like there&#8217;s only one chain for users. Thus, it can handle several chains at once such that they can interact with each other quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Polygon 2.0 doesn&#8217;t need extra security or trust because everything is already built in. This means the network can handle a lot of things at the same time and keep everything working smoothly.</p>
<p>The Polygon team hasn&#8217;t yet unveiled the specific timeline for the release of the newly upgraded network.</p>

Earlier, in March 2023, he made a sensational claim about <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> reaching $1 million shaking not just the crypto market but also the wider financial markets. Meanwhile, the investor believes that the United States&#8217; global veto over technology is no longer the same, just as the global distribution of power is not dominated by the US. Hence, going by Srinivasan&#8217;s argument, the crypto ecosystem is bound to grow faster if market participants look beyond the US as much earlier as possible.</p>

<p>In the recent times, top US based crypto exchange Coinbase announced plans to expand its presence beyond the United States. This came after its repeated attempts to obtain clear path to regulatory framework from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, he feels that US administration&#8217;s plans to have a CBDC-led surveillance environment would not have the same effect globally as it had earlier.</p>
<h2>&#8220;CBDC Surveillance State In The US&#8221;</h2>
<p>The crypto investor responded to a tweet by Josh Swihart about the US lawmakers&#8217; plans to &#8220;diligently working to shut off all crypto from the mainstream, including Bitcoin.&#8221; Srinivasan, however, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1668304162206121985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that it would not have a widespread effect on the crypto market as Washington DC does not have a global veto over tech anymore. Interestingly, the back to back lawsuits against top <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchanges</a> Coinbase and Binance draw parallel to the US government&#8217;s string resistance to the digital assets ecosystem.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the many obstacles and legal attacks, Bitcoin price is still 54% higher when compared to the closing price in 2022. This makes the case even more stronger to migrate to new crypto hubs like Dubai and Singapore.</p>

A clear indication to this is seen in the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sp500" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">S&amp;P 500 Index</a> behavior, which is at the cusp of closing at a 13 month high on Monday, largely due to the expectation of the central bank pausing the rate hike spree. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.86% on Monday while the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.3%. However, it remains to be seen whether the markets will have any real deviation if and when the rate hike pause is announced.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson believes the ongoing market optimism resulted in the pricing in of the Fed rate hike pause already. Hence, it may be argued that there may not be much room for bullish environment in the financial markets. However, the same may not necessarily be said about Bitcoin price and crypto markets.</p>
<h2>Former Fed Vice Chair: Rate Hike Pause Already Priced In</h2>
<p>Speaking to CNBC on Monday, former Fed official Roger Ferguson agreed that the market is right about the Fed pause expectation. However, he said not all is fine about the quantitative easing of the Fed&#8217;s monetary policy. Citing tight labor market and rising wages, Ferguson <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/squawkcnbc/status/1668225689877635074" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> there was likelihood of further rate hikes in the remaining of 2023, as against the market expectation of a downward path in terms of easing the policy. Hence, this could potentially translate to increased volatility in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>, as risky assets like Bitcoin may be preferred by traders in an uncertain environment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think the market has priced in a pause. Where I disagree with the market is I see not one but a possibility of two more hikes after this one with no reversal this year. I think the market&#8217;s generally correct but a little optimistic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The CME FedWatch Tool <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shows</a> that the likelihood that the Fed will change the Federal target rate just around 21%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-151531" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/13005947/ING.png" alt="ING dollar prediction" width="711" height="218" /></p>
<p>In yet another positive indication for rise in <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> in the rest of 2023, banking and financial services company ING predicted that the US Dollar could end up in a relatively lower position by the end of the year, as shared by Twitter handle Walter Bloomberg. This is based on a contrarian view that the Fed may cut rates in the fourth quarter.</p>

She titled the memo &#8220;Building Twitter 2.0 Together&#8221;.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello Twitter. <br />People keep asking me: Why Twitter?¬†<br />So, I‚Äôll tell you.¬†<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="üëá" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She began her explanation by reminding her more than 447,000 followers that the former CEO who is an automobile expert saw the need for transformation in the space exploration and electric vehicles sector, and he went for it. This time around, Twitter which she referred to as the &#8220;global town square&#8221; echoing Musk&#8217;s stated goal for the company, needed transformation and here she is.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It‚Äôs also becoming clear that the global town square needs transformation‚Äîto drive civilization forward through the unfiltered exchange of information and open dialogue about the things that matter most to us,&#8221; the new Twitter CEO said. &#8220;Have you ever been talking with someone particularly insightful and thought, you should have the freedom to speak your mind. We all should. Enter Twitter 2.0.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><b>Yaccarino Becomes Responsible for Twitter Ad Business</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before coming to Twitter to take over from Elon Musk, Yaccarino was a long-time advertising executive at NBCUniversal.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During her time there, she led global and sales for the media house. Upon her joining Twitter, Musk decided to oversee the operations of Twitter‚Äôs product and engineering teams while Yaccarino leads everything else. He decided to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/elon-musk-might-step-down-as-twitter-ceo-heres-why/"><span style="font-weight: 400">step down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> after coming under different policy changes on Twitter that led to a few account suspensions and sine other chaos.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the Tesla boss bought the bluebird app in a </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-elon-musk-cites-whistleblower-to-end-44-billion-twitter-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400">$44 billion bid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Twitter‚Äôs ads business has seen a relapse. Hence, Yaccarino&#8217;s major responsibility will be to rebuild that sector. Speaking to Twitter employees, Yaccarino reminded them that Twitter is currently on a mission to become the &#8220;world‚Äôs most accurate real-time information source and a global town square for communication.&#8221; </span></p>

<h2>A Turning Point In XRP Lawsuit?</h2>
<p>As per the court orders, Ripple and SEC filed a joint letter seeking <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-seeks-extension-to-reveal-hinman-docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one week extension</a> until June 13, 2023, for the public release of the unredacted Hinman Speech documents. However, with speech linked memos, unredacted versions of cross motions for summary judgment of both parties will be made public.</p>
<p>Finally, the Crypto industry will gain clarity that why then SEC Director of Corporation Finance, Bill Hinman concluded that Ether (ETH) was not a security.</p>
<p>Attorney John Deaton, Amicus curiae in the XRP lawsuit suggests that June 13, 2023, will make it clear how strong or weak the SEC‚Äôs assertions linked to several specific sales stands. He highlighted that just the ‚Äúoffer‚Äù can violate Section 5 of the Securities Act. It is important to note that this appears to be the commission‚Äôs strongest argument in the case. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<h2>Ripple Wanted To Hide Sales Data</h2>
<p>Deaton mentioned that the cross motions filed by both parties will be released to the public. This will allow us to see some specific evidence offered against Ripple and the defendants. However, Ripple was seeking to redact evidence linking to its revenue with XRP sales offered to Coinbase crypto exchange and others to list XRP. This also included the amount of sales that were targeted at investors via programmatic sales.</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-tail rejection at $0.0000056 support suggests the buyers are actively defending this level0</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential upswing in the SHIB price could raise a temporary recovery of 20%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $120.5 Million, showing a 68% loss.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the aggressive selling was swiftly countered by buyers, who managed to recover the losses incurred during the day. The resulting long-tail rejection indicated that the buyers are aggressively accumulating at this discounted price and projected a suitable level to revert the price higher.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the SHIB coin traded at $0.00000665 and showed another long-tail rejection candle indicating the buying pressure persists. If the bullish momentum rises further, the coin price will witness a minor relief rally to retest the breached support of $0.0000072, and $0.00000783 as potential resistance.¬†</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the higher possibility of sellers defending two resistances, the Shiba price is likely to stay in a downtrend or consolidation phase for the remaining days of June.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Shiba Inu&#8217;s Price Recover to $0.000008?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the upside side, the Shiba Inu coin shows a downsloping trendline which has been carrying a steady downtrend for the past four months. Even if the coin price shows a significant recovery in the coming days, the buyers will get a better conviction for long-term recovery if the prices breach the overhead trendline. A breakout above the overhead trendline will boast the buying momentum and surpass $0.000008.¬†</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Vortex Indicator: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wide gap showcased as the VI- slope moves up above the V+ reflects an established downtrend.</span></li>

The bill, aimed at streamlining US capital markets, comes at a time when Gensler is facing heavy criticism for his style of enforcing laws on the crypto market. In a latest, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/gary-gensler-crypto-market-regulation-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> his warnings to crypto investors, in that he reiterates that the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> businesses are informed of the existing laws, although most of the industry participants dislike the status quo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the XRP community, which has been long fighting the SEC in the Ripple lawsuit, awaits the June 13 public release of the Hinman documents. The Ripple lawsuit is currently the most important conflicts with the SEC as the outcome is expected to be right around the corner with Judge Analisa Torres likely to deliver the all important Summary Judgement any time now.</p>
<h2>The SEC Stabilization Act To Fire Gary Gensler</h2>
<p>Warren Davidson, a Congressman from Ohio, filed the SEC Stabilization Act aiming to restructure the agency as well as fire Chair Gensler. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1668305460368121857?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a> that there was a need to fix the ongoing abuse of power and to ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. It‚Äôs time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as Chair of the SEC.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Davidson was joined with support by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who argued that the US investors and the industry deserve clear and consistent oversight, not political gamesmanship. The SEC Stabilization Act includes firing Gensler as the first step, followed by revamping the rulemaking process, enforcement and investigations.</p>

This deal was specifically struck between Islamabad and Moscow and the first cargo has arrived in Karachi since Sunday and is still being offloaded at the port.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The country&#8217;s Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik disclosed this information to Reuters on a phone call.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the minister, the entire transaction involves 100,000 tonnes of oil, but only 45,000 tonnes has been deposited at Karachi with the others on the way. He did not divulge details of the discount which Pakistan received from Russia or the commercial features of the deal. Still, he suggested that the oil importation is certainly a good buy for Pakistan.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We‚Äôve run iterations of various product mixes, and in no scenario will the refining of this crude make a loss,‚Äù Malik announced. ‚ÄúWe are very sure it will be commercially viable.‚Äù</span></p>
<h2><b>BRICS Nations to Ditch the U.S. Dollars</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Importantly, the change in currency notes is a clear effort to inactivate the dominance of the United States dollars as regards international trades. More so, it is a milestone for BRICS foundation member countries; Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, that have been pushing for de-dollarization amongst themselves.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many member countries, as well as non-members of BRICS have also joined in the drive against U.S. dollar dominance. In April, Indonesia hinted at plans to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/ndonesia-looking-to-move-away-from-the-u-s-dollar/"><span style="font-weight: 400">replace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the dollar with an alternative mode of payment. At the time, Indonesia was considering reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar by introducing Rupiah for cross-border transactions, at least amongst Asian countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few weeks later, Brazil president Luiz Lula da Silva, proposed that the country </span><a href="https://coingape.com/brazil-president-proposes-ditching-us-dollar-trading-currency/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ditch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the dollar for another currency. Apart from using their local currencies, some of these nations are considering Bitcoin (BTC) as a safer alternative to the U.S. dollar, especially now that the cryptocurrency has recovered reasonably from the bear market of last year.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noteworthy, Max Keiser, the advisor to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele is positive that if the BTC alternative is accepted, it will be </span><a href="https://coingape.com/super-hyper-bitcoinization-will-kill-us-dollar-dominance-el-salvador-advisor/"><span style="font-weight: 400">fast track</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to de-dollarization.¬†</span></p>

He made some interesting remarks before Piper Sandler Global Exchange &amp; Fintech Conference. Gensler once again drew a link between the digital assets market and the securities laws, stating that trust in capital markets in the United States was built on compliance with the laws. He also warned that <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> like bankruptcies can continue to happen without compliance, although he failed to address how exactly crypto businesses are to comply.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the SEC Chair spoke about the need to protect investors, saying the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto markets</a> should not be allowed to harm them. In his speech, Gensler mentioned a 2018 conversation by Binance&#8217;s then Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim with a colleague about how the crypto exchange is operating as an unlicensed securities exchange in the the United States. The same was included in the SEC&#8217;s recent complaint against Binance, which alleged it of lying to regulators.</p>
<h2>Gary Gensler Warns Crypto Market, Again</h2>
<p>Gensler reiterated in his opening remarks that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities by the virtue of meeting the investment contract test. However, the SEC Chair made it a point to warn that lack of compliance could lead to more and more anti-crypto enforcement actions. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-piper-sandler-060823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>, &#8220;not liking the message is not the same thing as not receiving it,&#8221; indicating that the market participants are well informed about the status quo. Apparently, this is an attempt to shield the SEC&#8217;s arguments in the many crypto lawsuits that may involve the stance of &#8216;lack of clarity&#8217; over regulations.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When crypto asset market participants go on Twitter or TV and say they lacked ‚Äúfair notice‚Äù that their conduct could be illegal, don‚Äôt believe it. They may have made a calculated economic decision to take the risk of enforcement as the cost of doing business.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the digital assets market participants will be anticipating the public release of Hinman documents in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP Vs SEC lawsuit</a>, on June 13, 2023.</p>

From the peak of $0.000115, the coin price tumbled nearly 24.5% to reach the current price of $0.000086.

<h2><strong>LUNC Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LUNC price is likely to witness high volatility in a narrow range.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below $0.000082 could tumble the prices by 15%.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the LUNC price experienced a heavy sell-off and printed a long-red candle in the daily chart. This sell-off showed an attempt to break the local support of $0.000082 but the sellers failed to sustain lower levels.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the long-wick rejection candle validates the aforementioned level as a high accumulation zone, indicating the price is likely to fall below. Similarly, on the flip side, the overhead trendline will constantly pressurize the LUNC price and undermine bullish attempts.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the coin price is likely to coil between the mentioned until either of the levels is breached. Thus, the breakout will release the trapped momentum and trigger a direction move on the respected side.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will LUNC Price Fall to $0.00007?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The near future trend for LUNC price depends on the range formation between the downsloping trendline and $0.000082 support. With the current market condition bearish, the LUNC price is likely to break below $0.000082 support which will intensify the selling pressure and push the coin to $0.00007. Conversely, a breakout above the overhead trendline will provide buyers with a suitable footing to lead the price to $0.0001.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Pivot levels: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This support/resistance indicator reflects the demand zone at $0.000073 and $0.00006, and on the flip side, it shows the supply zone at $0.000092 and $0.000103.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish divergence in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> reflects increasing buying pressure at lower prices.¬†</span></li>

<h2>CPI Data, FOMC Meeting Remains Main Focus</h2>
<p>The US Core <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) will be the main focus this week followed by the crucial FOMC meeting. US CPI data will be announced on June 13, while the crucial FOMC meeting will be held from June 13-14. However, US Fed Chief Jerome Powell will give out market moving statement on June 14.</p>
<p>The market needs to brace itself as ECB is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on June 15 amid inflation pressure. Reports suggest that due to persistent inflationary pressures, the central bank might halt the hike for the rest of the year.</p>

According to reports, the case was </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitgo-lawsuit-against-galaxy-digital-140403325.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, giving Galaxy Digital the much needed relief over the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BitGo </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bitgo-sues-galaxy-digital/"><span style="font-weight: 400">filed the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> against Galaxy Digital back in September last year following the failure of the latter to make good on the deal to acquire the former for $1.2 billion as agreed earlier. The latter firm </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/galaxy-announces-termination-of-bitgo-acquisition-806604223.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">backtracked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the deal at the time on account that BitGo failed to share its audited financial records as of July 31 last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The period of the negotiations also coincided with the heat of the crypto winter that saw the collapse of top crypto platforms including Celsius Network and Voyager Digital which fueled cautionary investments amongst firms. With the expectations the deal generated, BitGo sued the Mike Novogratz led firm for more than $100 million in damages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the ruling, Galaxy Digital will no longer be liable to pay any damages and it will be able to focus on its business moving forward.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased with the court‚Äôs decision to dismiss BitGo‚Äôs claims. Now is the time for all of us to work together and focus on the task at hand: Upgrading the global financial system in a manner that promotes innovation and protects investors and consumers alike,‚Äù Galaxy Digital said in a statement shared on Twitter.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Galaxy Digital vs BitGo: The Way Forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lawsuit and the way it ended appears acceptable to Galaxy Digital and moving forward from here appears straightforward. However, the case is not the same for BitGo who as of the time of writing has not commented on the court‚Äôs decisions on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As noted, the latest tweet from BitGo is the affirmation of its legality as a crypto custody service provider, a confirmation that appears necessary to prevent the bout of panic withdrawals that is typically characteristic of the volatile cryptocurrency ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether or not BitGo will be appealing the case remains unknown, but for now, supporters of the Galaxy Digital firm appear elated for now.</span></p>

However, the US regulators have been waging a parallel war against <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> since the beginning of 2023, as the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> continues to target crypto businesses operating in the United States. In this context, there is an interesting situation wherein there are conflicting arguments in terms of regulating the AI space versus the digital assets space.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-ethereum-to-rise-amid-positive-us-fed-inflation-data-or-fall-as-market-makers-exit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Bitcoin, Ethereum To Rise Amid Positive US Fed &amp; Inflation Data or Fall As Market Makers Exit</strong></a></p>
<p>Recently, the US SEC filed back to back lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, which are the world&#8217;s top crypto exchanges in terms of trading volumes. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase lawsuit</a> came as a direct contradiction to the exchange&#8217;s demand for clear regulatory framework for crypto assets from the reguatory agency. The regulator claimed that Coinbase had been operating as an unregistered broker since at least 2019, whereas it was in the same year that the SEC approved SEC&#8217;s IPO application.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk Responds To Crypto Vs AI Regulatory Concerns</h2>
<p>Although Coinbase had in recent times moved court over its request to compel the SEC to respond to a crypto rulemaking petition, it can also be argued that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> actually never wanted any regulation. It is, however, widely agreed that regulation of digital assets under the existing rules is accepted by hardly any crypto market participants. Hence, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://companies.coingape.com/coinbase" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinbase</a> may be open to regulation as and when there are clear rules for the crypto space, which it appears will be a distant plan in near future, considering the upcoming US presidential election 2024 and the possibility of a regime change, including at the SEC.</p>
<p>Whereas on the other side, Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, recently called for the United States administration to regulate the artificial intelligence space. In this context, Musk <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1668080415293206530" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to the double puzzle on regulating the two emerging markets.</p>

From the peak of $0.95, this downfall tumbled the price by nearly 45% within a week. However, the daily chart shows a sharply lower price rejection at $0.518 on June 10th, revealing a high accumulation zone for buyers; Can coin buyers kickstart a fresh recovery from this level?</span></p>

<h2><strong>MATIC Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential reversal in MATIC price may face intense supply at $0.687 and $0.744</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oversold RSI indicator reflects the coin price is trading at a heavy discount¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $364.5 Million, indicating an 8.67% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/422D2L03.png" alt="MATIC Price " width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Long-tail rejection candle at $0.518 support indicates the aggressive accumulation from buyers at lower levels. The coin price is 24% higher from the bottom support to current trade at $0.644.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discounted MATIC price could attract more buyers and trigger a temporary pullback to $0.745. The potential rally could surge the price by 15%-18% to meet the long-coming resistance trendline(red).</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned resistance has maintained a steady downtrend in MATIC price and the potential traders seeking long-entry opportunities must wait for a breakout above this trendline.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will MATIC Price Rise above $0.745?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current relief rally in MATIC is likely triggered by the accumulation of this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> at discounted market value. Thus, with the overall trend still bearish, a recovery above $0.745 is less likely. If buyers face supply pressure at the in-between resistance of $0.68, the price may revisit $0.518 support.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin price stretched far from its <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">exponential moving average</a>(20, 50, 100, and 200) reflecting instability in the current downtrend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wide gap between the bearishly aligned <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) highlights an aggressive downtrend in MATIC.</span></li>

<p>Stock markets are inching toward fresh 52-week highs after new market forecasts indicate inflation cooled in May and the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-ethereum-recover-on-debt-ceiling-deal-us-fed-pause-easing-jobs-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Fed plans to &#8220;skip&#8221; rate hike</a> in June.

<p>Moreover, US treasury yields remain firm and the US dollar slides, bringing some upward momentum in Bitcoin price. US Dollar Index (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DXY</a>) fell below 103.50 on Monday.</p>

<h2>Internal Problems Still Haunts Bitcoin and Ethereum Price</h2>
<p>Despite positive developments on the macro front, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices fail to show strong price action due to uncertainty surrounding Binance and Coinbase lawsuits.</p>
<p>The key events for the crypto include a <strong>US House</strong> hearing on the digital asset industry and the <a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-releases-stablecoin-bill-bring-clarity-giving-fed-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draft stablecoin bill</a>, <strong>Hinman documents</strong> becoming public, SEC&#8217;s Coinbase rulemaking response, and the Binance.US hearing on assets freeze. All are scheduled for Tuesday, June 13.</p>
<p>According to Kaiko <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1668206152377663488" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a>, Binance.US market depth is down a staggering 78% since the SEC lawsuit. Marker makers pulled out liquidity after Binance.US ended USD support on the exchange.</p>
