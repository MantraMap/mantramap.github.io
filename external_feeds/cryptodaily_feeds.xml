			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After a partial Ripple&rsquo;s win against the SEC, many believe that the latter will file an appeal &ndash; law expert James Murphy offers four possible future scenarios for the case.</p>
Ripple Wins the Lawsuit against the SEC... or not yet?&nbsp;
<p>On July 13, 2023, Judge Analise Torres partially ruled in favor of Ripple Labs in the case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC), putting an end to a 3-year-long crusade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The historic victory made the XRP token skyrocket in value and sent the bullish wave to the whole crypto market. However, some believe that the battle is not over yet, as the SEC still has the option to file an appeal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Law expert James Murphy known on Twitter as &ldquo;MetaLawMan&rdquo; has shed some light on the matter. In his recent Tweet of July 25, Murphy identified four options the SEC currently has and described how each could work.&nbsp;</p>
So, What Could the SEC Do Next?&nbsp;
<p>According to the expert, the first option on the table for the SEC is to file a request for an interlocutory appeal. At the moment, the SEC doesn't have the unilateral right to appeal as the final judgment has not been entered yet. To proceed with an interlocutory appeal, the SEC would need to ask the permission of Judge Torres and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. To get this permission, Murphy explains that the SEC would need to prove that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
&ldquo;The ruling involves a controlling question of law;
</li>
<li>
There is substantial grounds for difference of opinion on that question;&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
An immediate appeal may materially advance the litigation.&rdquo;
</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s no deadline for the initial request, although it&rsquo;s likely to be done within 30 days. In case Judge Torres agrees, the SEC would have 10 days to seek permission from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second option for the SEC is to start a trial on the aiding and abetting claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse and file a regular appeal after.</p>
<p>Another potential path for the SEC is to drop the claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse. This would allow the SEC to take an immediate appeal without seeking permission.</p>
<p>Finally, the SEC has the option to settle, although Murphey believes that it&rsquo;s highly unlikely due to the political considerations.</p>
<p>James Murphy concludes that the first option is the most probable because the SEC is under pressure to get the Torres decision reversed and because the Ripple case could influence lawsuits against other crypto platforms such as Coinbase and Binance. Overall, the expert is quite optimistic about the Ripple&rsquo;s chances:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect the SEC to file a request for interlocutory appeal within the next 2 weeks. I believe it would be in the best interests of Ripple &amp; the #XRPCommunity for the appeals process to start now--rather than a year from now. And I like Ripple's chances on appeal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the price of XRP has been shining green in the last 10 days, even though it still hasn&rsquo;t reached a $1 mark.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">A team of Bitcoin developers and enthusiasts have introduced what's been dubbed the "Frostsnap" method, one that is set to provide multisig wallets with a range of new capabilities, transforming them from a static tool to a flexible, adaptive system.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With this new development, Bitcoin multisig wallets, known for their secure nature, are getting a significant upgrade. Multisignature or multisig wallets have always been a go-to for safeguarding funds on the Bitcoin network. Their modus operandi requires multiple signers to authorize any transaction, which adds a layer of security. But one of the limitations with traditional multisigs is that they can't add signers without creating a new wallet, an action that calls for transferring funds.</p>
The Solution
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The newly-introduced Frostsnap method proposes a solution to this inconvenience. It allows for the replacement of hardware wallets such as Ledgers, Trezors, ColdCards, or other similar permutations, without the need for additional on-chain transactions. It's also capable of adding new signers to a key after the initial private key generation event and rendering stolen hardware wallets incompatible with every other device of the multisig. Adam Mashrique, the project's hardware lead, affirmed the team's ambition to create an open standard that vendors could implement, thereby enabling different devices to be part of a FROST multisig wallet.</p>
Reshaping the Multisig Landscape
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Frostsnap has already drawn comparisons to a "Bitcoin multisig centipede" due to its flexibility and adaptability. Like a centipede, Frostsnap-compatible devices can be replaced, modify the required number of devices to confirm a transaction if a device is compromised, and efficiently facilitate data transfer to Bitcoin nodes with Taproot signatures. The name Frostsnap is a nod to the acronym Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signatures (FROST).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The remarkable aspect of this system is that it's fully in consensus with the Bitcoin network today, requiring no fork or proprietary node software. Despite plans to introduce a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for on-chain FROST support, devices supporting FROST can manage an on-chain Frostsnap wallet today. The development of Frostnap, in an of itself, is FOSS (Free and Open Source Software).</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Each person is a unique combination of things they know, objects they own, places they can access, and people they trust.How individuals secure their #Bitcoin should reflect this.Introducing Frostsnap, hardware and software evolving Bitcoin ownershiphttps://t.co/Vo111j4p5J</p>
&mdash; Frostsnap ❄ (@FrostsnapTech) July 20, 2023

Security and Flexibility
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In addition to improved flexibility and security, Frostsnap offers a handful of benefits. Users can back up information onto new devices, making future device swaps easier. It also allows multisig signers to dismiss any stolen device with a threshold number of signatures, providing further security against thieves.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Frostsnap provides increased privacy through Taproot, which erfectively conceals the existence or attributes of a Frostsnap wallet. Thanks to Taproot, Frostsnap can also consolidate signature-related data, reducing on-chain fees. Moreover, it can obscure whether a wallet involves Nostr, a federated mint, Bitcoin Script smart contract, or Lightning Network channel.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Frostsnap method stands to offer Bitcoiners a means to sign documents, verify identities, maintain privacy, and secure an organization's bitcoin against the risk of rogue employees or a lost signing device. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The world&rsquo;s premier crypto exchange platform is set to start operations for Japanese customers according to an announcement from CEO Changpeng Zhao in the WebX conference in Tokyo held today.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Last November 2022, Binance announced that it has acquired Japanese crypto exchange Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC), an exchange registered in the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA). This move was the start of Binance&rsquo;s expansion to the country, and at the same signaled its commitment to work with regulators. Now, the exchange is all set to offer its full services to customers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the same event meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reaffirmed Japan&rsquo;s welcoming stance to Web3, calling it &ldquo;a new form of capitalism.&rdquo; Koichi Hagiuda, the Policy Research Council chairman of Japan&rsquo;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), noted the party&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the country. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Japan has been slowly turning into a cryptocurrency hub in Asia. The LDP has recently announced a 30% tax break for companies issuing cryptocurrencies in order to improve conditions for the emerging sector. It has also published a whitepaper last March outlining the party&rsquo;s position on crypto and cursory plans of action. On top of this, Japanese firms unveiled a collaborative project to create the country&rsquo;s first metaverse infrastructure, designed to ease ordinary people into the world of digital assets. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance on the other hand has been looking for greener pastures as it is currently locked in a bitter legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Besides setting up shop in Japan, the exchange is eyeing a move to Dubai, another country noted for its pro-crypto policies. Asia looks to be the next big hub for cryptocurrency, as the U.S. attempts to crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin, the high-tech cryptocurrency initiative supported by Sam Altman, might soon find itself under the scrutiny of data protection regulators in the UK.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The development comes in the wake of Worldcoin's global debut on Monday. The Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office, responsible for upholding information rights and data privacy in the UK, conveyed to Reuters:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We are aware of Worldcoin's launch in the UK and will be making further enquiries."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin's distinctiveness lies in its innovative, orb-shaped cameras, or 'orb stations', which capture iris images to distinguish humans from AI online. Worldcoin assures users that this process maintains their privacy. As a trade-off for their biometric data, users receive a unique 'WorldID' and the native Worldcoin cryptocurrency at no charge.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin's Market Debut and Regulatory Challenges</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Renowned crypto platforms such as Binance, Huobi, and OKX have included Worldcoin (WLD) in their listings. On its launch day, WLD surged to a peak of $3.30. However, the initial euphoria proved short-lived as the token dipped more than 35%, dropping to $2.10 the following day.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite launching in 35 cities across 20 countries on Monday, Worldcoin chose to steer clear of the US due to regulatory uncertainties and potential misuse of cryptocurrencies. In response to its digital ID and cryptocurrency's availability, Worldcoin expressed optimism, stating, "We hope that in regions with unclear regulations, like the US, measures will be taken so more people can benefit."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Co-founder Alex Blania, in an interview with Bankless, mentioned that the specifics of the token's distribution remain undisclosed due to potential legal challenges in the US. He stated, "Many details can't be discussed here because of regulatory uncertainty in the United States."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin's Crypto Vision</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At the helm of Worldcoin are OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Alex Blania, who have been nurturing the project for over three years. The fundamental premise behind Worldcoin is to provide a viable means of verifying human identity online while preserving users' privacy. This need has been accentuated by the rapid evolution of AI technology, sparking concerns about its potential to replace human jobs and blur the distinction between humans and AI bots on the internet.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin offers a unique digital proof of personhood, known as World ID. Users obtain a World ID through an innovative biometric verification device called an Orb. The Orb scans users' irises, providing a biometric confirmation of their human identity.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Universal Basic Income and Beyond</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Notably, Worldcoin has also disclosed its plans for establishing what's been dubbed as the Universal Basic Income (UBI) service, funded by its AI efforts. The service, where permitted by local laws, will allow users to receive Worldcoin's digital currency (WLD) merely for their verified human status. It's evident that Worldcoin's roll-out has generated ample interest in the crypto world, with personalities like Vitalik Buterin weighing in on its biometric proof of personhood concept.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Privacy Concerns and Regulatory Challenges</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This ambitious venture intertwines the realms of biotechnology, AI, and cryptocurrency in a bid to tackle some of society's pressing issues. On the outset, however, Worldcoin will undoubtedly have to address potential concerns around privacy, security, and regulatory compliance to gain widespread acceptance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin's innovative approach, which fuses biometric data with cryptocurrency distribution, has attracted both attention and scrutiny. The project now faces the challenging task of assuaging data privacy concerns while navigating the complex regulatory landscape across different countries. How it manages these challenges could set precedents for the fusion of biotechnology and cryptocurrencies in the future. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Co-founder Alex Blania, in an interview with Bankless, mentioned that the specifics of the token's distribution remain undisclosed due to potential legal challenges in the US. He stated, "Many details can't be discussed here because of regulatory uncertainty in the United States."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin's Crypto Vision</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At the helm of Worldcoin are OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Alex Blania, who have been nurturing the project for over three years. The fundamental premise behind Worldcoin is to provide a viable means of verifying human identity online while preserving users' privacy. This need has been accentuated by the rapid evolution of AI technology, sparking concerns about its potential to replace human jobs and blur the distinction between humans and AI bots on the internet.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin offers a unique digital proof of personhood, known as World ID. Users obtain a World ID through an innovative biometric verification device called an Orb. The Orb scans users' irises, providing a biometric confirmation of their human identity.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Universal Basic Income and Beyond</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Notably, Worldcoin has also disclosed its plans for establishing what's been dubbed as the Universal Basic Income (UBI) service, funded by its AI efforts. The service, where permitted by local laws, will allow users to receive Worldcoin's digital currency (WLD) merely for their verified human status. It's evident that Worldcoin's roll-out has generated ample interest in the crypto world, with personalities like Vitalik Buterin weighing in on its biometric proof of personhood concept.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Privacy Concerns and Regulatory Challenges</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This ambitious venture intertwines the realms of biotechnology, AI, and cryptocurrency in a bid to tackle some of society's pressing issues. On the outset, however, Worldcoin will undoubtedly have to address potential concerns around privacy, security, and regulatory compliance to gain widespread acceptance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin's innovative approach, which fuses biometric data with cryptocurrency distribution, has attracted both attention and scrutiny. The project now faces the challenging task of assuaging data privacy concerns while navigating the complex regulatory landscape across different countries. How it manages these challenges could set precedents for the fusion of biotechnology and cryptocurrencies in the future. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>CyberKongz partners with Axie Infinity&rsquo;s creator Sky Mavis to migrate its existing Play and Kollect NFT game and mint the new Genkai NFT collection on the Ronin chain.</p>
New Genkai NFT Collection and Game to Be Launched on Ronin
<p>According to the press release of July 25, Sky Mavis, creator of the popular crypto game Axie Infinity, starts its new partnership with a growing NFT franchise CyberKongz.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CyberKongz will mint a part of its new anime-inspired NFT collection called Genkai on Sky Mavis&rsquo; Ronin chain. The Genkai mint will take place on July 27 at 12pm EST, with 4,000 made available on Ronin&rsquo;s Mavis Market and the other 16,000 NFTs minted on the Ethereum Mainnet. The Ethereum NFT holders will have the option to move their tokens to Ronin in the future. The price for Genkai NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain is expected to be 0.25 ETH (about $460) per token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT creators have also confirmed that they&rsquo;ll join forces with Ronin to develop a new game featuring Genkai, although no further details have been announced so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genkai is the first non-pixel artwork I have created for CyberKongz and will represent our growth as a project to expand our IP into the Southeast Asian and Japanese markets. Additionally, CyberKongz will be working with Ronin to develop a game featuring Genkai. This ambitious venture will seek to alter the paradigm of web3 IP in a gamified manner.&rdquo; &ndash; shared CyberKongz founder and artist, Myoo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s been reported that the CyberKongz&rsquo; existing NFT minting game called Play and Kollect will be migrated from the Polygon blockchain to Ronin. However, the date for the migration hasn&rsquo;t been set yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To strengthen the connection between Axie Infinity and CyberKongz users, Sky Mavis will give away free Genkai NFTs to each holder of the rare Mystic Axies.&nbsp;</p>
What Does the Partnership Mean for Sky Mavis and CyberKongz?
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why CyberKongz chose Sky Mavis for this collaboration. Apparently, there&rsquo;s always been a link between Axie Infinity players and CyberKongz fans.</p>
<p>CyberKongz council member Henry the Grape explained: </p>

<p>&ldquo;We were really born out of the Axie community. So when the opportunity came with Ronin to be able to continue building our ecosystem on Ronin, it was kind of a no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myoo of CyberKongz also mentioned:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By partnering with Sky Mavis we are embarking on a unique opportunity to accelerate our already established gaming ecosystem, while also enabling an expansion of our holder base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for Sky Mavis, it will undoubtedly benefit from the partnership. The Axie Infinity creators are moving towards growing a large blockchain gaming ecosystem. CyberKongz NFTs will become the first profile picture collection minted on Ronin.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Avalanche Foundation has earmarked a whopping $50M to acquire assets that are tokenised on its blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
Reshaping the financial landscape
<p>In a blog on the Avalanche website, the ambitious venture, named "Avalanche Vista," is explained. By converting real-world assets into digital tokens on the blockchain, Avalanche aims to revolutionise the way assets are viewed and handled, making the process faster, more scalable, and tailored to specific needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This significant financial commitment underscores the foundation's vision of reshaping the financial landscape. By leveraging Avalanche's cutting-edge consensus mechanism, innovative Subnet structure, and technological prowess, the foundation seeks to propel the concept of tokenization into the mainstream. The goal? To showcase how blockchain can transform traditionally cumbersome processes like asset issuance, settlement, and management.&nbsp;</p>
A new era of tokenisation
<p>John Wu, Ava Labs' President, remarked:</p>

<p>"Asset tokenization isn&rsquo;t just the future of capital markets, it&rsquo;s a critical driver of the present,&rdquo; said John Wu, President of Ava Labs. &ldquo;The groundswell of momentum across institutions building on-chain has been astounding, and the Avalanche Foundation is taking a big leap forward with this initiative."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Historically, private market investments have been a playground for the elite. But the barriers that kept many at bay, such as high operational costs and manual processes, are being dismantled. By merging on-chain asset management with tokenization, we're ushering in a new era of efficiency and enhanced user experience.</p>
A $20 trillion market by 2030
<p>Reports suggest a bright future for tokenised assets. Security Token Advisors found that a staggering 77% of capital market players foresee the digitization of traditional securities in the next decade. By 2030, the market for tokenised securities could skyrocket to $20T. Moreover, VanEck anticipates institutions will tokenise assets worth $25B in 2023. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD 28095 Remains Pivotal:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 26 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained pressured early in the Asian session as the pair glided higher from the 29046 level and reached the 29278.23 area after Stops were elected above the 29228.77 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure around the 28850 and 28981 levels.&nbsp; Buying pressure emerged around the 29092.07 area during a pullback, deriving technical support just above a related price objective around the 29084 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;After recently trading as high as the 30350.70 area, BTC/USD rapidly depreciated to the 28973.24 area.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 29403 and 29089 levels during the acute depreciation, downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure around the 30421.29 and 29851.28 levels.&nbsp; Related downside price objectives include the 28775, 29386, and 27757 levels.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives include the 28213, 28137, 27757, 27430, 27338, 27312, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">As the crypto market is evolving rapidly, investors are looking for stable projects for investments. The market value of Tradecurve (TCRV) is projected to soar by 80x in 2023. On the contrary, Neo (NEO) and Polkadot (DOT) are witnessing an erosion in their investor base. </p>
<p class="s6">Therefore, Tradecurve&rsquo;s presale has become a huge hit from the very first day of its launch due to its stable and growth-bound business roadmap.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Neo (NEO) Launches Neo Compounder
<p class="s6">Neo (NEO) has recently taken measures to expand its universe, and protect its price from falling. The price of Neo (NEO) has been on a free fall for the last few weeks, and has plummeted by 10% in the past 7 days. As a result, the trading price of Neo (NEO) has come down to $10.82, which is about 95% below its peak price of $196.85. </p>
<p class="s6">To break this bearish momentum, Neo (NEO) recently announced that Neo Compounder has been made live. According to the project developers, Neo Compounder will auto-compound users&rsquo; GAS rewards into more NEO tokens. Analysts believe that this development will incentivize users to increase their activity on the Neo (NEO) network. </p>
<p class="s6">This, in turn, can help the Neo (NEO) network register a positive growth rate in the coming weeks. </p>
Polkadot (DOT) Tops GitHub Commit Rankings
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) recently bagged the top spot in GitHub commit rankings. According to data from Santiment, Polkadot was ranked first in the list of the top 20 fastest-developed crypto assets. The top position on the list indicates that the level of development activity on the Polkadot network has been higher than other blockchains. </p>
<p class="s6">As per experts, high development activity can boost investors&rsquo; confidence in the Polkadotnetwork, as it hints about an upcoming surge in the value of DOT tokens. In another event, the social network, MeWe, recently integrated with the Polkadot ecosystem. This can also increase the user base of Polkadot. Currently, Polkadot is trading at $5.91, after suffering a fall of 7% in the last week. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Eyes Big Jump During Presale
<p class="s6">The ecosystem and dominance of the crypto market are expanding at a fast pace. The number of crypto traders is expected to cross 994 million in the next four years. Tradecurve, a new Web3 platform, is tapping this huge market with an ingenious business roadmap and platform.</p>
<p class="s6">It is expected to emerge as one of the world&rsquo;s top three trading exchanges. It is a blockchain-based trading platform that enables users to access a wide range of assets, enjoy complete anonymity, and trade at lower fees.</p>
<p class="s6">The trading platforms currently available in the market are either dedicated to only cryptocurrencies (Huobi and KuCoin), or exclusively deal with the trade of conventional derivatives (TD Ameritrade). </p>
<p class="s6">But Tradecurve (TCRV) allows the trading of cryptocurrencies, stocks, Forex, commodities, ETFs, bonds, and more, on the same platform, and from a single account.</p>
<p class="s6">Its presale is currently live, and the price of TCRV tokens is set at $0.025 (up a huge 150% already). It is predicted to increase by 80x during the presale phase, and 100x after being listed on Uniswap and multiple CEXs.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">After the collapse of the FTX Exchange, and the bankruptcy of big banks like Silvergate Capital and Silicon Valley Bank, investors have become skeptical about most crypto projects, including Litecoin (LTC) and Binance (BNB). Hence, they have started to shift toward Tradecurve(TCRV), a new crypto project.</p>
<p class="s5">Investors in these projects have been on the losing side for quite a long time. Due to its novel features and huge growth potential, Tradecurve has been able to attract thousands of investors, who are looking at the project for long-term growth.</p>

Litecoin (LTC) Sees Increase In Trade Volume
<p class="s5">Litecoin (LTC) recently received positive support after the US regulators termed it a commodity. The development has come as a major relief for Litecoin, which is awaiting a halving event. It is also an encouraging development for the Litecoin community as the token is still 79% down from its peak price of $412.96.</p>
<p class="s5">Besides, Litecoin earlier launched its Litecoin Card Program across Europe to increase its adoption rate. This has benefited Litecoin as the number of transactions on the platform has seen an uptick in the past month. Subsequently, the price of Litecoin has witnessed a rise of 9% in the last month. Currently, Litecoin is changing hands at $86.22.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Binance (BNB) Accused of Serious Irregularities
<p class="s5">The US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a lawsuit against Binance(BNB) that could have serious repercussions on the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance has been falling on the price chart for the past many days. The trading price of Binancehas fallen by over 1% in the last week.</p>
<p class="s5">As a result, Binance is currently available to trade at $329.15. According to the lawsuit, Binancehas flouted many regulations, including those related to anti-money laundering and KYC. Along with Binance exchange, its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has also been named in the lawsuit. Market analysts believe if the charges against Binance are proven, the exchange could cease to exist in the market.</p>

Tradecurve (TCRV) Brings New Excitement to the Market
<p class="s5">There are nearly 600 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, but none of them are as inclusive as Tradecurve (TCRV), which is a new Web3 trading platform. It is an all-in-one platform that facilitates the trading of cryptocurrencies, OTC derivatives, stocks, bonds, CFDs, Forex, and other commodities, on a single interface.</p>
<p class="s5">Notably, the FX market is the world&rsquo;s largest single market with a daily trading volume of $7.5 trillion. Besides, revenue in the cryptocurrency market is projected to amount to $37.87 billion in 2023. Given such a massive market base, the project has become a favorite investment destination of market bulls.</p>
<p class="s5">Unlike existing crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, which require users to be verified and disclose their personal data, Tradecurve helps people finalize trades without the KYC process. It ensures the anonymity and privacy of users using DeFi capabilities. </p>
<p class="s5">TCRV token holders will receive a range of benefits, such as discounts and staking rewards. The project has begun its presale with an initial price of $0.018. Market pundits forecast that TCRV&rsquo;s price is set to increase by80x by the end of the presale phase. </p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, if you lock your tokens now, you can bag a 100x profit by the end of 2023. Interestingly, Tradecurve&rsquo;s presale growth projections are significantly higher than that of Binance and Huobi. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Uwerx is a soon-to-launch blockchain-based freelance project that has quickly become the most sought-after project by investors. Since the start of its presale, Uwerx's innovative features have propelled it forward. </p>
<p class="s5">The project has continued to sell out fast at each presale, leading the developers to increase the token allocations to accommodate more users. </p>
<p class="s5">This article will examine Uwerx's success and highlight what analysts predict for Cosmos Hub (ATOM) and &nbsp;Gala (GALA). </p>
Can Uwerx (WERX) Continue On Its Winning Path?
<p class="s5">Despite being only two months into its presale, Uwerx has recorded huge wins. These wins have attracted 5,546 signups, 1,620 Twitter followers, and 1,685 Telegram members to the project. Priced at just $0.041/WERX, Uwerx has become a great opportunity for investors to make massive profits in the coin market. </p>
<p class="s5">The project is gearing up to run a test airdrop which experts believe will further engage Uwerxholders. This test airdrop was voted for by 98.2% of the Uwerx community, and the Uwerx team considers it a means to ensure that users entered the correct Receiving Wallet addresses.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale exceeded everyone's expectations, leading the Uwerx team to modify the project's token allocation. Uwerx now offers 57% of the 750 million total token supply, representing 427,500,000 tokens. The team also increased the project's launch price to $0.095 - $0.115. </p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale success is primarily due to the agile methodology approach that its developers adopted. It allowed them to release Uwerx in stages while making improvements with time.</p>
<p class="s5">Committed to serving its community, the Uwerx team locked developers' liquidity for 25 years on June 7, 2023, following 82.8% of the Uwerx community voting for it.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx aims to revolutionize the freelance industry by offering decentralization and low transaction fees at a 1% rate compared to traditional freelance platforms. It will offer transparent pricing, innovative earning opportunities, collaborative tools, and faster transactions. These features have set Uwerx apart and positioned it as the best option in the ever-growing freelancing industry. </p>
<p class="s5">According to a 2022 Forbes survey, 80% of U.S. employees are attracted to freelancing. This suggests that the freelance market will receive an influx of new freelancers, and Uwerx aims to get a huge share of that market.</p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx team also introduced a feature called the Uwerx Vault. This feature allows users to save WERX tokens for a desired period. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Uwerx has already launched the Alpha Version of its platform, giving users access to some of its key features, including the Landing, Sign-up, Login, Forgot Password, Hiring Dashboard, Freelancer/Client Initiation, The Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step of Finding Talent, My Activity, and Job Creation Process pages. </p>
<p class="s5">The team has announced that they will be launching additional functionalities soon. This has caused excitement among users already anticipating the release of the platform's Beta version. Additionally, the latest news that the team will introduce referral bonuses soon has added to investors' excitement.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx urges users to share their suggestions and recommendations through the dedicated email address feedback@uwerx.network. This will enable users to contribute to enhancing the platform.</p>
Investors Are Unsure If Cosmos Hub (ATOM) Will Rise Again
<p class="s5">Since 2021, Cosmos Hub (ATOM) has been making considerable progress in the coin market. However, the project has been falling in the last one month. Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is trading at $10.21, representing a -21.51 decline in the past month. The story has been the same for the last seven days as Cosmos Hub (ATOM) declined by -6.79. </p>
<p class="s5">The main aim of Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is to facilitate faster, cheaper and more scalable transactions. The project focuses on sovereignty and sustainability and facilitates interoperability between blockchains. </p>
<p class="s5">Cosmos Hub (ATOM) recorded important partnerships last month, notably with Stride. This partnership with Stride saw Cosmos Hub (ATOM) taking home 15% of STRD inflationary staking rewards, 15% of transaction fees and 15% of MEV revenue. </p>
<p class="s5">As Cosmos Hub (ATOM) enters the second week of June, holders expect more partnerships which could drive the price of Cosmos Hub up. Analysts predict the project will trade at $19.31 by the second quarter of 2024. </p>
How Will Gala (GALA) Perform This Month
<p class="s5">Last month was an eventful one for Gala (GALA). The project released the second version of the GALA token, which brought in more investors. Gala (GALA) also partnered with BitkubAcademy to develop educational content in the Web 3.0 industry. They also conducted the V2 airdrop and burned almost 21 billion GALA (GALA) tokens worth more than $637 million. These moves put investors' minds at ease and renewed their trust in the Gala (GALA) project. </p>
<p class="s5">Also in May, Gala Games partnered with PokerGo to build a Web3 social poker game. Gala (GALA) holders believe this partnership will lead to more exposure for Gala (GALA). </p>
<p class="s5">Despite these developments, Gala (GALA) entered the month of June declining in price. The project decreased by -37.8% in the last month. Gala (GALA) trades at $0.028, representing a 4.82% increase in the past 24hrs. Analysts predict the project will reach $0.051 by the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">This prediction is very little compared to what analysts predict for Uwerx. They are convinced that Uwerx has what it takes to surpass $2.50 by January 2024. As such, many investors are rushing to buy WERX tokens for the low price of $0.05245. </p>
<p class="s5">Knowing that the project has undergone InterFi Network and SolidProof audits, investors are confident that their funds are safe.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Uwerx is a soon-to-launch blockchain-based freelance project that has quickly become the most sought-after project by investors. Since the start of its presale, Uwerx's innovative features have propelled it forward. </p>
<p class="s5">The project has continued to sell out fast at each presale, leading the developers to increase the token allocations to accommodate more users. </p>
<p class="s5">This article will examine Uwerx's success and highlight what analysts predict for Cosmos Hub (ATOM) and &nbsp;Gala (GALA). </p>
Can Uwerx (WERX) Continue On Its Winning Path?
<p class="s5">Despite being only two months into its presale, Uwerx has recorded huge wins. These wins have attracted 5,546 signups, 1,620 Twitter followers, and 1,685 Telegram members to the project. Priced at just $0.041/WERX, Uwerx has become a great opportunity for investors to make massive profits in the coin market. </p>
<p class="s5">The project is gearing up to run a test airdrop which experts believe will further engage Uwerxholders. This test airdrop was voted for by 98.2% of the Uwerx community, and the Uwerx team considers it a means to ensure that users entered the correct Receiving Wallet addresses.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale exceeded everyone's expectations, leading the Uwerx team to modify the project's token allocation. Uwerx now offers 57% of the 750 million total token supply, representing 427,500,000 tokens. The team also increased the project's launch price to $0.095 - $0.115. </p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale success is primarily due to the agile methodology approach that its developers adopted. It allowed them to release Uwerx in stages while making improvements with time.</p>
<p class="s5">Committed to serving its community, the Uwerx team locked developers' liquidity for 25 years on June 7, 2023, following 82.8% of the Uwerx community voting for it.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx aims to revolutionize the freelance industry by offering decentralization and low transaction fees at a 1% rate compared to traditional freelance platforms. It will offer transparent pricing, innovative earning opportunities, collaborative tools, and faster transactions. These features have set Uwerx apart and positioned it as the best option in the ever-growing freelancing industry. </p>
<p class="s5">According to a 2022 Forbes survey, 80% of U.S. employees are attracted to freelancing. This suggests that the freelance market will receive an influx of new freelancers, and Uwerx aims to get a huge share of that market.</p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx team also introduced a feature called the Uwerx Vault. This feature allows users to save WERX tokens for a desired period. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Uwerx has already launched the Alpha Version of its platform, giving users access to some of its key features, including the Landing, Sign-up, Login, Forgot Password, Hiring Dashboard, Freelancer/Client Initiation, The Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step of Finding Talent, My Activity, and Job Creation Process pages. </p>
<p class="s5">The team has announced that they will be launching additional functionalities soon. This has caused excitement among users already anticipating the release of the platform's Beta version. Additionally, the latest news that the team will introduce referral bonuses soon has added to investors' excitement.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx urges users to share their suggestions and recommendations through the dedicated email address feedback@uwerx.network. This will enable users to contribute to enhancing the platform.</p>
Investors Are Unsure If Cosmos Hub (ATOM) Will Rise Again
<p class="s5">Since 2021, Cosmos Hub (ATOM) has been making considerable progress in the coin market. However, the project has been falling in the last one month. Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is trading at $10.21, representing a -21.51 decline in the past month. The story has been the same for the last seven days as Cosmos Hub (ATOM) declined by -6.79. </p>
<p class="s5">The main aim of Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is to facilitate faster, cheaper and more scalable transactions. The project focuses on sovereignty and sustainability and facilitates interoperability between blockchains. </p>
<p class="s5">Cosmos Hub (ATOM) recorded important partnerships last month, notably with Stride. This partnership with Stride saw Cosmos Hub (ATOM) taking home 15% of STRD inflationary staking rewards, 15% of transaction fees and 15% of MEV revenue. </p>
<p class="s5">As Cosmos Hub (ATOM) enters the second week of June, holders expect more partnerships which could drive the price of Cosmos Hub up. Analysts predict the project will trade at $19.31 by the second quarter of 2024. </p>
How Will Gala (GALA) Perform This Month
<p class="s5">Last month was an eventful one for Gala (GALA). The project released the second version of the GALA token, which brought in more investors. Gala (GALA) also partnered with BitkubAcademy to develop educational content in the Web 3.0 industry. They also conducted the V2 airdrop and burned almost 21 billion GALA (GALA) tokens worth more than $637 million. These moves put investors' minds at ease and renewed their trust in the Gala (GALA) project. </p>
<p class="s5">Also in May, Gala Games partnered with PokerGo to build a Web3 social poker game. Gala (GALA) holders believe this partnership will lead to more exposure for Gala (GALA). </p>
<p class="s5">Despite these developments, Gala (GALA) entered the month of June declining in price. The project decreased by -37.8% in the last month. Gala (GALA) trades at $0.028, representing a 4.82% increase in the past 24hrs. Analysts predict the project will reach $0.051 by the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">This prediction is very little compared to what analysts predict for Uwerx. They are convinced that Uwerx has what it takes to surpass $2.50 by January 2024. As such, many investors are rushing to buy WERX tokens for the low price of $0.05245. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With another rate hike universally expected to be announced on Wednesday, will this be the cue for bitcoin and crypto to take another leg down?</p>
A quarter percent rate rise
<p>The next FOMC meeting opens today, when the Federal Reserve board of governors and reserve bank presidents get together to review monetary policy and to decide whether yet another interest rate hike is necessary.</p>
<p>The market is expecting a nailed-on 0.25 basis point rate hike given that the CME Fedwatch tool is showing a 98.9% probability of such a move. Most market analysts, including the Fed itself are predicting one more rise this year, and then the hiking could well be finished for this cycle.</p>
Jobs market too strong
<p>Even though inflation looks to be coming down strongly, and is even approaching the Fed&rsquo;s target of 2%, Chairman Jerome Powell points to the robust labour market as a sign that the battle is not yet won. It would appear that many more businesses need to go to the wall, and Americans need to lose their jobs at a far faster rate in order to stop them spending and supposedly adding upwards pressure to inflation.</p>
The Fed&rsquo;s reactive policy
<p>Powell has his work cut out once again. Keeping a straight face as he announces the Fed&rsquo;s policy for the next few months cannot be easy. History has shown that the Fed is always late with its tightening or easing, and then it always carries on for far too long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, such is the nature of our debt-based monetary system and that we give an organisation like the Federal Reserve the power to try and manipulate markets in one direction or the other, rather than leaving it to the markets to balance things out.</p>
<p>So, the Fed will press on with another rate hike, and will look to implement one more before the end of the year. In the Fed&rsquo;s view this will be enough to act as a drag on the jobs market and will help to bring inflation down to its target.</p>
Crypto waits for liquidity or a spark
<p>It appears that crypto might have to wait a bit longer before the lifeblood of liquidity comes back into the market and provides the stimulus for the rest of the current bull market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That Bitcoin will be one of the main beneficiaries is very likely. A Bitcoin Spot ETF approval can of course provide the spark that sends crypto on its next leg higher. Be that as it may, in the short term, as rates go higher, the crypto market could have its work cut out to move out of the current doldrums it has been in for the last month.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Japan's Web3 strategy is likely to influence other nations' approaches to embracing the digital revolution.</p>
Corporate Partnership To Expand Metaverse Economic Zone
<p>Japan is set to embrace Web3 technology with the backing of major companies like Fujitsu and Mitsubishi. In a significant partnership, these companies are joining forces to create the necessary infrastructure for an open metaverse and to support Japan's Web3 strategy.</p>
<p>Fujitsu, along with nine other firms, has revealed plans to establish an interoperable metaverse structure known as RYUGUKOKU (TBD). The primary objective of this structure is to expand the Japan Metaverse Economic Zone, enabling a seamless virtual world experience.</p>
Establishing An Interoperable Metaverse&nbsp;
<p>The scope of this initiative goes beyond just entertainment and gaming. It also aims to provide a framework for corporations to leverage Web3 marketing effectively. As part of the project, prominent players such as automobile manufacturer Mitsubishi and global bank Mizuho have also stepped in, highlighting the broad support for the country's Web3 ambitions.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has been actively promoting the adoption of emerging technologies, and Web3 is no exception. By embracing decentralized systems, blockchain, and virtual reality, Japan seeks to position itself at the forefront of technological innovation.</p>
<p>The concept of an open metaverse holds promise in transforming various industries, from entertainment and gaming to commerce and finance. As the world moves towards a more interconnected and digitized future, creating a virtual space where users can interact seamlessly becomes increasingly vital.</p>
Japan&rsquo;s Revised Web3 Policy
<p>The country has already published a whitepaper earlier this year, recommending widespread Web3 adoption. On top of that, the National Tax Agency (NTA) has revised its corporate tax rules to provide a 30% tax exemption to companies issuing cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These web3-friendly policies have raised some questions as the company had tightened regulations in the wake of major hacks like Mt. Gox and Coincheck. Initially poised to become a crypto capital, Japan's regulatory landscape changed drastically after the hacks. It was extremely challenging even to list new tokens on Japanese crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the nation took decisive steps to enhance security measures, requiring the separation of customer and exchange assets, with most exchange assets stored in cold wallets. As a result, when FTX faced a crisis, Japan's regulations proved effective, ensuring the potential return of Japanese customer assets. These lessons from past emergencies have empowered Japan's regulatory approach, making it more knowledgeable and resilient in crypto.</p>
<p>Experts predict that the global Web3 market will witness exponential growth in the coming years, and Japan intends to position itself strategically to harness its benefits fully. As the infrastructure takes shape and the metaverse expands, Japan's Web3 strategy is likely to influence other nations' approaches to embracing the digital revolution.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Russia's bill regarding the digital ruble is now signed into law and will take effect on August 1, 2023.</p>
Russia&rsquo;s CBDC Legislation Finally Signed into Law
<p>Russia moves forward with the launch of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), digital ruble, thus taking a step towards crypto regulation in the country.</p>
<p>The digital ruble legislation bill was first introduced to the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the State Duma, in December 2022. The bill passed its first reading in March 2023 and its third final reading on July 11, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 24, Russia&rsquo;s president Vladimir Putin finally signed the CBDC bill into law which is scheduled to come into force on August 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The new law introduces amendments to several articles of the Russian Federation Civil Code. According to the law, the digital ruble will be treated as a means of cashless payment. Russia&rsquo;s central bank will be the main entity responsible for the digital ruble&rsquo;s infrastructure and the safety of the stored assets.</p>
How the Digital Ruble Is Expected to Work
<p>The digital ruble is primarily designed to be a means of payment or a money transfer method and not aimed at investment purposes. Russia&rsquo;s central bank reported that transfers and payments in digital rubles will be free for regular citizens, although corporate clients will have to pay 0.3% of the payment amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authorities have referred to the digital ruble as a &ldquo;new opportunity for citizens and businesses&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s also important to note that the use of the new currency in the country will be completely voluntary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is going to force anyone into the digital ruble. Its use is absolutely voluntary, it is an additional opportunity for people: they can use it if they want to.&rdquo; &ndash; said the governor of Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina.</p>

<p>The government authorities previously reported that trials of the CBDC were to be run in collaboration with 13 local banks that have passed the necessary technical stages of preparation. The digital ruble wallet and transfers should be available in any of the Russian banks&rsquo; mobile apps, although all the operations will be carried out by the Central Bank itself.</p>
<p>The Bank of Russia highlights the reliability, security, and efficiency of the CBDC operations thanks to their centralized regulation.</p>
<p>Olga Skorobogatova, the Bank of Russia&rsquo;s deputy governor, compared the digital ruble to other digital assets:</p>

<p> "the digital ruble is not a cryptocurrency or a stablecoin, where either there is no issuer, or it is not clear who it is."</p>

<p>The mass adoption of the digital ruble in Russia is expected in 2025-2027. The CBDC could be a way to avoid sanctions against Russia imposed by the West when making cross-border payments. It could also be part of the effort to regulate the use of digital assets in the country.</p>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Binance rolls out new intermediate-level courses.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Learners receive an NFT certificate upon completion of each course.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the launch of its successful beginner-level program in late 2022, Binance Academy, the education arm of the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, announced the launch of the free-to-learn intermediate-level courses this Tuesday. The courses aim to extend learning about Web 3 and crypto fundamentals and provide learners with an NFT certificate upon completion.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Changpeng Zhao and other defendants associated with the Binance crypto exchange plan to appeal to the court to dismiss a lawsuit from the United States commodities regulator.</p>
Binance&rsquo;s Appeal To Dismiss
<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and its former Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim have revealed that they will be filing motions with the court seeking permission to dismiss a prior complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the July 24 filing to the Illinois District Court, the defendants, which consist of multiple entities from the Binance ecosystem, have claimed that they will be filing two separate motions to counter the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint and appeal for its dismissal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC's lawsuit against Binance was filed on March 27, 2023, and the defendants are required to respond latest by July 27, 2023. In its latest filing, the Foreign Binance Entities, which includes CZ, has revealed intentions to file a joint Motion to Dismiss, while Samuel Lim plans to file a separate motion and incorporate parts of the motion filed by the other defendants.</p>
Binance Seeks To Exceed Page Limit Rule
<p>The defendants are also seeking to exceed the 15-page limit rule on the brief as they claim that they made every effort to adhere to this limit but contend that due to the intricacy of the CFTC's complaint and the multiple arguments they wish to present, their Memoranda of Law is likely to surpass the given page restriction.</p>
<p>The filing reads,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the complexity of the CFTC&rsquo;s Complaint and the number of arguments Defendants anticipate making in support of their Motions to Dismiss, Defendants anticipate that their Memoranda of Law in support of the two motions will exceed the fifteen-page limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In their motion, the defendants requested the court's permission to collectively use up to 50 pages for both Memoranda of Law. This proposed limit is 25 pages less than what the defendants would be entitled to under Local Rule 7.1 if each of them separately moved to dismiss the CFTC's complaint.&nbsp;</p>
CFTC&rsquo;s Complaint
<p>Notably, the CFTC has agreed not to oppose this request, as confirmed by discussions between both parties' counsels. While the court has yet to issue a ruling on their motion, the cooperation from the CFTC's counsel indicates a willingness to accommodate the defendants' request.</p>
<p>The regulatory body had accused Binance and Zhao of violating derivatives regulations and engaging in unregistered trading activities in the United States. The complaint alleged that Binance had strategically expanded its US presence despite publicly claiming to block or restrict access for US customers. CZ responded to the lawsuit, expressing surprise and disappointment, stating that it had been actively cooperating with the agency for over two years.</p>
<p>As the July 27 deadline for the response approaches, market participants are keenly observing the developments in this case, as its outcome may have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Middle Eastern crypto exchange Rain, backed by Coinbase, announced that its Abu Dhabi unit secured a license to offer crypto brokerage and custody services in the UAE.</p>
<p>According to reports by Reuters, Rain, a Middle Eastern crypto exchange based in Bahrain, and backed by Coinbase, announced today its Abu Dhabi unit secured a &ldquo;license to operate a virtual assets brokerage and custody service for clients in the United Arab Emirates.&rdquo;</p>
Rain Expands Offerings into UAE
<p>Obtaining the license means that Rain&rsquo;s unit based in the Abu Dhabi Global Market financial free zone may now offer institutional and a limited number of retail clients in the UAE services to buy, sell, and store their virtual assets.</p>
<p>Yehia Badawy, Rain&rsquo;s co-founder, said in an interview with Reuters that the license further allows the exchange to open a bank account in the UAE and permits its clients in the region to fund their own accounts provided they use a local payment network.</p>
<p>Badawy noted that local asset managers have been reluctant to work with crypto firms who do not have domestic operating licenses but said they would now confidently deal with such firms. He further stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can capture more demand from institutional investors using this licence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Badawy founded Rain with three partners in 2017 with the backing and support of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>Rain has seen significant growth after it raised $110 million in a Series B funding round in 2022, placing the firm&rsquo;s value at $500 million. The firm indicated that the funds were earmarked for regional expansion.</p>
Growing Number of Crypto Firms Attracted to UAE
<p>The current crisis and regulatory uncertainty in the US prompted many crypto-related firms to explore other regions to expand to, and the UAE appears to be a popular option.</p>
<p>Binance recently said it was considering a move to Dubai due to the UAE&rsquo;s pro-crypto stance and policies. Alex Chehade, Binance Dubai&rsquo;s General Manager, said the region is a prime destination for crypto businesses.</p>
<p>The US-based crypto exchange Gemini also said it would &ldquo;soon&rdquo; start the process of obtaining a crypto service license for customers in the UAE. Gemini cited &ldquo;hostility and [a] lack of clarity&rdquo; on US regulations as motivation for its decision.</p>
<p>Coinbase also believes that the UAE is an attractive region for establishing its business amid ongoing difficulties with US regulators. The exchange expressed its interest in establishing an international hub in the UAE with its CEO Brian Armstrong, who believes that the country is well positioned to expand and serve the market in Africa, Asia, and, naturally, the Middle East. Armstrong also praised the country for its &ldquo;forward-thinking&rdquo; approach to crypto regulation.</p>

<p>The US-based crypto exchange Gemini also said it would &ldquo;soon&rdquo; start the process of obtaining a crypto service license for customers in the UAE. Gemini cited &ldquo;hostility and [a] lack of clarity&rdquo; on US regulations as motivation for its decision.</p>
<p>Coinbase also believes that the UAE is an attractive region for establishing its business amid ongoing difficulties with US regulators. The exchange expressed its interest in establishing an international hub in the UAE with its CEO Brian Armstrong, who believes that the country is well positioned to expand and serve the market in Africa, Asia, and, naturally, the Middle East. Armstrong also praised the country for its &ldquo;forward-thinking&rdquo; approach to crypto regulation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The highly controversial Arkham Intel Exchange has approved its first-ever bounty hunt, with crypto sleuths set to go after crypto wallets belonging to Terra co-founder Do Kwon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Do Kwon currently languishing in a Montenegrin jail, crypto users have long been trying to seek out any information regarding his crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Deanonymizing The Blockchain&rdquo;
<p>The Arkham Intel Exchange is a highly controversial platform, acting as a marketplace that facilitates the trading of on-chain data. The platform recently approved its first-ever bounty submission after two crypto sleuths found evidence of crypto wallets belonging to Do Kwon. An anonymous user, along with a pseudo-anonymous Twitter user going by the name of @ErgoBTC, were paid around 9500 ARKM tokens, worth around $5000 for their submission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Arkham Intel Exchange now has its first approved submission: new evidence of wallets owned by Do Kwon / Terraform Labs. An anonymous on-chain sleuth and @ErgoBTC were the successful bounty hunters.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It further added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expanded labels for the LFG BTC address activity after running off with funds intended for the defense of the UST depeg have been added to Arkham as a part of their bounty program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Arkham Intel, the anonymous user and Ergo sent the platform considerable evidence they had found wallets owned by Do Kwon and Terra. Ergo stated this evidence contradicts public statements made by Terra that it holds only one Luna Foundation Guard wallet. Luna Foundation Guard stated that 80,081 BTC, which comprised over 99% of its reserves, had exited the fund. LFG had claimed that the reason behind the sale of the crypto asset was to shore up and support the overall health of the Terra ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
ErgoBTC&rsquo;s Findings&nbsp;
<p>Ergo shared further details about his research, which was first made public in October when the Luna Foundation Guard claimed it had only one Bitcoin wallet containing 313 BTC. Ergo had written at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While it may be true that this is the only formally &lsquo;declared&rsquo; wallet controlled by the LFG, they seem to have failed to account for the trail of bread crumbs left by the change outputs used to fund their new declared wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crypto sleuth continued to track the funds over the next few months and noted that they were moving even after Do Kwon&rsquo;s arrest in March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kwon may have been rolled up for faking a passport. But LFG and the BTC are still moving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wallet being tracked has been officially christened &ldquo;Terraform Labs&rdquo; on the Arkham Intel Exchange and currently holds around $160 million worth of crypto, out of which around $153 million is in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
The Arkham Intel Exchange&nbsp;
<p>The Arkham Intel Exchange was launched on the 10th of July to generally negative reactions by members of the crypto space, with most describing it as a glorified snitching service. Many in the crypto space have also stated that the platform could be used to dox innocent individuals. Users on the platform can place bounties for information related to blockchain transactions, which would then be released to the public within 90 days following approval from the platform. Going by this timeline, information about the Do Kwon and Terra wallets could be available in the public domain sometime in October.&nbsp;</p>
The Terra Collapse&nbsp;
<p>The Terra collapse was one of the most crippling events in the history of crypto when the collapse of its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its cryptocurrency LUNA triggered chaos in the market. Following TerraUSD&rsquo;s de-pegging and the ecosystem&rsquo;s collapse, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Do Kwon with securities violations for selling unregistered transactions of crypto asset securities. He was also charged for failing to provide truthful disclosures and providing investors with misleading information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kwon&rsquo;s whereabouts were unknown until March 2023, when he was apprehended by authorities in Montenegro and was sentenced to four months in prison for traveling using forged travel papers. Several other individuals connected to Terra are also under investigation by authorities in South Korea. Recently, co-founder Hin Hyun-seong had his first hearing for charges related to illegal profits from the sale of LUNA tokens.&nbsp;</p>
