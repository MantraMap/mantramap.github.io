According to industry reports, the Chinese gold industry managed to recover its extraction levels, reaching numbers it saw before the Covid pandemic, with the country engaging in a record streak of purchasing gold during the last five months.</strong></p>
<h2>China Recovers Gold Production Levels During Q1</h2>
<p>China managed to ramp up its gold extraction levels during the first quarter of 2023. Chinese companies have seen their production efforts rewarded during Q1 2023, as large mines managed to recover their numbers to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>According to reports from the Gold Association of China quoted by Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, gold mines operated by the biggest mining companies in China produced 32.72 tons of the precious metal during Q1 2023, almost half of the gold produced in the country during that period.</p>
<p>China is regarded as the top gold producer in the world, <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/chinas-2022-gold-output-climbs-consumption-weakens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">producing</a> 372 tons of gold in 2022, per China&#8217;s Gold Association numbers, defying the pessimistic projections of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258175/gold-output-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that pointed to a decline in this activity due to Covid complications, amidst other factors. However, last year&#8217;s numbers are far from the 453.5 tons produced by China in 2016, the highest number in its history.</p>

<h2>Central Banks Keep Buying Gold</h2>
<p>The recovery of the Chinese gold output is key for the country in a market where central banks have kept gold demand high. In March, the World Gold Council <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-banks-continue-to-show-strong-demand-for-gold-in-2023-says-world-gold-council-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that central banks will likely keep buying gold this year, adding to their reserves even if the purchases do not reach the record levels registered during 2022.</p>
<p>Much of this demand is coming from China, which has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-keeps-stockpiling-gold-adds-18-tons-in-march-to-reach-2068-tons-in-national-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> more than 100 tons of gold to its coffers during a five-month buying streak. China&#8217;s national gold reserve is estimated to be comprised of 2,068 tons. However, the biggest <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/turkey-central-bank-draws-down-gold-reserves-to-meet-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buyer</a> of gold last year was the central bank of Turkey.</p>
<p>Analysts have speculated that this gold rush might be related to the recent de-dollarization movement that certain countries have been pushing in world markets. Reserves held by central banks in U.S. dollars <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/global-reserves-held-in-us-dollars-fell-to-less-than-50-official-states-it-has-become-a-toxic-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell</a> to 47% in 2022, something that is being interpreted by some as a flight to safety to other currencies and gold amidst a geopolitical climate of uncertainty regarding dollar-based sanctions. Jan Nieuwenhuijs, a gold market analyst, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/analyst-predicts-gold-prices-might-exceed-8000-in-the-next-decade-as-central-banks-lose-confidence-in-foreign-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anticipated</a> this flight to safety might take the price of a troy ounce of gold to $8,000 as banks convert historic levels of reserves to the precious metal.</p>

<h2>Putin on Multipolarity Trend Escalating</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin talked about a global trend towards multipolarity at a recent meeting of the Council for Local Self-Government Development. Putin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This trend — the trend toward multipolarity in the world — is inevitable. It will only intensify. And those who do not understand this and do not follow this trend will lose.</p></blockquote>
<p>“It is an absolutely obvious fact. It is as obvious as the sunrise. Nothing can be done about it. Those who try to prevent this will only face additional problems that they already have,&#8221; the Russian president added.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov quoted Putin while addressing participants of the World Online Conference on Multipolarity in Moscow. Representatives from political, public, and academic circles from several dozen countries were brought together by the forum. The official opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The attempts to establish a unipolar world order with a sole decision-making center in Washington have failed. Today, the movement towards global multipolarity is a fact, a geopolitical reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We see new global centers, primarily in Eurasia, the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America grow and achieve impressive success in various fields, relying on their independence, state sovereignty, and cultural and civilizational identity,” Lavrov detailed.</p>
<p>The Russian foreign minister continued, “The facts speak for themselves,” elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past three decades, the share of the G7 countries in the global economy has significantly decreased while the influence of emerging markets is growing steadily.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We are witnessing the continued transformation of the structure of international relations. A striking example of multipolar diplomacy is the work of multilateral associations of a new type, such as the SCO [Shanghai Cooperation Organization] and BRICS,” he noted. “They bring together member countries with different political and economic systems with distinct values and civilizational platforms, which effectively cooperate in various fields.” The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Last week, Putin said that the actions of the elites in the U.S. and Europe will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-us-policies-will-backfire-russia-to-expand-relations-with-countries-in-eurasia-africa-latin-america/">backfire</a> on them, emphasizing that they do not always act in the best interest of their own people. He also said that Russia is focusing on strengthening its partnerships with friendly nations and collaborating with foreign partners.</p>

<h2>U.S. Debt Default Could Happen by June 1, Says Yellen</h2>
<p>United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen warned Monday that the U.S. government may default on its debt by June 1, which is earlier than the government and Wall Street had expected. In a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Yellen wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>After reviewing recent federal tax receipts, our best estimate is that we will be unable to continue to satisfy all of the government&#8217;s obligations by early June, and potentially as early as June 1, if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.</p></blockquote>
<p>She clarified that the Treasury Department’s estimate of when it could default on the government&#8217;s debt obligations is “based on currently available data,” noting that “It is impossible to predict with certainty the exact date when Treasury will be unable to pay the government&#8217;s bills.”</p>
<p>However, she stressed that based on the current projections, “It is imperative that Congress act as soon as possible to increase or suspend the debt limit in a way that provides longer-term certainty that the government will continue to make its payments.”</p>
<p>Emphasizing that “waiting until the last minute&#8221; to take action &#8220;can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,” Yellen warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, it would cause severe hardship to American families, harm our global leadership position, and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Congressional Budget Office Similarly Estimates U.S. Debt Default Could Happen in June</h2>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has also revised its estimate of when the U.S. government could default on its debt obligations. The federal agency announced Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because tax receipts through April have been less than the Congressional Budget Office anticipated in February, we now estimate that there is a significantly greater risk that the Treasury will run out of funds in early June.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Monday, President Joe Biden called McCarthy and three other congressional leaders — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries — to invite them to a meeting on May 9 at the White House to discuss the debt limit, a White House official told NBC.</p>
<p>Yellen warned last week that the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations &#8220;would produce an economic and financial catastrophe,&#8221; emphasizing that it &#8220;would raise the cost of borrowing into perpetuity&#8221; and &#8220;future investments would become substantially more costly.&#8221;</p>

The court has also ordered Steynberg to pay a civil monetary penalty of a similar amount. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) conceded that orders requiring payment of funds &#8220;may not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>&#8216;Largest Fraudulent Scheme Involving Bitcoin&#8217; in the History of the CFTC</h2>
<p>A United States Federal Court recently handed down a default judgment and permanent injunction against Johann Steynberg, the CEO of the now-defunct bitcoin ponzi Mirror Trading International (MTI). According to a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8696-23">statement</a> released by the U.S. derivatives regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on April 27, Steynberg is required to pay $1,733,838,372 in restitution to defrauded victims and a $1,733,838,372 civil monetary penalty.</p>
<p>The derivatives regulator’s statement also revealed that the penalty handed down by the court &#8220;is [the] highest civil monetary penalty ordered in any CFTC case.&#8221; The court action itself is reported to be the &#8220;largest fraudulent scheme involving Bitcoin charged in any CFTC case.&#8221;</p>
<p>As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, Steynberg, who was based in South Africa at the time, had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-african-regulators-probe-into-mirror-trading-international-unearths-undeclared-losses-missing-bitcoins/">repeatedly</a> faced allegations of operating a bitcoin Ponzi scheme before he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ceo-of-mti-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-flees-south-africa-in-a-possible-exit-scam-funds-blocked/">fled</a> to Brazil in December 2020. Shortly after his disappearance, liquidation proceedings against MTI were instituted by victims based in South Africa.</p>
<p>Almost a year after he disappeared, Steinberg was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ceo-of-mirror-trading-international-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-arrested-in-brazil/">captured</a> by Brazilian law enforcement and is awaiting his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mti-mastermind-arrest-lawyer-points-to-agreement-relating-to-johann-steynbergs-extradition-to-south-africa/">extradition</a> to either the U.S. or his native home of South Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Steynberg and MTI Failed to Comply With CPO Regulations</h2>
<p>As per the CFTC statement, the U.S. court order outlines Steynberg’s alleged fraudulent activities as well as his failure to comply with regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The order finds that Steynberg, the founder and CEO of Mirror Trading International Proprietary Limited (MTI), a company currently in liquidation in the Republic of South Africa, is liable for fraud in connection with retail foreign currency (forex) transactions, fraud by an associated person of a commodity pool operator (CPO), registration violations, and failure to comply with CPO regulations,&#8221; reads the CFTC statement.</p>
<p>Although MTI was primarily operating and targeting victims based in South Africa, the CFTC statement claimed that Steynberg and his company had accepted bitcoin from &#8220;some 23,000 individuals in the U.S.&#8221; without being &#8220;registered as a CPO as required.&#8221; The regulator also alleged that Steynberg and MTI had &#8220;misappropriated all of the Bitcoin they accepted from pool participants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CFTC also acknowledged in the statement that the penalty handed down by the court may &#8220;not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.&#8221;</p>

The bitcoin mining firm, on May 1, 2023, unveiled its plans to set up its miners at the new location by Q3 of this year, with an aim to raise the operation&#8217;s hashpower by 1 exahash per second (EH/s). </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Miner Mawson Acquires 24 MW in Ohio With Room for Expansion</h2>
<p>On May 1, 2023, Mawson Infrastructure Group <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230501005454/en/Mawson-Infrastructure-Group-Inc.-Signs-New-24MW-Site-in-Ohio---Full-24MW-Online-in-Q3-2023">revealed</a> it has signed an agreement for a new site in Ohio. This development comes on the heels of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mawson-infrastructure-group-launches-bitcoin-mining-operation-in-pennsylvania-exits-australia/">prior ventures</a> in Pennsylvania and the decision to pull out of Australia.</p>
<p>The new mining site, located in Ohio, is expected to offer a starting capacity of 24 MW. Mawson, however, anticipates expanding its operations to harness an additional 26 MW of power, effectively bringing the total capacity of the site to 50 MW.</p>

<p>The mining company disclosed it already operates 240 MW of capacity in the surrounding area. “We are very excited to have finalized this new site acquisition. The addition of this site to our portfolio of assets in the region is a great achievement by the team reinforcing our revised strategy of focus in the PA/OH region,” Mawson&#8217;s CEO, James Manning commented.</p>
<p>Despite the expansion news, Mawson&#8217;s publicly-listed shares (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MIGI/">MIGI</a>) have experienced a 5% drop in the last 24 hours and a 1.97% decline over the last month. Nonetheless, the statistics of the past six months reveal an upward trend in MIGI shares by 11.26%, and year-to-date, the shares have increased more than 107%.</p>
<p>Mawson&#8217;s initial plan for the Corning facility is to house 12 mobile data center (MDC) units and 7,056 miners. Both hosted and self-hosted machines will be deployed at the new mining location. Just prior to the Ohio announcement, in April, Mawson <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230419005625/en/Mawson-Infrastructure-Group-Inc.-Sells-Greenfield-Texas-Sites-for-8.5m">sold</a> its Greenfield Texas sites for $8.5 million.</p>

However, the president also acknowledged the &#8220;threat by the speaker of the House to default on the national debt.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Biden Expresses Confidence in American Banking System Despite First Republic Bank Collapse</h2>
<p>Biden’s recent statements were made following California&#8217;s financial regulators <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">seizing</a> First Republic Bank and placing it under the control of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). After the bank&#8217;s seizure, it was then sold to JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States, which pledged to cover all deposits, including the uninsured.</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/may/01/debt-ceiling-first-republic-bank-biden-republicans-2024-live-updates">expressed his approval</a> of the government&#8217;s handling of the crisis, saying, regulators have taken action to facilitate the sale of First Republic Bank, making sure that all depositors are protected, and “taxpayers are not on the hook.&#8221;</p>
<p>“These actions are going to make sure that the banking system is safe and sound,&#8221; Biden stated. &#8220;And that includes protecting small businesses across the country who need to make payroll for workers and their small businesses.”</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s comments echo those made after the fall of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen also gave <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/yellen-says-us-not-willing-to-allow-contagious-bank-runs-calls-opec-oil-production-cut-unconstructive/">similar reassurances</a> when the two banks collapsed, emphasizing the safety and soundness of the banking industry.</p>
<p>However, some have criticized Yellen&#8217;s handling of the crisis, with one contributor to the New York Post, Charles Gasparino, labeling her &#8220;clueless&#8221; for her failure to prevent the collapse of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-banking-industry-still-struggling-as-first-republic-bank-shares-plummet-by-over-30/">First Republic Bank</a>.</p>
<p>Yellen was “drooling happy talk about the banking system, and asking other banks to bail out the zombie. She’s also doubling down on her mistakes that caused this banking crisis in the first place, making it more difficult to escape,&#8221; Gasparino <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/28/clueless-yellen-fails-to-stave-off-bank-crisis-as-first-republic-sinks/">said</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/yellen-says-us-not-willing-to-allow-contagious-bank-runs-calls-opec-oil-production-cut-unconstructive/">Yellen</a> has <a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/03/16/yellen-debt-limit-breach-would-be-devastating-for-banks/">sounded an alarm</a> about the U.S. defaulting on its debts, a concern that Biden echoed during his press conference on First Republic&#8217;s downfall. On Monday, the president emphasized the need to ensure the continued reliance on the economy and financial system, calling for the &#8220;threat by the speaker of the House to default on the national debt&#8221; to be taken off the table.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers, however, have stood firm on the country&#8217;s debt limit, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/republicans-seek-to-repeal-bidens-inflation-reduction-act-in-exchange-for-raising-us-debt-limit/">demanding repeals</a> of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/230-economists-warn-the-us-governments-proposed-inflation-reduction-act-will-fuel-inflation/">Inflation Reduction Act</a> before they agree to any increase. The potential default on the country&#8217;s debt by the end of the summer has heightened fears of financial instability and a prolonged recession in the United States.</p>
<p>In a note shared with Bitcoin.com News, Ruslan Lienkha, the chief of markets at <a href="https://www.youhodler.com/">Youhodler</a>, an international fintech platform based in Switzerland, expounded on the impact of First Republic&#8217;s failure on the stability of the U.S. banking sector. Lienkha voiced apprehension that the Fed’s rate hikes that have taken place in the past year have been particularly “painful for small and mid-sized banks in the United States.”</p>
<p>“Which means the collapse of First Republic Bank is likely not the last one,” Lienkha opined. “A potential bankruptcy of the bank could trigger a broader financial crisis in the country, affecting the real estate market and many other related industries—which could have massive implications for the world economy.”</p>

In the last 30 days, onchain fees have soared by over 153%, from a prior rate of $4.65 per transfer to a current average of $11.80 per transaction. The data highlights a substantial surge in the costs associated with Ethereum network transactions, indicating a notable increase in onchain activity.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Onchain Fees on Ethereum Network Soar by 153% in a Month, While Arbitrum&#x2019;s Daily Transactions Exceed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> Post-Shapella Upgrade</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Over the past month, Ethereum network fees have witnessed a material surge, with the cost of onchain transfers surging from $4.65 per transaction on April 1, to an average of 0.0064 ether or <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3y">$11.80 per transfer</a> at present. The data reveals a staggering 153% increase in the average fees charged by the Ethereum network in just 30 days. Moreover, even the median-sized protocol fees on the network have experienced a significant upswing, soaring 157% higher from $2.13 per transfer on the first of April to the current rate of 0.003 ether or <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-median_transaction_fee.html">$5.49 per median-sized transaction</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The upsurge in transaction fees on the Ethereum network has been particularly noteworthy since the implementation of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-shapella-upgrade-unlocks-staked-ether-over-860k-eth-poised-for-withdrawal-price-surges-6/">Shapella upgrade</a> on April 12. From that day until April 22, the network processed more than one million transactions daily, with the exception of April 16. Since then, Ethereum&#x2019;s transaction volumes have <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_transactions_per_day">remained below</a> the million mark, averaging between 800,000 and 900,000 transactions per day. Amid the increase in fees over the past 30 days, the cost of certain transactions on the Ethereum network remains relatively high, with an Opensea sale incurring <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">$9.93 per transfer</a>, and a trade on Uniswap costing $25.58 per transaction. Sending an ERC20 token, on the other hand, requires $7.50 per transaction.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Interestingly, since the implementation of the Shapella hard fork, the Ethereum network layer two (L2) scaling solution, Arbitrum, has been surpassing the network&#x2019;s transactions on a daily basis. According to <a href="https://dune.com/blockworks_research/l2-comparison-dashboard">data</a> collected from Dune Analytics, Arbitrum has processed between 1.1 million to 1.5 million transactions per day since Shapella, while the L2 competitor Optimism has recorded between 240,000 to 550,000 transactions per day since the Ethereum upgrade. Moreover, the average transaction fee on Arbitrum stands at $0.368 per transfer, while the average fee on Optimism is slightly higher at $0.682 per transaction.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Over the course of the last 14 days, ethereum&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) market worth has tumbled by 12.7% against the U.S. dollar. However, the second-largest digital asset in terms of market capitalization remains 1.4% higher than it was in the previous 30-day period. At present, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s market value stands at $222.7 billion, accounting for a substantial 18.097% of the cryptocurrency economy&#x2019;s total value, which amounts to $1.23 trillion on May 1, 2023.&#13;<br />

<p><a href="https://paysenger.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysenger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduces a personalized AI model that allows artists to create unique, AI-generated art in their distinctive style. This exclusive, artist-specific AI model uses the artist&#8217;s social account for validation and access. By combining personalized AI models, blockchain technology, and NFTs, Passenger aims to revolutionize the art world and foster new opportunities for artists and brands alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysenger&#8217;s cutting-edge technology and proprietary AI have been developed in collaboration with Dr. Tamay Aykut, formerly a visiting assistant professor at Stanford. The company also collaborates with Polygon and ConsenSys, a prominent blockchain software company, further solidifying its position in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the skepticism surrounding AI projects and the hype they generate, Paysenger stands out as a project backed by substantial investments and focused on addressing real-world challenges. Projects with such foundations are expected to yield impressive results, capturing a significant market share in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform&#8217;s native token, EGO, not only serves as a medium for users to interact with their favorite creators and support their work but also provides an incentive for users to perform targeted actions like content publication, paid communication, and purchasing content from creators.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysenger&#8217;s success in bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 technologies and its potential for mass adoption of blockchain technologies present a strong case for the value of its native token, EGO. As the platform continues to grow and expand its offerings, EGO is set to become an integral part of this innovative ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 25th,</span><a href="https://egoco.in/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paysenger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is scheduled to launch its Initial DEX Offering (IDO), marking a significant milestone for the company.</span></p>

The global market cap is down 1.87% at the time of writing, which seems to be a result of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Solana was also in the red today.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was down for a second straight session on Monday, as markets prepared for the upcoming United States Federal Reserve policy decision.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD dropped to low at $86.83 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes 24 hours after trading at a high of $91.39.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s drop in price has pushed litecoin to its weakest point since last Wednesday, when the token was at a low of $84.21.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, Monday&#x2019;s move came as the relative strength index (RSI) fell to a support level at 44.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.80, with an upcoming ceiling of 50.00 a potential target for bulls.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should this point be hit, there is a strong possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> will move back above the $90.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to litecoin, solana (SOL) was another notable mover on Monday, as the token fell for a third consecutive day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a high of $23.93 on Sunday, SOL/USD slipped to a bottom of $22.05 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This bearish spell started after bulls were unable to force a breakout beyond a ceiling at the $24.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One of the catalysts for this was the RSI, which also failed to surge past a key resistance level at 55.00&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 48.58, with the next visible floor at the 45.00 zone.&#13;<br />

His comments arrive amid the collapse of three major U.S. banks and the expected seizure of First Republic Bank by the federal government. Despite the potential challenges, Munger emphasized that the current situation is not as severe as the 2008 financial crisis, stating that &#8220;it&#8217;s not nearly as bad as it was in 2008.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Banks Saddled With Poor-Quality Commercial Real Estate Loans, According to Charlie Munger’s Latest Interview</h2>
<p>The renowned investor and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/charlie-munger-urges-us-government-to-ban-crypto-like-china-has-done/">Charlie Munger</a>, spoke to the Financial Times (FT) in an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/da9f8230-2eb1-49c5-b63a-f1507936d01b">interview</a> published on April 30, 2023, where he discussed potential issues <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-by-fed-and-fdic-reveal-vulnerabilities-behind-2-major-us-bank-failures/">facing</a> the U.S. banking system.</p>
<p>During the previous financial crisis, Berkshire Hathaway provided <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna44271321">capital injections</a> to Bank of America and <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/history/moments/2008-buffett-investment.html">Goldman Sachs</a>. However, the FT interview noted that the conglomerate holding company has not made any comparable moves amid recent events, including the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank last month.</p>
<p>“Berkshire has made some bank investments that worked out very well for us,” Munger stated. “We’ve had some disappointment in banks, too. It’s not that damned easy to run a bank intelligently, there are a lot of temptations to do the wrong thing,” the investor added.</p>
<p>The 99-year-old American businessman discussed some of the challenges facing financial institutions today. Munger specifically highlighted the amount of commercial property currently held by U.S. banks.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-08/a-1-5-trillion-wall-of-debt-is-looming-for-us-commercial-properties">sources</a>, American banks hold nearly $1.5 trillion in debt, which is due by the end of 2025. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/10/business/commercial-real-estate-banks-offices/index.html">decreasing value</a> of this property has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/the-coming-commercial-real-estate-crash-that-may-never-happen.html">raised concerns</a>, compounded by the ten consecutive federal funds rate increases since last year. “A lot of real estate isn’t so good any more,” Munger remarked.</p>
<p>The Berkshire vice chair added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a lot of troubled office buildings, a lot of troubled shopping centres, a lot of troubled other properties. There’s a lot of agony out there.</p></blockquote>
<p>​​Following the publication of Munger&#8217;s interview, Jim Bianco, the president of Bianco Research, tweeted about the investor&#8217;s remarks. Bianco <a href="https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1652733622854590464?s=20">stated</a> that “Buffett is the GOAT largely because he has invested in banks for over 50 years. No one understands them better. So, I have noted his absence in all the happenings in the regional banks in the last two months. He is not investing, and, to me, this speaks volumes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bianco added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Munger may have said the reason why.</p></blockquote>
<p>Loan quality is a critical factor for American banks, alongside undercapitalization and the inability to meet obligations. If a bank makes too many bad loans, it can end up losing a significant amount of money, similar to what happened during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, during his interview with FT, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/berkshires-charlie-munger-says-ridiculous-anybody-would-buy-crypto-its-an-absolute-horror/">Munger</a> expressed optimism that the economy’s current troubles will not be as severe as they were back then. “It’s not nearly as bad as it was in 2008,” Munger said. “But trouble happens to banking just like trouble happens everywhere else. In the good times, you get into bad habits . . . When bad times come they lose too much.”</p>
