			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/geminis-c-winklevoss-issues-ultimatum-to-dcg-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the cryptocurrency industry with his open letter to Digital Currency Group (DCG) founder and CEO Barry Silbert published on Twitter on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In it, Winklevoss accused Silbert of avoiding direct contact with Gemini representatives regarding the $900 million Genesis, DCG’s lending subsidiary, owes to Gemini’s Earn lending program users after suspending its operations in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winklevoss also said that DCG and Gemini are “beyond commingled,” something Silbert has been vehemently denying to this day. Silbert is now facing an ultimatum from Gemini, which asks him to commit publicly to solving the problem by January 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winklevoss’ attempt to escalate the situation has eerie similarities to the beginning – and sudden end – of the conflict between Binance’s Changpeng Zhao and disgraced crypto baron Sam Bankman-Fried. Some argue that DCG’s role in crypto is even larger than FTX’s, and a blowup of DCG and its subsidiaries would be a catastrophe crypto has never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But who exactly are Winklevoss and Silbert? Why are they fighting? And how can this clash between Gemini and DCG end?</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cameron Winklevoss, together with his twin brother Tyler Winklevoss, are best known for their lawsuits against Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg in the early 2000s. The twins alleged that Zuckerberg illegally took their idea of a social network and created Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of legal battles and millions lost in the process, in 2014, the Winklevoss twins co-founded Gemini, a crypto exchange that has cultivated a reputation as a safe and regulated centralized exchange in the world. Gemini has consistently been one of the largest exchanges throughout the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both brothers have been actively participating in the development of the exchange, with Tyler being the CEO. Cameron, who is also an Olympic rower, stepped down as the director of Gemini’s European division last October but still sits on multiple boards inside the Gemini environment. Both of the brothers are crypto billionaires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barry Silbert, the addressee of Cameron Winklevoss’ open letter, is the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), a conglomerate of five cryptocurrency-focused companies founded in 2015. Those companies include Genesis Global Capital, Grayscale Investments, CoinDesk, Foundry, and Luno.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silbert is a veteran investor in cryptocurrencies – he started investing in Bitcoin back in 2012. On top of his massively profitable Bitcoin trades, he was an early investor in Coinbase and Ripple. According to Forbes, Silbert was worth $3.2 billion as of April of last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silbert’s DCG is mostly known for Grayscale, the asset management firm running the world’s largest Bitcoin trust fund, GBTC. The company has been the most profitable out of the five but recently has been facing mounting pressure from regulators and investors alike for failing to convert GBTC into an ETF, which has caused the shares of the fund to trade at a 50% discount.</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why are Winklevoss and Silbert in conflict? It goes back to November 17 of last year when Genesis Global Capital, the lending arm of DCG’s Genesis, announced that it was pausing redemptions and new loan originations in the wake of the bankruptcy of FTX.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hours after, Gemini came out with a statement saying it was halting withdrawals for Gemini Earn, its lending program that offered up to 8% interest to its users. The move was no surprise since it was public knowledge that Gemini used Genesis for its Earn program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it’s now been more than two months since Genesis halted redemptions. During that period of time, many speculated that either Gemini or DCG (or both) is going to file for bankruptcy. None of this has happened yet but what did happen was the public got the numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out that Genesis owes Gemini Earn users more than $900 million. It also turns out that DCG owes its subsidiary Genesis $1.675 billion. While Silbert denies DCG borrowed from Genesis, it’s still unclear why Genesis needed to halt its operations and where the $900 million of user deposits went.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it all goes back to the fateful day the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) blew up. It was reported that when Terra Luna imploded and 3AC got burnt so much that they filed for bankruptcy, Genesis lost around $1.1 billion in loans to 3AC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or perhaps the chain of events looks something like this: Gemini took almost a billion dollars from users to deposit it to Genesis; Genesis lent it out to 3AC; 3AC lost it either when Terra Luna imploded or perhaps loaned it to FTX; FTX loaned it to Alameda; and Alameda either lost or stole it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any scenario, there are billions of dollars missing and someone is going to pay the price for losing them. It’s no surprise that Winklevoss is publicly accusing Silbert of losing the funds and ignoring communications with Gemini, after all, there are real people behind the numbers. However, recent developments in the crypto industry have shown that it’s never a good idea to trust someone completely. It might as well be that Gemini itself is in some sort of a bad situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winklevoss issued an ultimatum to Silbert: Commit to solving the problem by January 8, or… He didn’t go into detail about the consequences for Silbert if he doesn’t do this. Let’s wait and see what happens on January 8.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Web3 gaming sector has seen a surge of investor interest in 2022, with venture-backed startups raising $4.49 billion. But despite the influx of capital, the industry is still struggling to attract and retain users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a</span> <a href="https://mpost.io/metaverse-fundraising-report-for-2022-trends-in-nft-gaming-infrastructure-ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Metaverse Post, 348 startups focused on NFTs, metaverse, gaming, AI, VR, and AR raised a total of $7.1 billion in 2022. Venture funding across the Web3 space has risen by $4.8 billion since 2021, a 48% increase in one year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of that funding went to Web3 gaming projects. Currently, Web3 gaming accounts for 62% of Web3 venture capital funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 alone, venture capital investments into gaming startups totaled roughly $4.49 billion, a figure that is disproportionate to the size of its user base. Last year, gaming was the largest sector by venture funding. For reference, metaverse projects were in second place, with $1.8 billion in funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This speaks to the confidence of venture funds in the potential of the Web3 gaming space. However, it is important to note that the vast majority of Web3 funding comes from just four major venture funds. These are Paradigm ($2.5 billion), a16z ($2.2 billion), HiveMind ($1.5 billion), and Binance Labs ($1 billion).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, gamers generally don&#8217;t share that confidence, as available data suggest that user adoption is slow. Moreover, most gamers either aren&#8217;t familiar with Web3 or are not in favor of it.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A June 2022</span> <a href="https://codaplatform.com/web3-user-study/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by gaming company Coda Labs suggests that Web3 gaming is still far from mass adoption. The poll surveyed 7,000 gamers from major markets, including the US, UK, and Japan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the poll, only 3% of gamers own non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These digital assets have been hailed as a technology that will transform ownership of in-game assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamers generally don&#8217;t know much about Web3. Specifically, 52% of gamers don&#8217;t know any Web3 gaming terms. Moreover, only 12% of gamers have tried playing a Web3 game. In fact, out of those that haven&#8217;t, only 15% say that they are interested in doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamers generally don&#8217;t have positive feelings about Web3 either. The survey found that gamers generally don&#8217;t like crypto or NFTs. Gamers rated their feelings about crypto and NFTs at 4.5 and 4.3, respectively, on a scale from 0 to 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, some gamers believe that NFTs only serve the game studios that issue them. In January 2022, the New York Times</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/15/technology/cryptocurrency-nft-gamers.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the backlash that some gaming studios face when trying to integrate NFTs into existing games. GSC Game World, the studio behind the popular S.T.A.L.K.E.R. video game, planned to release its NFTs earlier in 2022. However, the player backlash was so intense that the gaming studio quickly abandoned the plan.</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Web3 gaming space is growing, but onboarding real players is a challenge, says Parth Choudhary, Founder &amp; CEO of the Web3 game discovery platform Glip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glip has so far raised </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/glip-56f2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from venture capital sources, with a mission to make Web3 gaming more accessible to gamers. The startup is now tackling the unique challenges of bringing Web3 gaming to a wider audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do that, Web3 has to change. For one, the economic incentives of Web3 games just don&#8217;t work for many gamers, Choudhary explained. Many popular Web3 games are built around the &#8220;play to earn&#8221; (P2E) model. For instance, the Web3 game</span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/tag/axie-infinity/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Axie Infinity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attracted millions of players with a promise to earn while playing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, according to the Coda Platform </span><a href="https://codaplatform.com/web3-user-study/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 75% of crypto gamers said they played a Web3 game solely to earn crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most regular gamers play for fun, Choudhary says. &#8220;Offering a chance to earn digital tokens does not necessarily appeal to the core gaming demographic,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the crypto crash has revealed just how fragile play-to-earn models can be. &#8220;The appeal of game tokens and NFTs has diminished since the NFT crash,&#8221; Choudhary said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was especially true for Axie Infinity, which saw its daily active users and token crash in late 2021. The</span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axie-infinity/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">token</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dropped from its high of $151 and is currently trading at just $6.4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the promise of earning potential, games like Axie face challenges retaining users, Shrivastava said. &#8220;Web3 games are now forced to pivot to free-to-play models to cater to real gamers rather than speculators,&#8221; he added.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now, the biggest challenge facing Web3 gaming is user acquisition,” he notes. “Web3 games are still too complicated for casual gamers, and they don&#8217;t understand why they should switch to Web3,&#8221; said Ishan Shrivastava, Founder &amp; COO of Glip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising is also an issue. Major social media advertising platforms restrict crypto ads, including gaming ads. For instance, tech giant Meta </span><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/ad-standards/content-specific-restrictions/cryptocurrency-products-and-services/?source=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Fpolicies_center%2Fads%2Frestricted_content%2Fcryptocurrency_products_and_services" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manually reviews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ads focusing on crypto trading, borrowing, and lending, etc. Moreover, crypto platforms that want to advertise with these platforms must show proof of registration in one of the countries on its list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shrivastava believes that both regulators and Web2 giants will continue to crack down on crypto and Web3, gaming included. That is why Glip is building a Web3-first channel to help Web3 developers find their audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glip anticipated some of these challenges, Shrivastava says. The startup has focused on making Web3 games more accessible to users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glip has recently surpassed 1 million created wallets and 100,000 onboarded users for Web3 games in the three months since its launch. Moreover, the game has registered over 50,000 Web3 earners. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;My journey with gaming quests started with World of Warcraft,&#8221; Glip CEO Parth Choudhary said. &#8220;Now, I am excited to show a new generation of gamers what gaming could be.&#8221;</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharmacies are at the forefront of crypto adoption in the country as major local chains transition towards Web3 for digital payments. ANC Pharmacy, a major pharmacy chain, partnered with Binance Ukraine to launch crypto payments via Binance Pay, a contactless payment service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pharmacy chain officially </span><a href="https://anc.ua/blog/binance-krypto-anc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that ANC Pharmacy would enable customers to access instant payments while purchasing pharmaceutical products online starting January 3rd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chain operates over 1,000 pharmacies across Ukraine. It also runs a native online pharmacy service. Binance Pay is set to roll out in Kyiv following the official announcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANC Pharmacy-operated stores like Kopiyka and Shara will enjoy the benefits of crypto payments through Binance Pay in the new feature. ANC, Kopiyka, and Shara will reportedly be among the first pharmacies in Europe to accept crypto payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users must download the Binance application and access ANC’s website to access digital crypto payments. After choosing a product to purchase online, they can use Binance Pay and pick up their orders at a preferred location. </span></p>

While the national bank continues to experiment and explore use cases for the CBDC, cryptocurrencies play a critical role in Ukraine’s war effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the government&#8217;s push for digital innovation, Binance has also been actively establishing its presence in Ukraine over the past few years. Previously, the leading cryptocurrency exchange partnered with Varus, a prominent Ukrainian supermarket chain, to allow customers to pay for groceries through Binance Pay. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what seems like a cease on selling pressure, Solana has soared by 12% in the last 24 hours,  returning to the $12 price mark, according to market data from </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinmarketcap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The recent increase comes after a massive decline to below-double figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden rally coincides with the recent tweet of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin on Dec. 30. In the tweet, he heaped praises on Solana and hoped that the ecosystem would get a chance to thrive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buterin described the downturn in the price of SOL as the washing out of “awful opportunistic money people.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Twitter thread, he also accused DCG and FTX of misdirection and using various methods to attack 3AC. He alleged that both companies used the collapse of 3AC to take more deposits while insolvent, hoping that the market would go up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that this was possible because of the closeness shared between Barry Silbert, the CEO of DCG, and Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 30th, 2022, three Gemini Earn users represented by Silver Golub &amp; Teitell LLP (SGT) filed a request for </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/gemini-users-file-lawsuit-against-genesis-global-capital/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">class action arbitration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Genesis Global Capital and Digital Currency Group for breach of contract and sale of unregistered securities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The claimants allege that Genesis initially breached its Master Agreement when the firm failed to notify users when it went insolvent in the summer of 2022. Genesis would fail to reveal its insolvency until November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the filing, instead of notifying users, DCG acquired the right to collect a $2.3 billion debt that the now-insolvent hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) owed to Genesis for a promissory note of $1.1 billion due in 2033.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class arbitration filed with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) also asserts that the suspension of the Genesis Earn redemption program due to Genesis freezing withdrawals on November 16, 2022, led to Genesis selling unregistered securities.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Italian Parliament has approved a 26% capital tax on cryptocurrency gains above 2,000 euros (approx. $2,060) during a tax period as part of the country’s budget law for 2023.</span></p>

Following parliamentary approval, the new tax regime came into effect on December 30th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To encourage crypto traders to declare their holdings, the parliament approved a 3.5% aliquot for undeclared cryptocurrencies held before Dec. 31, 2021, and a 0.5% fine for each additional year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bill also has an additional incentive that would set a &#8220;substitute income tax&#8221; for investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of January 1st,2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB) released a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/SCBgov_bs/status/1610084773472485380" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on January 3rd to correct material misstatements made by the CEO of bankrupt FTX, John J. Ray III, about the value of FTX assets under custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FTX CEO had claimed that FTX was instructed by the Commission, under oath, to mint a substantial amount of new digital assets. The debtors also alleged that the Commission &#8220;stole&#8221; FTX users&#8217; assets under its control without backing their claim with valid proof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Bahamian regulator, the public statements made by FTX defamatory as they were based on “incomplete” information, and the debtors failed to utilize their ability to request information from the &#8220;Joint Provisional Liquidators.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement ended with the Commission expressing hope that Chapter 11 will be willing to consider the best interest of FTX customers. FTX also disputed SCB’s calculations, saying the digital assets seized in November were worth $296 million and not $3.5 billion.</span></p>
