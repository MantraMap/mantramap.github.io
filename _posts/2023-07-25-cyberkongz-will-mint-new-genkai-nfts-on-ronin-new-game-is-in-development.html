<p>CyberKongz partners with Axie Infinity&rsquo;s creator Sky Mavis to migrate its existing Play and Kollect NFT game and mint the new Genkai NFT collection on the Ronin chain.</p>
New Genkai NFT Collection and Game to Be Launched on Ronin
<p>According to the press release of July 25, Sky Mavis, creator of the popular crypto game Axie Infinity, starts its new partnership with a growing NFT franchise CyberKongz.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CyberKongz will mint a part of its new anime-inspired NFT collection called Genkai on Sky Mavis&rsquo; Ronin chain. The Genkai mint will take place on July 27 at 12pm EST, with 4,000 made available on Ronin&rsquo;s Mavis Market and the other 16,000 NFTs minted on the Ethereum Mainnet. The Ethereum NFT holders will have the option to move their tokens to Ronin in the future. The price for Genkai NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain is expected to be 0.25 ETH (about $460) per token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT creators have also confirmed that they&rsquo;ll join forces with Ronin to develop a new game featuring Genkai, although no further details have been announced so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genkai is the first non-pixel artwork I have created for CyberKongz and will represent our growth as a project to expand our IP into the Southeast Asian and Japanese markets. Additionally, CyberKongz will be working with Ronin to develop a game featuring Genkai. This ambitious venture will seek to alter the paradigm of web3 IP in a gamified manner.&rdquo; &ndash; shared CyberKongz founder and artist, Myoo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s been reported that the CyberKongz&rsquo; existing NFT minting game called Play and Kollect will be migrated from the Polygon blockchain to Ronin. However, the date for the migration hasn&rsquo;t been set yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To strengthen the connection between Axie Infinity and CyberKongz users, Sky Mavis will give away free Genkai NFTs to each holder of the rare Mystic Axies.&nbsp;</p>
What Does the Partnership Mean for Sky Mavis and CyberKongz?
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why CyberKongz chose Sky Mavis for this collaboration. Apparently, there&rsquo;s always been a link between Axie Infinity players and CyberKongz fans.</p>
<p>CyberKongz council member Henry the Grape explained: </p>

<p>&ldquo;We were really born out of the Axie community. So when the opportunity came with Ronin to be able to continue building our ecosystem on Ronin, it was kind of a no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myoo of CyberKongz also mentioned:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By partnering with Sky Mavis we are embarking on a unique opportunity to accelerate our already established gaming ecosystem, while also enabling an expansion of our holder base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for Sky Mavis, it will undoubtedly benefit from the partnership. The Axie Infinity creators are moving towards growing a large blockchain gaming ecosystem. CyberKongz NFTs will become the first profile picture collection minted on Ronin.&nbsp;</p>
