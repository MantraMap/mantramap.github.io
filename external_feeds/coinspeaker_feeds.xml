<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/uk-mortgage-rates-15-year-high/">UK Mortgage Rates Reaches 15-Year High as Housing Market Slows</a></p>
<p>Mortgage rates in the United Kingdom have reached a 15-year high, adding pressure on homeowners and slowing the housing market. According to data from Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed rate for residential mortgages has now peaked at 6.66%, a little increase from the 6.63% it recorded on Monday, July 10. Last year on October 20, the mortgage rates were at 6.65%. However, the new rates represent the highest level homeowners in the UK have seen since August 2008, during the global financial crisis, bringing mortgage costs to their highest levels for nearly two decades.</p>
<h2>UK Housing Market Attempted a Comeback Early This Year</h2>
<p>The country&#8217;s housing market has been on a roller coaster ride recently. After a turbulent start to the year, the market began to recover in early 2023. However, the recovery has been short-lived, as homeowners and buyers have recently faced renewed mortgage pain.</p>
<p>The rise in mortgage rates in the UK is driven by several factors, including rising <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mortgage-rates-drop-coronavirus/">inflation</a> and expectations that the Bank of England (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoE</a>) will continue to raise interest rates to bring inflation under control. The BoE has expanded its base rate many times since December, and the central bank is still expected to increase the rates further to keep inflation under control.</p>
<p>Last month, the BoE hiked its base rate to 5%. The new rate marked its highest level in 13 years. Economists believe the base rate could rise to as high as 6% by the end of the year. The rate increment has caused mortgage rates to surge, making it more expensive for people to borrow money to buy a home. As a result, house prices have begun to fall, and the number of mortgage approvals has declined.</p>
<h2>Experts Warn of Further Pain for Mortgage Holders in the UK</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/uk-mortgages-2-year-fixed-rate-hits-6point66percent-highest-since-2008.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, experts are warning that the rising cost of mortgages could significantly impact mortgage holders. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, an investment and stock broker company, said on Tuesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mortgage payers are marching towards fixed rate renewal dates with a sense of dread.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She believes that the mood in the market is changing and that bad news is becoming more commonplace.</p>
<p>Another expert, Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, anticipates that the central bank will hike interest rates to around 6.35% within the first three months of next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Financial markets are pricing in a peak in UK interest rates of around 6.35% in the first three months of 2024, up from 5% currently,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ryan also warned that this could have a massive impact on mortgage holders, as they will see their monthly payments increase.</p>
<h2>What Does This Mean for Homeowners?</h2>
<p>The rising cost of mortgages is likely to impact homeowners significantly. Those on variable-rate mortgages will see their payments increase as interest rates rise. While those on fixed-rate mortgages will not see their fees increase immediately. However, they will be locked into a higher rate when their fixed-rate period ends.</p>
<p>Homeowners struggling to make mortgage payments should contact their lenders for possible solutions. There may be options to help them, such as a payment holiday or a remortgage.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/user-traffic-twitter-threads-100m/">User Traffic Drops on Twitter as Threads Surpasses 100M Users</a></p>
<p>The introduction of Threads by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META) might have fueled concerns for Twitter as its numbers are gradually dropping. User traffic on Twitter has waned significantly since the launch of the Instagram-backed social media app. Web analytics platform Similarweb <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/social-media-news/threads/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> recent data which shows that Twitter went down by 5% for the first two full days that Threads was generally available compared with the previous week.</p>
<p>When placed side by side with the numbers at this same time in 2022, Twitter&#8217;s web traffic is down by about 11%. Twitter traffic decline is a testament that the social media platform was already facing crucial battles prior to the launch of Threads.</p>
<p>According to a new study published by Pew Research Center, many Americans had decided to take a break from the blue-bird app ever since it was acquired by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO. Their decision resulted from several policy changes and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-ceo-rate-limit-tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictions</a> introduced by Musk.</p>
<p>The Instagram spinoff, Threads <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-threads-app-goes-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> was launched last Thursday to furnish users’ desire for a more streamlined and visually appealing messaging experience. It was made available on Apple App Store and Google Play online store in over 100 countries but not in Europe. Noteworthy, the new app has the visual aesthetics of Twitter while adding some visible twists to it.</p>
<p>While Threads is designed like an offshoot of Instagram, interested users are required to download the app either from the online app stores it was hosted. Upon download, it allows users to retain their existing Instagram usernames.</p>
<h2>Beating Twitter: Threads Hit Milestone with 100M Users in 1 Week</h2>
<p>The launch of the Meta app met with excitement and support from netizens. In less than a few hours after the launch, Threads received over 10 million sign-ups, a figure that has been growing remarkably since then.</p>
<p>In less than one week after its official launch, the text-based conversational platform <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-threads-100m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exceeded</a> 100 million users.</p>
<p>There has been an impressive surge in sign-ups and user engagement so far. The massive number of signups within this short period is a milestone that no other app has ever recorded. Although some crypto Twitter users have <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-twitter-meta-threads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> issues of impersonation implying that some of the accounts on Threads are fake.</p>
<p>Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) platform Wombex put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/WombexFinance/status/1677625612813365248?t=bPsgRsqd6DboqlqZx9fXYA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">disclaimer</a> on Twitter saying that it is not yet on Threads but there is an account impersonating it on the new app. Also, Non-fungible Token (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a>) influencer Leonidas <a href="https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1677196328961441797" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">claimed</a> that “large NFT accounts” are being replicated by scammers on Threads. Hence, he was forced to open a Threads account before someone did it for him. So far, no malicious content has been shared by most of these fake accounts.</p>
<p>In what many legal experts expected, Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-threads-trade-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a> a letter to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg accusing the company of engaging in “systematic, willful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property.&#8221; The lawyer who condemned Meta for employing past Twitter employees who had access to Twitter’s confidential information requested that the company desist from using these secret trades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-stricter-rules-generative-ai/">China to Enforce Stricter Rules for Generative AI Content to Maintain Government Control</a></p>
<p>China is currently mulling tighter rules to govern and supervise the creation and application of generative artificial technology (AI) tools. Although the Beijing government supports AI in general, authorities are reportedly trying to ensure that it continues to have some control over generated content.</p>
<p>According to a Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1938b7b6-baf9-46bb-9eb7-70e9d32f4af0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, the Cyberspace Administration of China intends to create a license that all companies intending to publish generative AI must obtain. Government officials are already working hard on these regulations and hoping a draft will be available before the end of July.</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the matter, as referenced by Financial Times, Beijing’s only way to control AI-generated information is to require this license before launch. However, the regulation must be carefully developed so that it doesn’t suffocate the companies and eventually set China behind other countries in the AI race.</p>
<h2>China Proposed New AI Rules in April</h2>
<p>In April, the CAC <a href="https://cac.gov.cn/2023-04/11/c_1682854275475410.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> guidelines for AI models. According to the watchdog, AI companies in China must adhere to these rules by submitting all developed tools and products for security reviews before a public launch. Upon launch, AI companies must also verify all users so they can track usage.</p>
<p>The CAC specified that all AI-generated content must support socialist values and should not contain any pointers to subversion of power, incitement, or castigation of socialist ideologies. In addition, the rules <a href="https://www.globalpolicywatch.com/2023/04/china-proposes-draft-measures-to-regulate-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">encourage providers</a> of generative AI to help users carefully apply the technology without harming the rights, reputation, or image of others. In addition, The provider must be able to either suspend or permanently prevent access to users who violate these rules. Furthermore, a user can report an AI company to the CAC if generated AI content violates the draft rules in any way.</p>
<h2>AI Regulation in Other Nations</h2>
<p>China is trying to ensure its new rules still keep its AI ecosystem in fierce competition with developments in other countries. Nations around the world are also trying to create regulations to guide generative AI content without stifling growth in the industry.</p>
<p>The United States seems to be taking its time with developing AI regulations in the country. In April, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a part of the Commerce Department, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-begins-study-possible-rules-regulate-ai-like-chatgpt-2023-04-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would write a report to ensure AI tools function as advertised. The report would contain measures that guide AI development while preventing undue or harmful use of the technology.</p>
<p>Last June, the Canadian Parliament created a draft act to govern AI development. The Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (<a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovation-better-canada/en/artificial-intelligence-and-data-act-aida-companion-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AIDA</a>) sets the tone for the safe design and deployment of AI tools to mitigate potentially harmful side effects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Parliament in the European Union has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/eu-parliament-ai-draft-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> an act to regulate artificial intelligence in the country. With 499 of 620 votes in favor of the act, the EU ensures that AI development and deployment are responsible and properly regulated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fca-crypto-atms-uk/">FCA Investigation Results in Closure of 26 Crypto ATMs across UK</a></p>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom has successfully shut down 26 crypto ATMs across the country. The FCA&#8217;s actions stemmed from a coordinated investigation to crack down on illegal digital assets ATMs operating without proper authorization in London, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, and Exeter. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-are-crypto-atms-and-how-do-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATM machines</a> enable crypto traders to buy and sell virtual assets such as Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ether</a>) using cash or bank cards.</p>
<p>In an official <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-conduct-authority-continues-crackdown-unregistered-crypto-atms-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> on July 11, the FCA, the regulatory body responsible for overseeing financial activities in the UK, said it had inspected 34 locations suspected of hosting illegal crypto ATMs. Most recently, the regulator, alongside Bedfordshire Police and Hertfordshire Police, investigated 18 more crypto ATMs between May and June this year.</p>
<p>During the investigations, the market watchdog took decisive action against the crypto ATMs, found to be operating unlawfully without registration with the FCA, shutting down 26 machines across various regions in the UK.</p>
<h2>FCA Warns Users to Stop Using Crypto ATMs</h2>
<p>The closure is part of the regulator&#8217;s efforts to ensure the financial system&#8217;s integrity and prevent potential illicit activities associated with unregulated crypto transactions.</p>
<p>The latest crackdown comes after the FCA issued a stern <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/warning-illegal-crypto-atms-operating-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warning </a>to operators last year in November, stating that compliance with regulations is a prerequisite for their continued operation. The regulator&#8217;s ultimatum emphasized that all crypto ATM operators must adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) and consumer protection requirements, providing a safer environment for users engaging in crypto transactions.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, the Joint Executive Director of the Enforcement and Market Oversight unit at the FCA, warned users to be mindful of the machines as criminals may operate them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you use a crypto ATM in the UK, you are using a machine operating illegally and may be handing your money over to criminals. You will not be protected if something goes wrong, and you could lose your money. It is also unlikely you will be able to contact the machine operator to resolve any problems you may have,&#8221; said Smart.</p>
<h2>Crypto Trader Losses £1000 to ATM Machine in Sheffield</h2>
<p>In the Sheffield region of the UK, an individual fell victim to a crypto ATM scam, losing £1000, according to the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fca-imprisonment-crypto-asset-promotions/">FCA</a>. The victim shared his unfortunate experience with the Citizens Advice Bureau, explaining that the transaction failed and the machine could not return their funds.</p>
<p>When attempting to contact the ATM operators using the provided phone number, the victim found that he could only reach the operators via WhatsApp, with no option for a direct phone call. After inspection, authorities confirmed that the ATM is now out of service and no longer operational.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tata-indian-iphone-manufacturer/">Tata Group Close to Seal Deal on Becoming First Indian iPhone Manufacturer</a></p>
<p>Early on Tuesday, July 11, the news spread that India&#8217;s largest conglomerate Tata Group is close to acquiring <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a>&#8216;s Indian supplier factory by August this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-11/tata-group-closes-in-on-deal-to-become-first-indian-iphone-maker" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> sources familiar with the matter, and this would be the first time that a local Indian firm is moving into the manufacturing of iPhones.</p>
<p>The sources added that the Tata Group will take over the Wistron Corp. factory in southern Karnataka state, currently valued at over $600 million. They added that the Tata Group has been negotiating for more than a year. The facility at Wistron Corp. currently employs over 10,000 people responsible for the assembly of the iPhone 14 model.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year through March 2024, Wistron Corp has shown commitment to ship iPhones worth at least $1.8 billion from the Karnataka factory. This will also make them eligible for state-backed financial incentives, the sources said.</p>
<p>The introduction of an iPhone made specifically for the Indian market is expected to boost Apple&#8217;s efforts to expand its product range beyond China and strengthen its manufacturing presence in India. Wistron, one of Apple&#8217;s key suppliers, has already exported around $500 million worth of iPhones from India in the last quarter. Other Taiwanese suppliers like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. have also increased their local production in India.</p>
<p>A month ago and so, time cook integrated the first two Apple Stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. The Apple chief sees great potential in the Indian market and there&#8217;s a growing appetite for Apple products.</p>
<h2>India Pushing on Manufacturing</h2>
<p>India has been working on increasing its own manufacturing capabilities with the help of government programs and incentives. Apple, in particular, has been trying to reduce its dependence on China and expand its production in other countries.</p>
<p>The introduction of an Indian company manufacturing iPhones could be a big step towards challenging China&#8217;s position as the world&#8217;s factory. It may also encourage other global electronics brands to consider manufacturing in India, reducing their reliance on China.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s largest conglomerate Tata Group sells everything from salt to tech services. Now, the group is making a big push into the manufacturing of electronic devices as well as semiconductor manufacturing. The Tata Group is already producing the iPhone chassis, which is the metal frame of the device, at its factory located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-money-maker-funding-millionaire/">AI Will Be Largest Money Maker in History for Anyone, Says Self-Made Millionaire Exec</a></p>
<p>As artificial intelligence tools become increasingly popular, individuals and organizations scramble to take a big bite of the AI pie. Today, the general outlook on AI is disruptive, with most projecting that the technology will create new use cases and be a wealth facilitator. According to the CEO of investment company RSE Ventures, AI will be the next big money maker.</p>
<p>Speaking to CNBC’s Make It, CEO Matt Higgins believes that AI could be a fantastic way to make money if people knew how to apply the technology. He believes AI can work for everyone regardless of background or access to opportunities. Higgins said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history, because artificial intelligence doesn’t care where you were born, whether you have money, whether you have a PhD. It’s going to destroy barriers that have prevented people from moving up the ladder, and pursuing their dream of economic freedom.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Higgins’ position may not be surprising as most people seem very bullish about the opportunities obtainable from applying artificial intelligence. Since OpenAI launched <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> last November, the technology has been trending at the individual and corporate levels, such that most big tech companies are developing or launching one AI tool or another.</p>
<p>According to a Precedence Research <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/artificial-intelligence-market" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, the global AI market was valued at $69.25 billion in 2022 and would likely hit 1.87 trillion by 2032, with a 39.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2032. Another forecast gives AI a 20.1% CAGR and a value of $1.39 trillion by 2029.</p>
<h2>Experts Say Anyone Can Start Making Money Via AI</h2>
<p>Higgins is not the only stakeholder who believes it’s possible to already start making money using AI. However, the Shark Tank guest shark and self-made millionaire believes that now is the best time to begin. According to him, “it’s not that if you don’t jump on it now, you never can. It’s that now is the greatest opportunity for you to capitalize on it.”</p>
<p>CEO and founder of AI startup AIandYou, Susan Gonzales, is also blowing the AI trumpet. Through her startup, which teaches AI skills to communities in need, Gonzales also says now is the best time for anyone to learn about the technology. Anyone, including students, artists, and freelancers, can apply AI to their jobs or studies to streamline their process and improve turnaround time.</p>
<p>In addition to freelancing, AI will help entrepreneurs with optimizing business operations. Gonzales says that small businesses can use AI to gather competitive intelligence, improve advertising and marketing, and find new ways to make money.</p>
<h2>AI Regulation</h2>
<p>As AI adoption increases, governments worldwide are concerned about its abilities. Last month, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/eu-parliament-ai-draft-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> an act to manage and supervise AI development and usage in the area. The new act enforces a few specifics, including requiring companies to label all AI-generated content. The act would also restrict law enforcement from using AI tools to predict criminal behavior or conduct unauthorized surveillance. In addition, the act covers for close examination of any other AI uses considered high risk.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-china-store-wechat/">Apple Expands Retail Reach in China with Official Store Opening on WeChat </a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a>, an American multinational technology company, has expanded its retail presence in China, the world&#8217;s second-largest economy, with the launch of an official store on the popular social media platform WeChat. According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/apple-launches-wechat-store-in-china.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> on July 11, the latest expansion brings Apple&#8217;s products and services directly to WeChat&#8217;s vast user base of approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide.</p>
<p>The social media platform, known as a &#8220;super app&#8221;, goes beyond messaging and offers diverse services within its ecosystem. With the introduction of its Mini Program feature, users can access various services without the hassle of downloading multiple apps. The iPhone maker has leveraged the platform by launching its store on WeChat&#8217;s Mini Program, enabling users to conveniently browse and purchase Apple products, including the latest iPhone 14 models, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs.</p>
<h2>WeChat Offers Buyers Free Shipping on Orders</h2>
<p>According to the report, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent</a>, the parent company of WeChat, said that customers using the WeChat store could enjoy various benefits, such as free shipping on orders and an option for three-hour delivery in selected cases. Additionally, users can access more Apple services, including the trade-in program, all within the social media platform.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decision to establish an official store on WeChat is part of its ongoing efforts to strengthen its retail channels in China, one of its most significant markets. The company already operates an official store on Tmall, Alibaba&#8217;s e-commerce site, and collaborates with JD.com, a prominent online retailer in China.</p>
<p>To further expand its retail presence in China, the American-based technology giant ventured into live commerce in May this year, aiming to connect with consumers through interactive and real-time product showcases.</p>
<p>While the Chinese smartphone market experienced a 5% decline in sales during the first quarter of 2023, Apple&#8217;s iPhone sales demonstrated resilience, growing by 6% year-on-year during the same period. This solid performance in a challenging market highlights the strength of the company&#8217;s brand and consumer demand for its products in China.</p>
<p>The Asian country remains a crucial market for Apple, extending beyond its home turf in the United States. Counterpoint Research estimated that the iPhone 13 series dominated the top three spots in the chart of best-selling phones in China for 2022, highlighting Apple&#8217;s devices&#8217; strong demand and popularity among Chinese consumers.</p>
<h2>Apple Expands Retail Presence Around the World</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, apart from China, Apple plans to expand its retail services to various regions worldwide. The technology maker said in June that it intends to open and rejuvenate its retail chain to focus on strengthening its presence in other parts of Asia and revamping established locations in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gadgets360.com/internet/news/apple-plans-major-retail-push-new-stores-india-china-us-asia-europe-4087756" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, citing people familiar with the matter, the company is currently discussing opening 15 new stores across the Asia-Pacific region and five additional locations in Europe and the Middle East. Furthermore, plans are underway to establish four new outlets in the United States and Canada. These deliberations cover the period until 2027.</p>
<p>In addition to the new store openings, Apple aims to revamp or relocate six stores in Asia, nine in Europe, and 13 in North America. These efforts are part of the company&#8217;s comprehensive strategy to enhance the customer experience and modernize its retail spaces. The proposed plans involve 53 new, relocated, or remodeled stores over the next four years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/temasek-decline-shareholder-return/">Temasek Records 5% Decline in Annual Shareholder Return</a></p>
<p>Temasek Holdings Ltd, Singapore&#8217;s state investment business noted for its strong investment portfolio and stable financial performance, has reported a 5.07% decrease in its one-year total shareholder return in Singapore Dollars for the fiscal year ending March 31. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/singapore-temasek-2023-report.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, the company’s net portfolio value also experienced a dip, totaling S$382 billion ($284.77 billion) compared to S$403 billion in the previous year. This marks the first annual shareholder negative return for Temasek since 2020.</p>
<p>This downturn comes as no surprise, considering the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment that has impacted global markets. Lim Boon Heng, Chairman of Temasek recently highlighted the challenging nature of the global market conditions in 2022.</p>
<p>Last year, global stock markets grappled with the challenge of sticky inflation, despite central banks implementing multiple rate hikes. Intensifying geopolitical tensions, such as those between the US and China, as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, added to market volatility and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Notably, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> (INDEXSP: .INX) and MSCI Asia ex-Japan benchmarks both plummeted by around 20%. This slump reflects investor concerns about the impact of rising prices on corporate profitability and economic growth. Against this backdrop, Temasek’s decline in annual shareholder return appears relatively favorable, showcasing its ability to manage risks and mitigate losses.</p>
<p>The Singapore state investment arm maintains a diversified portfolio consisting of both public and private market investments. As of March 31, unlisted assets accounted for 53% of its portfolio, generating higher returns compared to listed assets.</p>
<p>Marking the unlisted portfolio to market would result in an estimated value uplift of S$18 billion. Additionally, Temasek has delivered robust long-term returns, with three-year, ten-year, and twenty-year total shareholder returns of 8%, 6%, and 9% respectively.</p>
<h2>Temasek Cautious Investment Approach</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Temasek disclosed a reversal of gains in its global direct investments in industries such as technology, healthcare, and payments, owing mostly to value derating in the higher interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Consequently, Temasek adopted a cautious approach and slowed down its investment pace, with a net investment of $3 billion in the 12 months ending March 31. Temasek made strategic investments in payment platform Stripe and IT security provider Kaseya, facilitating the acquisition of Datto, a provider of security and cloud-based software solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Temasek has bolstered its investment in Mastronardi Produce Ltd., a Canadian company that specializes in the cultivation and distribution of fresh produce grown in greenhouses. This move reflects Temasek’s confidence in the growth potential of the agriculture and food sector, driven by increasing demand for high-quality, sustainable produce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Temasek has set a limitation on early-stage investments, limiting them to 6% of its portfolio. This metric demonstrates the company&#8217;s sensible risk management approach and recognition of the higher risks associated with early-stage enterprises.</p>
<p>In November, Temasek <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/temasek-275m-investment-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote down</a> its $275 million investment in the bankrupt crypto exchange, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>. Subsequently, the company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/temasek-executives-ftx-stake-compensation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented</a> compensation cuts for the team responsible for recommending the investment and the senior management team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-wall-street/">BlackRock Edges Closer to Bitcoin ETF Launch, Here&#8217;s What It Means for Wall Street</a></p>
<p>Asset management giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> is ever close to launching its exchange-traded fund (ETF). This follows after it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/">applied</a> with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) sometime last month.</p>
<p>Although the SEC has never approved any spot Bitcoin ETF, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1886c3a3-3fb8-411a-b95a-e4667de560d1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">crypto enthusiasts</a> are quite positive about this one. So if successful, then BlackRock will become the first asset manager to launch a fund that tracks the price of bitcoin.</p>
<p>In all of this anticipation, however, the most probable gainers would be the institutional investors. Presently, institutional investors are not legally permitted to buy cryptocurrencies. But all of that could change once BlackRock secures the approval, thereby offering Wall Street a legal and cheap way to access the token.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Anticipates BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>The interest of Wall Street in the approval of BlackRock&#8217;s application might be understandable. Initially, BlackRock&#8217;s push appeared odd considering that the crypto industry is just recovering from what came to be a fatal 2022 for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin has managed to stage a comeback in 2023. And by gaining over 80% to hit the $30,000 mark, investors are now bracing for a potential bull run.</p>
<p>For Wall Street though, they would not want a repeat of 2021&#8217;s miss. Recall that as of early 2021, most top banks still took a somewhat hostile approach to digital assets. Their stance at the time meant that they missed out on a massive run of gains that saw Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price quadruple within a year, and brought the entire crypto industry to be valued at over $2 trillion.</p>
<p>But now, with BlackRock filing for its ETF off the back of another looming rally, Wall Street will seek to tap into the opportunity.</p>
<p>Speaking about his firm&#8217;s recent laser focus on spot ETF, CEO Larry Fink has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likened</a> the token to &#8220;digital gold&#8221;. According to Fink, Bitcoin has all the potential to &#8220;revolutionize&#8221; finance.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/circle-ceo-advocates-yuan-backed-stablecoins/">Circle CEO Advocates for Yuan-Backed Stablecoins Instead of CBDC in China</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jeremy-allaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Allaire</a>, the co-founder and CEO of stablecoin issuer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle Financial</a>, has recently urged Chinese authorities to consider yuan-backed stablecoins as a viable alternative to Central Bank Digital Currencies (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>s). Circle CEO&#8217;s suggestion comes amid China&#8217;s ongoing efforts to develop its own CBDC, the digital yuan.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3227171/head-crypto-firm-circle-accepts-ban-mainland-china-sees-role-yuan-backed-stablecoins?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with the South China Morning Post, the Circle boss highlighted the potential benefits of yuan-backed stablecoins for China&#8217;s international trade and commerce. He emphasized that if the Chinese government aims to see the yuan being widely used around the globe, stablecoins could be the path to achieve that goal. While he acknowledged that stablecoins and CBDCs are complementary, he believes stablecoins offer unique advantages compared to the central banks-issued virtual currencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;If, eventually, the Chinese government wants to see the RMB used more freely in trade and commerce around the world, it may be that stablecoins are the path to do that more than the central bank digital currency,&#8221; he told SCMP in the interview.</p>
<p>The Circle CEO further stressed that these types of cryptocurrencies have the advantage of maintaining the stability and familiarity of a fiat currency while leveraging the benefits of digital assets. By using stablecoins pegged to the yuan, China could enhance the global usability of its money and facilitate seamless cross-border transactions.</p>
<h2>China&#8217;s Strict Policies on Yuan Convertibility Could Hinder Stablecoin Adoption</h2>
<p>While Allaire&#8217;s proposal presents an alternative approach, it is important to consider the potential challenges associated with adopting stablecoins in China. The country has implemented strict capital controls and restrictions on the convertibility of the yuan as part of its economic policies. Experts have suggested that China may prefer to maintain its existing rules and limitations rather than pursue full currency convertibility, as it would require substantial changes to its trade settlement structure. Incremental steps, such as increasing the use of the yuan in trade with commodity-exporting countries, could be more feasible.</p>
<p>Moreover, Allaire&#8217;s proposition recognizes the complementary nature of stablecoins and CBDCs. He emphasized that if central banks upgrade their systems to utilize blockchain technology, it could bring numerous benefits. However, he also highlighted the distinction between the private sector&#8217;s innovative work on the public internet and the central banks&#8217; role in developing CBDCs.</p>
<p>&#8220;If central banks are going to upgrade their own systems to move away from legacy technology into more modern distributed ledger technology, that&#8217;s great. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of useful things from that, but I view that as very different from the work the private sector does to innovate on the public internet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Circle CEO Remains Optimistic about Web 3 Technologies in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>China has been at the forefront of CBDC development, with ongoing trials and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/digital-yuan-9-5b-spent-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilot </a>programs for the digital yuan. The government&#8217;s focus on creating a centralized digital currency aims to enhance financial inclusivity, improve payment efficiency, and strengthen regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>The country banned its citizens in 2021 from engaging in any activities related to the crypto industry, including trading and mining of cryptocurrencies in the country. Allaire believes that while mainland China has maintained its stance against the emerging economy and has not shown a willingness to open up its markets to digital assets, he remains optimistic about the development of Web3 technologies in Hong Kong. He also praised Hong Kong&#8217;s local monetary efforts to regulate stablecoins.</p>
