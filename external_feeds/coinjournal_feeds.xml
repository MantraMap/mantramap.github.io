<ul>
<li>With BRC-30, OKX Wallet users will soon be able to stake BRC-20 tokens and Bitcoin to earn passive income on their digital assets</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=djN5tl1YI3n-fgTWNjU7Z11yepNupe6FKFK4tQmjr7XwkwLirt8TEFQ2dB0PtrVpgZeYXCDddJTNW8IJtF-s0Hln-4JR3B2BKPx3ypDGiTLrafMbQNP4m3SMhGBgO88-Lu-FKAfyfI8U3Qe1BA5sW37WfBkxNJGLXYk4S28SQtYWlrjc7xX0nB3XQ2ay-_hV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>OKX</u></a>, a leading Web3 company, today introduced its <a href="https://www.okx.com/web3/build/docs/bitcoin-ecosystem/brc30-proposal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proposal</a> for a new, open-source BRC-30 protocol that enables staking of BRC-20 tokens and Bitcoin in order to earn BRC-30 tokens. The protocol is open-source and available for all developers to build upon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.okx.com/web3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OKX Wallet</a> will add support for the BRC-30 standard according to the protocol, enabling users to earn passive income by staking BRC-20 tokens or Bitcoin on <a href="https://www.okx.com/web3/earn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Web3 Earn</a> without actively trading. This complements the existing range of curated DeFi earning products already available through the platform.</p>
<p>The introduction of BRC-30 and its staking functionalities is driven by OKX&rsquo;s goal to provide users with additional opportunities to participate in the Bitcoin ecosystem and earn passive income.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>OKX Chief Innovation Officer Jason Lau said</strong>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to have proposed and pioneered the BRC-30 standard to enable Bitcoin and BRC-20 token staking. With the OKX Wallet soon to incorporate BRC-30 support, users will be able to access Bitcoin staking and earn opportunities across multiple-chains. With the Bitcoin ecosystem seeing an explosion of new development, we&rsquo;re proud to work with developers and projects across the community to contribute to the growth of the wider ecosystem.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>OKX is a longstanding supporter of Bitcoin, having integrated the Lightning Network to its centralized exchange over two years ago. OKX Wallet is also the first multi-chain wallet to support BRC-20 trading with the launch of its Ordinals Marketplace, as well as the viewing and transfer of Bitcoin Ordinals.</p>

<li>Bitcoin ended May down 8.0% &ndash; its worth month since November.</li>
<li>Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz is still bullish on BTC.</li>
<li>He explained why this morning on CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Squawk Box&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> just had its worst month since late last year but Michael Novogratz &ndash; the Chief Executive of Galaxy Digital is keeping optimistic on the cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>Novogratz shares his view on Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Novogratz attributed the recent weakness in BTC to a lack of participation from large-scale buyers or the institutional investors.</p>
<p>But the billionaire investor talked of two recent developments this morning on CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/06/01/crypto-is-lackadaisical-right-now-says-galaxy-digital-ceo-michael-novogratz.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squawk Box</a>&rdquo; that he dubbed meaningfully positive for the Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote><p>WeChat enabled bitcoin and crypto trading. That&rsquo;s a big deal. Hong Kong is officially allowing crypto trading for retail customers through regulated exchanges. So, we&rsquo;re seeing Asian adoption.</p></blockquote>
<p>Novogratz also noted that BTC, despite a sell-off in May, is still up 65% year-to-date which makes it one of the best performing assets since the start of 2023.</p>
<h2>Rate cuts will be a positive for Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Novogratz also expects Bitcoin to benefit once the U.S. Federal Reserve starts to <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/markets/when-will-fed-start-cutting-interest-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut interest rates</a> that he sees likely in the final quarter of this year.</p>
<p>To that end, the Galaxy Digital CEO said he would definitely pick BTC over a 5.0% guaranteed return on Treasury Bills if he had to invest $10,000 right now.</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. economy will slow . . . If we see a real slow down in the second half of the year, the Fed will be cutting rates by October and crypto will be off to the races.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further ahead, the total supply of Bitcoin is set to cut in half next year that&rsquo;s historically been a tailwind for price appreciation.</p>

<li dir="ltr">All reserves will be held in segregated accounts at regulated financial institutions.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The FDUSD stablecoin will launch on the BNB Smart Chain.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">First Digital, a Hong Kong-based qualified custodian and registered trust company, has launched a new stablecoin First Digital USD (FDUSD).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The USD-pegged stablecoin will be backed 1:1 with the US dollar reserves and issued by First Digital subsidiary FD121 Limited. The cash or highly liquid reserves will be held in segregated accounts at regulated financial institutions across Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There will be no co-mingling of users&rsquo; funds with the other assets of First Digital Trust, the company noted.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">FDUSD to launch on BNB Smart Chain</h2>
<p dir="ltr">FDUSD is said to be a programmable stablecoin and is set to launch on the BNB Smart Chain. It will be capable of executing financial contracts, escrow services, and insurance, all without intermediaries, the company said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-digital-group-is-propelling-digital-asset-innovation-with-the-launch-of-its-new-stablecoin-fdusd-bridging-stability-with-innovation-to-revolutionise-the-existing-global-financial-landscape-301839437.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> on May 31.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;The launch of this stablecoin represents a major stride forward in our mission to provide a secure and efficient digital currency that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday transactions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that First Digital commits to regulatory compliance, with transparency and robust oversight key to building trust within the stablecoin industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FDUSD&rsquo;s entry into the market comes at a time the crypto industry has welcomed Hong Kong&rsquo;s regulatory framework around the offering of crypto trading to retail investors.</p>
<p>As CoinJournal covered recently, the administrative region&rsquo;s crypto guidelines come into effect as from June 1. &nbsp;A host of platforms, including Huobi and<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinex-launches-bithk-trading-platform-for-hong-kong-users/">&nbsp;<u>CoinEx</u></a> have announced new crypto trading platforms for Hong Kong.</p>

<li dir="ltr">SYS Labs has scheduled the Rollux mainnet launch date as June 28, 2023.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Rollux is an EVM-compatible Layer-2 scaling platform.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The mainnet launch is expected after a successful testnet and positive feedback from the community.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">SYS Labs has announced the mainnet release of its EVM-L2 scaling platform Rollux will be on June 28, 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rollux is an Optimistic rollup fork and will deliver the key features the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a> ecosystem needs to achieve mass adoption &ndash; speed, security, affordability, and scalability.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Rollux testnet successful</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The MakerDAO community has voted to ditch Pax Dollar (USDP) stablecoin worth $500 million from its reserves.</li>
<li>Maker&rsquo;s treasury holds roughly half of the USDP&rsquo;s $1 billion supply.</li>
<li>New York state regulators in February forced Paxos to halt minting Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol MakerDAO&rsquo;s community has <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQYSLHH#vote-breakdown">voted</a> to drop the $500 million worth of USDP stablecoin from its reserves. This is a major blow to the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/search/Pax+dollar">Pax Dollar (USDP)</a> stablecoin since the lending protocol held half of the USDP token supply.</p>
<p>In total, there is a $1 billion USDP token supply and after the vote, Maker will remove all the 500 USDP tokens from its reserves.</p>
<p>After dropping the USDP, MakerDAO, which is the issuer of the $5 billion DAI stablecoin and the governing body of Maker, which is one of the largest lending protocols in <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/defi/">DeFi</a>, will boost its revenues by investing its vast reserves in yield-generating strategies.</p>
<p>Examples of the yield-generating strategies that MakerDAO will invest in include <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/gemini/">Gemini</a>, which pays an incentive to MakerDAO for holding its stablecoin, the GUSD. MakerDAO is also primed to earn a 2.6% yield on the $500 million of USDC it holds from Coinbase Prime.</p>
<h2>Impact on the embattled Paxos</h2>
<p>Paxos was in February forced by New York state regulators to halt minting Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. Since then, the market cap of the BUSD stablecoin has drastically declined from $16 billion to $5 billion according to data from Coingecko.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="https://www.coinlore.com/coin/pax-dollar">Pax dollar metrics</a> remained largely unaffected, the MakerDAO move has a significant impact on Paxos as a company.</p>
<p>The MakerDAO community argued that the USDP did not accrue any revenue for MakerDAO, something that hurt its capital efficiency as it plans to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/makerdao-proposal-eyes-dai-savings-rate-increase-to-3-33/">increase the rewards rate for DAI savings</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/learn/what-are-stablecoins/">Stablecoin</a> issuer Circle has <a href="https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/usdc-to-come-natively-to-arbitrum-f751a30e3d83" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of USDC natively on the Arbitrum blockchain, noting that the release will see native USDC liquidity eventually replace <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>-bridged versions on the Layer 2 protocol.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>USDC issued by Circle will be native to Arbitrum and will be considered the official version of USDC for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over time, native USDC liquidity will grow and replace the currently circulating &ldquo;bridged USDC&rdquo; liquidity that comes from Ethereum</em>,&rdquo; Circle noted via a <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1664256935976132610" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter thread</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Native USDC on Arbitrum is scheduled for June 8, 2023 and will bring ecosystem users benefits such as cross-chain transfer protocol support to remove bridge withdrawal delays. It will also introduce further institutional on and off-ramps via Circle and other partners.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Circle also noted that the Ethereum-bridged USDC on block explorers will change, renamed &ldquo;USDC.e.&rdquo; Apps will also be expected to take similar steps in their app UI and documentation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Arbitrum Foundation will work with ecosystem apps with the aim of facilitating a smooth transition of liquidity from the bridged USDC to native USDC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>There will be no immediate changes to the Arbitrum Bridge &amp; it will continue to operate normally for bridging USDC to-&amp;-from Ethereum</em>,&rdquo; Circle said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Circle&rsquo;s announcement about the launch of USDC natively on Arbitrum comes a few days after the company launched its Euro Coin stablecoin on Avalanche. The company <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/circle-launches-its-euro-backed-stablecoin-on-avalanche/">said</a> it targets multichain support for the euro-backed stablecoin.</p>

<li>The deal will see Sui roll out a series of digital experiences for racing fans.</li>
<li>At press time, the SUI token was trading at $0.9587, down 1.07%.</li>
<li>Oracle Red Bull Racing has made several crypto partnerships recently including with Bybit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sui Blockchain, whose <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/sui-iou-price-spikes-ahead-of-airdrop-mainnet-launch/">mainnet was launched</a> at the beginning of May 2023 has today sealed a multiyear partnership deal with Formula One&rsquo;s Oracle Red Bull Racing team. The deal makes Sui the blockchain partner of the Oracle Red Bull Racing team.</p>
<p>Sui&rsquo;s parent company Mysten Labs is a renowned company since it is one of the two spin-offs of Meta Platform&rsquo;s Diem project. Mysten&rsquo;s sister company is Aptos Labs which is famous for the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/aptos/">Aptos (APT)</a> cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>When the Sui Network mainnet was launched, leading cryptocurrency exchange UPbit announced it was listing two SUI pairs: BTC/SUI and KRW/SUI.</p>
<h2>SUI price reaction</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s partnership announcement is expected to bring some life into the price of the SUI token, which has been on the decline since hitting its all-time high of &nbsp;$1.72 on May 03, 2023, which was immediately after the mainnet launch.</p>

<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>The token has lost 78.75% value in the past month.</p>
<h2>Red Bull&rsquo;s foray into the crypto industry</h2>
<p>This is not the first crypto deal that Red Bull is signing. Last year, the Formula One racing team signed a $150 million deal with Bybit, a derivatives cryptocurrency exchange that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bybit-taps-into-crypto-lending/">recently expanded into crypto lending</a>.</p>
<p>However, commenting on the deal with Sui blockchain, the Oracle Red Bull Racing Team Principal and CEO Christian Horner said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Oracle Red Bull Racing was an early adopter of Blockchain technology in Formula 1. Partnering with Sui will elevate that experience, making access easier, more secure and engaging.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Red Bull Team said that Sui Blockchain will be releasing a series of digital experiences for racing fans over the coming months.</p>

<li>Ethereum gas fee tanked all the way down to under $5 in May.</li>
<li>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink reiterates dedollarisation as a real risk.</li>
<li>Ethereum is currently down more than 10% versus its YTD high.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> gas fee declined by close to 70% in just under a month, data from Santiment &ndash; an on-chain data provider confirmed on Thursday.</p>
<h2>Ethereum gas fee is back under $5</h2>
<p>Interestingly, that said fee was seen at a year-to-date high of $14 per transaction in early May. By the end of the month, though, it tanked all the way down to under $5. The Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1664033290343555073/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>More affordability encourages more utility. Additionally, crypto&rsquo;s number 2 asset is at an all-time low 9.9% on exchanges as selfcustody reigns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, strategists at JPMorgan <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/31/jpmorgan-reveals-900-billion-gold-based-implied-bitcoin-price-alongside-an-ethereum-upgrade-prediction-warning/?sh=617df4be2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> that Ethereum could see a sell-off in the coming months following its recent Shanghai upgrade that shifted the Ethereum network to a more energy efficient proof-of-stake.</p>
<p>ETH is currently down over 10% versus its year-to-date high.</p>
<h2>Could Ethereum surge in coming months?</h2>
<p>On the flip side, though, there are catalysts that could push Ethereum up moving forward as well. For one, <a href="https://coinscreed.com/blackrock-ceos-caution-on-positive-outlook-for-bitcoin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock CEO</a> Larry Fink this week reiterated dedollarisation as a real risk.</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States is jeopardising its reserve currency status with U.S. debt ceiling drama. There will be pockets of problems, like the commercial real estate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The recent banking crisis has also shaken confidence in the fiat currencies. That has also pushed many to crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum which are seen as safer alternatives.</p>
<p>In 2022, BlackRock itself <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrock-launches-spot-bitcoin-private-trust-us-clients-2022-08-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> a spot Bitcoin private trust for U.S. clients and also partnered with the crypto exchange Coinbase.</p>
