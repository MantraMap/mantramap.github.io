<p><strong>BitDAO</strong> created the optimistic rollup known as <strong>Mantle</strong>. It employs a modular structure, where the essential operations of a blockchain are carried out on specialized levels, with the goal of lowering costs and improving overall performance. With <strong>37,000 developers</strong> already signed up for the launch, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158898-bitdao-second-largest-crypto-treasury/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitDAO</a> has opened the testnet.</p>



<p>Before the mainnet launch, which is slated for later in the year, <strong>Mantle</strong> will be able to test and build new features for the chain on the <strong>&#8220;Wadsley&#8221; testnet</strong>. The public can access the testnet, and developers are encouraged to sign up to test their applications on the network.</p>

<p><strong>BitDAO</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147809-bitdaos-layer-2-network-mantle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> Mantle in November as a <strong>modular</strong> <strong>Ethereum Layer 2 networ</strong>k. For handling network operations like a consensus, transaction execution, and settlement, modular networks contain different layers. They are a more recent iteration of the blockchain architecture, as opposed to earlier monolithic chains when all network operations took place on the same base layer.</p>



<p>The<strong> </strong>DAO reaffirmed that <strong>Mantle would provide quicker finality at lower transaction costs</strong>. The announcement also stated that<strong> multi-party computation</strong> would be used by the network. Nodes that are specifically intended to handle off-chain transactions are used in this form of processing.</p>



<p>One way Layer 2 networks function to reduce the risk associated with transactions carried out outside the base layer of a blockchain network is through multi-party computation.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>About MEXC </strong></h2>



<p>MEXC is a cryptocurrency exchange with a wide selection of features and trading options. For purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies with reasonable liquidity and trading volume, the user interface is well-balanced. With its margin,<strong> Futures, P2P, automated trading bots, and copy-trader features, it is more aimed toward severe traders. </strong>As the site does not permit fiat withdrawals to cash out, investors will be unhappy. In conclusion, MEXC is an adequate trading platform that will satisfy the needs of a contemporary cryptocurrency trader.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>1. Features Review</strong></h2>



<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="supported-crypto-assets">Supported Crypto Assets</h3>



<p>With each new project launch, the cryptocurrency market continues to grow. To ensure its customers gain access to the best and most promising cryptocurrencies, MEXC Global operates a rapid coin listing system. The exchange lists&nbsp;<strong>1,588 crypto assets and 2,500+ trading pairs</strong>&nbsp;at the time of writing.<strong> Investors can trade assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano on MEXC. </strong>This benefits investors keen on diversifying across several cryptocurrencies, making MEXC an ideal&nbsp;altcoin trading exchange.</p>



<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="crypto-markets-to-trade">Crypto Markets To Trade</h3>



<p>One of the most important discoveries while researching for this <strong>MEXC exchange review is the plethora of trading options available on the platform. </strong>MEXC has several trading options, including spot trading, margin trading, futures, perpetual contracts, automated trading, and copy trading.</p>

<p>In particular, the derivatives and&nbsp;margin trading crypto platform&nbsp;offer&nbsp;<strong>Leveraged ETFs&nbsp;(exchange-traded funds) focused on cryptocurrencies for 1,000+ assets</strong>, MX-DeFi for mining rewards from retained tokens, and a staking platform. In short, MEXC has one of the most feature-packed services. However, <strong>this list of services mainly targets professional users familiar with the crypto space and its offerings. </strong>As for beginners, the expansive list of trading products could be overwhelming.</p>



<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="copy-trade-cryptocurrencies">Copy-Trade Cryptocurrencies</h3>



<p>Like the best social network and&nbsp;copy-trader platforms for crypto, MEXC has joined suit and enabled this service for its users. Individuals can find and&nbsp;<strong>copy the most profitable crypto traders</strong>&nbsp;on the MEXC platform and replicate their trades. The top traders can be filtered by their total PNL, win rate, total equity, or number of followers. While it is not as popular compared to eToro, which boasts a large number of social traders, it&#8217;s a helpful feature on MEXC for beginners.

<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="leveraged-and-index-etfs">Leveraged and Index ETFs</h3>



<p>Another unique platform feature is the Leveraged ETFs service – an ETF trading targeted at cryptocurrencies. MEXC customers can trade over 1,000 digital currencies with up to&nbsp;<strong>5X leverage</strong>. This increases a user’s purchasing power and could also boost potential profit on a correct market prediction. Its Index ETFs allow investors to diversify their portfolios by investing in multiple assets. This includes the Grayscale Index, Major Crypto Index, and DSA Index, among others.</p>

<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="demo-trading">Demo Trading</h3>



<p>MEXC has recently launched a testnet for its users to demo trade cryptocurrencies and experience the platform before funding an account with real funds. The practice account can be loaded with up to&nbsp;<strong>$50,000 USDT in virtual funds.</strong>&nbsp;The user interface mimics that live platform with real-time crypto prices and the ability to place orders and execute positions like normal. The demo mode can be toggled within the same platform, unlike other tenets for crypto, which require a separate login. To see how the MEXC demo account compares, read this article on the&nbsp;best free crypto demo accounts.</p>

<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="0-trading-fees">0% Trading Fees</h3>



<p>Investors consider the trading fees charged by cryptocurrency exchanges before signing up.<strong> Naturally, traders seek platforms that provide excellent services and charge affordable fees so that profits can be maximized. </strong>Given this, most crypto exchanges charge incredibly low fees to attract investors.</p>



<p>MEXC differentiates itself from its competitors by offering&nbsp;<strong>no fees on the spot market.</strong>&nbsp;This is a promotion that applies to all spot trading pairs on MEXC. For instance, an individual can order to&nbsp;buy Bitcoin&nbsp;without paying any fees.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Its futures derivative trading also starts at a minimal transaction cost of only 0.02% and 0.06% for makers and takers, respectively, which is good value for money. For a list of other&nbsp;crypto exchanges that charge no fees, read this article next.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">MEXC Alternatives &amp; Comparisons</h2>



<p>MEXC has low trading fees, impressive crypto support, and wide investing options targeted at beginners and pro traders alike. <strong>While MEXC shows a substantial lineup of crypto assets, the platform has an average rating of 3 out of 5 on the third-party review platform TrustPilot. </strong>This is understandable, considering the issues that plague MEXC. The platform is not available to US traders, its basic trade option (the Quick Buy/Sell) is limited, and it lacks direct fiat withdrawals.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>2. Token of Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>As per MEXC exchange reviews, the platform is currently compatible solely with fiat currency via the P2P and Credit Trading (instant purchase) features. In general, the P2P function is compatible with a broad array of fiat currencies, viz. USD, CNY, EUR, GBP, etc.</p>



<h5>Supported Cryptocurrencies</h5>



<p><strong>Taking cryptocurrencies into account, MEXC is attuned to many cryptocurrencies:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>MX Token (MX)</li>



<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>



<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>



<li>Eos (EOS)</li>



<li>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</li>



<li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>



<li>Ontology (ONT)</li>



<li>Tron (TRX)</li>



<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>



<li>Bitcoin SV (BSV)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Ethereum Classic (ETC)</li>



<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>



<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>



<li>Dash (DASH)</li>



<li>Neo (NEO)</li>



<li>Chainlink (LINK)</li>



<li>Quantum (QTUM)</li>



<li>Polkadot (DOT)</li>



<li>VeChain (VET)</li>



<li>Stellar (XLM)</li>
</ul>



<p>MEXC trading has won spurs as the first centralized asset service provider supporting the most recent coins and tokens. As per this MEXC exchange review, MEXC Exchange is the ticket for those looking to bypass costly synthesized exchanges and gas fees.</p>



<p><strong>Taking into account the countries MEXC supports, it includes people from all over the world, with the exception of:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>North Korea</li>



<li>Cuba</li>



<li>Sudan</li>



<li>Syria</li>



<li>Iran</li>



<li>Yemen</li>



<li>Zimbabwe</li>



<li>Belarus</li>



<li>Iraq</li>



<li>Crimea</li>



<li>Congo</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Myanmar</li>



<li>Lebanon</li>



<li>Libya</li>



<li>Bolivia</li>



<li>Ecuador</li>



<li>&nbsp;Bangladesh</li>



<li>Somalia</li>



<li>The central African Republic</li>



<li>Kyrgyzstan</li>



<li>The United States</li>



<li>and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>3. Trade on Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>Much like most of the&nbsp;best trading apps for crypto, <strong>MEXC has a standalone mobile app. This is convenient for investors who are constantly moving and prefer trading from their mobile devices on a 24/7 basis.</strong> The MEXC is available for download on Android and iOS devices. The app offers the same trading experience as the web-based platform to&nbsp;seamlessly buy and sell crypto assets&nbsp;and&nbsp;monitor a portfolio&nbsp;with minimal effort. Mobile users also use in-app support to reach out to customer service for guidance which is a valuable feature.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>4. Pros and Cons of Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table has-medium-font-size"><table class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Second-to-none trading experience and platform.</td><td>&nbsp;Trading without margin.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Compatible with a broad array of cryptocurrencies.</td><td>&nbsp;Incompatible with fiat currencies.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Affordable trading fees.</td><td>&nbsp;Occurrences of user complaints.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Availability of a mobile app.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Cutting-edge security features.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Multiple payment methods.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>5. Competitors</strong></h2>



<p>MEXC takes the security of users’ funds quite seriously. New accounts are required to complete KYC and enable 2FA using the Google App authenticator. Once this is done, an anti-phishing code is set up alongside a withdrawal whitelist. Withdrawals are only permitted once the 2FA requirements are met.</p>



<p>Mobile&nbsp;number and email verification are also set up to improve the platform&#8217;s security. Alongside this, the platform&nbsp;<strong>s</strong>tores most of the crypto assets in a cold storage wallet, which is currently the safest means of securing crypto assets from cyberattacks.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>MEXC Exchange is the ideal platform for selling popular coins and tokens. As the first centralized exchange supporting the assets, it has achieved success in the market. Due to its comprehensive features, the platform is ideal for all types of traders.</p>



<p>The website&#8217;s poor English translation feature, which makes it challenging for English-speaking users to access the site, is one of its worrying aspects. The majority of customer support is provided by email, which is, by and large, a responsive, efficient, and convenient service to use. The site has been deemed safe in numerous reviews. Before making any kind of investment, this MEXC exchange review advises traders to read additional reviews about the site.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;This officially terminates the Earn Program and requires Genesis to return all assets outstanding in the program(…). Existing redemption requests are not completed and continue to await fulfillment by Genesis.&#8221;</p>
<cite>Gemini told customers in an email on Tuesday.</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>A Genesis official issued a statement that the company &#8220;does not agree with all of Gemini&#8217;s claims&#8221;</strong> and expressed disappointment that Gemini is &#8220;conducting a public media campaign despite ongoing beneficial private dialogue between the parties.&#8221; The statement said, &#8220;We are dedicated to moving as quickly as possible, but this is a very complex process that will take additional time.</p>



<p>Following the bankruptcy of FTX, the loan division of cryptocurrency broker Genesis ceased customer withdrawals in November. It was locked up with customer money from Gemini Earn. Gemini Earn billed as an interest-earning account for bitcoin deposits, was introduced in February 2021, and genesis provided the yield investors in Gemini Earn got.</p>



<p>Gemini&#8217;s termination took effect on January 8. <strong>The firm had earlier given CEO Barry Silbert of DCG, Genesis&#8217; parent company, a deadline of January 2 in a public letter</strong>. Additionally, Silbert was charged in the letter with &#8220;engaging in bad faith stall tactics&#8221; during discussions.</p>



<p>As was updated in a previous Coincu News article, on January 10, <strong>Gemini co-founder Winklevoss wrote another public letter calling for the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159312-gemini-ceo-requests-fire-barry-silbert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decision to resign from Silbert</a> </strong>and accusing DCG and Genesis of committing crimes of accounting fraud. The fraud allegation resurfaced in a lawsuit Gemini filed in court that same day in response to a class action lawsuit brought by Gemini Earn customers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-629.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="636" height="382" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-629.png" alt="Gemini Has Ended Its Earn Program And Asks Genesis To Refund All Locked Assets" class="wp-image-159412" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-629.png 636w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-629-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" title="Gemini Has Ended Its Earn Program And Asks Genesis To Refund All Locked Assets 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Immediately after the resignation request was made, Silbert also wrote a letter to his shareholders to clarify the situation of DCG and Genesis. Still, <strong>there needed to be a mention of offering a solution to the increased debt of up to $900 million for Gemini.</strong></p>



<p>Customers had agreed to &#8220;arbitrate any claims related to the Gemini Earn program&#8221; and that plaintiffs&#8217; claims and causes of action &#8220;should not be tried in any venue Genesis is joined,&#8221; so Gemini further stated all claims in the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The decision was made in the midst of a national security investigation into Binance. Th<strong>e US that Voyager is attempting to accelerate</strong>.</p>



<p>Judge Michael Wiles permitted Voyager to sign the asset acquisition agreement and request creditor approval on January 10 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, but the sale won&#8217;t be complete until a subsequent court hearing, according to a Jan. 11 Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/voyager-seeks-expedite-national-security-review-binance-deal-2023-01-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.</p>



<p>It happens when Voyager is trying to hasten the review of its request to sell assets to Binance. US, which can cause the agreement to be delayed or blocked.</p>



<p>During the court hearing, <strong>Voyager&#8217;s attorney Joshua Sussberg stated that the company has been responding to inquiries from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)</strong> and will address any issues the committee may have that could lead it to oppose the deal.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are coordinating with Binance and their attorneys to not only deal with that inquiry, but to voluntarily submit an application to move this process along,&#8221; Sussberg said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>CFIUS is an interagency organization that assesses foreign investments in or acquisitions of American businesses for potential threats to national security.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">CFIUS finds that the transaction raises legitimate national security concerns</h2>

<p>If CFIUS finds that the transaction raises legitimate national security concerns, it may prohibit or reverse the transaction or order the parties to make changes to allay the concerns.</p>



<p>On December 30, CFIUS notified the court that <strong>&#8220;one or more transactions anticipated&#8221; </strong>by Voyager may be the subject of a review, which might lead to delays or blockages.</p>



<p>The U.S. attorney&#8217;s office is apparently looking into Binance&#8217;s global operation amid allegations of money laundering, but Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, the CEO, has denied any wrongdoing. <strong>US has its main office in California and bills itself as &#8220;totally independent.</strong>&#8220;</p>



<p>Zhao is a Chinese-born citizen of Canada, and CFIUS is empowered to examine any transactions that potentially give a foreign person equity interest in or control over a U.S. company.</p>



<p>The <strong>Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors</strong>, which represents creditors without security interests in Voyager, supported the deal in its current form, pointing out that it would yield more significant recoveries for creditors than if Voyager liquidated its holdings itself, as would happen if CFIUS rejects the deal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>The bankrupt lender had already refuted <strong>Jan. 8 objections to the acquisition proposal from Alameda Research, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), four US states, and the US trustee.</strong></p>



<p>It stated that the deal serves the interests of its creditors to the greatest extent possible and that the objections &#8220;fail to put up any factual or legal evidence&#8221; for their claims. Voyager announced their agreement with Binance on December 19.</p>



<p>US&#8217;s offer to purchase its assets in the $1.022 billion transaction following the prior $1.4 billion agreement with FTX. After the collapse of the crypto exchange, the US failed.</p>

<p>It is known that the relationship between the two founders of DCG and Gemini broke down after Genesis announced to stop withdrawing money in November 2022. This locked the funds belonging to investors in the Earning product and Gemini&#8217;s money, leaving Gemini struggling to find a way to get its customers&#8217; money back.</p>



<p>Currently, <strong>Gemini Earn program has also stopped working</strong>, and <strong>Gemini&#8217;s side has issued a request to return all locked assets</strong> to Gemini.</p>



<p>In the body of the letter, DCG CEO Barry Silbert introduced more details about Genesis Capital&#8217;s lending division in a letter to investors. He noted that <strong>DCG has laid off employees and closed its crypto asset management headquarters.</strong></p>



<p>He also asserted that <strong>funds had never been mixed between DCG subsidiaries</strong> and that its relationship with <strong>Three Arrows Capital was limited to a loan and transaction agreement</strong>, which the company further invested in some products of Grayscale.</p>

<p>During the Q&amp;A session, Silbert addressed the controversy surrounding Genesis and its client Gemini. He said DCG borrowed from Genesis Capital, but <strong>&#8220;these loans are made on a free basis and are priced at prevailing market rates.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p><strong>DCG and Genesis Capital have a $1.1 billion promissory note maturing in 2032</strong>, and DCG currently owes Genesis $447.5 million and 4,550 bitcoins, worth about $78 million.</p>



<p>Regarding DCG&#8217;s role in the restructuring of Genesis Capital, Silbert said that due to the debts and promissory notes that DCG owes Genesis Capital, DCG executives, including those on the Genesis board of directors, <strong>do not have decision-making power regarding the restructuring of Genesis Capital.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Because of the outstanding loans and the promissory note that DCG owes to Genesis Capital, DCG executives, including those on the Genesis board, have no decision-making authority related to any restructuring of Genesis Capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>Starting on Tuesday, users can only create vaults for the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152104-curve-finance-be-integrating-with-zksync-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve Finance</a> liquidity tokens, a stablecoin exchange program. These vaults will employ <strong>veCRV</strong>, a Curve time-locked token that enables users to significantly increase their yield benefits.</p>

<p>The permissionless vaults are a component of a larger V3 strategy, which seeks to completely decentralize the user-facing services and products provided by Yearn in the future.</p>



<p>Users have only been able to access vaults made by the project developers and contributors thus far. Anyone can now develop their own strategies and market them on Yearn, where other interested users can deposit their own tokens and receive dividends, thanks to the advent of the permissionless vault factory.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://cryptofees.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>, over <strong>$100,000 in fees</strong> were earned on Curve in the last 24 hours and distributed to users and liquidity providers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Over time, this might expand Yearn&#8217;s user base and draw additional liquidity to the well-liked DeFi application. When Yearn charges a fraction of the rewards as fees for its yield-aggregation service, it generates revenue based on customer liquidity.</p>



<p>Last October, <strong>yearn.finance</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/131900-yearnfinance-launches-vaults-on-optimism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it launched opportunities for Yearn vaults on <strong>Optimism</strong>, which provides farming for some vaults such as DAI, WBTC, WETH, USDC, and <strong>sUSD</strong>. Furthermore, with strategies that farm on several <strong>DeFi</strong> mainstays like <strong>Aave, Velo, Uniswap, Curve, Stargate</strong>, and <strong>Ironbank</strong> &#8211; Optimism fans may now receive the same Yearn unbreakable risk management framework with increased earnings.</p>

<li><em>Avalanche-based lending protocol Defrost Finance declared that the refund contract had been set up on the Avalanche C-Chain. Users who were impacted by the prior hack may begin requesting refunds on January 11 at 0:01 UTC.</em></li>



<li><em>According to Defrost, the contract will have a 100-day hold on the fund. It recommended clients submit refund requests as soon as feasible.</em></li>



<li><em>Defrost was abused in the past. A malicious pricing oracle was employed, along with the addition of a phony collateral token to liquidate existing users.</em></li>

<p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong>, CEO of JPMorgan, referred to Bitcoin as a &#8220;<strong>decentralized Ponzi scheme</strong>&#8221; when speaking at the<strong> 41st Annual Healthcare Conference</strong> hosted by JP Morgan.</p>



<p><strong>In 2017</strong>, he stated that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159187-bitcoin-on-track-for-a-major-breakout-2023/">Bitcoin</a> was <strong>a well-known &#8220;scam&#8221;</strong> and that any <strong>JPMorgan trader who was</strong> <strong>caught trading BTC would be sacked immediately</strong>. After that, Dimon became somewhat more open-minded, even going so far as to say that he thinks the blockchain technology has some potential.</p>



<p>Despite its CEO&#8217;s aversion to cryptocurrencies, the JPMorgan Group has shown <strong>interest in blockchain technology on multiple occasions</strong>. Dimon was unwavering in his opposition to bitcoin. According to Dimon,<strong> bitcoin is a speculative &#8220;asset&#8221;</strong> that will never be able to replace fiat currency or develop into an effective payment system.</p>

<p>He stated that cryptocurrencies are frequently used for <strong>unethical endeavors </strong>and pointed to the fact that the majority of people own them as<strong> investment vehicles due to the volatility of their pricing</strong> rather than to purchase goods and services. He said that this is because cryptocurrencies are decentralized and anyone can create their own cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Although Dimon is not<strong> as caustic in his criticism of cryptocurrencies</strong> as he was <strong>in 2017</strong>, he continues to consider them as<strong> hazardous speculative instruments</strong> that have no real value. This is despite the fact that he was less severe in his criticism of cryptocurrencies in 2017.</p>



<p><strong>In October</strong>, Dimon criticized Bitcoin by calling it<strong> &#8220;dirty&#8221; and &#8220;expensive,</strong>&#8221; expressing his distaste of the cryptocurrency. <strong>In Decembe</strong>r, he explained the cryptocurrency by comparing it to little rocks that you keep as pets.</p>

<p><strong>Armstrong</strong> <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/a-message-from-ceo-and-co-founder-brian-armstrong-to-coinbase-employees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> after assessing the company&#8217;s chances for 2023:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As we examined our 2023 scenarios, it became clear that we would need to reduce expenses to increase our chances of doing well in every scenario. While it is always painful to part ways with our fellow colleagues, there was no way to reduce our expenses significantly enough, without considering changes to headcount.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to its <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/2f0eb2cd-0f3c-4a4c-a23a-e715caf96394.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8K filing</a>, the exchange projects that the restructuring costs associated with these actions will amount to <strong>between $149 million and $163 million</strong>. Of this, monetary charges for employee severance and other termination payments will total <strong>between $58 and $68 milli</strong>on. The cost of stock-based compensation for the layoffs will range<strong> from $91 million to $95 million</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of this year, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158089-coinbase-pays-100-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> expenditures anticipate recognizing these costs. <strong>Armstrong</strong> cautioned there is a possibility of more spread following the impact of dishonest actors in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>As the <strong>U.S. Federal Reserve</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/134929-fed-officials-intend-rates-aggressively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised</a> interest rates to <strong>14-year highs </strong>to combat scorching inflation, <strong>Armstrong</strong> also noted that the value of cryptocurrencies trended lower throughout 2022.</p>



<p>In <strong>June 2022</strong>, Coinbase <a href="https://news.coincu.com/98811-coinbase-lays-off-1100-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off</a> <strong>1,100 employees</strong>, or <strong>18%</strong> of its workforce, and another <strong>60 workers</strong> in <strong>November 2022</strong>.</p>
