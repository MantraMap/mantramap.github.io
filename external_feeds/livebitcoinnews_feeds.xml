										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly half a billion dollars has been <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/half-billion-dollars-mysteriously-disappears-111248374.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">taken out of the now</a> failed FTX exchange, and nobody really seems to know where the money went.</p>
<h2>Money Is Missing from FTX</h2>
<p>Spokespeople for the crypto exchange claim that “unauthorized transactions” are what caused the money to disappear, and it is being said that the company might have been hacked and the money stolen. The question is, “By who?”</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the company has moved whatever funds it still had into cold storage to ensure no further illicit transactions could occur. FTX is also working with law enforcement agents and regulators to figure out what might have happened.</p>
<p>Frances Coppola – an independent financial and economic commentator – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ll have to wait and see what the fallout is, but I think we are going to see more dominoes falling and an awful lot of people stand to lose their money and their savings, and that is just tragic, really.</p></blockquote>
<p>FTX is likely to go down in history as one of the biggest embarrassments to ever occur within the digital currency space. Founded in 2019, the company was relatively new still at the time of its collapse. By some miracle, the firm rose to prominence rather easily during the three years that it was fully alive, and many credited its founder Sam Bankman-Fried as something of a genius.</p>
<p>They wondered how he could make a company get so big in so little time, but clearly, things weren’t done well enough to ensure the firm could remain afloat.</p>
<p>Trouble for the firm began in mid-November when it was announced that FTX was experiencing <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">something of</a> a “liquidity crunch.” Apparently, the firm didn’t have enough money on hand due to mismanaged financial accounts and the FTT token, which is the native cryptocurrency of the exchange, saw massive dips in its price.</p>
<p>The company went to Binance for <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">help and for a while</a>, it was being reported that the larger firm was potentially going to buy the smaller one, but within 24 hours or so, Binance announced on social media that it was dropping out of the deal, saying that FTX’s problems were simply too big to handle.</p>
<p>From there, the enterprise became the latest big name in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto to undergo bankruptcy</a> proceedings, and Sam Bankman-Fried has since resigned from the company, claiming in a recent message that he had “f*cked up.”</p>
<h2>Many Want Regulation</h2>
<p>The incident is causing <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/congress-wants-to-really-regulate-crypto-after-ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">many members of Congress</a> to (unsurprisingly) revoice their desires for hardcore crypto regulation.</p>
<p>Not long ago, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/brad-sherman-billionaires-have-prevented-crypto-regulation-from-forming/" data-wpel-link="internal">Congressman Brad Sherman</a> – a known crypto skeptic – cited FTX as the reason as to why he was now looking to establish serious regulation as a means of preventing something like this from ever happening again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brad Sherman – a cryptocurrency skeptic and congressman – says <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/us-congressman-brad-sherman-holds-billionaire-crypto-bros-responsible-for-delayed-cryptocurrency-legislation/ar-AA145hay" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">crypto billionaires are</a> largely responsible for the fact that digital asset regulation has taken so long to arrive.</p>
<h2>Brad Sherman Wants Regulation NOW</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Sherman said that the collapse of the leading exchange FTX in mid-November is reason enough to get the ball rolling on digital currency regulation. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The collapse this week of one of the largest cryptocurrency firms in the world has been a dramatic demonstration of both the inherent risks of digital assets and the critical weaknesses in the industry that have grown up around them. For years, I have advocated for Congress and federal regulators to take an aggressive approach in confronting the many threats to our society posed by cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, Congress has been pushing for hardcore crypto <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/regulation/" data-wpel-link="internal">regulation</a> for some time. It appears lawmakers either don’t trust the space, or they’re trying hard to impose on our freedoms even further. In any case, there are those that argue for crypto regulation, and those that argue against it, and there hasn’t been much headway in the space over the last few years.</p>
<p>Those that say crypto regulation is a negative feel so because it allegedly goes against everything the digital currency space stands for. They say the point of crypto is to give traders full financial autonomy and independence, and thus they shouldn’t be prone to the same third parties, prying eyes, and middlemen that one often sees in the traditional financial sector. Thus, the regulatory aspects of this world should be left out of the equation.</p>
<p>Others, however, feel that crypto regulation is necessary precisely because it has given way to a lot of malicious behavior from individuals who feel they can get away with everything they do because of a lagging legal presence. Many feel that what happened with FTX occurred simply because the space is unregulated, and that this may not have happened if the right laws were in place.</p>
<p>Sherman clearly falls into the latter category. He continued his interview with:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Regulators] are reacting to an industry that is evolving constantly, but overregulation could stifle that innovation… poorly thought-out regulation could create a two-fold issue. First, it could limit US consumers’ ability to participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and it could also drive these businesses to less regulated jurisdictions. This creates more risk for customers as it puts them in a position of dealing with less regulated institutions to participate in the ecosystem.</p></blockquote>
<h2>He&#8217;s Working on the Issues at Hand</h2>
<p>Sherman announced he is now planning to work with his associates to establish full, long-term financial regulation for the crypto space.</p>
<p>He believes it will be executed with the aid and cooperation of executives working in the crypto arena.</p>

<h2>Lauren Duncan Nearly Became Another Crypto Victim</h2>
<p>Duncan, like many people in America, was looking for love online one day and went so far as to join Hinge, a dating app that’s designed to be deleted once a person has found their special someone. Duncan indeed found someone special, but for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old former airline worker divorced her husband roughly ten years ago and admits to not having dated anyone since (it’s likely she’ll never date anyone else again after this event). She decided, at least temporarily, to jump back into the dating mix and created her profile on Hinge, thus prompting several messages to come in from potential suitors.</p>
<p>One – a man known as Matteo Thomas – hailed from Jacksonville, Florida, and seemed to be everything she wanted at first. She looked deeper into Thomas’ profile to see if he was real or just a figment of her overactive (and romance-themed) imagination. She said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>He sent me a rose (emoji), which caught my attention. You can send a rose, and that’s like they are really interested in you.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the texts Duncan received from him read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am lovely, caring, and romantic.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then forwarded her several pictures of himself. Later digging led to these same photos being discovered on several websites that track imposters, meaning Thomas was never who he claimed to be, though Duncan was late in realizing this. The pictures sent were later tracked to a medical technician that lives in Hamburg, Germany. He is nowhere near Jacksonville, and all the photos Duncan received were not of her actual suitor.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long before he began pressuring her to invest in a new crypto opportunity. Interestingly, Duncan says she began to sense something was wrong during this conversation, and she immediately went back to him and explained that she wasn’t interested in investing at that time. She went with her gut and when she was told to invest approximately $3K, she immediately alerted Hinge as to what she felt was going on.</p>
<h2>You Need to Have a Careful Eye Out</h2>
<p>Brian Watson – a veteran with the Orlando-based Secret Service – says these scams often result in people seeing returns on their investments, though they are never able to withdraw them as the platforms are controlled by malicious actors. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You’re not going to get these returns anywhere. Some people are re-mortgaging their homes because they think the money is real and they can make a killing on it. The bad guys are taking it to the bank and cashing out.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been so many years, and yet the shadows of the dark web platform <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/silk-road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/silk-road/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540093481000&amp;usg=AOvVaw03ji7wWn_XyC_56P8oI4iS" data-wpel-link="internal">Silk Road</a> are still with us. Silk Road operated under the illicit hand of Ross Ulbricht and was known for being a market where individuals could pay for drugs, guns, and other illegal items with bitcoin and cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>A Lot of Silk Road Money Has Suddenly Turned Up</h2>
<p>Now, it appears the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/us-doj-announces-seizure-of-3-36b-in-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/us-doj-announces-seizure-of-3-36b-in-cryptocurrency/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540093481000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1PpgGzdJKA23YnbXKpKtOC" data-wpel-link="exclude">seized more than</a> $3 billion in BTC from a man that “unlawfully obtained” about 50,000 units of the world’s number one digital currency by market cap from the dark market back in 2012. James Zhong of Gainesville, Georgia pleaded guilty in early November to committing wire fraud in September of that year and now faces as many as 20 years in jail. To think… Ross Ulbricht may soon have a new cellmate, one that was a former customer.</p>
<p>The money was seized from Zhong’s home back in 2021. At the time, the money was worth a whopping $3.36 billion. The assets were found in a safe under the floor and on a single-board computer hidden under blankets in a popcorn tin in Zhong’s bathroom.</p>
<p>Over $600K in cash was also recovered from the dwelling, as well as 25 individual Casascius coins and several gold and silver bars, meaning the DOJ has recovered a massive amount of money.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of the bitcoin has been unknown to authorities for a minimum of ten years, according to U.S. attorney Damian Williams. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/doj-seizes-usd3-36-billion-in-second-largest-bitcoin-recovery-on-record-6826287" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.investopedia.com/doj-seizes-usd3-36-billion-in-second-largest-bitcoin-recovery-on-record-6826287&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540093481000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GO73o_4_rwIVLLKdrRpJE" data-wpel-link="exclude">In a press release</a>, he commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>For almost ten years, the whereabouts of this massive chunk of missing bitcoin had ballooned into an over $3.3 billion mystery… This case shows that we won’t stop following the money, no matter how expertly hidden, even to a circuit board in the bottom of a popcorn tin.</p></blockquote>
<p>The event marks the largest crypto seizure by the DOJ in history and its second largest financial seizure.</p>
<p>Silk Road is widely considered one of the main factors that has prevented bitcoin and digital currencies from entering mainstream territory. Many are concerned that these assets are utilized for criminal activities and thus should not be permitted as payment tools for everyday items and services. It can be argued that Silk Road is part of the reason as to why so many individuals feel uncomfortable around digital assets.</p>
<h2>Ross Ulbricht Created the Organization</h2>
<p>As the man in charge, Ross Ulbricht operated under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts” and launched the site in 2011. The market was well-known for its money laundering activities and for allowing individuals to purchase and sell illegal drugs with and for bitcoin.</p>
<p>By 2013, however, the site had been fully shut down by authorities in the U.S. and Ulbricht was later <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/convicted-silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-sentenced-to-life-in-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/convicted-silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-sentenced-to-life-in-prison/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540093481000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3lu2cnqX_vTkJHN-7Ni5oc" data-wpel-link="external">handed a life sentence</a> for his alleged crimes.</p>

The non-profit is built to bring industry leaders together to discuss the major challenges the crypto industry brings to the region and to see how best to integrate crypto into everyday life.</p>
<h2>The MEAACBA Will Seek to Strengthen the Crypto Space</h2>
<p>Among the financial companies that have already joined the MEAABA include Bit Oasis, a Dubai-based digital currency exchange; Mid Chains, a trading platform; Crypto.com; Binance, and Rain Financial in Bahrain. Abu Dhabi says it wants to become the world’s leading financial hub, and it hopes to make crypto a staple of living and working in the region.</p>
<p>The MEAACBA chairman Ahmed Al Zaabi explained in a recent speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>The UAE is heading to become one of the best international financial centers, and we want to be a recognized contributor to the development of the diversified and sustained development of the UAE economy. We strongly believe that MEAACBA will constantly contribute towards the bolstering of the UAE’s digital economy and adoption… and will have an impact in the region and globally.</p></blockquote>
<p>Abu Dhabi is widely considered amongst several industry heads to be in a great place when it comes to crypto adoption. Stuart Isted – general manager for the Middle East and Africa branches of Crypto.com – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the US and UK market, they don’t have the same regulatory framework and intent from the regulator to build out an industry from the ground up, which is what the UAE has done.</p></blockquote>
<p>The UAE has cemented its position in the digital currency arena by being one of the few nations out there to instill appropriate regulatory tactics for the growing arena. Just a few weeks ago, Dubai said that it was now <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/dubai-is-instilling-a-new-set-of-crypto-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/dubai-is-instilling-a-new-set-of-crypto-rules/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540093486000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Azjti13i73iEQn0d_lICC" data-wpel-link="internal">working to initiate a</a> new set of crypto-based laws that would ensure all traders remain safe and secure when engaging in transactions and that illicit actors had fewer opportunities to get involved in blockchain.</p>
<p>Like all crypto fanatics, Abu Dhabi has been suffering from the ongoing crypto winter. Jehanzeb Awan – chairman of the new association and founding partner of J Awan &amp; Partners in Dubai – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have had some very nice springs and summers, but also cold and chilly winters. Businesses are built on principles, not seasons. Therefore, we need a lot of effort to bring all industry players together.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Building Things from the Bottom Up</h2>
<p>According to Joseph Dallago – chief executive and co-founder of Rain Financial – 2022 has presented several opportunities to focus on the fundamentals of the crypto space rather than just prices. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of people focus on the speculative nature of the industry, but this year is a chance to focus on the fundamentals of the industry.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain technology and artificial intelligence were designed to solve different tasks. However, they can also be used together to solve long-standing problems in different industries. Blockchain and AI are currently used in sectors such as the automobile industry, supply chain and logistics, healthcare, media and entertainment, insurance, and more. It is also being implemented by AIWORK to address long-standing issues plaguing the online video space.</p>
<p>There are plenty of use cases where a combination of both technologies can be used. One industry that is being completely transformed by blockchain and AI is the financial services industry. This article will take a look at the role blockchain, and AI are playing in transforming finance.</p>
<h4><strong>What Is Blockchain Technology And AI?</strong></h4>
<p>Blockchain technology is a familiar concept, where a shared, immutable ledger allows users to share data with multiple users and initiate and complete transactions. Blockchains also store data and transaction details and can track orders, accounts, payments, production, goods, etc. Blockchain technology guarantees the fidelity and security of data and information stored on it without needing a third party.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), on the other hand, refers to machines capable of simulating human intelligence. AI-powered machines are capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intervention. They can also think like humans, mimic actions, and exhibit various qualities associated with the human mind, such as learning and problem-solving. AI can also partake in decision-making processes, rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specified outcome. AI can also learn from data sets provided to it and get smarter and more efficient over time.</p>
<h4><strong>What Do They Have In Common?</strong></h4>
<p>Blockchain technology and AI are the definition of “opposites attract” because they don’t have much in common. However, what they do have in common is that both are leading innovations in the world today and have several use cases, both individually and in tandem. However, both play entirely different roles. Blockchain technology acts as a decentralized, immutable, and secure storage, while AI can process vast amounts of data but is typically centralized and opaque.</p>
<p>Blockchain struggles with efficiency and scalability, while AI has problems when it comes to transparency and privacy. This makes them ideal for one another, as they can address each other’s weaknesses. Using blockchain provides trust, privacy, and accountability to AI and its processes, while AI provides scalability and efficiency to the blockchain.</p>
<h4><strong>How Are Blockchain And AI Chaning Finance?</strong></h4>
<p>The financial industry has always been a leader when it comes to innovation and the implementation of new technologies, as it needs to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to security and data protection. So how is implementing blockchain technology and AI changing the financial ecosystem? For starters, AI can process data at exponential speeds, allowing financial institutions to leverage a significant amount of data and extract more insights, automate any repetitive tasks, and help make processes more efficient.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is complementing this by adding greater transparency to financial processes. It also enables better access to financial markets through decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts.</p>
<p>So, blockchain technology and AI can greatly improve finance by processing data faster, enabling transparency and decentralization, and introducing smart contracts. Let’s understand how exactly.</p>
<h4><strong>Securing Payment Networks</strong></h4>
<p>One of the most significant benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to function as a borderless payment network and enable frictionless payments involving low transaction costs. However, despite these concerns, lingering concerns around security hindered adoption. However, leveraging AI can help identify any inconsistent account activity and trigger human involvement. Additionally, other AI-related technologies, such as biometrics and behavioral analysis, can further eliminate any vulnerabilities.</p>
<h4><strong>Greater Efficiency</strong></h4>
<p>Financial systems that implement blockchain and AI solutions are typically looking to deliver improved speed and quality of services. By combining the two technologies to drive business processes, financial institutions can maximize their returns while also providing greater value to their customers.</p>
<h4><strong>Cheaper And Faster Payments</strong></h4>
<p>Most bank transactions are slow and cumbersome. Compare this with blockchain-based cross-border payments, which are quick and inexpensive because they cut out the middleman from the transaction. Implementing AI can further increase the speed and efficiency of transactions by reducing human intervention. Additionally, AI can help banks automate payment workflows by implementing image recognition in financial documents and using natural language processing to support payments.</p>
<h4><strong>In Closing</strong></h4>
<p>The current financial industry is highly centralized. The implementation of blockchain technology and AI can usher in a new era for finance, characterized by faster transaction speeds, increased transparency, and better security. The integration of AI would make it possible to process large amounts of data, while blockchain would improve transparency, security, and data management. However, while both show considerable promise, both have to be carefully integrated with currency operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TokenSociety Acquires All Dippies NFT IP And Will Continue To Develop Dippies NFT Initiatives While Integrating The NFT Project Into Existing Partnerships</em></p>
<p><strong>Cheyenne, Wyoming &#8211; December 15, 2022 &#8211;</strong> <a href="https://tokensociety.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Token Society, Inc.</a>, a Web3 incubator and metaverse project launchpad, announced today the acquisition of all of the intellectual property and assets of the <a href="https://www.dippies.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dippies NFT</a> and Dippies Vans NFT Projects based on a vote by the Dippies community council.</p>
<p>Dippies is a music-driven NFT project which has collaborated with <a href="https://www.deathrowofficial.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Death Row Records</a>, Snoop Dogg, Champ Medici, and Steve Aoki. The project was launched in March 2022, initially sold 8,888 NFTs, and later released 11K+ Dippies Vans NFTs to NFT holders to be used in a play-to-earn (P2E) racing game and as the holders’ key to the Dippieverse metaverse. To date, the two NFT collections have traded a combined 9,345 ETH in secondary trading volume on Opensea.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the acquisition, TokenSociety.io shall continue to develop the DippiesRaces P2E racing game which will now be enhanced to include a multi-player augmented reality version that <a href="https://altar.is/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Altar, Inc.</a> will develop. In addition, the Dippies NFT and Dippies Vans NFT owners will also have access to several other P2E games and metaverse spaces currently being developed by TokenSociety including MERCHX, <a href="https://www.xr.casino/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CasinoXR</a>, and <a href="https://unitea.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">UniteaMeta</a>.</p>
<p>TokenSociety shall also integrate the Dippies community into their ecosystem of Web2 and Web3 companies, granting Dippies NFT owners access to a long list of utilities including access to live events hosted by TokenSociety, major music festivals hosted by Unitea Music, and opportunities to participate in television shows and movies currently in development with <a href="https://www.archstoneent.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Archstone Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Dippies NFTs shall also be integrated into the <a href="https://shopx.co/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SHOPX</a> Web3 e-commerce platform. This will grant owners of Dippies NFTs the ability to utilize their Dippies NFT to access the SHOPX app in lieu of the SHOPX Licensing Token in order to create token-gated e-commerce stores. TokenSociety will also work with the Dippies NFT owners to develop intellectual property and products with their Dippies NFTs which can be monetized on the SHOPX platform or other distribution channels.</p>
<p>“The original vision of the Dippies project was to build a global community of rebellious individuals helping to create a more free world through decentralized business ventures. TokenSociety acquired this ethos and will bring it to life with the growing list of projects and strategic partnerships within our ecosystem”  Scott H. Weissman, co-founder and CEO. He added,  “We are excited to work with the Dippies NFT owners to develop valuable IP while providing the best metaverse and IRL experiences for the community.”</p>
<p><strong>About Token Society, Inc.</strong></p>
<p>Token Society, Inc, aka TokenSociety.io, is a Web3 incubator and metaverse project launchpad that owns the Gay Aliens Society (Gen 1) NFT, Dippies NFT, and Dippies Vans NFT.

<p><strong> </strong><strong>About Dippies NFT</strong></p>
<p>Dippies are modern-day adaptations of hippies, with the same values. Ones that are more in touch with society, but who are still quietly carving their own path. Rather than refusing to take part in the system, Dippies are building businesses to layer themselves out of the system. The Dippies Van NFTs can be used in the DippieRaces P2E game and tuned up in the DippieGarage. Vote on future initiatives for the Dippieverse and join IRL events with like-minded individuals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The blockchain arena is getting a big boost from financial giant JPMorgan, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/11/06/a-massive-step-jpmorgan-just-made-a-surprize-game-changing-bet-on-crypto-despite-2-trillion-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-crash/?sh=76aa15a1652d" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/11/06/a-massive-step-jpmorgan-just-made-a-surprize-game-changing-bet-on-crypto-despite-2-trillion-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-crash/?sh%3D76aa15a1652d&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540093491000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NrNRYcZfXskwv5dg9dOF9" data-wpel-link="exclude">which recently completed</a> its first cross-border transaction using the technology that’s become so prominent in the crypto space.</p>
<h2>JPMorgan Is Giving Defi a Real Boost</h2>
<p>The transaction occurred in the decentralized finance (defi) arena, thus bringing one of the world’s largest monetary institutions to the world of autonomous banking. The move is being hailed as a real clincher for digital currency, and many believe this will push the space to new heights and broader levels of mainstream attention.</p>
<p>JPMorgan utilized Polygon to perform the transaction. Polygon is a blockchain system based on Ethereum technology. It’s a modified version of AAVE and is designed to help ETH scale while giving traders the opportunity to lend and borrow digital funds without the aid of third parties.</p>
<p>Mikkel Morch – chairman at the digital asset hedge fund ARK36 – commented in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto enthusiasts have never doubted that innovation coming out of this space (especially innovation in defi) has the potential to make international banking cheaper, faster, and more efficient. Now, the giants of traditional finance are starting to confirm that by using defi protocols as a viable solution for streamlining international monetary trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>The irony of the situation is that JPMorgan has not always been kind to crypto. It’s head executive Jamie Dimon has been a very vocal critic of bitcoin and other digital assets in the past. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/jamie-dimon-expresses-more-hate-for-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/jamie-dimon-expresses-more-hate-for-btc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540093491000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hsGbzR_Gv47zKaI3bdbPL" data-wpel-link="internal">As recently as two</a> months ago, Dimon said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m a major skeptic of crypto tokens, which you call currency, like bitcoin. They are decentralized Ponzi schemes, and the notion that it’s good for anybody is unbelievable. It is dangerous.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the same time, his company has never hesitated to get involved in the crypto space, thus suggesting that while Dimon himself isn’t a fan, he recognizes there’s money to be made and business to be had in the future. A few years back, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47240760" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47240760&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668540093491000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2kiBEewQ2FxTCABY4H78EV" data-wpel-link="external">company unveiled its very own</a> digital asset and described it as such:</p>
<blockquote><p>It can be moved just the way cryptocurrencies can be moved. Stable value, very low cost.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marcus Sotiriou – an analyst at digital asset broker Global Block – expressed his surprise that JPMorgan of all companies would be the one to engage in such a transaction. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a bit surprising to see JP Morgan at the forefront of this trend given how critical the bank’s CEO has been of the cryptocurrency space. But as the adage goes, actions speak louder than words.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Singapore Is Now Exploring Defi</h2>
<p>The event was overseen by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which has recently unveiled a pilot program through which the company will explore defi applications for wholesale funding markets.</p>
<p>Many believe this is the first step towards bridging the gap between standard banking and crypto.</p>

<li>Bitcoin cash price started a fresh decline from the $118 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below the $110 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $109 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it breaks the $106 and $105 support levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining from the $118 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-upsides-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could decline heavily if there is a move below $105.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $118 and $120 resistance levels. BCH formed a high near $117.43 and started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $112 and $110 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below the $110 support and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-fresh-increase-possible-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. It traded as low as $102.26 before there was an upside correction.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $117.43 swing high to $102.26 low. However, the price is struggling to rise above the $110 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>It failed near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $117.43 swing high to $102.26 low. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $109 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>An immediate support on the downside is near the $107 zone. The next major support is near the $105 level, below which the bears might aim $100. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $90 level.</p>
