In today’s announcement, Singapore-based Exchange BingX announced the listing of BONE trading pairs (BONE/USDT) on the beta version of its BingX Spot platform. The exchange said that the deposit and withdrawal service of the BONE token will be available on the BingX exchange starting from January 18, and trading will commence once the pairs are launched. According to the company’s announcement, the move was taken due to the high demand from customers and members of the Shiba Inu and BONE community.
