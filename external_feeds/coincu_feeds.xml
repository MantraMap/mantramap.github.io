<p>As mentioned in an earlier Coincu News article, Kaplan was assigned to join the case on Tuesday, after the judge initially withdrew himself because her husband&#8217;s law firm had advised FTX before it fall.</p>

<p>Before his arrest on December 12, <strong>Bankman-Fried admitted to risk management failures at FTX</strong>, <strong>but adamantly protested that he did not participate in fraudulent activities</strong> and would not be held criminally responsible.</p>



<p>However, two of his close associates, former Alameda chief executive Caroline Ellison and former FTX chief technology officer, Gary Wang, pleaded guilty to their role in FTX&#8217;s collapse and agreed to cooperation with prosecutors is a major threat to the SBF&#8217;s previous denials.&#8221;</p>

When the application was approved on June 1, <strong>the investment had a value of over $1.1 million, even though 610 ETH now only has a value of roughly $723,000 due to Ethereum&#8217;s dropping value.</strong></p>



<p>A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is an online group of people who come together for a common cause. Membership is often demonstrated by holding blockchain tokens. Ownership of one of the NFTs is required to participate in the Nouns DAO in this scenario, and holders are given one vote per NFT on community proposals.</p>

<p><strong>Key Words:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The DFPI&#8217;s consumer alert page now has 16 alerts from December 27 to 28 warning businesses to appear to be involved in fraud against California consumers.</em></li>



<li><em>The warnings were issued in response to public complaints about the brokers and websites, noting that consumers have losses ranging from $2,000 to $1.2 million.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Over the course of two days, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) has issued 17 different warnings to cryptocurrency brokers and websites it believes to be fraudulent.</strong></h5>

<p>The suspected crypto websites include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Tahoe Digital Exchange</li>



<li>TeleTrade Options</li>



<li>Tony Alin Trading Firm</li>



<li>Hekamenltd/Tosal Markets Limited</li>



<li>Trade 1960</li>



<li>Yong Ying Global Investment Company Limited</li>



<li>Unison FX</li>



<li>VoyanX.com</li>



<li>rbhoodc.com</li>



<li>Rui Win Capital Group LTD</li>



<li>Reliable Option Trade</li>



<li>Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited/ Simex</li>



<li>Sun Bit Proa</li>



<li>UniSwap LLC</li>



<li>eth-Wintermute.net</li>



<li>ZC Exchange</li>
</ol>



<p>Wherein, <strong>eth-Wintermute.net, and UniSwap LLC are the two copycat sites posing as two big names in the crypto sector</strong>.</p>



<p>The DFPI&#8217;s consumer alert page now has 16 alerts from December 27 to 28 warning that these businesses <strong>appear to be involved in fraud against California consumers.</strong></p>



<p>It is unusual for the DFPI to issue so many notifications at once, implying that<strong> the amount of crypto fraud reports may have increased in the final parts of the year</strong>. The DFPI normally issues intermittent warnings concerning company investigations or notices about specific instances.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The warnings were issued in response to public complaints about the brokers and websites, with the DFPI noting that <strong>consumers have reported losses ranging from $2,000 to $1.2 million in certain cases</strong>. The DFPI, on the other hand, just states that these websites &#8220;appears to be engaged in fraud.&#8221;</p>



<p>A significant theme asserted in the majority of these advisories is pig slaughtering schemes, in which <strong>an individual or group creates a phony identity online in order to cultivate fraudulent relationships or friendships via social media, texting, and dating apps.</strong></p>



<p>The ultimate objective is to <strong>convince the victim to invest in cryptocurrency through a spoof version of a real website</strong>, in this case, UniSwap LLC and eth-Wintermute.net or by sending cash to a shady wallet address.</p>

<p>CAKE&#8217;s response to this upgrade was subpar, as is shown on its daily chart, which was highlighted in red. In the last seven days, the price of CAKE has decreased by more than 4,4%, according to CoinCu.

<p>Santiment&#8217;s research did, however, offer some solace since several on-chain metrics suggested that CAKE&#8217;s next price movement would soon be supported.</p>

<p>Over the past week, the token&#8217;s<strong> Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has decreased</strong>, which can be a sign that the market has reached a bottom. The velocity of CAKE also increased, which raises the possibility of a trend reversal even more.</p>



<p>Last week, CAKE&#8217;s social dominance frequently increased, demonstrating its appeal. <strong>Not only was CAKE&#8217;s social supremacy confirmed, but so was its appeal. </strong>This was because it had received the second-most mentions in the past 24 hours among the top BNB Chain initiatives.</p>



<p>The network&#8217;s burn rate for PancakeSwap seems to be somewhat optimistic, given that it recently burned 6,808,702 tokens worth more than $22 million.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Manchester United&#8217;s NFT collection has been criticised for being too similar to the work of famous NFT artist DesLucrece.</em></li>



<li><em>DesLucrece stated that he, Tezos, and Manchester United are discussing a solution to the problem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>A well-known NFT artist known for his vibrant animated monsters has been compared to an official collection from the Manchester United Football Club that appears a little too much like his work.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>CertiK</strong> has audited many key components of <strong>The Open Network</strong>, including the vesting schedule smart contract, <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Bridge</strong> application, and <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Baselayer</strong>. The company reduces the risk of Web3 services being compromised by security threats using a hands-on approach and automated audits run by artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>In order to give the network an additional layer of security assurance, the audit company also used formal verification. A defense-in-depth strategy is created by combining expert manual review with automated, AI-powered verification, which reduces and guards against the very real hazards that are present in the <strong>Web3</strong> environment.</p>

<p>All land owners, past, present, and future will have access to the <strong>Illuvium: Zero Private Alpha.</strong></p>



<p>The alpha testing will likely be divided into two seasons. Currently, <strong>Season 0</strong> is expected to run <strong>6 to 8 weeks </strong>before being completely reset and wiping off all data (even blueprints).</p>



<p><strong>Season 0 </strong>is meant to give the development team a chance to fix bugs and balance problems while averting any potential problems that might occur if player data needs to be reset.</p>



<p><strong>Illuvium: Zero</strong> is a game about base building, resource extraction, and blueprint creation. Players can opt to produce <strong>Fuel</strong> (which powers players in the <strong>Illuvium</strong> <strong>Overworld</strong>), materials for growth and crafting, or blueprints for <strong>NFT Overworld</strong> and <strong>Arena skins.</strong></p>

<p>The game offers players a variety of tactical alternatives and judgment calls. Everything from building placement (some buildings fit together better than others), resource management, market work, and Illuvial research for blueprints are crucial decision points.</p>



<p><strong>Season 1</strong> of the game will follow <strong>Season 0</strong>, and it will last up until the open beta phase. At the conclusion of <strong>Season 1</strong>, another data reset is anticipated.</p>

<p><strong>Mean</strong> <strong>Finance</strong> is the state-of-the-art DCA open protocol that enables users (or <strong>dApps</strong>) to <strong>DCA</strong> <strong>any ERC20 into any ERC20 </strong>with their preferred period frequency without sacrificing decentralization or giving up personal information to any centralized parties.</p>



<p><strong>DCA</strong> is a tool an investor can use to build savings and wealth over a long period while neutralizing the short-term volatility in the market.</p>

<p>The purchases occur regardless of the asset&#8217;s price and at regular intervals. In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of assets at the best prices.</p>



<p>The protocol is designed in such a way that users get protection against volatility while market makers are well-incentivized to execute the trades.</p>



<p>Users can get protection against market volatility, MEV-protected trades, and gas-less DCA. Market makers can leverage the whole protocol balance to execute the trade, earn a percentage of the fees, and arbitrage the Mean Finance pool.</p>
