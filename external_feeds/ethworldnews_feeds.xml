<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Genesis filed for bankruptcy protection late on Thursday revealing $3.6 billion owed to the top 50 creditors.</li><li>Top unsecured claimants included Gemini, Babel Finance, VanEck, and Cumberland among others.</li><li>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss once again threatened legal against Genesis&#8217;s parent company DCG and CEO Barry Silbert. </li></ul>



<p>The Winklevii Founded Gemini was <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/genesis/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTQzOTA3OQ==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">named</a> a top creditor in a list of unsecured claims published by bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global. Genesis filed for bankruptcy late on Thursday roughly two months after the imposition of the crypto exchange FTX. </p>



<p>According to the court filing submitted in the Southern District of New York, Genesis owes over $3.6 billion to its top 50 unsecured creditors. The crypto lender also confirmed between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and liabilities. The filing covers Genesis Global Holdco LLC, Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd, and Genesis Global Capital LLC which served as the partner firm for Gemini’s beleaguered Earn product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thursday’s unsecured claims list noted that Gemini is owed $766 million. Two other creditors are owed a combined $692.2 million but both names were redacted in the court filing. Other members of the top 50 creditors category include Mirana Corp (owed $151 million), Babel Finance (owed $150 million),&nbsp; and VanEck New Finance Income Fund (owed $53 million) to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DCG subsidiary said the late filing was a “strategic action to achieve a global resolution to maximize value for all clients and stakeholders”. The filing comes a few months after the fall of FTX and uncertainty surrounding the lenders’ parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG)</p>



<h2>Winklevoss Threatens Lawsuit Against Genesis Parent Company DCG</h2>



<p>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss threatened to sue the crypto lenders&#8217; parent company DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert for lying to investors about the company’s financial health. Cameron tweeted on Friday that the bankruptcy filing “does not insulate Barry, DCG, and any other wrongdoers from accountability”. </p>



<p>Both parties engaged <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-barry-silberts-resignation-dcg/">embroiled</a> in a public spat ever since Genesis Global Capital paused withdrawals, essentially cutting off liquidity for Gemini’s Earn program and its 340,000+ users. The crypto lender supposedly buckled amid back-to-back exposure to crippled entities Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6/ Unless Barry and DCG come to their senses and make a fair offer to creditors, we will be filing a lawsuit against Barry and DCG imminently.</p>&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1616302998736756737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, Thursday’s filing raises questions regarding <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-confirmed-grayscale-gbtc/">Grayscale’s</a> Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product, another entity owned by DCG. Crypto participants have expressed worries that bankruptcy proceedings could have a domino effect on the company’s massive BTC holdings which exceed 600,000 at press time. </p>

<p>John Ray III, the current CEO of FTX, has hinted at the possibility of restarting FTX.com, the international crypto exchange that lies at the center of Sam Banklam-Fried’s failed crypto empire. Mr. Ray, who was brought in last November to clean up the mess made by SBF and his team, has spent the past two months salvaging assets from the exchange in a bid to secure some value for the exchange’s investors and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>John Ray: Restarting FTX is on the table</strong></h2>



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ftx-chief-says-crypto-exchange-could-restart-11674143168" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, new CEO John Ray III revealed that he has set up a task force to explore the possibility of restarting FTX. The CEO acknowledged that rebooting the exchange may be feasible. Shutting it down and returning available assets to customers would be the other available option. If reviving the exchange leads to more recovery than the liquidation of assets, then the exchange will be restarted.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Everything is on the table…If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”</p><cite>CEO John Ray</cite></blockquote>



<p>Mr. Ray told WSJ that recovering assets was particularly difficult in this case because there was no centralized register that listed the company’s cash and investments. Gary Wang, the exchange’s co-founder, and Alameda Research’s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/alamedas-caroline-ellison-says-sbf-ftx-execs-received-secret-loans-worth-billions/">Caroline Ellison</a> initially helped to locate the exchange’s funds. Both executives have pleaded guilty and secured deals with prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankmain-Fried, who has maintained that filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy was a mistake, welcomed the possibility of restarting FTX. John Ray took issue with comments made by SBF since the bankruptcy, calling them “unhelpful and self-serving.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/" rel="nofollow noopener">FTX Token</a> ($FTT) has gone up more than 30% since the news of a possible revival of the exchange came out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A hacker who stole almost $5 million from Solana-native decentralized exchange Raydium moved a part of the funds from an Ethereum wallet to sanction crypto mixing protocol Tornado Cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The activity was noted on Thursday by the on-chain security firm CertiK. According to the company, the exploiter transferred $2.7 million in stolen Ether (ETH) to the mixer. EtherScan data indicated that the hacker’s wallet moved a total of 1,774.5 ETH over 42 transactions. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>The initial hack <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/raydium-hacker-bridges-solana-to-ethereum/">occurred</a> in December 2022 as previously reported. An unidentified exploiter obtained keys to the admin account for Raydium’s smart contract code. The compromised credentials allowed the hacker to drain liquidity pool (LP) tokens from the DEX. After, the individual bridged the digital assets to Ethereum’s blockchain and converted the funds to ETH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A total of $4.4 million in crypto was stolen off the Solana-based exchange, per reports. </p>



<h2>Tornado Cash Saga</h2>



<p>The attempt to leverage Tornado Cash and other crypto mixers is not uncommon among decentralized finance (DeFi) criminals. Indeed, the U.S Treasury Department sanction the Ethereum-based protocol on suspicions that North Korean cyber-criminal organizations used the service to fund illicit operations.</p>



<p>Although, reports from on-chain observers like Chainalysis disputed claims that the bulk of global money laundering and illicit wealth is funneled through the crypto industry. Per the blockchain company’s review, crypto makes up for less than 5% of illegal cash flow.</p>



<p>Alexey Pertsev who wrote the code for Tornado Cash was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-will-reportedly-stay-in-jail-for-two-months-after-his-appeal-gets-dismissed-by-the-court/">arrested</a> by Dutch police back in August 2022. Pertsev remains jailed until February 20 as a Netherlands judge deemed the developer a flight risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Raydium Hack Among Over $3 Billion In DeFi Attacks </h2>



<p>Raydium counted among a raft of attacks on DeFi protocols in 2022. Hackers had drained over $1 billion in assets from crypto projects as of September. October was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/12/28/over-3-billion-stolen-in-crypto-heists-here-are-the-eight-biggest/" rel="noopener">tagged</a> the worst month for DeFi hacks.</p>



<p>To date, the 2022 exploit of Ronin’s bridge remains the largest hack in DeFi history. The exploit which was attributed to the North Korean group Lazarus <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ronin-network-hacked-for-173-6k-ethereum-and-25-5m-usdc/">stole</a> over $600 million in Ethereum and USDC from the cross-chain service.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A VC fund co-founded by Peter Thiel closed almost all of its 8-year-long bet on Bitcoin last year.&nbsp;</li><li>The winding down of the crypto investments came right before 2022’s crypto crash in May.&nbsp;</li><li>Shortly after selling the crypto holdings, Thiel suggested that Bitcoin’s price may rise 100-fold.</li><li>The fund currently manages more than $11 billion and has very little exposure to crypto.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Billionaire investor Peter Thiel reportedly cashed out big on crypto last year. The Founders Fund, a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel, made its initial investment in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-developer-loses-3-6-million-bitcoins-hack/">Bitcoin</a> in early 2014 when the flagship crypto was trading at around $700. This was followed by large investments in crypto, however, the bulk of the crypto exposure was to Bitcoin. Crypto investments became one of the fund’s core positions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Peter Thiel’s fund sold crypto investments before the market crashed</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a1d5597-7145-4035-987b-ff033bba3d75" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a>, the 8-year-long crypto bet made by Thiel’s Founders Fund was wound down towards the end of March 2022. This included the majority of the fund’s exposure to the crypto portfolio. This sale came just a month before the crypto contagion of 2022 that started in May. The fund netted a whopping $1.8 billion from this sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, Peter Thiel said in April 2022 that he was optimistic about the future of Bitcoin. The billionaire investor had suggested that BTC, which was worth around $44,000 at the time, could rise by 100 times. These comments came just days after his fund had sold its Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sale of the Founders Fund’s crypto portfolio has not previously been reported. People familiar with the matter told FT that as of now, the fund has no significant exposure to crypto assets. The fund currently has more than $11 billion under management and has&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://foundersfund.com/portfolio/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">invested</a>&nbsp;in popular companies like SpaceX and Lyft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Stargate Finance looks to power liquidity transfer across decentralized networks without downgrading security and efficiency, per Stargate&#8217;s official announcement.</li><li>The LayerZero Labs&#8217; protocol will start by enabling support for Tether&#8217;s USDT stablecoin for Metis users on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Ethereum.</li><li>Metis CEO Elena Sinelnikova noted that the partnership should propel growth for the multi-chain economy, making crypto more accessible to everyday users.</li></ul>



<p>LayerZero Labs’ Stargate Finance will onboard its liquidity transport protocol on layer 2 network Metis as Stargate moves toward bridging crypto assets and digital currency liquidity across multiple blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unveiled by LayerZero Labs in March 2020, Stargate boasts network composability allowing users and decentralized applications (dApps) to move native assets between otherwise isolated blockchains. The solution operates as a cross-chain protocol with its own unified liquidity pools and optimized finality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LayerZero supposedly built the protocol to further plans of an Omni-chain ecosystem where crypto users can seamlessly interact with web3 solutions like decentralized exchanges and yield aggregators, regardless of the native blockchains those solutions were initially built on.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Pushing Crypto Adoption And Accessibility With Cross-Chain Technology</h2>



<p>Commenting on the news, Metis CEO and Co-Founder Elena Sinelnikova opined that onboarding Stargate Finance will further broader cryptocurrency adoption by improving accessibility to digital assets. Sinelnikova also noted that the partnership signals significant progress toward “eliminating the barriers between blockchains, and opening the doors to a more decentralized, multi-chain economy.”</p>



<p>Metis is a layer 2 protocol based on Ethereum’s blockchain network. Similar to other layer 2 chains, Metis improves scalability, enabling faster transactions at lower costs without trading the network security that Ethereum is famed for. </p>



<p>The project also moves a step further with an NFT bridge, a web3 storage solution, a framework for decentralized autonomous companies (DACs), and a middleware protocol dubbed Polis.&nbsp; LayerZero Labs Co-Founder and CTO Ryan Zarick added that integrating with Metis paves the way for deeper communications between protocols and solutions on Ethereum’s layer 2 network.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The integration of Metis is another big step in LayerZero’s expansion into the Layer 2 ecosystem of Ethereum, allowing for a unified flow of messaging across the entire Ethereum ecosystem. We’re extremely excited to support the Metis ecosystem and its developers and are looking forward to building amazing things together.</p><cite>&#8211; CTO Ryan Zarick.</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Stargate Finance Brings USDT To Metis Users</h2>



<p>According to the official announcement, Stargate Finance will provide support for Tether’s USDT stablecoin on Metis. Users leveraging Metis’ layer 2 solutions on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/">Ethereum</a> will be able to tap crypto’s largest stablecoin by market cap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the partnership with Metis marks a watershed moment for <a href="https://stargate.finance/" rel="nofollow noopener">Stargate Finance</a> since its launch. This is the first time the project has expanded beyond LayerZero Labs, the Stargate Finance team told EthereumWorldNews.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Ethereum Name Service governance proposal aims to create an extra runway for the project should the crypto market suffer another downturn.</li><li>10,000 ETH would be sold for Circle&#8217;s USDC via a Gnosis auction, Wednesday&#8217;s proposal suggested.</li><li>ENS DAO held around $2.4 million in stablecoin and some 40,000 Ether in its treasury at press time.</li></ul>



<p>A member of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DAO submitted a governance proposal aimed at diversifying the protocol’s treasury and hedging against further downturns in the crypto market. The details of the draft proposed offloading 10,000 Ether (ETH) worth around $13 million at today’s prices. </p>



<p>The ENS treasury held over 40,000 ETH and almost $3 million in Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), crypto’s second largest stablecoin by market cap. According to the member’s proposal, swapping 10,000 ETH for 13 million in USDC will allow the project to hold enough liquidity to offset operating costs for the next 24 months, regardless of crypto asset prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the broader digital asset and financial markets suffered huge downturns in 2022 following harsh macro conditions and a series of industry implosions like Terra. When Ethereum Name Service fully launched its service and token in November 2021, Ether peaked at over $4,000 and set an all-time high. </p>



<p>ETH’s price has since dipped over 60% in over a year and currently trades around $1,500. The ENS community member <a href="https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">argued</a> that securing liquidity is essential since the project’s primary revenue is in Ether. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The DAO currently keeps almost 100% of its spendable treasury in ETH. While ENS generates protocol revenue in ETH, having so much exposure to a single volatile asset places the DAO in a vulnerable position.</p></blockquote>



<h2>2.8 Million Ethereum Name Service Domains Registered in 2022</h2>



<p>Ethereum Name Service enjoyed massive user activity in 2022 despite crypto prices taking a beating. Dune Analytics data showed over 2.8 million domains registered and over 600,000 unique wallets created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ENS runs atop the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> blockchain and was initially a part of the Ethereum Foundation in 2017. However, the service broke off as a standalone entity a year later in 2018, and is managed by True Names Limited. </p>



<p>The Ethereum Name Service protocol allows users to attach a simple name like “xyz.eth” to their ETH wallets. ENS was built as a solution to make crypto wallets more accessible, meaning that users do not have to memorize complicated long-form addresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the service is similar to web2 domain registrations where users link a dot-com name to their numeric internet protocol addresses. </p>

<ul><li>Genesis Global Capital is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.</li><li>The DCG subsidiary has been in negotiations with several creditor groups.&nbsp;</li><li>Genesis has been struggling to raise funds for its lending unit following a liquidity crunch.&nbsp;</li><li>Parent firm Digital Currency Group suspended dividends today due to liquidity issues with subsidiaries.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Genesis Global Capital, one of the most popular subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dcg-asset-sales-genesis-owes-3-billion/">DCG</a>), is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy as soon as this week. This crypto lending subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group has been attempting to raise funds to maintain liquidity ever since FTX’s collapse caused it to halt withdrawals in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Genesis in confidential negotiations with creditors</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/crypto-firm-genesis-said-to-prepare-bankruptcy-filing-as-soon-as-this-week" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Genesis Global Capital has engaged multiple creditor groups in negotiations amid liquidity issues that have spilled over to parent firm Digital Currency Group. The crypto broker had indicated in November 2022 that a bankruptcy filing may be imminent unless fresh capital was raised to sustain operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People close to the matter have stated that a bankruptcy filing may not be necessary and that plans could change. As per a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theblock.co/post/203310/genesis-creditors-negotiating-prepackaged-bankruptcy-sources" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>&nbsp;by The Block, creditors of Genesis are actively involved in negotiating the terms of a possible chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Sources revealed that creditors may agree to a forbearance period between 1-2 years under a prepackaged bankruptcy plan in exchange for cash payments and equity in the Digital Currency Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCG&#8217;s founder and CEO Barry Silbert has been involved in a public feud with Gemini’s co-founder and President Cameron Winklevoss. The latter’s customers are allegedly owed more than $900 million as part of Gemini&#8217;s Earn Program. The non-payment has dragged Silbert into the limelight following a series of open letters published by Cameron Winklevoss.</p>



<p>People familiar with the matter have stated that the communication regarding the bankruptcy filing is ongoing and may change. Genesis’ parent firm Digital Currency Group revealed earlier today that it would be suspending its quarterly&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/digital-currency-group-halts-dividend-payment-to-conserve-cash" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dividends</a>&nbsp;to preserve cash following liquidity issues with its subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A second Substack post from the FTX Founder contested data and financial records filed by legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.</li><li>Bankman-Fried argued against the notion that FTX US has a shortfall and is unable to pay back customers.</li><li>The platform has over $350 million in excess cash, said SBF once again.  </li></ul>



<p>Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried reiterated that FTX US, the American division of his bankrupt international crypto exchange, remains solvent with enough cash and assets to make customers whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried argued against court records filed by legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell which claimed that the U.S. exchange had a shortfall and was insolvent. The documents filed by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell directly contrast SBF’s rhetoric of healthy financial holdings at FTX US.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>S&amp;C claims that FTX US has a shortfall. That claim is false. Based on S&amp;C’s own data provided in the same court presentation, FTX US had roughly $609m of assets ($428m USD in bank accounts, plus $181m of tokens) backing roughly $199m of customer balances. FTX US was solvent when it was turned over to S&amp;C, and almost certainly remains solvent today.</p></blockquote>



<p>In his second Substack post after a “<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-premortem/">pre-mortem</a>” analysis on January 12, Sam Bankman-Fried once again opined that FTX US was solvent when he handed over to the bankruptcy team on November 12. SBF also noted that the U.S. platform holds at least $111 million of excess cash and over $350 million to cover customer deposits. </p>



<p>“Customers should be given access to their funds,” said Sam Bankman-Fried in his latest Substack post, expressing annoyance that users have not received their crypto and assets. Notably, Bankman-Fried also <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1615555252962627584?s=20&amp;t=uBmpEg5coaQJ7oy6rPIZRg" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> there isn’t enough information to actually prove that. </p>



<h2>FTX Discovers Another $90 Millon Missing</h2>



<p>The bankrupt crypto exchange reported that about $181 million in liquid assets from the American exchange have been identified so far. Of the total sum, $88 million was moved to cold storage wallet controlled by debtors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around $3 million was also earmarked for cold storage, said the bankruptcy team. About $90 million remains unaccounted for at press time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous reports <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-5-billion-recovered-in-crypto-assets/">stated</a> that around $5 billion in cash, crypto, and securities were recovered. However, it remains unclear if this figure includes nearly $400 million <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">stolen</a> from the exchange, $3.5 billion in the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">hands</a> of Bahamian authorities, and roughly $450 million worth of Robinhood shares <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2023/01/04/feds-move-to-seize-ftxs-robinhood-shares-as-sam-bankman-fried-faces-fraud-charges/" rel="noopener">seized</a> by the U.S. Department of Justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Users have until February 16 to withdraw their assets from the exchange or risk legal headaches.</li><li>Coinbase will close fiat deposits by January 20 as the company winds down operations in Japan.</li><li>The news follows three separate staff cuts with over 2,000 employees fired from the company due to market conditions. </li></ul>



<p>Major crypto exchange Coinbase announced a “difficult decision” to shut down its operations in Japan due to harsh market conditions hitting the crypto ecosystem and the broader financial industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company initially disclosed plans to tap the Japanese market in 2016, before later teaming up with the global giant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to realize its plans in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now the exchange advised users to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/halting-operations-in-japan" rel="nofollow noopener">withdraw</a> their crypto from the exchange roughly two years after launching services for the crypto market in Japan. According to Wednesday’s announcement, local account holders have until February 16 to withdraw their digital assets in either crypto or fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assets on the exchange after February 17 will be converted to Japanese Yen (JPY) and users with active balances will have to engage the Legal Affairs Bureau for a resolution, Coinbase said. Also, the option to deposit fiat on the exchange will be disabled by January 20.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Any remaining crypto holdings held on Coinbase on or after February 17th will be converted to JPY. In the month following February 17th, Coinbase will send any remaining JPY to a Guaranty Account at the Legal Affairs Bureau in accordance with legal requirements. If customers do not take any action before February 16th, they will have to coordinate with the Legal Affairs Bureau to retrieve their JPY balance.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Coinbase Rocked By Layoffs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Indeed, Coinbase <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-investors-cheer-6-stock-surge-following-950-job-cut-announcement/">announced</a> another round of staff cuts in early January 2023 as the crypto exchange doubled down to survive the crypto blizzard. The company effectively fired over 2,000 workers since 2022 and rescinded job offers in some cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The broader crypto ecosystem was shaken by several industry failures like Terra and FTX which drove down asset prices across the board. Other crypto entities like Kraken and Gemini also reduced their workforce to manage resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, beaten crypto prices and industry shakedowns did little to deter Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest from backing Coinbase. The investment giant deployed $5.8 million to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cathie-woods-ark-invest-demonstrates-confidence-in-coinbase-with-another-5-8-million-share-purchase/">purchase</a> more COIN stock, bringing the company’s portfolio to a staggering 8.7 million shares.</p>

<ul><li>HashKey Capital has concluded a $500 million funding round for its third crypto fund. </li><li>The Hong Kong-based firm plans to invest in crypto and blockchain ventures around the world. </li><li>The asset manager has invested in popular projects like Polkadot, 1inch, etc. </li><li>The new crypto fund comes amid a brutal crypto winter that has discouraged other institutions from investing. </li></ul>



<p>HashKey Capital, the Hong Kong-based investing subsidiary of the HashKey Group, unveiled a new crypto fund earlier today. The asset investment firm revealed that it had secured a whopping $500 million in committed capital for what will be its third such investment fund.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>HashKey Fintech Investment Fund III</strong></h2>



<p>The HashKey Fintech Investment Fund III is set to invest in crypto and blockchain projects around the world with a war chest worth $500 million. According to a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hashkey.com/en/newsroom/hashkey-capital-announces-close-fund-III-500-million-to-build-web-3" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>&nbsp;from the HashKey Group, the latest fund will be deployed to increase crypto adoption around the globe, particularly in emerging economies.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Fund III will provide investors with institutional-grade exposure to all facets of blockchain and crypto technologies. This new fund aims to invest primarily in infrastructures, toolings, and applications that have potential for mass adoption.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Since its founding in 2018, HashKey Capital has managed over $1 billion in client assets. The firm has invested in popular crypto projects including Polkadot, DeFi exchange 1inch, and layer 2 network Aztec. It was one of the earliest institutional investors in Ethereum, whose latest Shanghai upgrade was reportedly named after the investment firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investment fund’s launch comes at a time when institutions around the world are discouraged by the prolonged <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/nft-marketplace-superrare-downsizes-30-of-staff-due-to-extended-crypto-winter/">crypto winter</a>. However, the turmoil in the crypto market seems to have no effect on the Hong Kong-based asset manager. According to CEO Deng Chao, the firm has weathered at least three cycles in the crypto industry and each one has left the firm with experiences and insights that are coming in handy. </p>
