										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>PolyNetwork announced the suspension of all platform activities to focus on remediation.</em></li>



<li><em>The attack left 57 assets affected across 10 blockchains, with an estimated $34 billion in damage.</em></li>



<li><em>The project contacted most of the project teams and urged them to withdraw liquidity from decentralized exchanges quickly.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to official sources, PolyNetwork, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, tweeted that they will be suspending services while dealing with the attack. The cause of the attack has not yet been revealed.</strong></h5>

<p>The attack affected 57 assets across 10 blockchains. The team has begun communicating with centralized exchanges, cybersecurity experts, and individuals with relevant knowledge. Users with information are also encouraged to contact the platform. The network also expects attackers to cooperate and return users&#8217; assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>To further mitigate risk, PolyNetwork contacted most of the project teams and urged them to withdraw liquidity from decentralized exchanges quickly. It also advised users holding affected assets to withdraw liquidity and unlock LP tokens quickly.</p>



<p>According to Beosin Alert monitoring, hackers minted over $34 billion in assets across multiple chains, and some of the stolen funds (approximately $800,000) were moved to the Ethereum address: 0xe0Afadad1d93704761c8550F21A53DE3468Ba599.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 2, blockchain security unit Peckshield<a href="https://coincu.com/199488-polynetwork-suspected-hacking-released-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reported</a> that PolyNetwork had encountered a certain vulnerability, allowing attackers to mint a large number of tokens on many different chains. Specifically, looking at the hacker&#8217;s address, it can be seen that he interacted with Poly Network and minted $42.1 billion worth of tokens.</p>



<p>In the past, PolyNetwork on August 10, 2021, was attacked by bad guys, siphoning up to $611 million. It was the most severe crypto hack in history up to that point, surpassed only by Axie Infinity&#8217;s Ronin bridge hack in March 2022, which caused $622 million in damage. Under pressure from the project and the crypto community, the hacker returned almost all the money taken from the attack a few days later.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Frax Finance sounds like an interesting concept! By integrating the functionalities of Curve, UniSwap, and AAVE into a single platform, it could provide users with a comprehensive DeFi experience.</strong></h5>

<p>Curve is known for being a liquidity destination, UniSwap is a leading decentralized exchange, and AAVE is a popular lending protocol. Frax Finance aims to combine these functions into a unified platform.</p>



<p>With Frax Finance, users could enjoy the benefits of liquidity provision, decentralized trading, and lending/borrowing within a single app. This integration would streamline the user experience and eliminate the need to switch between different platforms for various DeFi activities.</p>



<p>So what is Frax Finance? Let&#8217;s find out more about this project with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Frax Finance?</h2>



<p>Frax Finance is the name of a DeFi initiative that offers a number of multi-chain goods. Frax Finance refers to a complete ecosystem of Defi goods and services, including Frax Protocol (or Frax Finance Protocol), Fraxlend, Fraxswap, stablecoin FRAX, and so on.</p>



<p>The project is the pioneering initiative in the paradigm of partly reserved algorithmic stablecoins (Fractional Algorithmic). The purpose of Frax Finance is to develop a decentralized, stable, scalable, and capital-efficient stablecoin. The Frax Finance network&#8217;s mechanism is made up of two tokens:</p>



<ul>
<li>FRAX: Frax Finance is an algorithmic stablecoin that is partially collateral-backed and partly algorithmically stable.</li>



<li>Frax Shares (FXS): The Frax Finance network&#8217;s governance and utility token. FXS is accumulated with the value from the unsecured FRAX rate, fees, and protocol revenue.</li>
</ul>



<p>Prior to the introduction of the Frax Protocol, stablecoins were classified into three types:</p>



<ul>
<li>Collateral stablecoin using fiat, real-world assets issued by a non-traditional company/consortium: USDT from Tether, USDC from Circle, or BUSD from Paxos.</li>



<li>Crypto-collateral: There include CDP systems such as Maker DAO, that issue DAI, Venus, that issue VAI; and Parrot, that issue PAI.</li>



<li>There is no need for collateral since the system is entirely algorithmic.</li>
</ul>



<p>Frax Finance introduces a fourth form of stablecoin: a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin, whose exchange rate stability mechanism is partly dependent on algorithms and partially backed by other assets.</p>



<p>Frax is now being implemented on Ethereum and 12 other blockchains, along with two stablecoins, FRAX (anchor to USD rate) and FPI (anchor to US CPI, not yet launched). The Frax protocol&#8217;s ultimate purpose is to create a highly scalable, decentralized cryptocurrency in substitute of digital assets with a fixed supply, such as BTC.</p>



<p>Frax Finance&#8217;s approach to developing Web-Apps, or what Frax Finance hopes to provide to consumers, is to give Defi services on an All-in-One platform that exists on several chains with strategic items such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>FRAX &#8211; Stablecoins</li>



<li>FraxSwap &#8211; AMM DEX</li>



<li>FraxLend &#8211; Lending protocol</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mechanism for mortgages</strong></h3>



<p>USDC is originally completely collateralized FRAX. Later, as stablecoin demand grew and mortgage rates fell, FRAX was partly collateralized with FXS and USDC. FXS, which works similarly to the LUNA/UST method, supports the algorithm component of FRAX.</p>



<p>Frax Mining Process: The user inputs $0.88 USDC and xFXS has a value of 0.12$ to the protocol, resulting in a total valuation of $1. The user is then given one FRAX unit. Since the fraction of FXS delivered into the protocol will be burnt, each FRAX held by the user is only backed by $0.88 USDC.</p>



<p>Mortgage Withdrawal Procedure: The user returns FRAX to the protocol for burning. The protocol generates an appropriately valued quantity of yFXS equal to $0.12 (y may vary, maybe equal to x owing to variable FXS pricing) plus $0.88 collateralized USDC, which is returned to the customer.</p>



<ul>
<li>Where F is the minted FRAX unit.</li>



<li>Y is the unit of USDC loaded into the system. Py is the USDC/USD rate.</li>



<li>Z is the FXS unit loaded into the system. Pz is the FXS/USD rate.</li>



<li>Cr is the USDC Mortgage Rate.</li>
</ul>



<p>The collateral method described above serves as the foundation for the exchange rate stabilization mechanism described below.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exchange rate stabilization mechanism</strong></h3>



<p>FRAX supply is changed to fit market supply and demand by focusing on market players&#8217; interests.</p>



<p>Considering the secondary market price of FRAX is larger than $1 for any reason, it is comprehensible that the demand for FRAX exceeds the supply. Assuming that FRAX always respects the mortgage rule, anybody may mint FRAX for $1 and sell it on the secondary market for more than $1 to benefit from the exchange rate difference. At this moment, the supply of FRAX has been increased.</p>



<p>When the price of FRAX on the secondary market is less than $1, anybody may acquire it and use the Frax Protocol to withdraw $1 in USDC and FXS. The supply of FRAX is presently diminishing, while demand in secondary markets is increasing, causing FRAX to revert to the peg price of $1.</p>



<p>FRAX&#8217;s price volatility is therefore transferred to the FXS. Depending on the circumstances, this might be beneficial or detrimental. If the supply of FRAX continues to rise, more FXS will be burnt, deflating the supply of FXS.</p>



<p>The protocol uses Algorithmic Market Operations (AMO) to achieve stability in the first version &#8211; Frax v1. Every one hour, if FRAX is greater than $1, Cr (USDC collateral rate) decreases by 0.25%, if FRAX is less than $1, Cr increases by 0.25% to increase the collateral structure in USDC, and Cr stays the same when Frax price = 1.</p>



<p>Frax v2 expands on the AMO concept introduced in v1 by aiming to operate as many AMOs as possible in order to enhance protocol, boost privacy and capital efficiency, and empower FXS holders more. This allows the protocol to mint extra FRAX when the price is more than $1 in order to return the price to $1.</p>



<p>AMOs may be openly suggested and formed by the community, but they must be approved by a governance vote before they can be implemented. Today, four AMOs have been deployed, with two more in the works.</p>



<p>The Frax system receives FRAX and FXS collateral pricing data through Oracle Chainlink and Uniswap.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>FRAX</strong></h3>



<p>FRAX is an algorithmic stablecoin with price stability achieved by asset collateralization. Mortgage rates are adjusted hourly to the value of FRAX by 0.25%.</p>



<p>To develop stability for the protocol before permitting collateral with many other assets, the assets used as collateral to produce FRAX are currently only stablecoins such as USDT and USDC.</p>



<p>FRAX is always created/redeemed with a value of one dollar. As FRAX exceeds $1, a reward is created that motivates users to mint additional FRAX. When FRAX is less than $1, however, there is an advantage to redeeming FRAX.</p>



<p>The overall value of FRAX created (mine) is guaranteed to be equal to the sum of the collateral value at the collateral rate and the FXS value (the number of FXS to be burned). When FRAX is redeemed, the user receives the collateral as well as FXS at the same value (this FXS is generated).</p>



<p>Moreover, following the release of Frax V2, Frax used Curve&#8217;s governance architecture, which is Vote Escrowed (ve). You will need to lock FXS in order to obtain veFXS for administration and prizes.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Fraxswap</strong></h3>



<p>Fraxswap is Frax Finance&#8217;s AMM, and it is based on Uniswap V2.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Fraxlend</strong></h3>



<p>Frax Finance cannot construct a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem without a lending platform &#8211; a decentralized capital market. Fraxlend is a freshly released loan platform by Frax Finance.</p>



<p>Anybody may generate liquidity between two ERC-20 tokens using Fraxlend, and everyone can develop and participate in lending and borrowing operations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-69.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="619" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-69-1024x619.png" alt="image 69" class="wp-image-199526" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-69-1024x619.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-69-300x181.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-69-768x464.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-69-750x453.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-69-1140x689.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-69.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Frax Finance Review: Project To Eliminate Weaknesses of Algorithmic Stablecoins 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The following people are involved in the loan process on Fraxlend, according to the diagram above:</p>



<ul>
<li>FraxLend Pair: This is similar to a loan contract in that the contract will record the collateral and the lending assets are ERC20 tokens. Fraxlend Pair Deployer, the makers of this asset pair, implemented it.</li>



<li>Lenders: Lenders that deposit Token Asset into the Fraxlend Pair will get interest in fTokens. Lending tokens may be traded for fTokens.</li>



<li>Borrowers: Borrowers deposit tokens as collateral into Fraxlend Pair in order to borrow Token Asset.</li>



<li>Rate Calculator is in charge of calculating interest rates.</li>



<li>The market pricing for both the Asset Token and the Collateral Token is determined by one (or two) ChainLink Oracles in each contract.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the liquidation procedure, this approach remains identical to previous loan arrangements. Each borrower&#8217;s position is governed by an LTV, which is the ratio of the value of the borrowed asset to the value of the collateral placed. As the exchange rate between Token Asset and Collateral Token changes, LTV changes. When a borrower&#8217;s LTV (Loan to value) exceeds the limit LTV, he or she might add collateral or repay the loan to put the LTV back into a safe range. Instead, anybody may return all or part of the loan on the borrower&#8217;s behalf and earn the collateral&#8217;s value plus a liquidation fee.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Frax Finance is a well-known stablecoin initiative in the cryptocurrency industry that has weathered multiple market storms while maintaining its peg.</p>



<p>It is a truly decentralized system with on-chain governance, and it will be the first and only stablecoin to use a hybrid fractional-algorithm architecture when it launches in November 2020. While not yet fully developed, Frax Finance always has highly promising directions and promises to establish an extraordinarily robust ecosystem. Nonetheless, Frax Finance&#8217;s market penetration in the cryptocurrency sector remains minimal.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decentralized income is at the heart of the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. In with this agreement, Convex Finance presents an interesting approach for users to earn benefits and get increased CRV payouts without locking up their CRV tokens.</strong></h5>

<p>So what is Convex Finance? Let&#8217;s find out more about this project with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Convex Finance?</h2>



<p>Convex Finance is a one-of-a-kind platform that allows Curve.fi LPs to earn trading fees as a return. These LPs may also claim increased CRV benefits without locking up CRV tokens. Dividing trading costs between users and LPs increases capital efficiency. It also maintains a healthy balance between liquidity providers (LPs) and CRV token holders.</p>



<p>Convex is also noted for its low cost. The platform charges no costs for withdrawals and keeps performance fees to a bare minimum. CVX stakeholders often get performance fees, sometimes known as gas fees. Surprisingly, on Convex, both LPs and CRV stakeholders earn CVX as a mining return. CVX is also the Convex Finance ecosystem&#8217;s native coin. The tokens also act as governance tokens, with holders responsible for allocating veCRV tokens.</p>



<p>Convex Finance was founded in Curve Wars with the ability to increase earnings for Curve Finance and Frax Finance token holders, CRV and FXS, respectively. Moreover, Convex maximizes earnings for LPs on Curve and Frax. Convex has been quite successful despite having a significantly different operating paradigm than other platforms at the same time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Convex Finance and Curve Finance</strong></h3>



<p>Convex has an interaction with two items on Curve Finance, including CRV holders and liquidity providers. And now we&#8217;ll look at how Convex works with each of the items listed above.</p>



<p><strong>CRV holders</strong></p>



<p>Convex enables consumers to lock CRV on their platform for a bigger payout than Curve Finance offers. And the following is Convex&#8217;s method of action for CRV holders:</p>



<ul>
<li>Step 1: Users will permanently register their CRV with Convex Finance.</li>



<li>Step 2: Convex Finance returns it to the user cvxCRV. This cvxCRV reflects the CRV supplied by the user to the platform.</li>



<li>Step 3: Convex owning veCRV permits the platform to get a portion of Curve Finance&#8217;s income, which Convex re-shares with cvxCRV holders.</li>



<li>Step 4: In addition to income sharing from Curve, the Convex platform will reward cvxCRV holders in CVX (this is more of Convex when comparing Curve Finance directly).</li>



<li>Step 5: Customers may exit cvxCRV&#8217;s position on Curve Finance by trading in the cvxCRV &#8211; CRV liquidity pair.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Curve Finance liquidity providers</strong></p>



<p>Convex interacts with liquidity providers on Curve Finance in addition to CRV holders. And the operating method on Curve Finance between Convex Finance and liquidity sources is as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Step 1: LPs will get LP Tokens reflecting their liquidity on Curve Finance after supplying liquidity on Curve Finance. After that, the user transfers and bets the LP Token on the Convex Finance platform.</li>



<li>Step 2: Convex Finance will provide a reward as part of the money generated by the Curve Finance protocol, as well as certain incentive tokens such as LDO, SNX, and so on. Moreover, the token is the incentive that LPs get. CVX. Particularly appealing are the $0 deposit and withdrawal fees.</li>



<li>Step 3: At any moment, users may unlock their LP Token.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Frax Finance and Convex Finance</strong></h3>



<p>Convex, like Frax Finance, features two products for FXS holders and also provides liquidity on Frax Finance.</p>



<p><strong>FXS holders</strong></p>



<p>When users lock FXS on the Convex platform, a number of events occur, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Step 1: The user deposits FXS into the Convex platform, and Convex locks permanently on the Frax Finance platform to receive veFXS.</li>



<li>Step 2: The customer will get a 1 &#8211; 1 ratio cvxFXS with the FXS put into the platform.</li>



<li>Step 3: The user is rewarded with the platform&#8217;s CVX; moreover, if the user&#8217;s cvxFXS is introduced to create liquidity on Curve for the cvsFXS &#8211; FXS pair, they will be rewarded when they directly stake FXS on Frax Finance as FXS.</li>



<li>Step 4: Users may exit their cvsFXS position by trading the cvsFXS &#8211; FXS pair on Curve Finance.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Frax Finance liquidity providers</strong></p>



<p>This method is analogous to how Convex interacts with LPs on Curve Finance. This mechanism works as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Step 1: You must take this quantity of LP Token if you are staking your LP Token on Frax Finance.</li>



<li>Step 2: Make a deposit of your LP Token with Convex Finance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<p>Convex enables Curve.fi LPs to earn transaction fees and claim higher CRV without locking up the CRV. With little effort, LPs may increase their CRV and liquidity mining returns.</p>



<p>Convex enables users to gain transaction fees as well as a portion of the CRV increase obtained by LPs if they desire to stake CRV. This results in a better balance between LPs and CRV stakeholders, as well as improved capital efficiency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquidity Providers (LPs)</strong></h3>



<p>The Convex ecosystem is supported by LPs and stakers. On Convex, LPs will receive trading fees as well as increased CRV. As previously indicated, LPs are not required to lock up any CRV tokens in order to get these benefits. On Convex, LPs will:</p>



<ul>
<li>Staking for higher rewards is automatically triggered when Curve LP tokens are deposited into Convex Finance.</li>



<li>Get CRV as well as other tokens as prizes (SNX, PNT, BOR, LDO,…).</li>



<li>Prizes are obtained from the Curve gauge on a regular basis and transferred to the Synthetix-inspired Reward contract, with rewards given after seven days.</li>



<li>Add and remove liquidity quickly and conveniently, with no extra deposit or withdrawal fees.</li>



<li>Get a CVX &#8211; Convex token based on the CRV received by the user.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CRV Stakers</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Submitting CRV to Convex will result in it being locked indefinitely and returned to cvxCRV.</li>



<li>cvxCRV should be deposited into the Reward contract (can be withdrawn at any time).</li>



<li>Take advantage of the CRV incentive.</li>



<li>Get the same transaction fees as if you owned a veCRV.</li>



<li>Although permanently closed, users may trade at Pool cvxCRV/CRV if they desire to return to CRV.</li>



<li>Get a CVX &#8211; Convex token based on the CRV received by the user.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CVX Stakers</strong></h3>



<p>Stake CVX to get platform transaction fees in the form of cvxCRV. Despite the fact that it was just recently introduced, Convex&#8217;s TVL has developed significantly. Convex&#8217;s TVL is now $3.27B, ranking 7th on DefiLlama, indicating that Curve&#8217;s user base is quite huge and they require a location to enhance revenues.</p>



<p>Moreover, 16% of the farm reward from CRV will be removed and distributed in the form of CRV as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>10% off on cvxCRV.</li>



<li>CVX Stakers get a 5% discount.</li>



<li>1% gas cost reimbursement for collecting and delivering prizes under Reward contracts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Liquidity Pools on Convex</h2>



<p>Convex Finance&#8217;s pools will be determined by a user&#8217;s unique objectives, risk tolerance, and other choices. Nonetheless, certain pools have regularly supplied consumers with large reward chances without incurring small impermanent losses. These are a few of Convex&#8217;s most popular and successful pools:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tricrypto pool (USDT+BTC+ETH): This pool enables users to stake three highly liquid assets: USDT, BTC, and ETH, and earn trading fees, CRV, and CVX in exchange for trading fees, CRV, and CVX. This pool gives players equal exposure to USDT, Bitcoin, and ETH while paying a 13.5% APR.</li>



<li>stETH pool (ETH/STETH): Users may stake stETH, a wrapped version of ETH that can be used to generate yield on the Lido staking platform. At 5.4% APR, the stETH pool has delivered the greatest dividends for ETH investors.</li>



<li>4pool (DAI/USDC/USDT/SUSD): This pool enables users to stake DAI, USDC, USDT, and SUSD, four extremely liquid stablecoins. This pool has delivered its participants with a 3.8% APR return with no impermanent loss.</li>
</ul>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the returns of these pools might fluctuate over time, and consumers should always do their own research and assess the risks before investing in any pool. While selecting a pool, consumers should also consider liquidity, token price stability, and the project&#8217;s overall long-term viability.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Team</h2>



<p>Convex Finance&#8217;s team is not publicly known, and the project is regarded to be an anonymous team. The team&#8217;s anonymity is widespread in the DeFi field, and it is thought to be done to avoid regulatory scrutiny and possible legal difficulties. Having said that, it is usually assumed that the development community behind Curve Finance is the entity responsible for implementing and maintaining the protocol.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Convex is a platform that was formed when Curve Wars burst, and it is still growing today because to the vigor of Curve Finance. After then, the project continues to expand on Frax Finance. Finally, Convex Finance is a well-known DeFi protocol that focuses on maximizing yield production for Curve.fi liquidity providers and CRV stakeholders, with over $4 billion in total value locked. The platform allows users to optimize their profits with minimum effort and great capital efficiency by offering tokenized deposits, increased CRV incentives, and its native CVX token.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s find out details about this project with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is JustLend?</h2>



<p>JustLend is the first lending platform in the Tron ecosystem, with the purpose of creating pools based on the supply and demand algorithm for assets such as TRX and TRC20. The program enables customers to contribute TRX and TRC20 tokens in exchange for interest on each asset class and borrow extra tokens for other uses.</p>



<p>JustLend is another name for the Just platform&#8217;s decentralized lending technology.</p>



<p>Simply said, Just is a DeFi platform based on the TRON ecosystem&#8217;s Blockchain network. Just&#8217;s primary purpose is to give consumers all around the world a fair, decentralized financial system with reliable crypto financing and governance. Just is well recognized as one of the most active decentralized platforms on the TRON Blockchain.</p>



<p>JustLend formally opened the community in August 2020, after the IEO on the Poloniex LaunchBase platform, and is recognized as one of the three key products of the Just project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Just Ecosystem</h2>



<p>The Just platform was founded by Justin Sun and introduced in Q3 2020; its name is taken from the first four letters of the founder&#8217;s name. JUST is a rapidly evolving DeFi platform that provides a broad variety of decentralized financial solutions, including JustStable, JustLend, JustSwap, JustLink, and cross-chain tokens. The TRON network serves as the foundation for the system. It uses a decentralized stablecoin system comprised of USDJ and its governance token, JST.</p>

<p>The network&#8217;s core decentralized financial product, JustStable, is powered by USDJ, a stablecoin coupled with US dollars and accepting different collateral. JustStable is a cross-border stablecoin lending platform where users may borrow stablecoins. Investors and traders are increasingly seeking for methods to generate stablecoins without selling their crypto assets as yield mining and trading possibilities in the crypto industry rise.</p>



<p>Traders must deposit their collateral in the form of backing collateral tokens in order to get USDJ fast (including TRX). After that, the asset is swapped for the PTRX token and locked as collateral, resulting in a collateralized debt position (CDP). Users may simply mint or withdraw USDJ depending on the amount of collateral placed. The platform will then repay the user for the initial collateral.</p>



<ul>
<li>JustStable provides consumers with the liquidity they need.</li>



<li>JustLend is a money market platform driven by TRON smart contracts, where users may contribute liquidity to liquidity pools in order to borrow at cheap interest rates.</li>



<li>Cross-chain tokens are assets from other blockchains that, after being encrypted on TRON, may be utilized in the JUST network. JustSwap is yet another smart contract framework for exchanging trustless tokens and creating accessible liquidity pools.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<ul>
<li>JustLend&#8217;s UI is simple and easy to use, even for novices. The program gives a comprehensive index of tokens that have been integrated into JustLend in the Market area, making it simpler for users to make investment choices.</li>



<li>Risk Meter: The gauge on the homepage of JustLend illustrates the amount of risk in borrowing your property.</li>



<li>Liquidity Mining Mode: This mode provides information and enables users to supply liquidity in exchange for JST incentives from various pools.</li>



<li>Let users vote: Users on JustLend may vote on product suggestions. The package includes a section where anybody can learn about and vote on the product.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>The generation of USDJ coins and governance through JST coins are two fundamental processes going place in the JustLend decentralized crypto lending ecosystem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mechanism</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Core Architecture of JustLend</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Customers deposit monies into Smart Contracts on the platform, with the asset offered to serve as the underlying asset.</li>



<li>Smart Contract: Transferring the underlying asset&#8217;s jToken to the user&#8217;s account at the exchange rate.</li>



<li>Lenders: JustLend accepts money market assets in exchange for interest on loans. They have the ability to remove the underlying assets they have given at any moment.</li>



<li>Borrower: In this case, the borrower will over-collateralize an asset borrowed through the protocol. Smart Contracts will automatically match loan orders as long as the market has adequate liquidity. Borrowers have the option of repaying the loan at any moment.</li>



<li>Loan interest is calculated based on the number of blocks. Smart Contracts will automatically determine the floating interest rate depending on market supply and demand.</li>



<li>The Smart Contract will automatically initiate liquidation if the borrower&#8217;s collateral falls below the liquidation level. Users might mortgage additional assets or pay off a portion of the borrowed assets to prevent asset liquidation.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Supply of assets</strong></p>



<p>Borrowers and lenders will unite on present peer-to-peer networks, and users&#8217; assets will be directly loaned to others. But, on JustLend, the protocol will pool each user&#8217;s supply, increasing liquidity and creating a better currency balance.</p>



<p>jToken is the asset delivered to the market (TRC20 token balance). Token holders may acquire the appropriate jToken by supplying and following the applicable requirements while earning interest. The primary instances in question are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Users may earn interest by offering tokens on the platform.</li>



<li>With the platform, the assets of Dapps, institutions, and exchanges may be valued.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Borrowed assets</strong></p>



<p>Borrowers who wish to borrow an asset on JustLend must first mortgage the asset to the platform and earn jTokens, then use the jTokens to trade for any asset accessible on the platform. Loans do not need a payback date; the interest rate is automatically updated based on market supply and demand; interest rates vary per property. Factors to keep in mind with loaned assets:</p>



<ul>
<li>Borrowers are permitted to borrow up to but not surpass the value of their collateral in order to reduce risk to the borrower of the property.</li>



<li>Risk &amp; Liquidity: If the outstanding loan amount of the borrower exceeds the collateral, the Smart Contract will immediately initiate the liquidation to remove risks and assure debt repayment and provide assets while protecting lenders.</li>



<li>Use cases for borrowed assets: Users may exchange their TRC20 tokens for other TRC20 tokens. Users may sell a token before it collapses, allowing the platform to benefit from the token&#8217;s loss.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interest rate</strong></h3>



<p>On TRON, JustLend interest is determined based on block creation time (approximately 3s). Smart Contracts will automatically compute interest rates based on changes in supply and demand, and loan interest rates may fluctuate amongst assets. When the demand for borrowing declines, the platform&#8217;s surplus tokens will have high liquidity and reduced interest rates, incentivizing borrowing. As demand for loans falls, tokens on the platform lose liquidity, and interest rates rise, motivating asset holders to lend.</p>



<p>Since the interest model is the foundation of JustLend, it will be linked to the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exchange Rates: In JustLend, each asset class is represented by a TRC20 standard token, and the balance is represented by jToken, which may be created by giving it to the market or redeeming it. Exchange rates and the value of an underlying asset will rise with time.</li>



<li>Use Rate: The usage rate indicates how efficiently a platform uses cash.</li>



<li>Reserve: Based on the reserve factor, JustLend deducts a reserve from the revenues of each loan.</li>



<li>Interest Rate Supply: The rate of supply, like the borrowing rate, is controlled by the utilization rate.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oracle Price</strong></h3>



<p>The values of various underlying assets must be used to establish the value of a borrower&#8217;s collateral or the worth of their borrowed property.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>jTokens</strong></h3>



<p>When a user gets jTokens for supplying the underlying asset to JustLend, it is known as a receipt, such as jTRX, jUSDT, JSUN,…which you obtain for delivering the appropriate asset. The TRC20 token in your wallet is called jToken.</p>



<p>JustLend supports all assets, which are kept and integrated using a smart contract called jToken. When a user redeems a swappable jToken, it becomes the matching underlying asset.</p>



<p><em>Four steps to creating USDJ coins from CDPs</em></p>



<p><strong>Step 1: Transfer coins to the JustLend platform</strong></p>



<p>The vast majority of users will lock up collateral to establish the USDJ stablecoin. And USDJ will be produced throughout the CDP deposit procedure. CDP (Cardapio) is a cryptocurrency that runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC BEP-20).</p>



<p>JustLend now only takes PTRX as collateral; other crypto assets are not accepted. As a result, users should exercise caution when transferring coins to JustLend in order to prevent losing money.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: Set up the CDP coin</strong></p>



<p>The CDP coin initialization procedure on JustLend will commence once sufficient collateral is provided. At this stage, users must initiate a transaction on JustLend in order to produce the matching amount of CDP currency. After that, you proceed with the transaction and deposit the PTRX coin into the CDP you just created, resulting in the USDJ price-stable asset.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: Create USDJ using CDP</strong></p>



<p>Users who hold CDP coins must conduct a transaction in order to define the quantity of USDJ launched in the CDP. Once there, a debt is established, and the collateral is likewise secured. The lock-up period will persist until all debts have been paid off.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: Repurchase the collateral</strong></p>



<p>To reclaim the collateral, the user must pay the whole amount borrowed in USDJ currency. Other charges are paid in JST tokens at the same time.</p>



<p>CDP coin holders get full access to the JustLand platform after paying off all obligations and interest. This process will assist the user in recovering the whole amount of the preceding collateral.</p>



<p>If the collateral decreases precipitously and is no longer sufficient to cover the obligations on JustLand, the system will immediately liquidate the CDP currency.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-56.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-56-1024x538.png" alt="MakerDAO Review: One Of The Most Powerful DeFi Platforms Currently" class="wp-image-199499" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-56-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-56-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-56-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-56-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-56-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-56.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="MakerDAO Review: One Of The Most Powerful DeFi Platforms Currently 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>So what is MakerDAO? Let&#8217;s find out details about this project with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is MakerDAO?</h2>



<p>MakerDAO is an organization that is building lending and savings technologies, as well as a stablecoin crypto asset called DAI on the Ethereum blockchain. MakerDAO has developed a system that allows anybody with ETH and a Metamask wallet to lend money in the form of the DAI stablecoin. Network members may produce DAI by locking up some ETH in MakerDAO&#8217;s smart contracts; the more ETH locked up, the more DAI created.</p>



<p>Additional information about how to operate:</p>



<ul>
<li>As users engage with MakerDAO, they construct CDPs (Collateralized Debt Position Smart Contracts), which are smart contracts for collateralized debt.</li>



<li>Return DAI equivalent to a portion of the deposited asset value.</li>



<li>To get collateral, pay the stability charge and borrow DAI.</li>
</ul>



<p>The DAO&#8217;s two-token concept, which includes the collateral-backed DAI stablecoin and the governance token MKR, attempts to restore stability to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Users may utilize the Maker Protocol to lock their ETH as collateral for a DAI loan. When customers wish to get their ETH back, they just refund the loan plus any costs.</p>



<p>The Maker Foundation launched MakerDAO in 2014. Its worldwide development team began constructing the Maker ecosystem in 2015, and in 2017, the whitepaper launched the Stablecoin System, or Sai, which was formerly known as Dai.</p>



<p>The Maker Foundation, in partnership with the MakerDAO community, thinks that a decentralized stablecoin such as DAI is required for people and blockchain enterprises to fully benefit from the digital asset.</p>



<p>Since the system only accepted Ethereum (ETH) as collateral, the full term was Single-Collateral Dai, or SCD. Participants could manufacture SCD using ETH in this way through a sophisticated system of smart contracts; however, the Maker protocol was upgraded in 2019, and it is now powered by DAI.</p>



<p>MakerDAO is part of a worldwide community and is used to lend DAI, a stablecoin. This is done when users deposit supported ETH into the Maker Vault, resulting in a loan represented in DAI that may later accumulate interest.</p>



<p>DAI, a stablecoin backed by collateral, is the initial component of Maker&#8217;s two-token scheme. Its value is fixed to a certain fiat currency, such as the US dollar. DAI may be used for a variety of reasons, including trading, remittances, and gaining access to decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.</p>



<p>The second component is MKR, the Maker Protocol&#8217;s governance token. MKR holders have voting rights in the MakerDAO governance. Members take part in voting and other governance activities to keep the system running and the DAI stablecoin running.</p>



<p>MakerDAO intends to allow anybody in the world to use its permissionless borrowing marketplace and trustless financial apps by building an inclusive infrastructure for individual economic empowerment. This creates an opportunity for users to profit from DeFi and use MakerDAO&#8217;s decentralized lending and borrowing services.</p>



<p>Ultimately, MakerDAO&#8217;s purpose is to maximize DeFi&#8217;s potential by offering a stablecoin and governance structure that delivers stability and accessibility to the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>We are all aware of the crypto market&#8217;s extreme volatility. As a result, the community is hoping for a cryptocurrency with a steady value to protect its holdings.</p>



<p>Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, TUSD…), on the other hand, are issued by a centralized organization with the promise that 1 issued stablecoin will be backed by 1 USD in the bank. But we don&#8217;t know whether that&#8217;s true or not.</p>



<p>As a result, Maker was built to address this issue. It generates a stablecoin whose value is tied to USD but collateralized by crypto; the unique feature is that it is a decentralized system, so everything is visible and under control.</p>



<p>Assume you&#8217;re visiting a farmer&#8217;s market and want to purchase some veggies. You don&#8217;t have any cash with you, and the farmer doesn&#8217;t take credit cards. Fortunately, you have a valuable object, such as a watch, that you can use as collateral to purchase veggies from another person at the market.</p>



<p>You are the borrower in this situation, the farmer is the lender, and the watch is the collateral. Let&#8217;s imagine you want to purchase some more veggies but don&#8217;t have any more collateral. Here is where MakerDAO enters the picture.</p>



<p>MakerDAO is analogous to a collection of individuals at the farmer&#8217;s market eager to lend you money in exchange for your collateral, in this instance, Ethereum. Rather than relying on a conventional bank to lend you money, MakerDAO enables you to borrow DAI by staking your ETH as collateral.</p>



<p>Similarly to how you may use your watch as collateral to borrow money from the farmer&#8217;s market, you can use your ETH as collateral to borrow DAI from MakerDAO.</p>



<p>Maker guarantees that when consumers invest ETH, they will get a comparable quantity of DAI. Simply explained, Maker will act as a credit lender, with ETH serving as security and DAI representing the amount borrowed by the user. The MKR token will be used by the protocol to guarantee that the price of one DAI is always equal to one USD.</p>



<p>When an incident threatens the whole system (such as hacking or collateral depreciation), a process known as &#8220;Global settlement&#8221; is implemented. Following then, CDP creation will be halted, and the stopper will be able to get collateral in their unpaid DAI or CDP. This approach was designed to boost confidence in the MakerDAO system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<p>MakerDAO was one of the first efforts to address the issue of capital use efficiency. Users may deposit current assets in order to borrow stablecoins for other purposes. This allows us to avoid selling assets while still having money.</p>



<p>MakerDAO is one of the biggest and most established dApps on the Ethereum blockchain, accounting for a considerable portion of overall liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem. In reality, when the Total Value Locked (TVL) of ETH in DeFi initially crossed the $1 billion mark in June 2020, the MakerDAO protocol owned almost 60% of the ETH.</p>



<p>When DeFi grows in popularity in 2021, consumers will want to not only acquire assets and wait for the price to rise before selling, but also keep stablecoins to engage in yield farming or just discover methods to boost capital efficiency. MakerDAO was the only answer at the time, thus it flourished. MakerDAO&#8217;s greatest TVL in 2021, according to Defi Llama, is more than $19.8 billion.</p>



<p>The market has received 4.6 billion DAI. As a result, DAI is presently the top-ranking stablecoin in the same sector. At the time of writing, Maker is third in Total Value Locked after Aave and Lido, with about $6.3 billion in assets locked on its platform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="1-mkr-token">MKR token</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key Metrics</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Token Name: Maker</li>



<li>Ticker: MKR</li>



<li>Blockchain: Ethereum.</li>



<li>Token Standard: ERC-20</li>



<li>Contract: 0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2</li>



<li>Token type: Governance</li>



<li>Total Supply: 1,005,577 MKR</li>



<li>Circulating Supply: 977,631 MKR</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>



<p>MakerDAO users pay the system cost with MKR Token, which is around 1%.</p>



<p>In the governance mechanism, MKR is employed as a vote. MKR holders have the right to vote on platform governance initiatives. The algorithm then chooses the suggestions with the most votes.</p>

<li>Circulating Supply: 4,650,025,526 DAI</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>



<p>DAI is a stablecoin that is part of the MakerDAO ecosystem. After collateralizing crypto assets, users earn DAI, which they may spend for any purpose. Users may now pay the loan charge with DAI tokens rather than MKR tokens.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Team</h2>



<ul>
<li>Rune Christensen: Founder and CEO.</li>



<li>Steven Becker: President and COO.</li>



<li>Andy Milenius: CTO.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Investors and Partners</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors</strong></h3>



<p>From 2017 through 2019, MakerDAO received funds from a number of famous investors, including Paradigm, a16z, Dragonfly Capital, and others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partners</strong></h3>



<p>MakerDAO has partnered with more than 400 dApps, and integration services such as MetaMaksk, Coinbase, Oasis, Opensea, DENT, Sandbox, League of Kingdoms, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The potential of MakerDAO and DAI</h2>



<p>MakerDAO is a large-scale initiative that aims to create a decentralized future for the crypto industry. According to the published timeline, the project might take three years to build the Ethereum mainnet.</p>



<p>MakerDAO is an excellent investment due to its decentralized system. Everyone with MKR tokens instantly joins the community and obtains governance privileges. This implies that if you invest in MKR, you will have the ability to shape the future of MakerDAO.</p>



<p>MakerDAO developers are optimistic about the project&#8217;s success because of the following remarkable features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Maker is a system that employs the ERC-20 tokens MKR and DAI, both of which utilize ETH as a trading pair.</li>



<li>Maker utilizes MKR token and Smart Contract CDP to keep DAI token stable at 1 USD. It is tied to the USD and may be exchanged to another currency if the US economy fails and the USD falls in value.</li>



<li>Maker is a decentralized platform that is backed by several of the world&#8217;s most prominent DEXs.</li>



<li>MKR token holders have voting rights on the Maker platform, and as the final deciders for the DAI stablecoin, they are motivated to keep the platform functioning.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to invest in the project, MKR Token is a good option. MKR Token is a Utility Token as well as a Governance Token. The value of MKR will rise as buyer demand rises.</p>



<p>MKR is, therefore, more advantageous for borrowers. This is due to the fact that as a user, you may lend yourself by securing ETH as collateral and establishing a Collateralized Debt Position.</p>



<p>Yet, owning MKR has its own set of hazards, the majority of which are speculative and have yet to materialize. The most serious danger is that the Ethereum price may plummet, leaving all collateral in the Maker ecosystem worthless.</p>



<p>Another danger is that the number of bad debts and defaults increases to the point that the price of MKR tokens falls.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>MakerDAO is a pretty fascinating protocol that has emerged in the DeFi area over the past 4 years or so, trying to marry both stablecoin creation as asset-backed collateral and decentralized lending and borrowing features.</p>



<p>MakerDAO is a DeFi project that is building one of the first decentralized financial protocols. MakerDAO has been a pioneer in the decentralized financial movement, with a robust and prolific development community and hundreds of collaborations. If the protocol continues on its present course and ETH remains a desirable asset, MakerDAO will undoubtedly have a great future.</p>



<p>MakerDAO is one of the biggest and most established dApps on the Ethereum blockchain, accounting for a considerable portion of overall liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem. MakerDAO&#8217;s two-token architecture, MKR and DAI, enables almost anybody on the planet to get access to economic empowerment through its trustless, permissionless, DAO-like financial platform.</p>



<p>Ultimately, MakerDAO provides a decentralized, transparent, and reliable lending and borrowing ecosystem. Its distinguishing characteristics, such as collateralization and cheap fees, make it a popular solution for people seeking liquidity without selling their crypto holdings.</p>

<p>As of now, there has yet to be a response from the project side.</p>



<p>Poly Network is a project that provides a cross-chain solution allowing blockchains to interact and build infrastructure for Web3. One of Poly Network&#8217;s primary use cases is as a cross-chain bridge, allowing users to move assets from one blockchain to another through a lock &amp; mint burn mechanism. &amp; mint and atomic swap.</p>



<p>This is one of the oldest projects in the crypto market, going into operation in August 2020 before DeFi summer explodes in mid-2021.</p>



<p>However, Poly Network <a href="https://coincu.com/9143-polynetworks-terrible-661m-hack-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was attacked </a>on August 10, 2021, causing more than 600 million USD in damage. The hack happened on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. This is the biggest hack ever in the DeFi market. This amount was later returned from the hacker.</p>



<p>Until now, after being refunded, Poly Network has returned to normal operations and continuously integrated many new blockchains and layer 2 in the market, such as zkSync Era, Aptos, Arbitrum, and Optimism…Up to now, the network has integrated with more than 30 chains.</p>

<p>As you can see, only some startups are raising capital at all stages. And with that comes a slowdown in hiring, signs of layoffs, and company closures that are still increasing due to the impact of market crises.</p>



<p>Venture capitalists have maintained a trend that began in 2022 amid scandals affecting the crypto sector. News of regulatory uncertainty, market downturns, and unprecedented crashes were the headwinds that drove venture capitalists out of the industry.</p>

<p>At the beginning of June, consecutive lawsuits against the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the market, Binance and Coinbase by the SEC, shook the cryptocurrency industry while blowing billions of dollars in assets of the SEC billionaires in this industry.</p>



<p>Additionally, venture capital firms may be less interested in investing in a highly volatile industry with the Fed still mulling over rate hikes.</p>



<p>However, the market seems to be recovering gradually, and there is a good chance that venture capital funding could increase later this year of the significant impetus that came from the wave of Bitcoin ETF spot fund registrations that have led Bitcoin to surge above $30,000, along with the overall improvement of the market. Also, when the US inflation rate falls, the financial sector can regain stability, undoubtedly attracting more funding.</p>

<p>The floor price of Azuki Elementals is 0.95 ETH, down 19.49%, and the floor price of Beanz is 0.3838 ETH, down 10.37%.</p>



<p>Despite the commercial success, the anime-style non-fungible token (NFT) collection &#8220;has yet to hit the mark&#8221; envisioned for the new NFT installment Elementals. However, some Azuki NFT owners have expressed disappointment that the new Elemental collection looks much like the previous one, causing a significant price drop on June 28, 2023.</p>



<p>An angry section of NFT fans criticizes the Azuki NFT team for their clumsy work in releasing the latest NFT. Some on crypto Twitter have questioned the exclusivity and value of Azuki NFT, causing the price of the company&#8217;s native non-fungible token to drop 34% in the 24 hours after Elementals minted it.</p>



<p>The fresh drop still drives sales around $38 million, but instead of attracting new buyers, some say the sales were mostly from existing buyers. Azuki&#8217;s official Twitter account quickly released a statement acknowledging their mistake and blaming it for having come up with an &#8220;ambitious goal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The decline of Elementals focuses on the challenging environment for the NFT as the crypto market continues to lag. The best NFT projects exist because of the strong communities they provide and their value to members. In a down market, growing this community becomes even more critical.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Saga smartphone by Solana Mobile indeed aims to provide users with a comprehensive solution for engaging in various activities related to cryptocurrency and the decentralized web. With its focus on minting NFTs, trading crypto, and navigating web3, the Saga phone seeks to empower individuals to participate actively in the digital economy.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-1024x768.png" alt="Solana Saga Review: The First Crypto Phone To Explore The Web3" class="wp-image-199455" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Solana Saga Review: The First Crypto Phone To Explore The Web3 28"></a></figure></div>


<p>In an era where concerns about privacy and control over personal data have become significant, the Saga phone&#8217;s success will largely depend on how it addresses these issues. As you mentioned earlier, smartphones have increasingly become surveillance devices that track and monitor our activities. If the Saga phone can offer robust security measures, enhanced user privacy, and greater control over personal data, it may resonate with individuals who prioritize these values.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Saga phone&#8217;s seamless integration of blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps) could potentially offer a user-friendly experience for individuals interested in exploring the world of cryptocurrency and web3. By providing a convenient platform for minting NFTs and trading crypto, the Saga phone might contribute to the wider adoption of these technologies.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that the success of the Saga phone will depend not only on its technological capabilities but also on factors such as market demand, competition, and user satisfaction. As the crypto and blockchain space continues to evolve rapidly, it will be intriguing to see how devices like the Saga phone shape the narrative of this ongoing saga themselves. Let&#8217;s find out more about this phone with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is the Saga Phone?</h2>



<p>The Solana Saga is a new Solana and OSOM solution that combines a flagship phone with an innovative method to handle built-in wallet security for popular Solana wallets like as Solflare and Phantom. Therefore, in a nutshell, it&#8217;s a crypto phone with outstanding specifications and consistent day-to-day performance.</p>



<p>The Solana phone costs $1,000 and is now available. The official release date for the Solana Saga phone is May 8th, 2023. You may now receive one if you pre-ordered. If you haven&#8217;t already purchased the Saga, you may sign up on Solana Mobile to be alerted when the phones are ready to ship.</p>



<p>The team believes that even in the worst-case scenario, customers will wind up purchasing a really wonderful Android gadget. The phone will also have privacy measures that allow users to disable Google and other services to which they do not want access.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seed Vault</strong></h3>



<p>Phantom and Solfare Solana wallets employ a 12-word seed phrase to generate or restore a wallet&#8217;s private keys (the keys that let you spend crypto). Solana&#8217;s seed vault ups the ante by producing a secure key with a 24-word seed phrase in encrypted storage and then granting access to the seed vault to certain applications — the aforementioned Phantom and Solflare wallets — for safe transactions.</p>



<p>These applications are installed via Solana&#8217;s own dApp Store rather than Google Play, with the following advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Secure seed vault (knows your seed phrase)</li>



<li>Solana dApp wallets (unknown seed phrase)</li>



<li>Solana mobile applications (just talk to the wallet)</li>



<li>More applications for Android 13 OS</li>
</ul>



<p>This configuration keeps your seed phrase distinct from the operating system and other software. It should be noted that the seed vault only works with Solana and the two wallets stated above. If you need to utilize another blockchain, the process is the same as it is on any other Android phone; you set up or restore the seed phrase from inside the app. The seed vault&#8217;s 24-word seed phrase is also compatible with other Solana wallets.</p>



<p>For the sake of science, I successfully imported the wallet into the Phantom Wallet Chrome plugin. I was able to execute the same thing on another Android phone after a few attempts, although the difficulties might have been due to a hardware problem. In what we&#8217;ll term &#8220;The Klondike Derby sled incident,&#8221; the phone in issue was once retrieved from an ice-encrusted snowbank.</p>



<p>In summary, even if you drive over your sparkling Saga with a hefty, hand-crafted sled, you can still retrieve your crypto wallet, although in a less secure manner than utilizing Saga&#8217;s seed vault.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DApp Store</strong></h3>



<p>The Solana Saga phone comes with 18 dApps that can be downloaded. During seed setup, you may have one or both wallets downloaded automatically. Additional dApps, such as Marinade (liquid Solana staking, anyone?) and Jupiter (swaps aplenty), may be downloaded from a special dApp store.</p>



<p>These Solana dApps&#8217; updates and permissions are likewise distinct from the Play Store.</p>



<p>Although the dApp selection is still limited, some of the major brands are already there, and the list is expected to increase over time. The dApp store is based on the Solana Mobile Stack (SMS), an open-source toolkit that allows developers to create mobile applications.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wallets</strong></h3>



<p>Phantom and Solflare are two possibilities to examine.</p>



<p>Each wallet supports both the seed vault and biometric authentication. At the touch of a finger, you may approve transactions. They both include connections to certain more dApps inside their wallet applications. Phantom, for example, has Solend (a crypto lending software), and Solfare includes a built-in browser, allowing you to go into the DeFi weeds if you so choose.</p>



<p>You may also access DeFi applications with Chrome or another browser. I used Chrome to connect to Solend and Marinade, selecting &#8220;Mobile Wallet Adapter&#8221; from the connect option. This summons your seed vault wallet of choice, in my instance Phantom.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Minty Fresh</strong></h3>



<p>Minty Fresh is one of 18 applications available in the dApp marketplace, and it&#8217;s really simple to use. Minty Fresh NFTs are created from your own graphics or photographs. If you&#8217;ve always wanted an NFT of your big toe or your dog that barks like a maniac during Zoom calls, now&#8217;s your chance.</p>



<p>Separately, the Saga comes with a free Genesis NFT — as well as a little dollars to get you started on your Solana voyage. That&#8217;s a nice touch.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jupiter And Marinade</strong></h3>



<p>Jupiter Finance dApp is a DeFi virtual currency asset developed on Solana.</p>



<p>Marinade Finance is a Solana-based non-custodial liquid staking mechanism. Marinade delivers a frictionless experience via automated staking techniques, with no lockup periods and fast access to staking rewards, for users who wish to stake their SOL tokens and participate in DeFi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Solana Mobile Stack</h2>



<p>The Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) is a free and open-source developer tool for building mobile-first cryptocurrency apps on the Solana blockchain.</p>



<p>Other blockchain applications may also contribute their code to Solana Labs to be audited and integrated. The objective for the future is to outsource the audit and integration to other teams.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Fees</h2>



<p>Apart from network costs for transactions, exchange fees, and staking fees (all of which are standard), users should not incur any additional expenses. Thus far, the Solana dApp store is completely free to use, with no hidden fees. This is subject to change in the future. With crypto, there are no assurances.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Security</h2>



<p>Two-thirds of the way up the rear of the Saga is a round, recessed fingerprint sensor. Learn how to use that part of the phone since you&#8217;ll use it a lot.</p>



<p>Saga takes security carefully since it syncs to user wallets and seed storage. Most Saga users are unlikely to be able to tell where Saga UX and security finish and an individual app&#8217;s security starts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Customer Support</h2>



<p>OSOM, a privacy-focused startup, created the Saga (like the seed vault). Nevertheless, support is only available via Solana Mobile. The website has a ticket system, a chat, and various FAQ-style support pages. The Saga is covered by a one-year limited guarantee against faults for the original owner alone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why Saga has good support for crypto users?</h2>



<p>Nowadays, cryptocurrency is mostly utilized on desktop browsers and is not optimized for mobile. The cooperation between OSOM and Solana Labs, hopefully, will alter that by allowing mobile-first web 3 solutions.</p>



<p>Crypto-specific hardware enables developers to construct previously unimaginable products. This incredible experience requires the following components:</p>



<ul>
<li>Secure Elements that allow you to access your keys safely while the wallet never sees your seed phrase</li>



<li>Trust Zone that prevents your wallet from lying about what you are signing APIs that allow you to do Bip 39 Key Recovery</li>



<li>Decentralized Dapp Marketplace with no fees at first (0.2% transaction fees in the future)</li>
</ul>



<p>If the Saga and the Solana network as a whole want to enroll a billion people, the seed vault is a step in the right way — but it&#8217;s just the first of many.</p>



<p>Most individuals will not bother with a 24-word recovery phrase that they must keep secret. To achieve Solana&#8217;s aim, a new strategy may be required at some time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The Solana Saga accomplishes its goal: it&#8217;s a phone that has a Solana hardware wallet and showcases the best of what web3 has to offer. The issue is that what web3 has to offer is still limited to NFTs and trading.</p>



<p>Android used to be the Linux to iOS&#8217;s macOS: a far more open experience with rough edges that might rend your shirt. It&#8217;s now just as wonderful as iOS, but less limited and complicated.</p>



<p>The Saga is a usable blockchain phone with built-in security that many cryptocurrency consumers will look for.</p>



<p>The phone symbolizes a stride forward for the network after numerous steps back: it slipped out of the top ten in terms of market capitalization, gained unwelcome publicity for network disruptions, and saw the arrest of its most vocal advocate, Sam Bankman-Fried. This phone provides developers with a strong foundation for re-establishing the network&#8217;s dominance.</p>

<p>While Ethereum continues to dominate most key metrics, Solana has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing Ethereum&#8217;s NFT trading volume. Ethereum has long been regarded as the leading platform for NFTs, but Solana has emerged as a formidable contender among the Ethereum Killers. The platform NFT trading volume reached an impressive $25.5 million within a 24-hour period, eclipsing Ethereum&#8217;s $24.5 million.</p>



<p>This marks a significant breakthrough for this platform, as it is the first time the platform has outperformed Ethereum in terms of total NFT trading volume. While Ethereum boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $26.7 billion, SOL&#8217;s TVL currently stands at $265.57 million.</p>



<p>Despite the gap in TVL and market capitalization between Ethereum ($231.17 billion) and SOL ($7.38 billion), <a href="https://coincu.com/199109-solana-makes-final-breakthrough/">Solana</a>&#8216;s recent surge in NFT trading volume highlights its growing prominence and potential as a thriving blockchain ecosystem.</p>

<p>As Solana continues to gain traction and demonstrate its potential, the platform&#8217;s achievements in the NFT market are enhancing its reputation and drawing the attention of investors as well as fans. Solana is establishing itself as a formidable competitor in the blockchain business, as seen by its rapid expansion and its capacity to hold its own against more well-established companies.</p>



<p>While Ethereum remains the dominant force, the recent achievement in NFT trading volume demonstrates its ability to carve out a niche and establish itself as a viable alternative. As the competition among blockchain platforms intensifies, the platform upward trajectory showcases its determination to challenge the status quo and redefine the future of decentralized applications and digital assets.</p>
