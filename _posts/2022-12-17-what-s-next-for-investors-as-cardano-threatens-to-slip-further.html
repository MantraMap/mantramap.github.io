tag: NewsBTC

The Cardano price continued to depict a strong bearish influence in the market. The coin lost over 7% of its value over the last 24 hours. On a weekly time frame, ADA was down by 14%. The extended price pullback might continue, so investors should be wary of their next move. The ADA price was unsettled; the only way investors can make gains is to sell now and buy when the coin dips further, as it would recover lost gains by correcting itself. The technical outlook for the coin supported the bearish thesis and emphasized that ADA might nosedive below its local support line. The trading volume of Cardano also dipped, indicating that sellers have taken over the market. In case of a price correction, if ADA manages to move above the $0.30 price mark, then the bulls will make a comeback. If bearish momentum continues to prevail, then investors will be presented with a shorting opportunity. Related Reading: Stablecoins Flow Into Spot Exchanges, Fuel For Christmas Bitcoin Rally?
