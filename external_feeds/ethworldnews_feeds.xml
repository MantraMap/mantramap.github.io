<ul><li>Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have appealed his remand to jail following the revocation of his bail.&nbsp;</li><li>Bankman-Fried’s legal defense team appealed in less than an hour of his arrest earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>Federal Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked the FTX founder’s bail for witness tampering and leaking Caroline Ellison’s private writings.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF will likely be jailed in Putnam County Correctional Facility and the Metropolitan Detention Center during the trial.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s legal defense team has appealed his remand to jail less than an hour after his bail was revoked by a Manhattan judge. The disgraced <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ryan-salame-plea-deal-prosecutors/">FTX</a> founder was handcuffed and escorted out of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York earlier today after federal Judge Lewis Kaplan remanded him into custody ahead of his trial, which is set to begin on October 2, 2023. </p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried Jailed For Witness Tampering</strong></h2>



<p>Inner City Press <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690106507436646400" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today that Judge Kaplan remanded Sam Bankman-Fried to jail due to his attempts to tamper with a key witness in the Department of Justice’s case against him. The judge also highlighted the FTX founder’s decision to leak the private writings of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison with the New York Times last month. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“In view of the evidence, my conclusion is that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has attempted to tamper with witnesses at least twice…” </p><cite>SDNY Judge Lewis A. Kaplan</cite></blockquote>



<p>After Bankman-Fried’s bail was revoked, he was handcuffed by U.S. Marshals and escorted out of the courtroom. As for Bankman-Fried’s jail arrangements, Assistant United States Attorney Danielle Sassoon proposed that he be held at the Putnam County Correctional Facility in New York and the Manhattan Detention Center during his trial. </p>

<p>Within an hour of Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail revocation and subsequent arrest, his legal defense team led by Mark Cohen appealed his remand to jail. Cohen had previously stated his intent to appeal and asked Judge Kaplan for a written order of bail revocation for the same. According to Inner City Press, an electronic filing for the appeal has been made, complete with a filing fee of $505.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss has accused DCG’s Chief Executive Barry Silbert of playing dumb.&nbsp;</li><li>Winklevoss has indicated that DCG’s motion to dismiss Gemini’s fraud lawsuit is baseless.&nbsp;</li><li>The Gemini co-founder believes that DCG’s defense will not hold up in front of a jury.&nbsp;</li><li>Gemini sued the Digital Currency Group last month for allegedly defrauding customers of the Gemini Earn Program.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Cameron Winklevoss has <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1690049346803245056" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to the Digital Currency Group’s motion to dismiss the fraud lawsuit filed by Gemini last month. DCG’s filing on August 10 claimed that Winklevoss’ crypto firm had failed to support the fraud alleged against the crypto conglomerate and its founder Barry Silbert. In response, Winklevoss, who serves as Gemini’s president, has accused DCG and its chief of playing dumb in order to avoid responsibility. </p>



<h2><strong>Good Luck In Front Of A Jury: Gemini’s Cameron Winklevoss</strong></h2>



<p>The Digital Currency Group’s motion to dismiss Gemini’s lawsuit highlighted that the complaint named DCG as the defendant, despite it having no direct business dealing with Cameron Winklevoss’ crypto exchange. The crypto conglomerate added that Gemini’s allegations pertaining to its transaction with its subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Silbert’s firm accused the Winklevoss twins of mounting a character assassination campaign on Twitter, to deflect the blame from the stranded customers of Gemini Earn Program. DCG also called out Gemini for avoiding responsibility, having actively promoted Genesis as a “sophisticated market participant” to its customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an X (formerly Twitter) post earlier today, Winklevoss described DCG’s motion to dismiss as a brief written by a law school student making up baseless legal defenses. According to the Gemini founder, the motion was in line with Silbert’s playbook of refusing to take responsibility, playing dumb, and attempting to avoid accountability using technicalities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Good luck making these arguments to a jury of your peers. See you in court.</p><cite>Cameron Winklevoss</cite></blockquote>



<p>Winklevoss also took issue with DCG’s claim of owing no direct duty to Gemini to correct the allegedly false statements made by Genesis. “When a company you own says you wrote a $1.1 billion check that you know you didn’t write, yes, you have a duty to correct this. Sorry, but this doesn’t even pass the giggle test,” the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-hints-xrp-relisting-price-up-4/">Gemini</a> founder added. </p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is inviting new public commentary on the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application, delaying a decision on the filing as expected by ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood. </p>



<p>By standard procedure, the SEC has 240 days to deliver a final decision on an application after initiating the review process. </p>



<p>Stakeholders who are interested in contributing to the discourse were urged to submit &#8220;written data, views, and arguments&#8221; within a 21-day timeframe. Back in June, the regulatory authority laid out its intent to &#8220;approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove&#8221; the application by the stipulated date of August 13.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pretty Standard,&#8221; Bloomberg&#8217;s Eric Balchunas said regarding the SEC&#8217;s request for public input on the proposed rule change.  </p>



<p>ARK Invest CEO Cathi Wood foresaw the delay, per an interview. &#8220;I think the SEC, if it&#8217;s going to approve a bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.&#8221; Wood <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-08-07/wood-sec-could-approve-more-than-one-bitcoin-etf-video" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-08-07/wood-sec-could-approve-more-than-one-bitcoin-etf-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> predicting simultaneous approvals from the SEC in the future. </p>

<h2>8 Bitcoin ETFs In-Play</h2>



<p>The SEC has received eight Bitcoin ETF applications including filings from BlackRock and Fidelity. Issuers seem in a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-assess-valkyries-spot-bitcoin-etf/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-assess-valkyries-spot-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">race</a> to clinch the inaugural Bitcoin ETF, a product that would allow a swathe of American investors access to Bitcoin without actually holding the cryptocurrency. </p>



<p>BlackRock CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larry Fink</a> opined that approval is a matter of when, not if, hinting at the approval of his firm&#8217;s submission in four to six months.</p>



<p>Historically, the SEC has denied Bitcoin ETF applications on the grounds of market manipulation and inadequate surveillance. The prevailing rebuttal points to the approval of Bitcoin Futures ETFs, a similar product.</p>

<p>The network hopes to offer users a web2-like experience, using Ethereum updates like Account Abstraction to implement seamless activities across networks compatible with EVM standards. DeBank also announced a private key signing feature built to safeguard assets. </p>

<h2>DeBank, Coinbase, Mantle Opt For OP Stack</h2>



<p>DeBank is the latest DeFi player to adopt Optimism&#8217;s OP stack for its own blockchain solution. Indeed, the OP stack has become popular among service providers looking to build tools that offer cheap on-chain transactions at scale. </p>



<p>Base, the layer 2 network backed by crypto exchange Coinbase, also built its recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> mainnet using Optimism&#8217;s developer kit. Users bridged ~ $170 million in crypto from Ethereum to Base less than 24 hours after the network launched. </p>



<p>Other decentralized networks like Mantle and OpBNB also chose OP stack for their chains. </p>

<p>The community behind the leading DeFi lending protocol Aave has voted in favor of a <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=289" rel="nofollow noopener">governance proposal</a> that seeks to acquire 5 million Curve DAO Tokens (CRV). The community was visibly divided over the proposal, with more than 42.19% of the votes against the CRV acquisition deal. However, nearly 58% of the community voted to proceed with the deal, which is expected to be implemented within 24 hours. </p>



<h2><strong>Aave To Use 2 Million USDT From Treasury To Acquire CRV</strong></h2>



<p>According to Aave’s governance <a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-acquire-crv-with-treasury-usdt/14251" rel="nofollow noopener">forum</a>, the decentralized finance protocol will use 2 million USDT from the Aave DAO treasury to strategically acquire 5 million CRV. The CRV purchase aims to support the DeFi ecosystem following the instability induced by the recent Curve Finance exploits. </p>



<p>Aave DAO is also looking to position itself strategically in the Curve Wars. The Curve Wars is a competition between several DeFi protocols to secure a large portion of Curve Finance’s liquidity by ensuring that their preferred pools offer the highest CRV rewards. The allocation of CRV rewards to pools is influenced by protocols that hold the most veCRV tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from supporting DeFi and strategizing for the Curve Wars, Aave is also hoping to incentivize liquidity for its native stablecoin <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-dao-approves-deploy-gho-ethereum/">GHO</a>. The DeFi protocol plans to lock the CRV tokens in order to accumulate Curve voting power and support a GHO-specific gauge, which would benefit GHO secondary liquidity. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The treasury balance and the predicted lower costs for service providers for the 2023-2024 budget would allow this strategic acquisition while maintaining a conservative stance with DAO treasury holdings.”</p><cite>Aave governance forum</cite></blockquote>



<p>The community is currently mulling over two other proposals that seek to limit its exposure to CRV. The first proposal aims to reduce the liquidation threshold by 6% for CRV on Aave Ethereum V2. The proposal is poised for approval, with 100% of the votes currently in favor. The second proposal seeks to disable the borrowing of CRV on Ethereum and Polygon V3. This proposal has not been met with any resistance so far and is set to be implemented after August 13, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Binance Labs, the crypto exchange&#8217;s venture capitalist and incubator arm, plans to invest $5 million in CRV, Curve DAO&#8217;s token and a widely used crypto in Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized finance ecosystem. CRV will also deploy on BNB Chain as part of the agreement.</p>

Binance said the commitment to CRV directly helps to shape DeFi&#8217;s future and propel growth within the industry, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$5m-in-curve-dao-token-crv-and-supports-curve-deployment-to-bnb-chain-4372009526169554266" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$5m-in-curve-dao-token-crv-and-supports-curve-deployment-to-bnb-chain-4372009526169554266" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs Yi He. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Given the recent events that have impacted the protocol, Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration.</p></blockquote>



<h2>SEAL 911 Assembled Amid Curve Recovery</h2>



<p>Nearly two weeks after a reentrancy exploit, Curve Finance has recovered roughly three-quarters of ~ $70 million drained from liquidity pools on the platform. Affected protocols like Alchemix either had the stolen funds <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/">returned</a> by exploiters or recovered by white hat hackers. </p>



<p>Curve Finance is yet to recover assets from the CRV/ETH pools at the time of writing. The protocol put out a bounty of $1.8 million, around 10% of the outstanding funds, for any information on the exploiters&#8217; identity. </p>



<p>The incident also galvanized a collaborative initiative comprised of white hat hackers, auditors, and security experts. SEAL 911, a telegram chatbot <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-defi-first-responder-telegram-bot/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-defi-first-responder-telegram-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by Paradigm head of security Sam (@samczsun) connects any user to a pool of vetted professionals offering assistance in emergency cases like the hacks on CRV pools and Euler. </p>

<p>Base, the L2 Ethereum network backed and built by crypto exchange Coinbase, is officially open for public access. </p>



<p>100 decentralized apps and crypto service providers like Chainlink are available on the blockchain at launch. Moreover, Base features an official <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/" rel="noreferrer noopener">bridge</a> to Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet allowing users to freely move ETH between both networks.</p>



<p>The launch of Base also coincides with the company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1689315339006574592?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1689315339006574592?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Onchain Summer</a>&#8221; week-long event featuring commemorative NFTs and rewards for users. </p>



<p>Coinbase is the first-ever publicly traded entity in the U.S. to launch its own decentralized network. The company does not plan to launch a token for its Base L2 blockchain. </p>



<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s Secret Plan</h2>



<p>The decentralized network developed using Optimism&#8217;s OP stack is part of &#8220;The Coinbase Secret Master Plan&#8221;, said CEO Brian Armstrong when Base was announced back in February. </p>



<p>By mid July, would-be early users trooped into Base despite the network being only accessible to developers at the time. Several &#8220;degens&#8221; bridged their Ether (ETH) tokens to the network through a portal proxy contract, a one-way door from Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem to Base. The gateway allowed these users to make millions overnight aping into risky memecoins like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" rel="noreferrer noopener">BALD</a>.</p>



<p>BALD holders however soon found themselves rekt after the token&#8217;s developer withdrew liquidity in what turned out to be a rug pull. A number of other memecoins on Base also turned out to be scams as well. At the time, Base users only had access to a one-way bridge, leaving liquidity trapped in the budding ecosystem. </p>

<p>Layer 1 blockchain Aptos Labs has announced a partnership with tech giant Microsoft to leverage each other’s infrastructure and roll out new products. The partnership will also see both firms explore blockchain-based use cases, including asset tokenization, central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/central-bank-mas-standard-cbdc-stablecoin/">CBDCs</a>), and digital payment, among others. </p>



<h2><strong>Aptos Assistant: AI-Powered Chatbot for Aptos Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/08/09/microsoft-aptos-labs-ai-blockchain-partnership-github-copilot-aptos-assistant-chatgpt/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a>, Aptos will collaborate with Microsoft Azure’s OpenAI service to develop an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot similar to OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. The new chatbot, Aptos Assistant, will help users and developers access data and information about the Aptos ecosystem. </p>



<p>As part of the partnership, Aptos will run validator nodes on Microsoft Azure for efficient transactions and better security of the network. The layer-1 blockchain will also integrate its programming language, Move, with the Microsoft-owned coding platform GitHub. Move will specifically be integrated with Github’s Copilot, which is an AI-enabled tool that helps developers by auto-completing codes.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The intersection of AI and blockchain is one of the most interesting combinations of emerging technologies.

<p>Additionally, a team of developers from Aptos will directly collaborate with Microsoft’s AI professionals to train the tech giant’s AI models using Aptos’ verified blockchain information. As part of the partnership, Microsoft will open the door for large financial institutions to explore blockchain solutions with Aptos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mo Sheikh, the Chief Executive of Aptos Labs, stated that the partnership with Microsoft is part of a larger vision between the companies. “We didn’t want to go off onto the side and just hack something together just for the hype of A.I. We wanted that deep integration and co-development,” Sheikh added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>APT, the native token of the Aptos blockchain, surged more than 17% after news of the partnership with Microsoft broke. At the time of writing, APT was trading at $7.84.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Winklevoss-owned Gemini recently hinted at relisting XRP leading to a 4.7% surge in its price.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange has tweeted two cryptic messages teasing the crypto’s relisting on its trading platform.&nbsp;</li><li>Gemini previously stated that it was exploring the token after the summary judgment in SEC v Ripple.&nbsp;</li><li>XRP’s recent rally has prompted the liquidation of $2.4 million worth of short positions on centralized exchanges.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Gemini has hinted at relisting XRP on its trading platform. In two separate crypto tweets, the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange indicated that it would be relisting the token soon. The relisting tease comes less than a month after a federal judge in New York ruled that XRP’s sales to retail investors on secondary markets did not qualify as an investment contract, handing a major victory to Ripple.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>XRP’s Rally Liquidates Short Positions Worth $2.4 Million </strong></h2>



<p>Gemini’s official X (Twitter) account posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1688661246231359490" rel="nofollow noopener">meme</a> earlier today which read, “Me, the intern, patiently waiting for<a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini" rel="nofollow noopener"> @Gemini</a> to list XRP.” The online crypto community interpreted it as a hint of XRP’s impending relisting. A few hours later, the crypto exchange tweeted another XRP-themed message, which reinforced the speculation about the token’s relisting. </p>

<p>The speculation surrounding XRP’s relisting on Gemini has led to a rally of more than 4.7%. The token went from $0.61 to $0.64 in less than 24 hours. The rally also prompted a visible uptick in the token’s daily trading volume, as well as its market capitalization. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Coinglass showed that the surge in XRP’s price also caused the liquidation of short positions worth over $2.4 million over the past 24 hours. </p>

<p>Gemini previously announced that it was exploring relisting XRP for both spot and derivatives trading. The announcement came on July 13 following the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-dismiss-sec-lawsuit-ripple-ruling/">summary judgment</a> in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. In the aftermath of the summary judgment, leading crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Crypto.com, announced that they would reverse the decision to suspend XRP’s trading and relist the cryptocurrency. </p>



<p>The token was delisted from several exchanges after the SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, accusing the blockchain firm of conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While last year’s downtimes and the seven major exploits the chain experienced in 2022 led to a severe decline in its TVL, the year so far has been different. Per <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Messari</a>, Solana’s TVL at the beginning of the year was $209.25 million. Growing by 217% since then, the Layer 1 (L1) network’s TVL was $664 million at press time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Solana registered a TVL uptick in the last month, other top L1 networks Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche, saw respective declines of 13%, 6%, and 10%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, Arbitrum saw its TVL fall by 7% in the last month. Optimism, however, fared better as the rollup network logged a 10% jump in its TVL during the same period. </span></p>
<h4><b>State of Solana</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite registering a TVL growth in the last month, user activity on Solana suffered a shortfall. Per data from </span><a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/solana" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Token Terminal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the network registered a 5% decline in active user count in the past 30 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For context, user activity on the chain has been on a steady decline in the last year, primarily due to the several downtimes and exploits the network suffered during that period. In the past 180 days, daily active user count dropped by 15%. In the last 12 months, this fell by over 50%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1.6% drop in active user activity on Solana last week reduced trading volume across the decentralized exchanges hosted on the chain. zkSync, with a much lower TVL, exceeded Solana in DEX volume during that period, on-chain data revealed.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a silver lining exists. While user activity and trading volume suffered a decline, Solana’s transaction fees and network revenue surged. Per data from <a href="https://analytics.solscan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Solscan</a>, network fees charged for successful non-vote transactions climbed to a high of 53.06 SOL on 2 August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it has since declined, this represented a significant growth in network fees from 31.64 SOL recorded a month ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A broader assessment of all network fees revealed a 50% jump in the last month. Solana also saw a corresponding hike in revenue during the same period. On an annualized basis, the L1’s revenue has gone up by 21%.</span></p>
