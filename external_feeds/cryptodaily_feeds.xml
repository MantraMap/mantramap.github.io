			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Manipulation and fraud in the diamond industry goes on to this day. The Diamond Dawn NFT collection showcases an elegant solution to the problem.</p>
A $100 billion problem
<p>In the diamond industry there are factors in how a diamond is graded that make the most enormous amount of difference. Suppose you have a pink diamond that is worth $130,000 per carat. You&rsquo;d be in the money, but, if your diamond were red, the change in value ($4.5 million per carat) could be life-changing.</p>
<p>So could the colour be upgraded in order to benefit from the huge change in value? You might think that the colour is the colour, but in the diamond industry today anything appears to be possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin with, who decides the colour anyway? This isn&rsquo;t something your average consumer can evaluate. To grade a diamond requires training and specialist equipment.</p>
<p>Several companies offer professional diamond certification services. The certificate lists all a diamond&rsquo;s natural attributes, and therefore the paper certificate is needed in order to establish the trust that is recognised across the industry.</p>
Bribery and fraud
<p>In order to get your diamond properly certified, according to the industry, you need to hand it over to a certification company for review. Once the review process is complete, you receive your diamond certification with the listed grading for each attribute.</p>
<p>However, this process can be manipulated, and the characteristics of the diamond can be changed. It was revealed in 2005 that the GIA, one of the most trusted sources of diamond evaluation, was accepting bribes to change and upgrade the attributes of diamonds in its reports.</p>
<p>Even if the diamond industry may have cleaned up its act since, for the whole industry to rely on certificates that are stored on paper ledgers held by the biggest certification companies is problematic. How do we know whether certificates have been tampered with?</p>
Introducing Diamond Dawn

<p>&ldquo;I founded Diamond Dawn to demonstrate how decentralized technology can create a REAL-LIFE impact&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Mike Moldawsky, CEO, Diamond Dawn.</p>
<p>An NFT project designed to solve real-life problems, Diamond Dawn demonstrates how decentralised NFT technology can solve the massive problems that beset the diamond industry, including that of certification fraud.</p>
<p>So how is this done?</p>
<p>The Diamond Dawn project locked 333 REAL GIA certified diamonds in a vault in the Israeli Diamond Exchange centre. The team developed a smart contract that can represent the attributes displayed on a GIA certificate, and the corresponding traits of all 333 diamonds were injected into it, effectively creating the first ever set of on-chain diamond certifications.</p>
<p>The project partnered with artist David Ariew, who recently sold his first digital artwork at Sotheby&rsquo;s, and he designed the digital counterparts to the 333 physical diamonds.</p>
A 6-month project
<p>The project has two main objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">To demonstrate the disruptive power of decentralised NFT technology and show how it can be used to solve real-world problems.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">To explore if digital assets can hold a greater value than physical ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>The project is divided into 4 phases.</p>
<p>The first three phases take place exclusively in the digital realm, while the fourth and final phase can take place in either the digital or physical world.</p>
<p>Over these four stages, collectors will evolve their digital diamonds on the blockchain through a process similar to the natural diamond manufacturing process in the real world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the final stage, collectors will have to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Keep the diamond in its digital form forever.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Burn the digital diamond in exchange for a luxurious ~8kg artwork containing their physical GIA-certified diamond delivered to their doorstep.</li>
</ul>
NFT technology will disrupt all industries
<p>A lot of people associate NFTs with simple artworks that might be bought and flipped to make a profit. This is far from the truth. The technology is actually only limited by human imagination at this point, and will be used to disrupt every industry in the most remarkable ways.</p>
<p>NFTs enable anyone to own an asset, or a fraction thereof, and to be able to indisputably prove its ownership and provenance, and be able to verify this authenticity beyond the shadow of a doubt without having to rely on any third party.</p>
<p>Diamond Dawn will demonstrate the power and utility of this technology in the real-life situation of the diamond industry. The project marks the beginning of a new era where blockchain and NFT technology enter traditional industries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diamond Dawn's private sale starts on January 11th.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>U.S. billionaire and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, will be deposed in court in February as part of a continuing lawsuit against him by customers of the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Voyager Digital, who claim that Cuban promoted a Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Cuban and his legal team requested that the deposition be split into two sessions, but the request was denied on January 9, by overseeing judge Lisette M. Reid. The full deposition will take part on Feb 2 in Dallas, Texas. Two other Dallas Mavericks employees will also be deposed before February 23 as part of the defense. The suit against Cuban was filed in a U.S. District Court in South Florida in August 2022, by disgruntled customers of Voyager who allege that Cuban misrepresented the firm in promotional materials. The suit describes Voyager as a &ldquo;massive Ponzi scheme&rdquo; and makes specific reference to Cuban&rsquo;s aggressive promotion of the firm to crypto novices and inexperienced retail investors. Voyager was allegedly targeting such investors.</p>
<p>Cuban finds himself in deep trouble after he made statements that enticed Voyager investors, including claiming that the lender was &ldquo;as close to risk-free as you&rsquo;re gonna get in the crypto universe.&rdquo; The lawsuit also alleges that Voyagers described itself as a &ldquo;fully compliant and licensed crypto broker&rdquo; despite not being registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the required Federal or state regulators involved in overseeing the selling of securities.</p>
<p>Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 6 following heavy liquidity issues as a result of a defaulted loan involving Three Arrows Capital and the ongoing crypto winter. Voyager is currently undergoing what they call a &ldquo;restructuring plan&rdquo; aimed at preserving customer assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase has announced that it will lay off around 950 staff in a bid to cut costs.</p>
<p>Coinbase, one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, has recently announced plans to lay off a significant portion of its workforce. According to a company statement, the layoffs are a result of the "evolving industry landscape" and a need to "align our company with the current market conditions."</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong said in the statement that cost-saving was the main reason behind the lay-offs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've made the difficult decision to reduce our operating expense by about 25% Q/Q, which includes letting go of about 950 people. All impacted team members will be informed by today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The news of the layoffs has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, with many wondering what this means for the future of Coinbase and the industry as a whole. Some have suggested that the layoffs may be a sign of deeper issues at the company.</p>
<p>Despite the layoffs, Coinbase remains one of the most valuable and respected companies in the cryptocurrency space. Founded in 2012, the company has quickly become one of the most popular exchanges for buying and selling digital assets, and it has been widely credited with helping to bring mainstream attention to the world of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>However, Coinbase's success has not been without its challenges. The company has faced regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and it has also struggled to maintain profitability in the face of intense competition. The recent decline in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has also had a significant impact on the company's bottom line.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Internet and email service providers have been ordered by the Nepalese telecommunications regulator to block access to any cryptocurrency-related trading websites or face possible legal action. </p>
<p>Internet service providers (ISPs) in Nepal have received instruction from the country&rsquo;s telecommunications regulators to block access to all cryptocurrency trading websites. Those who fail to comply with the instruction have been threatened by legal action. The Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA) issued a notice to all ISPs and email service providers which orders them to prevent access to &ldquo;websites, apps or online networks&rdquo; related to any cryptocurrency activities according to reports by Cointelegraph.</p>
<p>In a September 2021 notice, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), declared cryptocurrency trading and mining illegal, further stating &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; others to make use of cryptos is also an activity that is punishable by law.</p>
<p>The NTAs recent notice said that virtual currency transactions &ldquo;are increasing in recent days&rdquo; and underscored the fact that cryptocurrency transactions are still illegal in Nepal. The NTA also issued a similar notice in April related to crypto websites requesting the public to inform the regulator if they have information &ldquo;related to the name of such website, app, or online network.&rdquo; The April notice also threatened legal action if &ldquo;anyone is found to have done or been doing&rdquo; crypto-related activities.</p>
<p>Despite being deemed illegal in Nepal, the country has been at the forefront of global cryptocurrency adoption and has been ranked 16th globally according to a Chainanalysis report.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Over the last few months, the growth of cryptocurrency has shifted to one of enthusiasm, with discussions centered on decentralized finance, NFTs, and token games. As the niche evolves in quest of more intriguing use cases and, ultimately, value for its members, a new model has developed - play to earn.</p>
<p class="s5">Taunt Battleworld is the world's first engage-to-earn NFT fighting game simulator, created by Amazon, EA, and Unity industry veterans. This vision combines the strength of NFTs, the thrill of a fighting game, and a comprehensive ecosystem that adds value to users in every aspect of play while sustaining a strong token and gaming economy.</p>
<p class="s5">If the UFC is to the real world, then Taunt Battleworld is the UFC of the Metaverse. The platform is a one-stop experience for both gaming and entertainment. Everyone should take advantage of the Lootbox Sales and Token Sellout. First, tokens will be released in Q4 through BSCPad, Bullperks, and Bybit directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s5">In addition, unique Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be available in the Lootbox. This is remarkable. All investors can quickly hop on the ongoing Lootbox pre-registration program to enjoy every benefit that comes with it.</p>
<p class="s5">Interestingly, the platform uses blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to provide innovative gaming and entertainment experiences. The team is committed to providing inclusive gaming that is cross-platform and cross-blockchain whenever possible. The aim is to bring Taunt Battleworld to the community's doorsteps, no matter where they are.</p>
<p class="s9">The Core Edges of the Game</p>
<p class="s5">The game, being a skill-based fighting simulator, is the first to combine the fastest-growing segment in Gamefi into one ecosystem. It also employs a novel method of play known as "engage-to-earn." Players will be paid in real-time during each phase of gameplay by merging watch-to-earn and predict-to-earn elements using unique interactive technology.</p>
<p class="s5">Taunt Battleworld is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the old Gods have transformed Earth into Battleworld, their playground. In addition, as an exciting new NFT game where you own and manage Acolyte Warriors on a quest to become champions, players can acquire, grow, and test their warriors against others in the grand arenas of the new world. This is done to achieve favor with the Old Gods.</p>
<p class="s5">NFTs are obtained from the marketplace via Genesis drops or secondary market sales. Players can, on the other hand, obtain NFTs created by other players through bleeding that is listed on the company&rsquo;s marketplace.&nbsp; Surprisingly, durable power-ups and enhancements can also be obtained to give a fighter a competitive advantage in the game.</p>
<p class="s5">25,000 of the universe's strongest warriors have been summoned to a never-ending battle for domination. How fights are won is just as essential as the fact that they are won. Above all, taunting is both encouraged and rewarded.</p>
<p class="s5">The Genesis Skull Pass, which will be available on the Ethereum network, will be the first NFT drop for Taunt Battleworld. This is done to maximize the number of people that could be adopted into Taunt Battleworld.</p>
<p class="s5">It is necessary to mention that the Polygon (Matic) network will&nbsp; be used to run the game's blockchain components. Fast speeds and minimal transaction fees will be possible while retaining high security. Wherever practical, the company intends to use Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for randomization processes.</p>
<p class="s9">Play, Watch and Predict to Earn</p>
<p class="s5">To compete for real-world prizes, players must enter their Acolyte Warriors into tournaments. Warriors have the best chance of winning if the players choose their runes and matches wisely. It's also possible to make money by watching brawls. Players are rewarded for sharing their knowledge of the Old Gods with the rest of the community.</p>
<p class="s5">To summarize, competing against others in live prediction contests with no monetary stakes is a significant advantage. Players use their knowledge and wits to progress to higher NFTs. Indeed,&nbsp; Taunt Battleworld values strategy, skills, and accessibility!</p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, the company&rsquo;s data cooperation with Esports Technologies (NASDAQ: $EBET) will provide new experiences and betting solutions for the Taunt Battleworldcommunity to gamble on events outside of the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s9">The Team and Its Structures</p>
<p class="s5">The team's ultimate goal is for players to be able to play Taunt Battleworld on the platforms of their choice. Soldiers are placed into Brawls to fight (much like in a 2D fighting game), but instead of controlling them directly, players choose their strategy. Everyone can profit from the ecosystem in a variety of ways as they fight and win or lose.</p>
<p class="s5">The team has been working tirelessly to bring its Acolyte Warrior NFTs, as well as the Alpha gaming platform and the Token Genesis Event, ready for launch. They've also been fast expanding to serve the Taunt Battleworld long-term strategy. Over 20 individuals are working on the product, including full-time contractors and staff.</p>
<p class="s5">Taunt Battleworld collaborates with a number of key partners. Chainlink - VRF, ASM, and Polygon are compatible blockchains. Furthermore, NAP Alliance and Magic Eden are two significant marketplaces. Similarly, BSCpad and Bullperks Launchpads are platform perks.</p>
<p class="s5">The Platform also has specific drops in place with IP partners including Floyd Mayweather, Cris Cyborg, and others. Furthermore, with backers such as Polygon Studios, Genblock Capital, and Shima Capital ($4.3 million raised), the team has prioritized development.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The notorious Avraham Eisenberg, also known for masterminding the $117 million hack on Mango Markets, has been charged with market manipulation by the CFTC.&nbsp;</p>
CFTC Follows DOJ, Charges Eisenberg
<p>On Monday, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) joined the U.S. Department of Justice in bringing charges of market manipulation against Avraham Eisenberg. The DOJ had arrested Eisenberg towards the end of 2022 on similar charges for his role in the Mango Markets hack that resulted in the loss of assets worth $117 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government body announced this news through a press release, which read,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging Avraham Eisenberg with a fraudulent and manipulative scheme to unlawfully obtain over $110 million in digital assets from a purported decentralized digital asset exchange.&rdquo;</p>

CFTC&rsquo;s First Enforcement In Crypto
<p>The lawsuit against Eisenberg alleges that he violated federal commodities law by employing a &ldquo;deceptive device&rdquo; to manipulate the price of the MNGO token. Over $100 million worth of crypto was siphoned away from the decentralized exchange after the trader used multiple accounts to buy, sell, and hedge the price of the token. Incidentally, this would be the CFTC&rsquo;s first legal action involving digital asset trading on a decentralized platform and involving the &lsquo;oracle manipulation&rsquo; scheme that Eisenberg employed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Acting Director of Enforcement, Gretchen Lowe stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The CFTC will use all available enforcement tools to aggressively pursue fraud and manipulation regardless of the technology that is utilized. The CEA prohibits deception and swap manipulation, whether on a registered swap execution facility or on a decentralized blockchain-based trading platform.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

CFTC Dismisses Eisenberg&rsquo;s Claims Of Legality
<p>Eisenberg had voluntarily admitted that he was responsible for the exploit and claimed that he and his team did nothing illegal. In fact, according to him, his actions were all part of a profitable trading strategy. He has even returned a part of the funds to the platform. However, it is clear that the DOJ did not share his viewpoint on the matter and arrested him roughly two months later on charges of market manipulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the CFTC, too, has taken a similar approach to the hack, claiming that Eisenberg had openly admitted to his scheme in a Discord server prior to the exploit as well as through his tweets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Contrary to his purported belief that his actions were legal, in fact, they constituted blatant manipulation of spot prices and swaps.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Peaks Around 17396:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 11 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) gave back some recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair orbited the 17267.87 area, a level that represents the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp; Traders pushed BTC/USD as high as the 17396.25 area, its strongest print since mid-December and one that was reached after Stops were elected above the 17329.38 area, representing the 50% retracement of the depreciating range from 18385.36 to 16273.40.&nbsp; Technical bids emerged around the 17143.71 area during subsequent pullbacks, right around the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 16326.16 to 17396.25.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, was off more than 3% in December, and is up approximately 4.5% month-to-date. Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16926.07 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17172.03.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies with real-world use cases that bring something new to the table will always triumph over ones that don't. For this reason, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), which is up 805% in stage 3 of its presale, is expected to rise alongside both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and World Cup Inu (WCI) in 2023! And as we all know, investing early in these projects is where the most profits are made. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) </p>
<p>Raising capital quickly can be difficult for many startup businesses. There are a lot of hurdles and rejections they must go through before they get their funding in order. Even more difficult is building and connecting to a community. Orbeon Protocol seeks to change this. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol will create a one-of-a-kind platform where startups can mint equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs as a form of investment. Investors will then be able to purchase a small part of this NFT for a price as low as $1. This system will bring faster and cheaper fundraising for both businesses, while providing new opportunities for investors! </p>
<p>What happens if a company fails to reach its funding goal? Orbeon Protocol has implemented a unique "Fill or Kill" system directly into its smart contract, which will provide refunds to all investors if the project fails to reach its target.</p>
<p>The project features a native ORBN token, which provides holders with various benefits. ORBN holders will be privy to priority access to funding rounds, governance rights, staking rewards and trading fee discounts. This utility has seen ORBN surge from $0.004 to its current price of $0.0362 in presale. And since experts believe the ORBN price may surge by 6,000% in the next few months, a significant profit for investors is not out of the question.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Shiba Inu (SHIB) </p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) was created after the success of Dogecoin (DOGE). Essentially, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin similar to DOGE. With Shiba Inu (SHIB), users can pay fees and help make network decisions.</p>
<p>Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous principal creator of Shibarium, is upbeat about the fate of Shiba Inu (SHIB) regardless of the broad crypto downturn. However, many traders are not so optimistic as Shiba Inu (SHIB) is worth $0.00000807 at the moment. Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders remain optimistic that the token&rsquo;s newfound utility will help it to retain value. </p>
<p class="s9">World Cup Inu (WCI)</p>
<p>The first ETH token to sponsor the World Cup is World Cup Inu (WCI). At its core, the World Cup Inu (WCI) presents a unique betting web3 platform. With the help of the World Cup Inu (WCI), users may employ Ethereum from their digital wallets to wager on their favorite team's victory.</p>
<p>World Cup Inu (WCI), like Shiba Inu (SHIB), has suffered dramatically due to its low practical value. The World Cup Inu (WCI) is currently worth $0.002106, a drastic 50% fall in just a month. Unfortunately, the World Cup Inu (WCI) disappears as soon as the sporting event ends. At this moment, an investment in the World Cup Inu (WCI) is not a good idea. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The company&rsquo;s lawyers claimed that BlockFi had repaid an investor $15 million to settle a threatened lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
Lawsuit Threat Settled With $15M
<p>Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi is attempting to repay its investors. In a recent hearing of bankruptcy court, the company&rsquo;s lawyers claimed that in the summer of 2022, BlockFi executives had paid a sum of $15 million to an investor who had threatened to sue the company because of its plummeting equity value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investor, who was addressed only as Counterparty A, had purchased equity shares that were issued as part of executive compensation packages. Back in 2022, the shares held a higher value due to the company&rsquo;s $6 billion valuation. However, the year wreaked havoc across the industry in the form of the collapse of the FTX ecosystem, resulting in plummeting values of BlockFi shares.&nbsp;</p>
Executives Paid Out Of Own Pocket
<p>According to BlockFi attorney Joshua Sussberg, the investor threatened to sue as they claimed that BlockFi and its executives should have been more open about the contagion risks in such an event. However, the charges were dropped after the settlement payment was made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the $15 million, BlockFi founder Zac Prince contributed the majority of $6.144 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sussberg said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think the important takeaway here is that there was no situation where insiders were pulling money off the platform on the eve of or anywhere near this bankruptcy file ... So this is not the Celsius case where management extracted value on the eve of the file.&rdquo;</p>

BlockFi &amp; FTX Drama
<p>BlockFi shares dropped in value significantly due to the company&rsquo;s exposure to FTX. The crypto exchange extended an emergency loan to the lending platform on July 1, 2022. The loan opened doors for FTX to buy BlockFi for $240 million, thus establishing a maximum value for existing equity. This buyout price resulted in the founder Zak Prince losing $412.82 million in equity stake as well as caused him to miss out on a planned $600,000 bonus payment. The downfall of the lending platform also led to the layoffs of 20% of the BlockFi workforce. Although an employee bonus package is in the works for court approval, unfortunately, Prince and other higher management will not be considered for it. The platform has also appealed to the courts for permission to return frozen assets from BlockFi wallets to users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lending platform had filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022, just weeks after the FTX ecosystem crashed. Both the companies had been tussling over Robinhood shares worth $435 million that BlockFi claimed as collateral on an unpaid debt owed to it by FTX affiliate Alameda Research. Matters got even more complicated with the United States Department of Justice seized the shares.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Tel Aviv, Israel, 10th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Building Blocks 23, a web3 builder-focused event, will be hosted in central Tel Aviv on February 7, 2023. Hosted by top Israeli companies as part of ETH TLV, the one-day Building Blocks event will bring together Ethereum developers and communities.</p>
<p>A series of workshops, panel discussions, and informal events will take place across Tel Aviv throughout ETH TLV. Building Blocks 23 organizers Collider, Fireblocks, and MarketAcross, in conjunction with StarkWare, will guide delegates through the art of creating a successful web3 business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the global stage, Tel Aviv plays an out-sized role in innovative startups with proven track records,&rdquo; said Idan Ofrat, Co-founder and CTO at Fireblocks. &ldquo;With the emergence of web3, we are excited to co-host Building Blocks 23 and to support the city&rsquo;s forward-thinking startup culture, bringing together the best collective experiences and insights that the country has to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Building Blocks 23 will form a day-long event for the foundations of web3 entrepreneurship. Founders and builders will share personal knowledge and experience of the industry&rsquo;s ups and downs. The lessons, mistakes, and success stories of successful web3 builders will be recounted for the benefit of those whose web3 journey has just begun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A series of talks will cover lessons and experiences of building in web3, mastering leading protocols, and staying on course in the face of market turbulence. Topics will also include fundraising, finding product market fit, building a security-first organization, growing a community, and building teams and culture in a distributed setting. In addition, a series of practical workshops will cover such matters as treasury management, developing sustainable tokenomic frameworks, and effective marketing and branding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Israel has always been a builders' hub,&rdquo; said Itai Elizur, COO of MarketAcross. &ldquo;Innovation is part of our DNA. Naturally, the narrative has shifted from Israel being a startup nation to a web3 nation. Tel Aviv is an ideal host as it continues to be a tech engine for a top-notch community of developers.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Raffle businesses represent a $366 billion-dollar industry, with experts estimating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.10% from 2022 to 2028. Should their forecast prove correct, the industry may reach up to $405 billion by 2028.</p>
Unfriendly Competition in the Web2 Raffle Industry
<p>This does not mean smooth sailing for any raffle business. Traditional lottery companies need help in many areas, including player trust and technical framework. Moreover, these legitimate businesses also need to compete with illegal lotteries for players since the latter usually have very attractive grand prizes &ndash; without the tax and deductions, of course.</p>
<p>What is more, aspiring lottery businesses have to come up with additional ways to encourage players, especially in jurisdictions that are dominated by large companies. One might even assume that big players are monopolizing the market and that smaller lotteries are being removed from the competition.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, lottery businesses are also noticing an increase in the number of people who are cynical about the raffle results&rsquo; integrity. Hence, there is a need for traditional lotteries to develop a decentralized and convenient means for people to check the proof of the integrity of the entire gaming process.</p>
BillionAir: The next generation of raffles and gaming
<p>Thankfully, these pain points are being addressed by new generations of lotteries like BillionAir, a raffle and gaming platform that uses blockchain technology. BillionAir leverages blockchain to provide a provably-fair gaming mechanism that everyone can check, cultivating trust from players and critics alike. The platform also issues digital tickets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ensuring undisputable ticket ownership.</p>
<p>BillionAir offers unique features, with most made possible only with blockchain integration. In detail, BillionAir has its own native AIRB token, which provides multiple exclusive utilities. For example, AIRB holders can stake their tokens via BillionAir&rsquo;s staking systems (liquidity pools, locked staking, etc.), greatly benefiting them with attractive annual percentage yields (APYs). Aside from accruing interest from staking, users can also receive NFT raffle tickets from BillionAir&rsquo;s Raffle Ticket Staking Pool.</p>
<p>Unlike most traditional raffles, BillionAir allows players to buy multiple tickets depending on their whitelisting tier and gain higher odds of winning by climbing the tiers. To increase the tier, they need to hold more AIRB tokens, which also signifies support for BillionAir and its vision, or play games, invite friends, and complete social tasks.</p>
<p>Aside from raffles, BillionAir is introducing matching games with exciting prizes like wagering arcade games, branded games, and more through our providers.</p>
<p>Prizes can also vary from digital assets, such as coins and NFTs, to physical goods like designer goods and luxury cars, to exclusive passes like concert tickets and invitations to meetings with celebrities.</p>
Team and Partners
<p>The BillionAir ecosystem was developed by seasoned talents, namely Co-Founders Radovan Voda and Radek Pl&eacute;ha. Rahul A R, leading the blockchain and game development; Ihor Medvediv and Bohdan Stavskyi, building sustainable growth and financial strategy; Tom&aacute;&scaron; Rokos as the lead analytic; and Arthur Iinuma, an industry veteran who has stood alongside many successful projects as the main advisor; and Chainlab partners and advisors Ricardo Barcolari and Giacomo Voltolina. Meanwhile, BillionAir has partnered with Blockchain Legal and SimpleTax &amp; Law to ensure that the platform complies with relevant laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy partnerships include Accubits, LunaPR, Iinuma Consulting partners, BitPay, Car Vault, Chain Lab, BitCars, WaveUp, and Connsio. Since BillionAir is also building on the BSC network, it has the infrastructure support of one of the most stable open-source blockchains in the world.</p>
How BillionAir Is Reshaping the Raffle Business
<p>BillionAir, with its partners and supporters, is paving the way for the future of the raffle business. The platform&rsquo;s sound integration of blockchain technology will encourage player confidence on top of providing a user-friendly lottery in which anyone can participate, regardless of their current location.</p>
<p>The lottery industry is ready for change, marked by high gameplay integrity and ownership assurance. Once other raffle businesses have caught wind of BillionAir&rsquo;s advantages, many will begin integrating blockchain technology into their platform and reap the benefits of this fantastic innovation.</p>

<li aria-level="1">Consola.finance has announced the release of its finance and accounting platform with an unparalleled infrastructure for on-chain data, completely revamping how web3 firms approach crypto finance management.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The launch follows after identifying the lack of comprehensive accounting tools to record all transactions, wallet balances, and other on-chain operations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Vienna, Austria, 10 January 2023: Consola.finance, announced today the launch of its anticipated end-to-end finance and accounting platform specifically designed for web3 firms. Following the successful pre-seed round September in 2022, closing &euro;1.1 million in funding, the B2B SaaS platform offers an innovative solution for bookkeeping, accounting, and reporting for all blockchain transactional activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch follows after identifying the lack of comprehensive tools to unify accounting related processes. At present, there is no benchmark process for crypto bookkeeping, and international accounting standards do not provide any bookkeeping framework. Bookkeeping is a crucial element to the success of all web3 organizations, and despite the millions of crypto transactions active daily across the globe, most crypto bookkeeping is still recorded manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now more than ever, the recording of trading, staking, or payments is of great importance, and as a result, automated crypto bookkeeping solutions are gaining traction across web3 businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consola.finance is committed to providing companies with clarity and control over their crypto finances, and their first product version successfully achieves this goal. With features like transaction and price fetching, fiat valuation, auto-categorization, cost basis calculation, profit and loss calculation, dashboarding, and reporting, the platform provides a solution to streamlining a web3 company&rsquo;s financial processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the platform aims to unify on-chain operations across accounting, payments, and DeFi, enabling organizations to fully leverage the potential of blockchain in a secure, compliant, and efficient manner, offering unprecedented solutions for automated payments, expense, and invoice management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consola.finance worked closely with leading organizations including Rook DAO, Decent DAO, MoonDAO, YGG SEA, Spool DAO, Solid World DAO, Bitpanda, LimeWire, Katana Inu, and many others to build its robust platform.</p>

<p>"We are excited to launch our first product version and offer web3 firms a solution to manage their crypto finances with ease. We have built a completely new on-chain data infrastructure that provides the highest level of quality, and have partnered with leading node providers and auditing firms to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our data.", said Jacob from consola.finance</p>
<p>"Consola.finance is an extremely powerful tool that helps crypto natives like me to better organize, interpret and use the power of my data to make better decisions&rdquo;, said Matt from Rook DAO.</p>
<p>"Consola.finance takes the manual time-consuming work out of on-chain accounting, freeing up my time to focus on other high-value operations", said Adam from Decent DAO.</p>

<p>Through consola.finance's partnerships with significant node providers, tax advisors and DeFi applications to integrate their solutions, the company successfully closes the gap of companies currently requiring several point solutions to manage, spend, track and report their on-chain finances.</p>
<p>About consola.finance</p>
<p>consola.finance, an EU-based finance and accounting SaaS platform brings clarity and control to companies' crypto finances. consola.finance automates crypto finance processes like bookkeeping and reporting, saving valuable time and reducing the risk of human error.</p>
<p>To try out consola.finance, companies can visit app.consola.finance and sign up. For partnerships, consola.finance can be contacted via partnerships@consola.finance, Twitter or Discord.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hong Kong regulator, the FSTB, is looking to open up crypto more to retail investors, but within robust, market-driven regulations.</p>
<p>At the recent Web3 Forum, Hong Kong&rsquo;s finance secretary Paul Chan, announced that the region wanted to move back to its previous status as a world leading crypto hub.</p>
<p>Now, in a report first published by CoinDesk earlier today, Hong Kong&rsquo;s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, has shown his support for the crypto industry by advocating for a more robust regulatory framework to protect investors and prevent frauds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Hong Kong FinTech Week, Hui, who is in charge of developing policy direction for the crypto sector in Hong Kong, announced that his department, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) is piloting a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) offering, tokenizing green bonds and a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the e-HKD, in an attempt to evaluate the use cases of crypto assets and lay down a macro approach to regulation.</p>
<p>According to Hui, crypto currently falls under several regulators in Hong Kong, where the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is looking into stablecoins, and the Securities and Futures Commission takes on enforcement responsibilities, but he and his bureau will be focusing on placing crypto within financial regulation, with the possibility of including retail investors under the incoming regulatory framework in order to allow them to trade on licenced exchanges.</p>
<p>Hui sees crypto as a potential transformation in how society and economy work, but also emphasises the importance of use cases, he said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My inclination is to see through these investments and look at what&rsquo;s behind them, what&rsquo;s underlying them,&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said that he&rsquo;s most excited about the tokenization of green bonds, which makes what can be a cumbersome process of issuance and investment far more streamlined. Hong Kong has already issued $10 billion in green bonds in multiple currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro, and renminbi.</p>
<p>Hui also said there are many areas in which technology can really address bottlenecks, shortening the subscription for initial public offerings as an example, and puts Hong Kong&rsquo;s strength in being a well-regulated, sustainable and credible gateway to the global crypto industry, down to a mix of factors such as the rule of law, regulation, and commercial modus operandi.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The multichain blockchain ecosystem Polkadot has once again shown why it&rsquo;s one of the most exciting projects in the crypto space, racking up a string of impressive achievements over the final few months of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its fourth quarter ecosystem report, Polkadot lists a number of significant milestones it has achieved, including the launch of so-called &ldquo;nomination pools&rdquo; that all but eliminate the barrier to entry for native staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polkadot is an extremely novel blockchain project created by the Web3 Foundation that&rsquo;s aiming to solve the problem of network interoperability. To do this, it has designed a protocol that enables unrelated blockchains - known as &ldquo;parachains&rdquo; - to talk to each other in a secure way. Data can flow between the main Polkadot relay chain or any individual parachain without using intermediaries. What&rsquo;s more, the use of parachains also makes transaction processing much faster, as each project on Polkadot has its own, separate chain that relieves the strain on the main network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polkadot took a key step in boosting the security and decentralization of its network with the launch of nomination pools that make it possible to stake DOT, the platform&rsquo;s native token, with as little as 1 DOT. Previously, users were required to use a minimum of 200 DOT to stake natively, or else go through a third party. Nomination pools provide a way for DOT holders to pool their stakes together on-chain to nominate validators, without having to share the staking rewards they receive. They&rsquo;ve gone down well with the community too. Polkadot said in its Q4 update that there were 3,475 nomination pool members staking a combined 854,495 DOT at the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were other developments on the DOT front too, with Polkadot&rsquo;s native token finally morphing from a &ldquo;security&rdquo; into a &ldquo;non-security&rdquo; in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Web3 Foundation said the announcement followed more than three years of engagement with SEC authorities, stressing the prolonged efforts that went into ensuring the vision of token morphing was fully addressed. It involved the Web3 Foundation setting up business processes and communications guidelines akin to a public company, while taking steps to ensure DOT is both compliant and offers token holders greater security.</p>
<p>While working with the SEC, Polkadot was simultaneously engaged with its grassroots community. In the fourth quarter, the Web3 Foundation grants program provided funding to an additional 37 projects, reaching 476 total grants since its inception. Those funds come from the Polkadot Treasury, which took its total spending thus far to more than 4 million DOT, up from around just 200,000 DOT at the end of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Developer Momentum
<p>Perhaps the most impressive sign of Polkadot&rsquo;s growth is its sustained momentum in terms of development. By the end of the year, Polkadot had emerged as the crypto industry&rsquo;s single largest ecosystem of &ldquo;use-case specific&rdquo; layer-1 blockchains and apps, with 74 parachains up and running following an auction on either Polkadot, or Kusama, its canary test network. Those parachains host more than 300 decentralized applications between them, and it&rsquo;s expected that more will be up and running soon, as Polkadot says there are around 550 projects in total building on its parachains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Development activity is on the up too, with Polkadot&rsquo;s ecosystem numbering 1,128 weekly active developers producing a combined total of 13,934 weekly commits, according to Electric Capital data. That puts Polkadot in pole position, ahead of all other blockchains in terms of development activity, Web3 Foundation said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two Polkadot parachains also ranked high on Electric Capital&rsquo;s list, with the privacy protocol Manta Network and Kusama landing in third and fifth place overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Parachains Progressing
<p>Manta Network also hit the headlines during the quarter when it set a new record for establishing what was the largest Trusted Setup in zero-knowledge technology ever seen. It involved more than 13,000 participants from 177 countries in total, and is a key demonstration of what Manta says will become a vital technology to ensure the privacy and security of user&rsquo;s data in Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another parachain making good progress is Astar Network, a scalable smart contract platform that aims to fill the void created by the Polkadot relay chain&rsquo;s lack of support for smart contracts. During the quarter, it announced a key collaboration with Japan&rsquo;s leading mobile network carrier NTT Docomo that will see the two companies collaborate on Web3 adoption. As part of the collaboration, NTT Docomo will invest as much as $4 billion on decentralized technologies, while working with Astar to accelerate the growth of Web3 through education, implementation and the nurturing of developer talent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, there was news from KILT Protocol, the decentralized self-sovereign identity protocol that enables users to create and share verifiable credentials without revealing information about themselves. KILT notably became the very first project to complete a full migration from Kusama to the more stable Polkadot network. According to KILT&rsquo;s development team, the migration was necessary because enterprises have implemented a number of business use cases on KILT that require higher levels of security and stability than what Kusama can offer. The migration was pulled off without a hitch, with no downtime or application glitches reported.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The long-awaited airdrop of the FLR token is unceremoniously dumped by most of the XRP community.</p>
A long wait
<p>Two years ago, a project called Flare Networks promised to bring smart contract functionality to the XRP ecosystem by airdropping a new token called FLR to all XRP holders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning on Monday, that airdrop finally happened and the FLR token has been made available for trading on a number of decentralised exchanges, but the reaction from the market has been less than enthusiastic.</p>
Price plunges
<p>As soon as the FLR tokens were made available, the price immediately dropped by 73%, a clear indication that traders and investors have not been impressed by the long-awaited airdrop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, as well as a lack of enthusiasm for the Flare Network project itself.</p>
Issues
<p>Many have criticised Flare for taking so long to deliver on their airdrop promise, and there are also concerns about the project's centralization, with a small group of nodes having control over the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Flare team has not been able to secure any partnerships with major companies or institutions, further diminishing investor confidence in the project.</p>
Potential
<p>Despite the poor reception, some experts believe that the Flare Network still has the potential to make an impact in the crypto space. The ability to run smart contracts on the XRP ledger could be a game changer, especially if Flare is able to attract developers and businesses to build on its platform.</p>
<p>The Flare Network's ability to run smart contracts is based on a new consensus algorithm called Avalanche, which was developed by a team at the Interactive Coin Offering (ICO) research lab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This algorithm has the potential to solve some of the scalability issues that have plagued other blockchain projects and could make Flare a valuable addition to the crypto ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain startup Radix has provided users with the first glimpse of what it says will be a revolutionary new Web3 wallet, as part of its ongoing mission to reinvent decentralized finance with an &ldquo;asset-oriented&rdquo; approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Radix Wallet, which is still a concept at this time, has been under development for more than 18 months and is designed to give users a &ldquo;radically better user experience&rdquo; when interacting with DeFi apps. It&rsquo;s powered by no less than five wholly unique and innovative technologies that underpin the revolutionary Radix Network, which aims to transform DeFi into something that&rsquo;s just as safe, reliable and easy to use as traditional banking applications while retaining the unique benefits of Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Radix points out, the DeFi experience is in desperate need of a makeover if it&rsquo;s to gain the interest of everyday users. Cryptocurrency itself is complex enough as it is, with the need to setup a wallet and write down a &ldquo;seed phrase&rdquo; and keep it somewhere safe, followed by the chore of going to an exchange to buy digital assets and transfer them for safekeeping. DeFi, however, takes that complexity to another level, with hundreds of different dApps that require significant technical expertise to navigate. Add to that, even for experienced users, DeFi is extremely unsafe, with hackers helping themselves to millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of user&rsquo;s funds seemingly every couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s no doubting the benefits of DeFi and Web3, the simple fact is that the vast majority of people won&rsquo;t go there while it remains unsafe and lacks user-friendliness. So this is precisely the problem Radix is trying to solve, and to do so it has created a whole new network architecture than rebuilds DeFi from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radix has been in the works for several years and is finally ready for primetime as we enter 2023, with the launch of its Babylon Mainnet just around the corner. At the same time, it will also launch Radix Wallet, which promises to make it much simpler for new users to engage with DeFi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a preview of the wallet at RadFi 2022, Radix provided a walkthrough of how these features work together to transform the user experience. The first major difference is that, rather than using a seed phrase, users will have access to what&rsquo;s known as a &ldquo;Smart Account&rdquo; that allows them to secure their wallet with multifactor security. At the same time, users will be able to login to their wallets using &ldquo;Personas&rdquo;, which enable Web2 logins to access Web3 assets for the first time. &ldquo;Radix Connect&rdquo; meanwhile is a new feature that enables a seamless transition between desktop and mobile devices. Finally, users can look forward to managing &ldquo;Native Assets&rdquo; on the Radix Network for a more intuitive digital asset ownership experience, and &ldquo;Transaction Manifests&rdquo;, which add clarity to all transactions and eliminate many of the seemingly random transaction failures that occur in traditional DeFi.</p>
<p>Matthew Hine, chief product officer of RDX Works, the company behind Radix, said the new Radix Wallet will deliver a user experience that &ldquo;gets out of the way&rdquo; and allows users to engage with minimal effort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the kind of experience that will make Web3, DeFi and even the metaverse actually relevant to people, and you can&rsquo;t build it on any network except Radix,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radix has, in other words, created an entirely new kind of Web3 wallet to enable a radically different DeFi experience, one that it says works just as users imagine it should work, making the entire experience not just easier, but also much safer.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The boundary between the physical and digital world is becoming increasingly blurred, and the inhabitants of the metaverse are flocking to dynamic new forms of architecture that can fuse audiences together in the virtual world, just as stadiums do in reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIrtual stadiums are making their mark in the metaverse, and as they become more widespread and attract new fans, they promise to foster greater engagement and enthusiasm in these emerging digital worlds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Real-world stadiums very often serve as the anchor for entire communities, sitting at the center of lively commercial districts that form a hub of life and activity. Stadiums can also revitalize entire districts that had previously fallen into disrepair. Take the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, which has been credited with a stunning 148% increase in the price of nearby homes between 2014 and 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the home of two incredibly popular NFL teams, the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, the SoFi Stadium has become the center of a vibrant entertainment district in the city, where people come to spend their money, socialize and have fun. As a result, Inglewood has become one of the most popular districts in LA, encouraging people to engage with its nearby attractions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reason to believe that virtual stadiums in the metaverse can have a similar impact on the atmosphere of virtual worlds, producing a magnetic impact that attracts more visitors to check out nearby spaces. It&rsquo;s an intriguing prospect because metaverse stadiums are rapidly catching on, enabling a new kind of immersive experience that isn&rsquo;t possible in the real world. At the same time, metaverse stadiums promise to bring together big crowds even while those people are residing in the comfort of their own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Rap Legends Reborn
<p>One of the most impactful virtual stadium events to date was the recent Notorious B.I.G VR concert experience that took place within Meta Horizon Worlds last month. A digital avatar of the legendary, now deceased rapper was resurrected to appear before thousands of fans in a virtual replica of 1990s Brooklyn, New York, where he delivered a breathtaking performance that had the effect of transporting attendees back in time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hyper-realistic Notorious B.I.G avatar appeared in Horizon Worlds clad in a red, velvet tracksuit and proceeded to deliver some of his greatest hits via an immersive concert experience that would simply be impossible to recreate back in the real world. With guest appearances from Sean &ldquo;Diddy&rdquo; Combs, The Lox, Latto, Nardo Wick and Lil&rsquo; Cease, the live performance also included a narrative of Biggie&rsquo;s early life, and was attended by several hundred floating avatars in a lifelike concert venue who benefited from 360 degrees of immersive sounds and sights. The event, delivered by the digital tech firm Hyperreal, was a hugely successful showcase for the potential of these pioneering VFX environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Immersive Sports Experiences
<p>Fans of the video games industry will soon be able to enjoy more immersive experiences of this kind thanks to Everyrealm, a metaverse developer that recently partnered with MIBR, a subsidiary of U.S. firm Immortals Gaming Club, to create a new virtual arena focused on e-sports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the MIBR Arena and it&rsquo;s hosted in the Portals metaverse, with the intention of bringing e-sports fans together in one virtual space to enjoy special events together and increase community engagement. Already it has hosted a number of successful events, such as livestreaming the IEM Major Rio 2022 Champions Stage that took place in the physical world in Rio de Janeiro last November. For fans who couldn&rsquo;t attend in person, the virtual MIBR Arena provided another way to see the event with their own eyes, with everything being livestreamed in an immersive 3D environment where attendees could walk around, meet up with other fans, and even take part in some unofficial games themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MIBR Arena is modeled after a real-world e-sports arena and is themed with the landscape of Rio. Visitors can dress their avatars with MIBR digital wearables provided by the VR developer Ready Player Me, and while access is free for anyone, there are plans for VIP ticket sales for future events that would enable paying guests to enjoy extra benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Football fans can also get a taste of the metaverse stadium experience via Upland, a unique, open virtual world that&rsquo;s mapped to the real world. Upland hit the headlines a few weeks ago, just prior to the Qatar 2022 World Cup, when it announced it was partnering with FIFA to deliver a metaverse based experience to coincide with the world&rsquo;s greatest sporting event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Upland, metaverse fans were able to enjoy a unique World Cup experience by visiting a virtual World Cup village that was mapped to the real-world village in Doha, Qatar. Visiting Upland&rsquo;s virtual World Cup Village, soccer fans had the opportunity to participate in numerous metaverse games with the object of collecting NFT souvenirs that can be used to decorate virtual buildings and show support for the 32 nations participating in the tournament. As part of the experience, Upland constructed a full-sized digital replica of the Lusail Stadium in Doha that served as the venue of the World Cup final. What&rsquo;s more, the digital stadium was given away to one lucky winner, as one of numerous prizes on offer to players who were able to collect the most NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Beating Heart Of The Metaverse Community
<p>Perhaps the most popular arena to emerge in the metaverse so far is not really an arena at all. Nevertheless, Decentral Games&rsquo; metaverse poker lounge has become one of the most visited places within Decentraland, which itself is one of the best known virtual worlds that exists today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentral Games is essentially a metaverse-based gaming lounge where players can visit using a digital avatar and participate in various skill-based games using crypto, meaning that the stakes are very real. It&rsquo;s by far and away the most popular attraction within Decentraland, accounting for 60% of all its visitors. Within Decentral Games, the most popular game is Ice Poker, and players can access daily events and challenges directly from the poker lounge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To participate in the biggest events, players need to acquire an ICE wearable, which is an NFT accessory that can either be purchased, loaned or borrowed for free if the user is lucky enough. The ICE wearable entitles players to a specified number of &ldquo;chips&rdquo; which can then be used to play ICE Poker tournaments. By winning, players can obtain xDG tokens that can be used to purchase new wearables or sold for another cryptocurrency. The tokens also provide governance voting rights, enabling players to participate in community management decisions. Players don&rsquo;t need to spend any money to visit the poker lounge though, as it also hosts hundreds of free-to-play poker games where nothing is at stake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of Decentral Games&rsquo; metaverse gaming lounge shows that metaverse stadiums can have the same magnetic pull on everything around them as they do in the real world. Metaverse stadiums are still relatively new creations and there is no hard data on what kind of attraction they provide, so we can&rsquo;t say what kind of impact it would have if we were to just construct one in a remote part of The Sandbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, metaverse traffic looks a lot like it does in the real world. Those who build in a high-traffic area, such as close to Snoop Dogg&rsquo;s virtual mansion, will have to pay more for the land but it has been shown that they also receive more visitors due to their proximity to other attractions. It makes sense that users will explore what&rsquo;s nearby, as they&rsquo;re able to see what&rsquo;s available close to the destination they&rsquo;ve just arrived at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, virtual stadiums could one day become the centers of vibrant new metaverse communities. If thousands of people are flocking somewhere in the digital realm to catch the next concert involving a music legend who&rsquo;s been brought back from the dead, why not place your virtual pizza place next to it, offering deliveries directly to the door of hungry fans in the real world?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The potential of sports-themed metaverse districts could well be the next big thing for virtual metaverse real estate investors, with numerous opportunities to cater to their digital and real-world wants and needs.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The boundary between the physical and digital world is becoming increasingly blurred, and the inhabitants of the metaverse are flocking to dynamic new forms of architecture that can fuse audiences together in the virtual world, just as stadiums do in reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIrtual stadiums are making their mark in the metaverse, and as they become more widespread and attract new fans, they promise to foster greater engagement and enthusiasm in these emerging digital worlds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Real-world stadiums very often serve as the anchor for entire communities, sitting at the center of lively commercial districts that form a hub of life and activity. Stadiums can also revitalize entire districts that had previously fallen into disrepair. Take the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, which has been credited with a stunning 148% increase in the price of nearby homes between 2014 and 2021.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>London, United Kingdom, 10th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Metacade has exceeded expectations as investors flocked to its presale to purchase MCADE tokens, raising over $2 million for the GameFi project.</p>
<p>The beta stage of the presale saw $1 million pour in over a matter of weeks and momentum has continued despite the 25% increase in token price. There is now only $690k remaining of the token at $0.01 before the price rises 20% in the next round.</p>
<p>$MCADE is available to buy on the official Metacade website.

</p>
<p class="chainwire-video-container"></p>

<p>Metacade is the world&rsquo;s first community-run play-to-earn (P2E) arcade built on blockchain. The Ethereum-backed metaverse project will offer a thriving GameFi hub for gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. It will be a place to earn, learn and connect with like-minded individuals while playing some of the hottest P2E games that GameFi space has to offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built to last, the Metacade roadmap showcases the project&rsquo;s ambition and longevity. Beyond its stellar blockchain game offering, the platform will host leaderboards, trending games, GameFi alpha, and much more to keep the community engaged. To further show its support to the gaming community the platform will launch a jobs board to help people new roles in Web3 and a Metagrants initiative to support game developers keen to build on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MCADE, the platform&rsquo;s native token, will power activity and transactions on Metacade. Players will use it to access pay-to-play games and be rewarded for their gaming efforts in MCADE. There will be further earning opportunities through competitions and tournaments, sharing gaming alpha, and writing reviews. Staking will also be an option for MCADE holders wanting to top up their income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MCADE has a fixed token supply of 2 billion tokens, with seventy percent of these being made available during the presale. The other thirty percent of these tokens have been reserved for development, liquidity provisions, competition pool funding, and exchange listings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MCADE will soon be listed on Bitmart, one of the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, which is ranked 21st in the CoinMarketCap exchange rankings. Metacade signed the terms with the Singapore-based digital asset exchange in December 2022 and shared the news on its Twitter account. This is just the beginning for the MCADE token as the team has revealed they are in talks with other crypto exchanges and have a top 10 exchange listing announcement coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
Head of Product for Metacade Russell Bennett said: "The Bitmart listing will give millions of people easy access to the MCADE token in a secure and safe trading environment. The public listing will propel awareness of Metacade and help the project gain further traction and following. With another popular exchange announcement soon to be revealed, we&rsquo;re thrilled by the spectacular welcome Metacade has received from the GameFi space."
<p>The P2E GameFi platform has the stamp of approval from leading blockchain auditing firm Certik. Metacade joins the ranks among Polygon, ApeCoin, and BNB Chain as a trusted platform in the crypto space. Certik employs cutting-edge technology and mathematics to analyze and evaluate the specification and code of blockchain projects. The auditors also carried out a full KYC of the Metacade team to ensure they are genuine and provide further transparency of the project. The full audit results are available on the Certik website. &nbsp;&nbsp;

The Metacade presale has now sold over $2 million worth of tokens in under 7 weeks and at the time of publishing has under 25% remaining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Metacade 
Metacade &nbsp;is the premier destination for gaming in the metaverse. As Web3's first community arcade that allows gamers to hang out, share gaming knowledge and play exclusive P2E games. The platform offers users multiple ways to generate income, build careers in Web3, and connect with the wider gaming community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leading investing site Invezz has called Metacade: "A place where GameFi and the Metaverse intersect, with the potential to be one of the biggest names in its space, and potentially the industry overall".</p>
<p>Metacade will be the one-stop destination for users to play, earn, and network with other passionate gamers worldwide. Once the project reaches the end of its roadmap, Metacade will be handed over to the community as a full-fledged DAO. After all, Metacade wants you to have a hand in shaping the GameFi world of tomorrow.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>While the crypto winter persists, investors are seeking profitable projects to put in their money. Experts recommend new crypto projects with practical uses like Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) for higher returns.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>What is the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)?</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a new crypto project created to reform the venture capital industry. Orbeon makes investment opportunities accessible to everyone. Both start-ups and retail investors benefit from the design of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN).</p>
<p>Companies seeking funds can mint their equity-backed NFTs on Orbeon Protocol. These NFTs are broken into fractions to encourage people to invest. In the end, unicorn companies raise needed funds faster and users get to invest with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) provides everyday investors with the opportunity to back highly promising companies at an early stage. Before Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), access to the world's outstanding companies was only available to venture capitalists. But with Orbeon, an everyday person gets the opportunity to back a brand they truly believe in and reap the benefits. The Orbeon Protocol is here as a challenger VC.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>What do businesses benefit from the Orbeon Protocol?</p>
<p>With Orbeon, businesses are saved from facing rejections when sourcing for funds. Also, they don&rsquo;t have to complete any regulatory procedures to get needed funds.</p>
<p>Additionally, Orbeon connects businesses directly with the crypto community.</p>
<p>So, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) helps businesses to quickly access funds and also grow their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>What investors benefit from Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)?</p>
<p>On Orbeon, investors get to put their money into vetted real-world businesses and crypto projects.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Fill or Kill&rsquo; mechanism that protects the interest of investors. It is included in the smart contract of the NFT created for client companies. Such that, investors automatically get their money back if a company fails to meet its funding goals. Additionally, the tokens allocated to the founding team are locked for one year, and are then released quarterly. Also, the liquidity pool is locked for 10 years to avoid the risk of a rug-pull.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Price Prediction&nbsp;</p>
<p>For $ORBN, analysts predict a 6,000% rise in price after the presale. Already, the coin has done 805%, moving from an initial price of $0.004 and now selling at $0.0362. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has completed two stages of presale. It is now in the third and final presale stage, and tokens are selling out fast.</p>
<p>Furthermore, holders of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) tokens enjoy governance and voting rights, priority access to up and coming funding rounds, staking rewards, and exclusive investor groups.</p>
