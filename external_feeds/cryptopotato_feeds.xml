			            <description><![CDATA[The Argentinian police suspect that the crypto millionaire's gory death was connected to his huge debt.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The remains of Fernando Pérez Algaba, a crypto millionaire who also ran a luxury car rental outfit, were reportedly found dismembered in a suitcase while the deceased was staying in Argentina.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Authorities suspect that the amputation was done by professionals, with an autopsy showing that he was shot before his body was cut to pieces.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Another Crypto Millionaire Found Dead</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Argentinian police have launched an investigation into the <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/27/millionaire-crypto-influencer-found-dismembered-in-suitcase/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">mysterious death </a>of Fernando Pérez Algaba, whose body parts were found in a suitcase over the weekend in Ingeniero Budge, a town in the province of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Algaba was reported missing on July 19 after the millionaire influencer did not return the keys to an apartment he rented for a week while in Argentina or answer his phone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to reports, Algaba&#8217;s dismembered remains were discovered by some children whose parents took the matter to the Buenos Aires police. On getting to the scene, authorities discovered Algaba&#8217;s legs and forearm in the suitcase, another arm in the stream, and later discovered the victim&#8217;s head and torso on Wednesday, July 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the police are yet to uncover the motive behind Algaba&#8217;s murder, they suspect that the amputation was the work of an expert, judging from the clean cuts. An autopsy carried out also showed that the deceased was shot thrice before being chopped to pieces.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before his death, Algaba, who was 41 years old, ran a luxury car and jet ski rental firm in Miami, the United States, before moving to Barcelona, Spain, earlier in 2023. The victim claimed to have started working since he was 14 years old selling sandwiches and later got involved with acquiring vehicles for repair and resale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Algaba&#8217;s efforts seemed to have paid off, with the entrepreneur owning a large warehouse full of expensive cars, jet skis, and motorcycles 10 years later at the age of 24. His <a href="https://instagram.com/fernandoperezalgaba?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Instagram page</a>, which has over 900,000 followers, mostly contains pictures of him in luxurious cars.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The entrepreneur was also said to be a crypto trader who operated an office in Buenos Aires with 25 employees. Algaba said he made millions through his luxury vehicle rental business and cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Murder Suspiciously Connected to Huge Debt Pile</h2>
<p dir="ltr">However, Algaba seemed to be neck deep in debts, with his company &#8220;Motors Lettuce SRL&#8221; bouncing checks less than one year after its establishment in January 2018. This caused the businessman to accumulate what was described as an &#8220;irrevocable&#8221; debt with the Argentinian tax agency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The entrepreneur was also said to run into trouble with the Barra Bravas gang, which demanded a $40,000 loan from Algaba. A message from the victim read, &#8220;If something happens to me, everyone is already warned.&#8221; Algaba further revealed that he lost a lot of money to crypto investments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While investigations into the murder are ongoing, police have arrested a suspect in connection with the case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Algaba&#8217;s mysterious murder follows a wave of crypto-related deaths that happened in 2022. As previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-recent-wave-of-mysterious-deaths-in-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> by <em>CryptoPotato</em>, Amber Group&#8217;s co-founder, Tiantian Kullander, passed away in his sleep. Another was the billionaire crypto businessman Vyacheslav Taran, who died in a helicopter crash, and MakerDAO developer Nikolai Mushegian, who allegedly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/makerdao-co-founder-nikolai-mushegian-found-dead-in-puerto-rico/" data-wpel-link="internal">drowned</a> in Puerto Rico.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[GALA, INJ, and MNT have also dropped by double digits within the past seven days.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin remained relatively calm after the US Fed&#8217;s latest interest rate hike, but the past 24 hours brought a minor retracement that pushed the asset back down to just over $29,000.</p>
<p>Most altcoins have also lost some steam today, with DOGE and MATIC losing the most value from the larger caps.</p>
<h2>BTC Struggles at $29K</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s week started on a negative tone as the asset failed during its Sunday conquest at $30,300. The subsequent rejection pushed it south hard, and BTC found itself dumping to a monthly low at under $29,000 on Monday.</p>
<p>The bulls managed to intervene at this point and didn&#8217;t allow any further declines. They pushed the cryptocurrency to just over $29,000 as the community prepared for the next US FOMC meeting <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/federal-reserve-raises-rates-again-by-0-25-bitcoin-trades-flat/" data-wpel-link="internal">scheduled</a> for Wednesday.</p>
<p>As many anticipated, the US Federal Reserve increased the key interest rates by 25 bps. Unlike previous such developments, this one had<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/btc-remains-flat-after-feds-rate-hike-xlm-soars-14-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal"> little-to-no effect</a> on BTC right off the bat. It was hours later when the asset added a few hundred dollars but was stopped from challenging $30,000.</p>
<p>The past 24 hours brought some more pain for the bulls as the cryptocurrency fell back down to just over $29,000, where it currently stands. Its market cap has fallen to $565 billion while its dominance over the alts stands still at 48.2% on CMC.</p>

<h2>PEPE Down Hard Weekly</h2>
<p>Most altcoins are also slightly in the red on a daily scale. Ethereum, Ripple, and Binance Coin have also declined by up to 1% to $1,860, $0.7, and $240, respectively. Cardano and Litecoin have seen similar drops.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Polygon have retraced the most from the larger-cap alts, as both assets are down by around 3%. SOL, DOT, BCH, and SHIB are also in the red now.</p>
<p>ICP is among the few exceptions on a daily scale, posting a 3% increase that has pushed it to $4.25.</p>
<p>The landscape is quite painful on a weekly scale as well. PEPE, GALA, INJ, and MNT have all dumped by somewhere between 10-15%.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has also lost some steam and struggles at $1.180 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The 49-page document addresses the CFTC’s complaints and claims that they are unfounded.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several days ago, Binance’s legal team announced they will be pursuing the dismissal of the CFTC’s court case against them, mirroring similar actions by Coinbase and Bittrex.</p>
<p>Binance’s hefty <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767.59.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">plea</a> has now been filed and is largely based on refutations of the CFTC’s jurisdiction since neither the exchange nor its CEO reside or are headquartered in the United States.</p>
<p>The document, which is 49 pages long once annexes and other norms are applied, is far longer than the 15 pages usually allowed by such a plea. However, given the broad scope of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/binance-asks-court-to-dismiss-us-derivatives-regulator-s-lawsuit" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CFTC’s accusations</a>, Binance’s legal team found it necessary to exceed the customary limit.</p>
<h2>CFTC Has No Jurisdiction Over Either Defendant</h2>
<p>Mirroring CZ’s personal opinion expressed on Binance’s <a href="https://archive.is/qUVHt" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog</a>, the document accuses the CFTC of attempting to regulate foreign entities and individuals.</p>
<p>Since Binance is not headquartered in the States, and CZ is a Canadian national with no permanent residence within the country, the company argued that it is outside of the jurisdiction of any U.S. regulatory entity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The CFTC seeks to regulate foreign individuals and corporations that reside and operate outside the United States &#8211; outstripping the limits of its statutory authority and treading on deep-rooted principles of comity with foreign sovereigns.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Another complaint of Binance’s in the same vein is that the CFTC accused the firm of knowingly accepting orders of cryptocurrency, fiat, and other financial products on behalf of U.S. corporations or citizens – all while admitting that the end customer in these transactions is often unknown.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The complaint rarely identifies whether the supposed “U.S. customer” is a natural or corporate person, though that fact matters in determining whether a customer is a “U.S. person” under both the agency’s guidance and its regulation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Among other rebuttals of the CFTC’s case, another salient point made by Binance’s legal team is the one against client solicitation.</p>
<h2>Binance Is an Intermediary, Not a Vendor</h2>
<p>According to lawyers for Binance, the platform is primarily a marketplace where third parties can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Although the exchange naturally holds reserves that it can choose to sell to customers, the primary sources of cryptocurrencies sold to Binance customers are the wallets of other company users, who entered into a voluntary agreement with the third party.</p>
<p>Therefore, the defense argued that Binance cannot be accused of client solicitation. This refutation is followed up by an argument that there is no legal precedent for such an accusation against a crypto platform “for good reason.”</p>
<p>For now, no response has been provided by the court. Should Binance and CZ manage to shake the accusations brought against them by the CFTC, they will still have to contend with other <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-and-cz-will-pursue-cftc-case-dismissal/" data-wpel-link="internal">court cases</a> and investigations filed by other regulatory entities.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sui Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the Sui Network, has terminated its partnership with MovEX, a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity management platform, following the violation of a lockup agreement.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.sui.io/understanding-sui-token-supply/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog post</a> by the Sui Foundation, MovEX moved some Sui tokens (SUI) that were subject to a contractual lockup without informing or seeking consent from the organization, sparking accusations of misrepresented emissions from the crypto community.</p>
<h2>Sui Foundation Cuts Ties With MovEX</h2>
<p>MovEx was an early contributor to Sui during its mainnet <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sui-faced-massive-volatility-minutes-after-mainnet-launch/" data-wpel-link="internal">launch</a> in May, serving as a core builder for the network’s DeepBook, a shared decentralized central limit order book created for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>At the time, 5.15% of the total SUI supply was in circulation, with the rest released on a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-when-sui-networks-tokens-will-be-unlocked/" data-wpel-link="internal">preset schedule</a> to early contributors to maintain network stability. The tokens were subject to a lockup period in line with the release schedule.</p>
<p>In June, however, the pseudonymous Twitter user DefiSquared <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiSquared/status/1673572324145078273?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">accused</a> Sui of intentionally misrepresenting token emissions and dumping rewards from locked, non-circulating staked SUI on crypto exchange Binance.</p>
<p>Through several investigations, the Sui Foundation discovered that MovEX executed the transactions that stirred the accusations. Out of the 2.5 million SUI received as payment for contributing to DeepBook, the decentralized exchange had initiated three transactions of 625,000 SUI to three different wallets, leaving the rest in the original wallet.</p>
<p>Sui Foundation has ended its relationship with MovEX as the DEX breached the contractual lockup and failed to seek consent before initiating those transactions. Earlier this month, the foundation asked MovEX to move the 2.5 million SUI to a qualified custodian who will release them according to the token emission schedule.</p>
<h2>MovEX Reponds</h2>
<p>In response to the announcement by Sui Foundation, MovEX took to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/joinMovEX/status/1684496073967140864?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">explain</a> that it had only distributed the tokens to custodian and non-custodian wallets.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We would like to express our understanding regarding the conclusion of our partnership with Sui. We deeply value the journey filled with dedication, hard work, and honors, and we are truly appreciative of the support we received from the community,” MovEX said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Sui Foundation has assured the crypto community that “all other tokens subject to contractual lockups are held in qualified custodian accounts that have agreed to enforce the terms of such lockups.”</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[House Democrats accuse Republicans of being impatient with negotiations for payment stablecoins.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) failed to reach an agreement for stablecoin legislation on Thursday due to a number of disagreements Democrats had with its existing text.</p>
<p>Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) blamed the White House for holding up the bill, while Democrats alleged that Republicans were attempting to rush incomplete legislation.</p>
<h2>No Compromise For Stablecoin Bill</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4766/BILLS-118hr4766ih.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">bill</a>, titled the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023, would allow the Federal Reserve to write requirements for stablecoin issuers, but still preserve the authority of state-level payment stablecoin regulators while outlining other requirements.</p>
<p>After 15 months of negotiations, McHenry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGjvuDjXiq0&amp;ab_channel=U.S.HouseCommitteeonFinancialServices" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">claimed</a> the committee was “closer than we’d ever been” to a bipartisan deal aside from a few “small provisions.”</p>
<p>“It was the White House’s unwillingness to compromise that has once again brought negotiations to a halt,” he said. He did not specify which elements of the bill the Biden administration had objected to.</p>
<p>The agency’s ranking member, Maxine Waters (D-CA), blamed McHenry’s “impatience” for pushing forward a “deeply flawed” bill, which she said lacked support from both the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve. Previously, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/federal-reserve-chairman-refers-to-stablecoins-as-a-form-of-money/" data-wpel-link="internal">emphasized</a> that the central bank ought to have a role within the industry as the ultimate source of credibility on money.</p>
<p>Waters claimed the bill would give states too much authority to expand the number of eligible reserve assets for backing stablecoins, creating risks for token holders. Furthermore, she said it would allow tech giants to issue their own stablecoins – a threat reminiscent of Facebook’s now-defunct stablecoin project, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/diems-downfall-from-an-ambitious-single-global-digital-currency-idea-to-a-painful-end/" data-wpel-link="internal">Diem</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We too would like a real bi-partisan bill,” said Waters in her opening statement on Thursday. “I don’t know what the rush is. Why the rush at this particular time?”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Success of FIN21</h2>
<p>Unlike the stablecoin bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act proposed on Wednesday managed to secure bipartisan approval. All Republicans on the committee voted in its favor, alongside 6 Democrats.</p>
<p>The bill <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/congressional-stablecoin-bill-still-reeks-of-sam-bankman-fried-democrats-say/" data-wpel-link="internal">outlines</a> which market regulators should have authority over what cryptocurrencies, and clarifies that a crypto asset may be issued in a securities transaction without being a security itself.</p>
<p>Though crypto critics like Brad Sherman (D-CA) thought the bill was too friendly to the crypto industry, Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY) acknowledged that it was still leagues ahead of the regulations in place today.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This legislation is far from perfect, but it represents a good-faith attempt to create clarity where none exists,” said Torres. “I will not let perfect be the enemy of good.”</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &#8211; nephew of former US President John F. Kennedy and one of the presidential candidates for the elections in 2024 &#8211; reiterated his support for bitcoin, saying he had bought two BTC for each of his seven kids. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The leading digital asset stands at the center of his political campaign, with Kennedy promising to exempt its conversion to the US dollar from capital gains taxes. He also vowed to back America&#8217;s national currency with &#8220;real finite assets,&#8221; such as gold, silver, platinum, and bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Passing BTC for the Next Generation</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The US presidential candidate from the Democratic party – Robert F. Kennedy (known for his controversial views on nuclear power, the COVID-19 vaccination program, and weapons) &#8211; has also captured the attention of Bitcoiners, presenting himself as a keen advocate.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent Twitter Spaces gathering hosted by Scott Melker (known as &#8220;The Wolf of All Streets&#8221;), he </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1684262327854432266?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">admitted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> purchasing two BTC for each of his seven children shortly after the Bitcoin Conference in Miami in May this year. The asset&#8217;s price was hovering around $27,000 at that time, meaning he must have spent around $380,000 to acquire the stash.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Right after that Bitcoin conference, I got a big check, and I said, okay, you know, I&#8217;m going to put my money where my mouth is, and so I bought two BTC for every one of my seven children,&#8221; Kennedy stated.<br />
</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the 69-year-old explained he first heard of the primary cryptocurrency in 2009, he did not pay much attention to it back then. However, everything changed for Kennedy at the beginning of 2022 during the massive truckers&#8217; strike in Canada. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recall that protesters received significant crypto donations, whereas the local authorities ordered financial firms to cease facilitating any proceedings to addresses tied to them. This sparked huge controversy, with many highlighting BTC&#8217;s decentralized nature and opposing the government&#8217;s decision to adjust such transactions.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thanking all Bitcoiners</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, Kennedy appreciated the support he received from the Bitcoin community, saying he has a &#8220;spiritual bond&#8221; with them. He described those parts of the ecosystem as a &#8220;unique breed&#8221; that is not only interested in money but also in freedom:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Bitcoiners are a unique breed. Of all the financial people I&#8217;ve met in my life, people in finance are mainly interested in making a big pile for themselves, and whoever dies with the most money wins.</span></p>
<p>Bitcoiners are different breed, they like money, and they like profits, but mainly because it shows that you can make money by doing good, by winning freedom. They are ideologically based.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Brian Armstrong wants to see crypto payments upgrade to the next level. Is Bitcoin's lightning network the answer?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey pressed Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on Wednesday over his alleged refusal to acknowledge the power of Bitcoin’s lightning network – a layer-2 scaling solution designed to make BTC easier to spend.</p>
<p>His question sparked an online debate about the benefits and limitations of lightning in the payments realm, compared to other cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins.</p>
<h2>Why Not Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>In a tweet on Wednesday, Armstrong claimed that crypto’s next step was to make payments “instant and free globally,” through collective work on layer 2 solutions and user onboarding. He referenced a coffee shop that now accepted gas-free USDC payments using Coinbase Wallet, which integrated <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/say-gm-with-messaging-on-coinbase-wallet" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">messaging</a> this month.</p>
<p>The CEO acknowledged that crypto was still “stuck on layer 1,” prompting Dorsey to question him about Bitcoin’s premiere layer 2 network. “Why do you continue to ignore bitcoin and lightning?” he asked.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why do you continue to ignore bitcoin and lightning?</p>
<p>what &quot;crypto&quot; is a better money transmission protocol and why?</p>
<p>&mdash; jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1684298214198108160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Lightning makes BTC payments instant and virtually free by taking transaction settlement off the network’s main blockchain. The latter can get bloated and slow in times of peak demand, as seen when an explosion of Bitcoin-based memecoins in May sent transaction fees above $30 apiece.</p>
<p>The event caused withdrawal delays at <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-successfully-integrates-bitcoin-on-lightning-network-enabling-deposits-and-withdrawals/" data-wpel-link="internal">Binance</a>, which has since decided to integrate Bitcoin’s lightning network as a solution for future base-layer fee spikes. However, despite common demand from Bitcoiners including MicroStrategy’s <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1684301676390367232" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Michael Saylor</a>, Coinbase is yet to do the same.</p>
<p>While Armstrong didn’t respond to Dorsey directly, Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko answered his question. “USDC on Solana is cheaper and faster than Bitcoin and lightning and it’s the currency that people want to use globally,” he said.</p>
<p>USDC is a stablecoin value-pegged to the U.S. dollar, allowing it to avoid the short-term volatility of other cryptos, and better serve as a medium of exchange. The world’s most popular stablecoins including USDT and USDC primarily circulate on networks like Ethereum and Solana, but not Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Dorsey has previously <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1535322732249993219" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">disregarded</a> both Ethereum and Solana for being centrally controlled and prone to corporate capture.</p>
<p>Spiral – a subsidiary of Dorsey’s payments company, Block – has created tools to help developers better integrate the lightning network into their apps. The company’s popular payment service, CashApp, has also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/lightning-network-transfers-are-now-fully-available-on-cashapp/" data-wpel-link="internal">integrated lightning</a>.</p>
<h2>Solutions for Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The adoption of Bitcoin’s lightning network continues to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-lightning-networks-public-capacity-surpasses-5000-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">grow</a> over time, as do the network’s capabilities. Last year, Bitcoin infrastructure company Galoy <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/galoy-launches-stablesats-bringing-us-dollar-balances-to-lightning-network/" data-wpel-link="internal">developed</a> “Stablesats” – a centralized solution for effectively transacting “dollars” over lightning using perpetual futures trades on the back end.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/_pretyflaco/status/1684328205396717570</p>
<p>Another company, Stably, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stably-launches-bitcoins-first-brc-20-stablecoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> Bitcoin’s first-ever base-layer stablecoin back in May, leveraging the newly popularized BRC-20 token standard. However, BRC-20’s creator has admitted that tokenization solutions for Bitcoin are best found with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/lightning-labs-aims-to-bitcoinize-the-dollar-with-taros-alpha-release/" data-wpel-link="internal">Taro</a> – a company allowing for alternative asset transfers over the lightning network.</p>
<p>The company behind Taro, Lightning Labs, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/lightning-labs-unveils-toolkit-to-enable-ai-transact-in-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">unveiled</a> a toolkit earlier this month allowing AI to interact with Bitcoin’s lightning network.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; New York, USA, July 27th, 2023]</strong></p>

<p>Yue Minjun, the contemporary art giant of the 21st century, enters the digital art space with his inaugural Web3 project. The artist’s works fetch millions of dollars at auctions worldwide (USD 6.9 million sales record at Christie&#8217;s HK) and are in the permanent collections of the SFMoma, Denver Art Museum, The Culture Centre of Francois Mitterrand, Guangdong Museum of Art, Shenzhen Art Museum, and other leading art institutions. Collaborations with artists like KAWS and fashion brands like Comme De Garcons have cemented Yue Minjun&#8217;s signature style in global pop culture.</p>
<p><strong>Kingdom of the Laughing Man</strong> launches with <strong>Boundless</strong>, a generative collection of 1,200 unique NFT artworks echoing Yue Minjun’s iconic self-portraits.

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve explored numerous media with my art over the years.

In Web3 I can create a new engaging experience and relationship with the next generations of art collectors shaping the art world of the future,&#8221; says Yue Minjun.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yue Minjun exemplifies the caliber of artists who call LiveArt home in this new digital world.

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is a "better, safer technology" than fiat, Draper argued.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American venture capital investor Tim Draper predicted that bitcoin&#8217;s price will surge in the future due to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s advantages over fiat currency.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The billionaire claimed in 2020 that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a disastrous consequence on the global economy, but it will be a flourishing factor for BTC. The primary digital asset climbed to an all-time high of almost $70,000 the following year, whereas a financial crisis and record inflation rates shuttered many regions across the globe.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here&#8217;s Why BTC is Better</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the biggest proponents of bitcoin &#8211; Tim Draper &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1684211035509518336" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">doubled down</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> on his support for the asset in a recent interview for Fox Business.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He believes it will &#8220;rise above fiat&#8221; due to its advantages over the dollar and other currencies. One flaw that national currencies have is that they are controlled by a bank or a government, while BTC&#8217;s network is secured by &#8220;hundreds of thousands of nodes,&#8221; he added:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Having to have a bank and a government that decides on what currency is good is not as effective as having a bitcoin where you have a trusted third party which is hundreds of thousands of nodes out there checking to make sure that the transaction was done properly.&#8221;<br />
</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that central banks can also affect the supply of fiat currency by printing colossal amounts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Federal Reserve, for example, printed trillions of dollars in 2020 and 2021 to tackle the consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. While this move was somewhat helpful in the beginning, it later became one of the reasons for<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/massive-bitcoin-volatility-as-us-inflation-clocks-in-at-9-1-for-june/" data-wpel-link="internal"> the record inflation rate</a> in the USA.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meanwhile, bitcoin has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins ever to exist. Many supporters think this gives the asset an upper hand against inflation rates. In addition, its decentralized nature (the fact that no banking institution or a government can control it) could make it more attractive to people than fiat, whose supply is constantly adjusted by centralized authorities.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;So I think it&#8217;s just better, safer technology, and eventually, the rest of the world will come onboard,&#8221; Draper concluded.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Failure With the Previous Forecast</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American billionaire has not always been spot on in his predictions regarding bitcoin&#8217;s future valuation. He </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/everybody-will-accept-bitcoin-and-its-price-will-reach-250k-in-2022-says-tim-draper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">forecasted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in 2021 that BTC would climb to $250,000 by the end of last year, while in 2020, he suggested the asset would reach that milestone at the beginning of 2023. Despite the significant price increase in the past three years, bitcoin came nowhere near the $250K target.</span></p>
