<p>Identity and financial public network, Worldcoin has revealed plans to allow companies and governments everywhere to use its ID system.&nbsp;</p>
Worldcoin Growing Worldwide
<p>According to Ricardo Macieira, the general manager for Europe at Tools For Humanity (the San Francisco and Berlin-based company behind Worldcoin), the company will allow more users worldwide to sign up for its ID system. The company requires users to provide iris scans to obtain a digital ID and, in some regions, receive free cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will also allow other organizations and governments worldwide to use its iris-scanning and identity-verifying technology. With a recent funding round that raised $115 million from venture capital investors like Blockchain Capital, a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto, and Distributed Global, Worldcoin plans to continue its expansion into Europe, Latin America, Africa, and other receptive regions.</p>
Enabling Third-Party Use
<p>In the future, Worldcoin intends to open-source the technology behind its iris-scanning orb, allowing others to benefit. Companies could pay to use Worldcoin's digital identity system, enabling secure and privacy-conscious applications.</p>
<p>This technology's various potential use cases highlight the need for a global identity and financial public network. Worldcoin's website outlines potential applications for its technology, such as distinguishing between humans and artificial intelligence, facilitating global democratic processes, and paving a path toward universal basic income. However, the realization of these outcomes is not guaranteed.</p>
Privacy Concerns
<p>Despite Worldcoin's claims of being "completely private," regulators and privacy advocates remain concerned about the data collection practices. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision initiated an investigation in November 2022 due to concerns about the large-scale processing of sensitive data. French regulator CNIL is also investigating Worldcoin. Furthermore, it has been suspended by the Kenyan government, citing privacy and security concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite concerns from privacy campaigners, Worldcoin claims that 2.2 million users have signed up, with data watchdogs in Britain, France, and Germany investigating the project.</p>
Worldcoin Commits To Privacy Compliance
<p>The Worldcoin Foundation, based in the Cayman Islands, asserts its compliance with all laws governing personal data and pledges cooperation with regulatory bodies to address privacy and data protection concerns.</p>
<p>Worldcoin's future remains uncertain as it navigates regulatory scrutiny and addresses privacy concerns. However, with its ambitious expansion plans and potential applications, the company continues to be a notable player in the evolving landscape of digital identity and cryptocurrency.</p>
