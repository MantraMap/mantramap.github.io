<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>With the new Ledger Recover upgrade, the hardware crypto wallet now offers a subscription service that allows you to securely store your recovery seed phrase.</em></li>



<li><em>Nonetheless, the news has been heavily attacked by a segment of the Web3 community.</em></li>



<li><em>Ledger Recover essentially encrypts a user&#8217;s seed phrase and shards it into three pieces, each of which is shared with a separate custodian.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ledger was in hot water this week after announcing intentions to launch Ledger Recover, an optional, paid membership service for Ledger Nano X wallet users that offers a seed phrase recovery method involving third-party custodians. The new functionality, according to the company, is a breakthrough that will enable cryptocurrency and NFT holders to retrieve their funds in the case of a lost or forgotten seed phrase.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1051.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1051-1024x683.png" alt="Why Did Ledger&#039;s New Recover Function Cause Controversy?" class="wp-image-188933" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1051-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1051-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1051-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1051-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1051-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1051.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Why Did Ledger&#039;s New Recover Function Cause Controversy? 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Nevertheless, the news has been heavily condemned by a segment of the Web3 community, who allege that the firmware upgrade that allows the service to existing violates Ledger&#8217;s longtime policy of ensuring a user&#8217;s private key never leaves the device. Such issues have cast doubt on the wallet&#8217;s purported dedication to privacy and security, which the firm rejects.</p>



<p>Ledger launched the Nano X cold wallet 2.2.1 firmware upgrade on May 16, which includes a key mnemonic recovery tool named &#8220;Ledger Recover&#8221; as an ID-based key recovery service.</p>



<p>Backs up the user&#8217;s private key in order to recover the seed phrase, and needs a membership ($9.99 a month) to utilize. Presently, an EU, UK, Canadian, or US passport/ID document is necessary to subscribe to the service, but additional nations and papers will be supported in the coming months.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the publication of this capability has prompted many Web3 users to be concerned about privacy and security, particularly since it entails storing private key mnemonic phrases and correlating them with passports or ID papers, which clearly contradicts the encryption community&#8217;s privacy ideals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Controversial new feature</h2>



<p>Ledger is one of the world&#8217;s most well-known and popular producers of hardware wallets, valued at more than $1 billion and with an estimated annual sales of more than $53 million. Hardware wallets, often known as &#8220;cold storage&#8221; devices, are USB thumb-drive-like equipment that provides a highly secure method to store crypto. They are seen to be preferable to &#8220;hot wallet&#8221; competitors such as MetaMask and WalletConnect, which are simpler to use but have the disadvantage of keeping private keys online, exposing them to significantly more danger.</p>



<p>Setting up a Ledger wallet entails producing a unique seed phrase, which is a set of randomly generated words that serve as the private keys for crypto wallets. Although secure, this system has usability issues. Losing the seed phrase implies losing access to the money, which might lead to a wallet breach if it gets into the wrong hands.</p>



<p>According to reports, the basis of this new function is to fragment the user&#8217;s mnemonic phrase and split it into three pieces before encrypting it. At the same time, consumers must offer their own ID and selfie record, as well as trust three custodians. Humans safeguard this information for you.</p>



<p>There is, however, an issue with Ledger doing this.</p>



<p>To begin, in order to utilize this &#8220;mnemonic recovery&#8221; method, you must correlate your ID-identifying information with your account, resulting in a KYC pain point, data leakage, hacking, censorship, and surveillance.</p>



<p>Second, you must trust a third party and provide them with your ID information as well as knowledge about encrypted cash. Data breaches or hacks are quite possible in this circumstance; after all, user data is extremely valuable (both now and in the future), and any &#8220;approved third party&#8221; may decide to utilize your data as a source of money at any moment.</p>



<p>Moreover, the Recover function jeopardizes user privacy. At the moment, most users choose to use the Ledger Live software service, which will use the Ledger node to synchronize all wallets, which contain all the details of cryptocurrency activities in the wallet, users using Ledger Live are at a higher risk than users binding their own ID to the Leger account.</p>



<p>A security analyst touting a gadget that stores a fully untouchable and immovable private key and then abruptly revealing that the key might be accessed and shared with other parties did not sit well with most of the Web3 community.</p>



<p>Particularly distressing was the notion that users would be required to produce a government-issued ID in order to participate in Recover.</p>



<p>The disclosure of the upgrade sparked outrage in the crypto world, with charges that Ledger&#8217;s new function contradicted previous assurances about keeping private keys off the internet.</p>



<p>Others who feel doubters are exaggerating have referred to the fact that the wallets are intrinsically upgradeable to alleviate concerns about their accessibility and security, as well as to offer clarity on the fundamentals of how wallets function in the first place. Hardware wallets would lose usefulness if they could not be updated since blockchains themselves improve over time, and any device interacting with the blockchain must be able to adapt properly.</p>



<p>Whatever the subscription service is or is not, it demonstrates the difficulties of explaining new features in Web3&#8217;s rapid-response environment. The Recover debate, like many others before it, highlights the constant battle faced by blockchain-centric businesses; achieving a balance between user experience and respecting the crypto community&#8217;s basic beliefs is a difficult undertaking.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1053.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="432" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1053.png" alt="Why Did Ledger&#039;s New Recover Function Cause Controversy?" class="wp-image-188935" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1053.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1053-300x127.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1053-768x324.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1053-750x316.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Why Did Ledger&#039;s New Recover Function Cause Controversy? 3"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Does Ledger keep track of your seed phrase?</h2>



<p>The upgrade to Ledger Recover claims to encrypt and split your seed phrase into three parts. After that, you will provide identification evidence and a selfie video, and three separate custodians will protect the shards for you. Ledger, Coincover, and a third company will serve as custodians. It highlighted that this is a supplementary service, and customers may continue to carry their recovery seed phrases as previously. This change sparked outrage on Twitter from several internet privacy activists.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why is it dangerous?</h2>



<p>According to the information provided, all KYC data is gathered by a company named &#8220;Onfido,&#8221; which will handle things like KYC information verification. When Ledger users upload/verify their identities, user IDs, selfie videos, photo/video/sound, and an overall picture of the user&#8217;s device and current activities are retained.</p>



<p>This implies Onfido will have complete access to your ID and the information that you are a Ledger user. Of course, they are aware that you have cryptocurrency. Onfido will also have complete knowledge of the authentication devices you use, so you now not only trust Ledger and &#8220;approved third parties&#8221; with your identity data, but you also trust Onfido with your devices and more.</p>



<p>All of these actions have the potential to create new risks. Let us now look at it from a technical standpoint.</p>



<p>Users must trust Ledger &#8220;100%&#8221; from a technological standpoint since the code for the whole process is closed and unverifiable. Although Ledger co-founder Nicolas Bacca said that his team intends to open up its code in the future to enable customers to view how the wallet&#8217;s recovery service securely encrypts user data and functions safely behind the scenes, the company is also making its recovery service publicly available. Select and be upfront about agreements with third-party custodians, however, as of this writing, Ledger has not open-sourced the required code, which means that no one except Ledger can verify what is happening/security.</p>



<p>If everything goes as planned, the user&#8217;s seed phrase should never leave the device unencrypted. Nevertheless, we have no method of confirming this or guaranteeing that the seed phrases are correctly completed or encrypted.</p>



<p>But one thing is certain: the code is now running on your Ledger, and you may transmit your mnemonic through USB/BT. From another angle, your wallet will no longer be a &#8220;cold wallet&#8221; at this point but rather a &#8220;transition from cold to hot.&#8221; Not only that but being able to &#8220;hot&#8221; your wallet with a few keystrokes opens up a slew of new phishing and malware attack routes where hackers might accidentally get your seed phrase.</p>



<p>We are unable to establish if Ledger has built-in security safeguards to prevent someone from transmitting the encrypted shard mnemonic to one person, three distinct custodians, or whether the shard mnemonic can only be delivered by The user will decode it himself.</p>



<p>Another issue is that you don&#8217;t sure how the mnemonic recovery or decryption processes function. Users must check in to Ledger and confirm their identity, but since decryption can only be performed on their own device, how does the new device get the decryption key?</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1054.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1054-1024x538.png" alt="Why Did Ledger&#039;s New Recover Function Cause Controversy?" class="wp-image-188936" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1054-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1054-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1054-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1054-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1054-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1054.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Why Did Ledger&#039;s New Recover Function Cause Controversy? 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>There is normally a mechanism to authorize a new device and send it the decryption key in an end-to-end encryption (E2EE) situation, however in the instance of a lost Ledger, the user can&#8217;t actually do that, thus someone else must have the device they sent to. Mnemonic recovery requires a copy of your Ledger decryption key.</p>



<p>Who holds the decryption keys in this case? Is this the Ledger? Or is it encrypted and stored elsewhere after Ledger Recover and ID verification? If this is the case, how is the decryption key kept, encrypted, and authenticated?</p>



<p>Moreover, if someone discovers that you used Ledger Recover and obtained your ID, they may conceivably take all of your cryptos, even if your Ledger is safe and well in a drawer someplace.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that CoinCover, the custodian of Ledger Recover, and Onfido, both stated above, are based in the United Kingdom. Another custodian is not named in the original document, however, EscrowTech in the United States is reported to be one. If the story is accurate, it implies that you will be subject to the authority of the &#8220;Five Eyes Intelligence.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The most concerning aspect of the problem is an apparent loss of confidence between Ledger and its users, which has been sparked by discrepancies in the firm&#8217;s assertions.</p>



<p>Users that opt in for the Recover upgrade, on the other hand, will have their identities connected to their cryptocurrency wallets, bringing the experience closer to that of a centralized exchange with know-your-customer (KYC) checks.</p>



<p>Onfido collects all KYC information. When you upload/verify your identification, the firm also performs KYC onboarding and maintains track of your device and current behavior. You not only trust Ledger and other authorized parties, but you also trust Onfido with your sensitive information. Is it a calamity in the making?</p>



<p>The debut of the Recover service by Ledger may not be a smart idea since it violates all of the concepts of utilizing hardware wallets (cold storage) and involves KYC. At the same time, the &#8220;non-open source&#8221; method makes many Web3 users skeptical of its claims.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is EtherMail?</h2>



<p>EtherMail is a Web 3.0 email platform that redefines the standard for encrypted and anonymous wallet-to-wallet communication. The project bridges the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 email communication by offering users complete ownership and control over their mailboxes.</p>



<p>Make advantage of Web3 technologies to enable users to send emails securely and anonymously. EtherMail not only enables users to send emails properly, but it also allows users to have total control over their inboxes without being bothered by advertisements or spam messages.</p>



<p>The platform provides anonymous P2P (Peer-to-Peer) communication functions, and users may earn money for reading mail (Read2Earn model).</p>



<p>EtherMail is unique in that it incorporates blockchain technology to make sending and receiving emails more secure than ever before. Companies may use real-time information synchronized on the blockchain to provide rich, relevant content directly to asset owners. This enables users to engage with sensitive information that is not controlled by a third party.</p>



<p>EtherMail also offers project solutions for user information and communication. Such common projects are Doge Pound, GemSet, and so on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Read to Earn</h2>



<p>Read to Earn is an EtherMail feature that lets users can earn incentives for reading emails about their assets. This functionality is based on the Blockchain platform, which contributes to security and transparency. This is the distinction between EtherMail and conventional types of advertising, where consumers are often harassed by unwanted adverts.</p>



<p>With Blockchain, email reading may be authenticated, allowing users to maintain track of their email history and prevent losing correspondence. The &#8220;read to earn&#8221; feature of EtherMail helps both email users and businesses by improving engagement and accessibility to target audiences.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1043.png"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="959" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1043.png" alt="UniSat Wallet Guide: The First BRC-20-Supported Wallet" class="wp-image-188917" title="UniSat Wallet Guide: The First BRC-20-Supported Wallet 14"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is UniSat?</h2>



<p>Along with that is the appearance of many wallet projects (wallets) to support users to access Bitcoin&#8217;s NFT and DeFi ecosystem. UniSat Wallet, which officially went into operation on April 23, is the earliest BRC-20-supported wallet.</p>



<p>The overall consensus was that although Bitcoin may be used for payment, it is not required and should not be utilized as an ecology. With the release of BRC-20, many regular army players mocked this parody of ERC-20 since there is a significant difference between a plain string of JSON codes and a smart contract.</p>



<p>UniSat was working on integrating BRC-20 while everyone was enthused with the Bitcoin picture NFT.</p>



<p>UniSat is responsible for the success of BRC-20. UniSat, the first human to eat crabs, is one of the few ventures that took advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime chance.</p>



<p>You may argue that BRC broke the circle by chance in order to catch up with the &#8220;meme season&#8221; or that BRC&#8217;s fame would not endure long, but UniSat&#8217;s rewards are actual money. Entrepreneurs and developers are surrounded in echo chambers by the organization&#8217;s specified track and ecosystem, trying to generate the next miracle via repetitive wheel-making in the existing crypto company.</p>



<p>Referring to BRC-20, let&#8217;s learn a little about this token standard.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is the BRC-20 token?</h2>



<p>UniSat Wallet is an open-source Chrome addon for storing and transferring Ordinals NFTs and BRC-20 tokens. Ordinals NFTs are non-fungible tokens inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinal Protocol. BRC-20 tokens are fungible tokens that may be used on the Bitcoin network. UniSat Wallet allows you to instantly observe unconfirmed NFTs, inscribe on-the-fly without operating a complete node, and store, mint, and transfer BRC-20 tokens. UniSat Wallet is also the official Ordinal Protocol wallet.</p>



<p>Before the beginning of 2023, there was just one asset on the Bitcoin blockchain: Bitcoin. Despite much discussion about diversifying assets like as other blockchains, things are still not looking positive.</p>



<p>An anonymous developer dubbed &#8220;Domo&#8221; designed the BRC-20 token standard through March 2023, using the Ordinals protocol and the Inscriptions mechanism, enabling developers to install, mint, and transfer tokens on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>BRC-20 may be thought of as the ERC-20 equivalent of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, since it was recently formed, as of the time of writing (May 2023), this standard does not enable smart contracts in the same way as ERC-20 does.</p>



<p>Although it was only created 2 months ago, so far the market has appeared more than 25,000 tokens of the BRC-20 standard with a total capitalization of more than $500 million, sometimes reaching over $1 billion.</p>



<p>In such cases, the ORDI token capitalization accounts for more than half of the whole BRC-20 market capitalization. The first BRC-20 token, ORDI, was established with the intention of creating a new token standard. After that, ORDI&#8217;s popularity is growing as more developers &#8220;caught up&#8221; and created new tokens to test the system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What Makes UniSat Wallet Unique?</h2>



<ul>
<li>Ordinals NFTs should be stored and transferred.</li>



<li>See unverified NFTs right now, 100% Open-source</li>



<li>Inscribe on the fly without the need for a fullnode.</li>



<li>BRC-20 storage, minting, and transfer.</li>
</ul>



<p>With the democratization of Ordinals and BRC-20, an increasing number of applications are developing. Indeed, the fabrication of inscriptions was formerly restricted to intellectuals.</p>



<p>Moreover, purchases of NFT Ordinals occurred OTC (Over The Counter), posing serious decentralization and trust issues. UniSatis enables the creation, storage, and transmission of NFT Ordinals without the need for a complete node. The wallet now supports BRC-20 forwarding as of version 1.1.15.</p>



<p>Lastly, it provides a decentralized marketplace for purchasing and selling BRC-20 tokens. Unfortunately, this marketplace is still in its early stages. As a result, it should be taken with care.</p>



<p>It is essential, however, to exercise caution when investing in a BRC-20 since most of them are shitcoins with low value. As a result, it is essential to exercise caution and never invest significant sums of money. Moreover, UniSat is still in the experimental phase, which means it might be vulnerable to errors and malicious attacks. It is consequently advised to use extreme caution and not invest more than you can afford to lose.</p>



<p>Yet, this new tendency does not simply benefit the Bitcoin network. Moreover, the increased interest in Ordinals and BRC-20 has increased the number of daily Bitcoin transactions. Naturally, the network became congested as a result of this growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How to create a UniSat wallet</h2>



<p>Apart from Ordinals Wallet, the most popular wallet for accessing BRC-20 tokens is UniSat. Follow these steps to establish a UniSat wallet:</p>



<ul>
<li>Step 1: Go to https://unisat.io/ to get the wallet (add the wallet directly via Chrome Extension or download it from Github.)</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Buy/sell BRC-20 tokens</strong></h3>



<p>To buy/sell (trading) BRC-20 tokens, go to https://unisat.io/market, connect your wallet and start trading. However, UniSat marketplace will require you to meet ONE of TWO criteria:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hold OG Pass (currently has a floor price of ~0.25 BTC. You can check it here: https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/unisat-og-pass)</li>



<li>There are 20 UniSat points (each mint brother BRC-20 token corresponds to 1 UniSat point)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you meet the requirements of UniSat, you can start trending the BRC-20 token.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Although a token standard was born quite late compared to standards such as ERC-20, BEP-20, TRC-20, etc., BRC-20 has created a fever covering the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Unisat is one of the projects that is going up thanks to the development of BRC-20.</p>



<p>After you have successfully created your Unisat wallet, you can start trading. How to use Unisat wallet is similar to Metamask wallet.</p>

The coin has no use other than to provide pleasure.</p>



<p>Pepe coin is an ERC-20 token that operates on the Ethereum network. PEPE&#8217;s total circulation supply is now 420,690 billion, with no maximum supply indicated.</p>



<p>On April 16, PEPE was officially launched. And within just a few days, it had grown by up to 21,000%. PEPE gained traction on social media when a crypto trader allegedly swapped 0.125 ETH (worth about $250 at that time) for 5.9 trillion PEPE. The token is then worth more than $5 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">PEPE &#8220;symbol&#8221; in the crypto world</h2>



<p>What is the origin of PEPE? Why is this meme so popular and getting so much attention?</p>



<p>Years ago, while Matt Furie was in his early twenties and working at a junk shop in San Francisco, he began painting frogs for fun. He dubbed his character PEPE and published a small comic series called Playtime.</p>



<p>Later, he developed another successful comic series called Boys Club, which was based on Matt and his buddies but included the character PEPE the Frog and various other animal aids.</p>



<p>Furie seems to have been actively publishing her comics on the social networking site MySpace from there. Surprisingly, this series immediately became &#8220;viral,&#8221; particularly the picture of PEPE Frog peeing on his trousers with the message &#8220;Feels Good Man.&#8221;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, &#8220;Feels Good Man&#8221; quickly became a meme. When many individuals are happy with something, they will employ the frog meme + &#8220;Feels Good Man.&#8221; People have been using this meme to broadcast the name of a certain stock since 2008, before Bitcoin even existed.</p>



<p>The Pepe the Frog meme became viral on the internet in the years that followed. People are beginning to employ PEPE frogs to communicate various emotions, rather than &#8220;Feels Good Man.&#8221; PEPE the Frog collections such as &#8220;Sad Frog,&#8221; &#8220;Smug Frog,&#8221; &#8220;Angry Pepe,&#8221; &#8220;Feels Frog,&#8221; and so on were created and quickly became popular on most social media platforms.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not only memes, however. PEPE has also become a symbol. PEPE also became the face of Trump&#8217;s 2016 campaign, MAGA. Even Donald Trump posted a photograph of himself as Pepe throughout the campaign, demonstrating the campaign&#8217;s popularity. What size is this PEPE Frog?</p>



<p>Yet when it comes to crypto and the meme mania, PEPE is unquestionably necessary. The PEPE meme often appears on crypto discussion sites. Several individuals even opted to publish these photographs as blockchain-based NFTs. Then there are coins related to PEPE, such as: Feels Good Man (FGM), often known as the Pepe coin, which is the primary character in this story.</p>

<p>Although depending on the famous meme for virality, the team behind PEPE makes no claims regarding a connection to Pepe the Frog.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Pepe coin has no association with Matt Furie or his creation Pepe the Frog.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the contrary, the token&#8217;s purpose is to simply pay respect to a meme that we all know and adore.</p>



<p>Pepe coin is a cryptocurrency inspired by the image of Pepe the frog and built on the blockchain technology. The picture of Pepe the frog, on the other hand, has featured in Internet culture for a long time and has become a symbol of numerous online community organizations.</p>



<p>As a result, Pepe coin is more than just a cryptocurrency; it also has cultural significance. It is considered an element of Internet culture and is popular among lovers of that culture.</p>



<p>Moreover, Pepe currency is used to indicate support and affection for Pepe the frog and Internet culture in general. The usage of Pepe coins to demonstrate connection and engagement among members of the online community is also part of Internet culture.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Pepe coin is not only a cryptocurrency, but it also represents the cultural value of the Internet and is used to demonstrate the connection and interaction between members of the online community.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How to buy PEPE and trade it?</h2>



<p>You may purchase this coin on many cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Kucoin, and Kraken or decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. This currency is also available on well-known exchanges such as PancakeSwap and ProBit.</p>



<p>You must first open an account on one of these exchanges and pay using Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. You may swap it on comparable exchanges after you&#8217;ve acquired it. This currency features a liquidity reservoir that makes trading simple. Since its inception, the trading volume of this cryptocurrency has constantly expanded, making it an appealing investment alternative for traders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tokenomics</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key metric</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Token Name: Pepe coin</li>



<li>Ticker: PEPE</li>



<li>Blockchain: Ethereum</li>



<li>Token Contract: 0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933</li>



<li>Token Type: None</li>



<li>Total Supply: 420,690,000,000,000 PEPE</li>



<li>Circulating Supply: 420,690,000,000,000 PEPE</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use cases</strong></h3>



<p>As a result of its extreme volatility, PEPE should only be regarded a speculative token following the trend and not a long-term investment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Allocation</strong></h3>



<p>The following are the proportions of Pepe coin:</p>



<p>93.1% Liquidity Pool &#8211; 391,662,390,000,000 PEPE<br>PEPE CEX Listing: 6.9% &#8211; 29,027,610,000,000</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Release schedule</strong></h3>



<p>93.1%: Sent to the liquidity pool.<br>6.9%: Will be maintained in a multi-sign wallet and only utilized in the future as tokens for centralized trade lists, bridges, and liquidity pools. The ENS domain &#8220;pepecexwallet.eth&#8221; makes this wallet readily trackable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pepe coin Sale</strong></h3>



<p>There are no community token sales at PEPE.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Holder</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, there are 115,534 PEPE holders. This number exceeded the plan that Pepe coin set at the beginning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Team</h2>



<p>There is no information about PEPE&#8217;s founding team. PEPE&#8217;s developers are anonymous and have also given up control of the contract. But they still actively update information on the Website and social networking channels.</p>



<p>Therefore, for now, PEPE &#8220;can&#8221; be considered a community project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Roadmap</h2>



<p>Although joking about having no plans, the team has given out some expectations in the form of three separate roadmap stages, which may be seen below:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">A new cryptocurrency market trend</h2>



<p>Pepe coin is one of the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s representations of a new trend known as &#8220;meme coin.&#8221; These currencies, which are based on famous online memes, have grown in popularity among crypto aficionados.</p>



<p>Meme coins are often manufactured for enjoyment or to make a message. Yet, several meme currencies have increased in value, making them appealing investment alternatives. Pepe coin is one among them, and its value has risen dramatically since its inception.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The Pepe coin&#8217;s future</h2>



<p>This cryptocurrency&#8217;s future is unknown, but it has the potential to expand in value. The currency has a sizable fan base that is devoted to the Pepe the Frog meme and its cultural importance.</p>



<p>Moreover, PEPE has the potential to reach hundreds of trillion tokens, making it one of the biggest cryptocurrencies today. This would need a huge rise in currency demand, but it is not impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Community</h2>



<p>Whether a project has a strong basis or not, the community is at the core of it. It also has a major impact in the case of PEPE. While some BAYC members favor PEPE, it has amassed a sizable fan following over time. This explains the recent growth in its daily trading volume, which reached billions of dollars at one time. This growth in trading volume reflects a growing community that includes both day traders and active investors.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Should we buy Pepe coin?</h2>



<p>Pepe coin has made a stunning breakthrough into the crypto world, spurred by its association with a famous online joke and recent price increases. But, since it is a meme-based cryptocurrency, its development potential is questionable, and you should proceed with care.</p>



<p>Investing in meme coins is always dangerous, particularly with a project with &#8220;no value&#8221; like PEPE. Alternatively, if you want to invest seriously, there are more economical solutions, such as Ethereum.</p>



<p>PEPE, the first bull run, was spurred by enthusiasm and became viral after he knocked out dog-type coins. There are wallets that have held a considerable quantity of PEPE coins from day one, likely tied to the project&#8217;s designers, since these wallet addresses have had no prior trading activity before it gets PEPE. This might put us in danger of a sell-off if there is any FOMO. And the current price spike is the result of PEPE being listed on key CEX platforms. Yet these bullish benefits are typically difficult to maintain, so you must be cautious.</p>



<p>The answer to whether PEPE is a suitable investment depends on whether you want short-term or long-term rewards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Because of its affiliation with internet culture and the Pepe the Frog meme, Pepe currency has become a popular digital asset. Since its inception, the price of this cryptocurrency has risen significantly, making it an appealing investment alternative for traders.</p>



<p>This coin&#8217;s future is unknown, but it has the potential to improve in value. Its large fan base and ties to internet culture make it a one-of-a-kind and fascinating investment prospect.</p>



<p>If you want to invest in this cryptocurrency, make sure you do your homework and understand the dangers. The bitcoin market is very volatile, and all investments must be undertaken with caution.</p>

<p>Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) allow token holders to lock up their holdings as votes to propose changes to a project. These changes can range from deploying treasury funds to purposes that benefit the project to expansion on other networks.</p>



<p>The attacker floated a malicious proposal that hid a code function to grant them fake votes that can now be used to handle some aspects of Tornado Cash, such as torn (TORN) tokens held in the main governance contract or withdrawal of locked torn tokens. This was done by putting forth a proposal that imitated an earlier version, except with some malicious code that allowed for the update of logic, giving the attacker access to all governance votes.</p>



<p>As a result, the attacker now has all votes, which means that they have complete control over the DAO. Security researcher @samczsun tweeted on Sunday that &#8220;Now that they have all the votes, they can do whatever they want. In this case, they simply withdrew 10,000 votes as TORN and sold it all.&#8221; This is a serious issue that puts the future plans of the Tornado Cash DAO at risk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Once the proposal was passed by voters, the attacker simply used the emergencyStop function to update the proposal logic to grant themselves the fake votes<a href="https://t.co/JgYk9PJg6O" target="_blank">https://t.co/JgYk9PJg6O</a><a href="https://t.co/y3bjglXD7J" target="_blank">https://t.co/y3bjglXD7J</a> <a href="https://t.co/kpGXC3LtjW" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/kpGXC3LtjW</a></p>&mdash; @samczsun.com (@samczsun) <a href="https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1660012961975640064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>However, it is important to note that this attack does not impact the actual Tornado Cash protocol. The protocol allows users to pass funds through the service to mask or obscure the movements of funds and crypto addresses. This attack was not an exploit of any smart contracts or technology related to the working of Tornado Cash.</p>



<p>Tornado Cash community has put up newer proposals seeking to revert changes made to the code. One community member observed that the attacker had maliciously minted over 1 million torn for themselves, worth over $4 million at current prices. Despite this, the community is determined to keep the Tornado Cash project going and is taking steps to ensure that such an attack does not happen again in the future.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Custom Dashboards</strong></h3>



<p>If you can&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re searching for in the predefined dashboards and queries, which seems unlikely, you may design your own dashboard and begin adding queries to it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How to search On-chain data on Dune Analytics</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Search on-chain information of any project</strong></h3>



<p>To look for On-chain information for any project you&#8217;re interested in, follow these steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Step 1: Initially, you must register an account on Dune Analytics using your email address; the process is identical to that of other social networking sites.</li>



<li>Step 2: After login in, go to the Dashboards tab to proceed to the next step.</li>



<li>Step 3: Under the &#8220;Search for dashboards&#8221; tab, look for the project you&#8217;re looking for. Find details about the Optimism project in the sample below and hit the &#8220;Enter&#8221; key on your keyboard. After that, a series of findings will be produced, including summarizing and evaluating data from this layer 2 project. Just click on each item to begin sorting through the information and data on-chain that is relevant to your requirements.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-21-at-15.22.56.png"><img decoding="async" width="3024" height="1734" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-21-at-15.22.56.png" alt="Dune Analytics Review: The Most Powerful On-chain Data Analytics Platform" class="wp-image-188870" title="Dune Analytics Review: The Most Powerful On-chain Data Analytics Platform 37"></a></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Search for data on the blockchain by field</strong></h3>



<p>Using Dune Analytics, you can search for On-chain data by individual fields in addition to discovering it by project. The methods are identical to those used when doing an On-chain data search by the project. The main difference is that in this part, you will learn about field-specific On-chain data like DeFi, NFT (Non-fungible token), and so on.</p>



<p>An example of the On-chain data information of the NFT field that the Dune accumulates is shown below.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>NDAX places a strong emphasis on security and privacy to ensure the protection of user funds and information. While the specific security and privacy measures may evolve over time, here are some common practices and features employed by NDAX as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021:</p>



<ol>
<li>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): NDAX typically provides support for two-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of security to user accounts. By enabling 2FA, users are required to provide a second verification factor, such as a unique code generated by an authenticator app, in addition to their password when logging in.</li>



<li>Cold Storage: NDAX often utilizes cold storage for storing cryptocurrencies. Cold storage involves keeping the majority of user funds offline in secure hardware wallets that are not directly accessible from the internet. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access or hacking attempts targeting online wallets.</li>

<li>Regulatory Compliance: NDAX typically strives to comply with Canadian regulations, including measures related to know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. These compliance measures aim to ensure a more secure and regulated trading environment.</li>



<li>Privacy Policies: NDAX typically has privacy policies in place to outline how user information is collected, used, and protected. These policies explain how NDAX handles personal data and may include details on data retention, sharing with third parties, and user consent.</li>



<li>Security Audits: NDAX may conduct regular security audits and assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in their systems. These audits help ensure that security measures are up to date and effective in safeguarding user funds and information.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>NDAX is a Canadian-based cryptocurrency exchange that provides a platform for users to buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies. It emphasizes security, regulatory compliance, and user-friendly features to create a secure and accessible trading environment.</p>



<p>Some of the notable aspects of NDAX include its wide range of supported cryptocurrencies, integration with Canadian dollars (CAD) for fiat trading, user-friendly interface with real-time market data and trading tools, and adherence to regulatory compliance measures.

While I don&#8217;t have access to the latest fee details for Bitinka, I can provide you with a general overview of the types of fees that cryptocurrency exchanges typically charge. It&#8217;s recommended to refer to the official Bitinka website or contact their customer support for the most up-to-date and accurate fee information. Here are some common fees associated with cryptocurrency exchanges:</p>



<ol>
<li>Trading Fees: Trading fees are charges imposed on users for executing trades on the exchange. These fees are usually a percentage of the trading volume or a fixed amount per trade. The fee structure may vary based on factors such as the user&#8217;s trading volume, the type of order (market order or limit order), and the trading pairs involved.</li>



<li>Deposit and Withdrawal Fees: Exchanges may charge fees for depositing or withdrawing funds from the platform. These fees can vary depending on the payment method used and the specific cryptocurrency being deposited or withdrawn.</li>



<li>Maker and Taker Fees: Some exchanges differentiate between &#8220;makers&#8221; and &#8220;takers&#8221; when it comes to trading fees. Makers are users who provide liquidity to the order book by placing limit orders, while takers are users who execute trades by accepting existing orders from the order book. Maker fees are typically lower than taker fees as an incentive for providing liquidity.</li>



<li>Network Fees: Network fees, also known as blockchain fees or transaction fees, are charges associated with processing transactions on the blockchain network. These fees are paid to miners or validators who verify and add transactions to the blockchain. The amount of network fees can vary depending on the congestion of the blockchain network and the specific cryptocurrency being transacted.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Bitinka Security and Privacy</h2>



<p><br>Bitinka emphasizes security and privacy measures to protect user accounts, funds, and personal information. While I don&#8217;t have access to specific details about Bitinka&#8217;s security practices, here are some common security and privacy measures that cryptocurrency exchanges typically implement:</p>



<ol>
<li>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Encryption: Exchanges often use SSL encryption to secure communications between users&#8217; devices and their platform. This encryption helps protect sensitive information, such as login credentials and financial data, from unauthorized access.</li>



<li>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Bitinka may offer two-factor authentication as an additional layer of security for user accounts. 2FA requires users to provide a second form of verification, such as a unique code from an authenticator app or a text message, in addition to their password when logging in.</li>



<li>Cold Storage: To enhance the security of user funds, exchanges may store a significant portion of their cryptocurrencies in offline wallets, also known as cold storage. These wallets are not connected to the internet, minimizing the risk of hacking and unauthorized access.</li>



<li>Account Security Features: Bitinka may provide account security features such as the ability to set strong passwords, enable email notifications for account activity, and set withdrawal limits. These features allow users to have more control over their account security settings.</li>



<li>Regular Security Audits: Exchanges often conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the overall security of their systems. These audits can help identify and address potential security weaknesses.</li>



<li>Privacy Policy and Data Protection: Bitinka is likely to have a privacy policy in place that outlines how user data is collected, stored, and used. The exchange may adhere to data protection regulations and take measures to safeguard user privacy.</li>



<li>Compliance with Regulations: Bitinka may strive to comply with relevant regulatory requirements, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. These measures help ensure a more secure and compliant trading environment.</li>
</ol>
