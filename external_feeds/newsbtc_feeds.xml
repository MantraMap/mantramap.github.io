					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is correcting losses from the $27,660 zone. BTC is now facing strong resistance near the $28,800 and $29,000 levels. Bitcoin is attempting a fresh increase above the $28,500 resistance zone. The price is trading below $28,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $28,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could decline again if it fails to surpass the $28,800 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Upsides Capped Bitcoin price formed a base and started a recovery wave above the $28,000 resistance zone. BTC climbed above the $28,200 resistance zone to move into a short-term bullish zone. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $29,975 swing high to the $27,665 low. However, the bulls faced a strong resistance near the $28,800 zone and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Bitcoin price was rejected near the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $29,975 swing high to the $27,665 low. It is now trading below $28,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $28,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance is near the $28,800 level. The next major resistance sits near the $29,000 zone and the $29,080 level. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $29,000 resistance could send Bitcoin further higher. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise toward the $29,500 level. Any more gains could open the doors for a test of the key barrier at $30,000. Another Drop in BTC? If Bitcoin’s price fails to clear the $28,800 resistance, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $28,200 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $27,660 zone or the recent swing low, below which the price might drop toward the $27,200 support zone. Any more losses might take Bitcoin toward $26,500 in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $28,200, followed by $27,660. Major Resistance Levels – $28,800, $29,000, and $29,500.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Meme coins are rallying once more with 1,000% increases in a matter of hours now becoming the order of the day. With so many new meme coins performing well in the market, it is starting to look like a repeat of the infamous 2021 meme coin season. However, unlike in 2021, a whole new set of tokens are leading the charge this time around. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Triggers New Meme Run Before Pepe Coin (PEPE) launched in mid-April, meme coins had become another fixture in the market, just moving along with the general crypto market trend. However, PEPE would rise from a $50,000 market cap to over $600 million in less than three weeks and what followed was euphoria that triggered another meme coin bull run. Since PEPE’s success, a number of other meme coins have entered the market and many have found success as well across multiple chains. An example of this is the AIDOGE meme coin that launched on the Arbitrum blockchain around the same time as PEPE and in the two weeks that followed, the price of the cryptocurrency rose over 100x. Related Reading: Ripple’s Q1 Report Shows That Investors Are Still Bullish On XRP, Here’s Why Following the performance of both of these meme coins, activity spiked significantly on both blockchains with new coins entering the market. The next two weeks saw the entrance of new players such as WOJAK and SHIBAI, both of which have been listed on multiple centralized exchanges as well. Ethereum’s decentralized exchange trading volume is now dominated by these new meme coins, as well as the newly listed token pages on both on-chain data aggregators Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko. OG Meme Coins Take A Back Seat While it seems the meme season is back in full bloom, the original meme coins are not enjoying any of the action. Instead, cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are still seeing losses during a time when these new meme coins are performing incredibly well. For example, DOGE is changing hands at a price of $0.07822 at the time of this writing, with 24-hour losses of 0.84% and 7-day losses of 0.08%. In the same vein, SHIB is down 1.28% in the last day to be trading at $0.000009875. It has performed even worse on the weekly timeframe with a drawdown of 2.97%. DOGE seeing losses on the 24-hour chart &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com Obviously, investors are looking toward newer meme tokens in a bid to catch the next 100x, and coins like DOGE and SHIB have already grown too much to give such returns. Hence the reason why new meme coins are getting all of the attention right now. Related Reading: Kaspa (KAS), Render (RNDR), Injective (INJ) See Upside Amid Market Crash, What’s Going On? Something investors should keep in mind is the large number of rugs that are also being deployed by scammers to take advantage of unsuspecting profit-chasers.

					<description><![CDATA[Pepe coin is the most talked about asset in the crypto market right now. The less than one-month-old meme token has nothing at all to do with Bitcoin, yet shockingly is displaying nearly exact price patterns.  Don’t miss this incredible and unusual chart comparison between BTCUSD and PEPEUSDC.  A Quick Recap Of Pepe Coin And Its Runaway Crypto Success Pepe coin is one of the biggest new meme coins, prompting a massive wave of more meme tokens of all kinds.

But if the Bitcoin chart is any indication of what’s to come, some serious profit taking could be ahead.  In the comparison below, we have put the 4-hour PEPEUSDC chart up against the weekly BTCUSD chart.

					<description><![CDATA[The recent sharp decline in shares of major U.S. regional banks has sparked fears of another banking crisis. The collapse of First Republic Bank, the largest U.S. bank failure since 2008, has sent shockwaves through the financial sector, prompting experts to warn that a &#8220;confidence crisis&#8221; could happen to any bank in the country. Investors have reacted quickly to the news, with shares of PacWest Bancorp, Western Alliance Bank, and KeyCorp plummeting by as much as 30%, 21%, and 10%, respectively. The KBW Regional Banking Index has also taken a hit, falling by 5.2% and its lowest since December 2020. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Climbs Higher: Q1 2023 Results Show Impressive Growth US Banking Industry In Peril, Half Of America&#8217;s Banks Nearing Insolvency Mario Nawfal, a renowned financial expert, has expressed concern over the recent plummeting of bank shares in major U.S. regional banks, signaling a deepening banking crisis in the country. In the aftermath of the collapse of First Republic Bank, the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, shares of PacWest Bancorp, Western Alliance Bank, and KeyCorp fell drastically, with the KBW Regional Banking Index hitting their lowest level since December 2020. Nawfal warns that if a confidence crisis can happen to the First Republic, it can happen to any bank in the country. He attributes the current state of the US banking industry to “insatiable greed and reckless” money printing, which have had dire consequences. The collapse of First Republic Bank is just the tip of the iceberg, and things could get much worse if the Federal Reserve doesn&#8217;t pivot, Nawfal claimed.  The implications of JPMorgan being the government&#8217;s first line of defense in a banking crisis are also a cause of concern for analysts from Evercore ISI, a global independent investment banking advisory firm. Nawfal further stated that the US banking industry is in peril, and urgent measures must be taken to prevent a complete collapse. Major US Banks Experience Significant Share Price Falls, Halting Trading PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp, two major players in the US banking industry, have halted trading in their equities after experiencing significant share price falls of 24% and 20%, respectively.  This follows the recent sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan, which occurred after the US regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), took control of the struggling San Francisco-based lender. First Republic Bank&#8217;s share price had collapsed by a staggering 97% this year following the crisis of confidence triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. According to a report by The Telegraph, First Republic Bank&#8217;s deposits plunged by $100 billion in the first quarter of the year, highlighting the severity of the crisis. The sale of the bank to JPMorgan indicates the dire state of the US banking industry and the need for urgent action to prevent a complete collapse. Furthermore, according to The Telegraph, The US Federal Reserve has begun a two-day meeting to determine whether it should raise its benchmark lending rate for the tenth time. Since March last year, the Fed has aggressively increased interest rates to combat high inflation, which remains above its long-term target of two percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to raise its base rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, bringing the interest rate to between 5 and 5.25%, the highest level since the global financial crisis. The situation is not just concerning for investors but also the wider US economy. The banking industry plays a critical role in the economy, and a collapse could have severe repercussions, including a credit crunch and a recession.

					<description><![CDATA[According to the latest report by Messari, Avalanche (AVAX) has shown a strong rebound in the first quarter of 2023. The market cap of the blockchain platform increased by 65.8% quarter on quarter (QoQ), reflecting the broader market trend and the thaw of the crypto winter that took by storm the crypto industry in 2022.  Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Tanks As Bears Take Charge, Will The Bulls Come To Rescue? Avalanche&#8217;s Q1 2023 Performance According to the report, Avalanche experienced a decline in daily average active addresses and transactions during Q1 2023. The 20.7% and 31.9% decline followed an anomalous spike and a high growth period of subnet activity in Q4. However, the report also highlights that Avalanche&#8217;s supply of Bitcoin BEP2, a token on the Binance chain (BTC.b), increased by 64% during Q1, reaching over $250 million in market cap. This is a positive sign for the platform&#8217;s growth and demonstrates the increasing interest in Avalanche as a blockchain platform. The report further notes that mainstream interest in Avalanche network infrastructure continued to grow during Q1, with partnerships with blockchain services (AWS) and Tencent Cloud, a secure, reliable, and high-performance cloud computing service. This demonstrates the growing recognition of Avalanche as a major player in the blockchain space. In addition, Avalanche launched several notable developments during Q1 aimed at ushering in developers. These include the launch of HyperSDK, Glacier API, and integration with The Graph. These developments are expected to increase the adoption of Avalanche as a blockchain platform and attract more developers to build on the platform. The Avalanche Effect According to Messari,  Avalanche&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) denominated in USD increased by 4.2% QoQ in Q1 2023, following the crypto market relief rally in January. However, TVL denominated in AVAX declined by 34.3%, suggesting that the increase in USD was due to asset price increases rather than new capital inflow. Despite this decline, liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) and yield farming platforms supported Avalanche and its DeFi ecosystem. Benqi liquid staking TVL grew by 88.6% QoQ to $100 million by the end of Q1, and Vector Finance, a yield optimization platform, increased by 50% QoQ to $36 million. Collectively, these two protocols finished Q1 in the top 10 by TVL, with ~$136 million in TVL. Avalanche&#8217;s most prominent protocol by TVL denominated in USD, Aave, was down slightly 5% QoQ, but Benqi Lending, Trader Joe, and GMX grew by 49%, 24%, and 70%, respectively. However, there remained concentration risk in the leading application, with Aave making up 43% ($432 million) of Avalanche&#8217;s DeFi TVL by the end of Q1. Avalanche Validators Show Volatility According to the report,  Avalanche&#8217;s network health remained stable in Q1 2023, with the average number of validators, total stake, and average engaged stake remaining consistent. However, the average number of delegators grew by 26.1% QoQ, indicating increasing participation in the network. Despite the stability of stake across a greater number of validators and delegates, there was some volatility in the number of validators that went offline during Q1. Both the average amount of unresponsive stakes and the number of unresponsive validators increased by over 70% QoQ. However, the percentage of unresponsive stakeholders and validators remained high enough to sustain block production. Overall, the Messari report indicates that Avalanche&#8217;s network health remained stable in Q1 2023, with consistent numbers of validators, total stake, and average engaged stake. The growth in the number of delegators also suggests increasing participation in the network.  While there was some volatility in the number of validators that went offline during Q1, the percentage of unresponsive stakes and validators remained high enough to sustain block production. These findings demonstrate the continued growth and resilience of the Avalanche network and its potential for further expansion and adoption in the blockchain space.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Ethereum has observed massive inflows of $505 million into Binance during the past day, a sign that selling may be going on. Ethereum Exchange Inflows Have Shot Up During The Past Day According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this increase in the supply on exchanges is the largest observed since the day before the Merge. The &#8220;supply on exchanges&#8221; is an indicator that, as its name already implies, measures the percentage of the total Ethereum supply that&#8217;s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Miners Continue To Sell When the value of this metric increases, it means investors are depositing some coins to exchanges right now. This kind of trend can have bearish consequences for the asset&#8217;s price as one of the main reasons why investors transfer their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes. On the other hand, decreasing values of this indicator imply a net amount of ETH is exiting these platforms currently. Such withdrawals can be a sign that the holders are accumulating the cryptocurrency, which can naturally be bullish for the asset&#8217;s value in the long term. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum supply on exchanges over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has shot up in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum supply on exchanges has observed a sharp rise in the past day, meaning that investors have deposited a large amount of ETH to these platforms. In the chart, there is also the data for another ETH indicator: the &#8220;exchange flow balance.&#8221; This metric measures the net number of coins that are flowing into or out of exchanges, meaning that the exchange flow balance essentially tracks the changes happening in the supply on exchanges indicator. During the past day, this metric has seen a large positive value, suggesting that inflows have far surpassed the outflows in this period. According to the metric, around 320,000 ETH ($584.6 million at the current price) has entered into the wallets of the exchanges with this spike. This net increase in the exchange supply is in fact the largest that the cryptocurrency has seen since September 14, 2022, the day before the transition towards the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism took place. Related Reading: Internet Computer (ICP) Social Dominance Hits 23-Month High, Top In? Interestingly, the vast majority of the inflow spike has been contributed by just one transfer, as data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert shows. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 273,781 #ETH (504,986,096 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Binancehttps://t.co/WHqdlSQ5uB &#8212; Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 1, 2023 This transfer to Binance was worth almost $505 million, and it is one of the largest transactions between an unknown wallet and an exchange observed during the last five years. It&#8217;s uncertain whether the whale has made this deposit with the intention to sell, or for using any other of the services offered by the platform. However, if selling is truly the goal here, then this massive inflow can be bad news for the asset&#8217;s price.

<p>This transfer to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/binance-coin/bnb-remains-under-pressure-as-regulators-crack-down-on-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> was worth almost $505 million, and it is one of the largest transactions between an unknown wallet and an exchange observed during the last five years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s uncertain whether the whale has made this deposit with the intention to sell, or for using any other of the services offered by the platform. However, if selling is truly the goal here, then this massive inflow can be bad news for the asset&#8217;s price.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[According to Uniswap&#8217;s (UNI) price chart, the coin is moving sideways on the chart. As the market opened, the price dropped to $5.30, where UNI found little support. Bulls are trying to regain control, but selling pressure is quite strong. The coin started exhibiting bearish momentum after April 19, 2023, when sharp crashes were observed in the chart. As of today, May 2, it has continued the bearish trend.  UNI Price Trend In April Uniswap opened in April at $6.0603 and t traded around the same price level at the start of the next day before recording a pullback to $5.9461 at the close of the market. Luckily, UNI regained its grip above $6 on April 4.  Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential UNI maintained the same price level from April 4 to 7 before dipping to $5.9191 on April 8. Thankfully, the price dip lasted for 5 days only. On the April 13 close of the market, UNI gained again above $6. It remained at the level until April 20, when it lost the grip falling to the $5 price range and continuing till today, May 2.  Will Uniswap (UNI) Recover From This Downtrend? The price of Uniswap is $5.31 as of today, May 02, 2023, indicating a loss of 1.74%. Also, its market cap is down by 2.05% at $3.06 billion with UNI&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume down by 26.90% at $33 million. Related Reading: AVAX Smart Contracts Hit 6-Month High – What This Means For Its Price The 1-day price chart for Uniswap price analysis indicates that the UNI bulls are doing their best to control the price decline. However, the bears are still in charge of today&#8217;s price trend. But despite being under selling pressure today, the value of UNI/USD has only decreased by 1.74% percent over the past 24 hours. UNI price is in a zone where investors or traders are afraid to buy UNI, and holders will likely sell due to the current market sentiment. As such, the downtrend might continue, except the bulls build back the bullish momentum.  UNI Key Price Levels Based on the Uniswap chart today, the coin directly supports $4.628. If the bears continue this momentum, the next significant level is $3.341. The coin will have trouble breaking past the $7.761 resistance level with this low momentum.  Since April 18, 2023, when the price of Uniswap fell below its 50-day SMA, this indicator has been indicating a SELL signal.  Related Reading: Internet Computer (ICP) Bleeds, What Are The Chances For Reversal? Uniswap is also trading below the 200-day SMA. Since April 18, 2023, the 200-day SMA has indicated SELL for the previous 13 days. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum oscillator is 38.58, which shows that UNI is neutral. The MACD line is also below the signal line and trading in a downtrend, indicating bearish movement.

					<description><![CDATA[The Arbitrum (ARB) price has retraced in line with the market-wide correction over the past few days, falling close to a critical support level. In the current environment, altcoins in general continue to show weakness across the board. However, one altcoin that is exhibiting relative strength, backed by on-chain activity, is ARB. Arbitrum is an optimistic L2 rollup with the main purpose of helping Ethereum scale by enabling L2 transactions with much faster confirmation time. The project has established itself as one of the top names in decentralized finance (DeFi) in recent months. Remarkably, it also houses the most popular perpetual DEX with GMX. ARB Price Shows Relative Strength A look at the ARB/BTC chart (2-hour chart) shows that the altcoin has formed an uptrend in recent days. The ascending triangle has its resistance line at 0.00004737. If ARB writes further higher lows against BTC despite the generally pressured altcoins market, it could ultimately break through the resistance and rally towards 0.00004850. The 4-hour chart ARB/USDT reveals that Arbitrum is currently holding just above the most crucial support level at $1.29. If the price level is breached to the downside, the $1.20 to $1.24 range would be key. Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop To the upside, the key resistance is at $1.42. However, on the way up the 200-day EMA, currently sitting at $1.35, could also provide some minor headwinds. Fueled by a Bitcoin rally, however, the resistance at $1.42 seems within reach without further ado. Should BTC break above $30,000, ARB bulls could even target a move up to $1.56. Arbitrum On-Chain Activity Remains Ultra Strong Arbitrum&#8217;s current technical strength on the charts coincides with its on-chain activity. Most metrics for Arbitrum are at an all-time high. Most importantly, the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem has remained solid after the airdrop, showing increased activity, as researched by analyst Francesco, who states: Contrary to what was expected after the airdrop, TVL is rising: GMX still remains the best perpetual DEX, and Arbitrum still remains the home of DeFi due to its composability, cheap fees, and fast confirmation times. Related Reading: Arbitrum Soars 44% To Record Highs As Whales Splash Millions On ARB Tokens Arbitrum leads on almost every metric, especially TVL. The fact that more users have switched to zkSync is most likely due to airdrop hunters. Arbitrum&#8217;s TVL is currently over $2.2 billion, an increase of over 100% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The primary reason for this is the perpetual DEX called GMX, which is Arbitrum&#8217;s leading protocol with over $500 million or 26% of TVL. However, with Radiant, Stargate and Camelot DEX, Arbitrum based projects also occupy three more places within the top 6 decentralized exchanges, underlining the growth of the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, Arbitrum ranks 4th among all blockchains by TVL, just behind the layer-1&#8217;s Ethereum, Tron, and BSC. Featured image from Nansen, charts from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Internet Computer (ICP) is trading red, hovering around the $5.6 price mark today, May 2, 2023. According to its daily chart, the bearish trend began two days ago, following three-day bullish moves. The turn in the market sentiment has resulted in the recent plunge in ICP price. Aside from this, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is also down by 1.89% over the past 24 hours. This could also be a factor affecting ICP&#8217;s price at the moment. While a reversal is not certain, some technical indicators can show whether or not the chances are high. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Outlook Judging from the ICP price of $3.9309 at the start of 2023, the token has made more bullish moves than bearish ones. ICP currently trades at $5.719, showing a 24-hour price decline of 5.99%. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential The token&#8217;s market cap has dropped by 6.50% in the last 24 hours to around $2.46 billion. The trading volume within the same period has also declined by 20.69%, hovering around $60,208,714. The plummeting value of the trading volume indicates more selling pressure among investors and traders. If this trend continues, ICP may likely see its price fall to the $5 price level before the end of the day. Moreover, data suggests that the general price prediction sentiment of the Internet Computer token is bearish. Based on its findings, 17 indicators signal a bearish trend, while 11 technical indicators display bullish signals. But let&#8217;s consider some major indicators from the daily chart to confirm its potential move further. ICP Technical Analysis The price of the Internet Computer token is currently above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages. While that is supposed to indicate a buy tendency, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) negates it, as it stands at 50.42. This figure suggests a neutral state in the ICP market but with higher odds of selling pressure. The token made a Death Cross several days back which lead to a significant drop in its price. The market may create a Golden Cross later on, but this might come after a major decline in its price, considering the interpretation of the technical indicators. Related Reading: AVAX Smart Contracts Hit 6-Month High – What This Means For Its Price The chart also shows that ICP&#8217;s price fell from a resistance level of $6.339. Crypto traders and investors can expect its price to fall further to hit the closest support level of $4.996. Other resistance and support levels are $7.449 and $4.525, respectively. Note that even while the technical indicators can be a helpful tool for analysis, investment decisions shouldn&#8217;t be made solely based on them. Traders should also consider various factors and risk management strategies. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin bears have gained control over the last few weeks, at least in the short term, and the battle seems to be on. After Bitcoin failed again at the $30,000 level on Sunday as part of a &#8220;weekend pump,&#8221; the bears are pushing towards $27,000. As of press time, Bitcoin was hovering around $28,000, having already tested key support at $27,800 yesterday evening (EST). The long-term trend continues to be clearly in favor of the Bitcoin bulls, for which a price above $25,000 speaks. However, in the short term, the key is to defend the $27,800 level to avoid a deeper correction to $25,000, as also indicated by analyst XO. $BTC pic.twitter.com/OKS791fYEi &#8212; XO (@Trader_XO) May 1, 2023 Bitcoin Remains In Trading Range For technical analyst Michaël van de Poppe, founder of Eight Global, breaking through $28,400 on the shorter time frame is the trend-setting price level. &#8220;Breaking through $28.4K and we could be back to $30K in a few days. Not breaking and folding coming days, $25K next. Big volatility on the horizon,&#8221; the analyst warns. However, the current weakness that Bitcoin is displaying with hovering around $28,000 could be an indication that another sweep of the lows is needed to generate new upside momentum. &#8220;Still eyeing $27.8K for a potential long here, or a break and flip of $28.4 for Bitcoin,&#8221; van de Poppe notes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds At $29,300 As PCE Comes Out Neutral Glassnode co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel write in their latest analysis that Bitcoin&#8217;s April monthly close was a major sign for the bulls. BTC closed in green for the fourth consecutive month. According to the analysts, the short-term trading channel is between $27,000 &#8211; $29,200. [B]ut we are confident that we will be over $30k in no time. Our thesis solidifies the longer we&#8217;re above the highly active $28 &#8211; $28.2k level. Notice the large horizontal bar. All Eyes On The Fed Key to the price action in the coming weeks may be the FOMC meeting tomorrow, Wednesday, and the subsequent press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The market expects a final hike of 25 basis points. This will put the U.S. benchmark interest rate at the same level as before the financial crisis in 2007. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Crashing, But Why Are Transactions At New All-Time Highs However, the decision is likely to be priced in already. More important will be the FOMC press conference at 2:30 pm EST, when Powell will give his remarks for the coming months. The market will be hoping for a comment from Powell that this was the last rate hike and that the first rate cuts will come later this year (very unlikely). The focus will also be on Powell&#8217;s comments on the banking crisis and how the credit crunch is intensifying. Most likely, Powell will play both sides, as he did at the March FOMC meeting. Comments such as &#8220;inflation is not quite where we want it to be,&#8221; &#8220;monitoring developments in the banking sector,&#8221; and &#8220;data dependence&#8221; are virtually guaranteed. On the bullish side, Powell could signal a pause in June and leave a door open for rate hikes if data grants it. Lol &#8230; volatile day coming tomorrow, and perhaps a decisive trend setter for the coming weeks. The start of a new #Bitcoin rally? https://t.co/Dd8FWOjsDa &#8212; Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) May 2, 2023 At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $28,100, below the mid-range after rejecting at the range high again. Until the FOMC decision, it seems rather unlikely that BTC will make a major move unless there is another short or long squeeze due to the madness in the futures market. A recapture of the upper range would be a bullish sign going into the FOMC. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView,com]]></description>
