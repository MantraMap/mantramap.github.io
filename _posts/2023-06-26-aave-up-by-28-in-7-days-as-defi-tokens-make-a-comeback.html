The individual purchased 182,152 AAVE &#8211; worth $13.2 million at the time &#8211; within a span of 5 hours.  Looking at data from CoinMarketCap, Lookonchain concluded that this massive whale activity coincided with the period in which AAVE&#8217;s surge in market value began yesterday.  As of this morning, the blockchain data platform also reported that the whale “0x5a80”  had acquired a total of 257,147 AAVE tokens &#8211; valued then at $17.2 million &#8211; in the last 24 hours. Before halting their buying spree, whale “0x5a80” is believed to hold an estimate of 474,579 AAVE tokens &#8211; valued at $31.8 million. However, since whale “0x5a80” stopped accumulating AAVE, the token’s market price has been on a nosedive, losing nearly 13% of its value in the last 8 hours.  That said, several AAVE investors are likely to be on the watch for the actions of the whale “0x5a80” over the next few days, as it may be pivotal to the token’s future price movements.
