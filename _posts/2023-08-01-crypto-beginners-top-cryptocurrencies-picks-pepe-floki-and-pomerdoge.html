Pepe (PEPE): A Fun Meme-Coin 
<p>Pepe (PEPE) was one of the top gainers in the meme coin market, offering early investors enormous gains in late June and early July. Given that the Pepe coin was created with no intrinsic value, this performance has been noteworthy. </p>
<p>The Pepe coin price currently sits at $0.000001336 with a market cap of $523M, down 1.23% overnight. However, the Pepe technical analysis displays a bullish picture. In fact, all moving averages are showing buy signals. </p>
<p>As a result, experts remain bullish on Pepe's long-term growth potential. Thus, forecast a jump to $0.00000179 for Pepe by December 2023. </p>
Floki (FLOKI): On an Upward Trajectory
<p>Inspired by the viral popularity of Elon Musk's pet Floki, the Floki Inu token quickly gained traction. Like other meme coins, Floki's price dynamics are influenced by market sentiment and social media buzz.</p>
<p>In recent Floki Inu news, Binance Liquid Swap will sunset 31 liquidity pools, including FLOKI/USDT, as of August 4, 2023, at 4:00 a.m. UTC. But, this news did not impact the FlokiInu price, which now sits at $0.00002268 with a market cap of $213M. Hence, an increase of 1.43% in the last 24 hours. </p>
<p>In addition, the Floki trading volume increased by 47.54% in that same time, reaching $15,579,332. With all these bullish signs, experts forecast Floki could surge to $0.00002986 within Q4 of 2023. </p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Excellent Long-Term Growth Potential
<p>Pomerdoge (POMD) presents an enticing proposition for crypto beginners who want to combine gaming and earning. The project combines P2E mechanics with NFTs to create an immersive and rewarding gaming experience. Players can build up their characters, trade in-game items in the Pomerplace, and participate in exciting arena battles. </p>
<p>One of the standout features of the project is the promise to reward presale investors with a percentage of the revenue generated from the game. This unique revenue-sharing model allows investors to earn rewards proportionately to their tokens, adding a lucrative element to the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Moreover, to deliver a memorable and valuable gaming experience, Pomerdoge has curated a collection of 7,777 exclusive NFTs. Each NFT will be priced at 0.2 ETH, unlocking a world of possibilities for their owners. Nevertheless, the project has kept the benefits of owning these NFTs closely guarded until closer to the launch. </p>
<p>To participate in the acquisition of these exclusive NFTs, investors must hold POMD tokens. Currently, POMD has a presale price of only $0.007. But, this price will not be this low for too long as the presale is in Phase One. Many experts are forecasting that it will surge by 17x before it finishes. With all these features, POMD may leave Pepe and Floki in the dust.</p>
