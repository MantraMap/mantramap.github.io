The crypto market is in another full recovery mode and bitcoin has since crossed the elusive $17,000 price level. However, while the largest digital assets in the space are seeing a lot of green, one underdog is taking the space by storm. GALA is right at the top of the list of gainers for the past 24 hours, surpassing second-place Zilliqa (ZIL) by a considerable margin. Why Is GALA Pumping So Much? In the early hours of Monday, Gala Games took to Twitter to announce a new partnership. The blockchain gaming company which had been working on its film projects revealed that it had gotten movie stars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Mark Wahlberg to star in its film. But this was not the only bullish development of the company.

Furthermore, Gala Games also put another use case where QR codes could pop up to claim an item while viewers were watching a movie on a streaming platform such as Netflix. “That item has been selling on OpenSea so why wouldn’t you at least take a look?” the announcement said. The GALA token fits into all of this by being the gas token of Gala Film, which is the blockchain that powers the film arm. These items from the movies are not limited to Gala users, so individuals who want to claim items from the scanned QR codes will need to purchase GALA tokens to use as gas fees; therefore increasing the demand for the cryptocurrency.
