<p>Following an impressive performance last week, Bitcoin started the new week on a strong note, with the largest crypto asset globally maintaining its position above the $30K threshold. In the past seven days, Bitcoin surged by over 17%, tapping a one-year high of $31,397 and making it the best performing week since mid-march. </p>



<p>This strength has primarily been attributed to recent bitcoin ETF applications led by <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-investors-sentiment-for-crypto-surges-following-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-filing/">BlackRock</a> and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Valkyrie</a>, which coincided with a mini-bull market that kicked off earlier this year. This surge has also prompted speculation about the future trajectory of Bitcoin and whether it has reached its bottom.</p>



<p>On Sunday, Dan Lim, a verified analyst for onchain analytics firm Cryptoquant, shared his thoughts on Bitcoin&#8217;s current behaviour. The pundit highlighted that the substantial surge of Bitcoin since the start of 2023 has propelled the MVRV indicator, which gauges the present value of Bitcoin, to reach 1.51, surpassing the undervaluation range of 1.0. According to him, this suggests a potential shift in the market dynamics for Bitcoin&#8217;s future direction.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;In the past, when MVRV broke strongly above 1.0 at the bottom of a bear market and continued to rise for several months, there was no case where Bitcoin bottomed out again</em>,&#8221; said Lim.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sdQLjQuTtZ2BgPlJgv-Qt_5jWaV3aswEvLLbhNnpfwL6_KxHCrFuaTwN3AZiQ32oFCbN8I8_VW-q0pFwPKYXBle4swCriqpuwB8jzuwC3KwkI_0-ODVnBjC8Pg_o5ZOuayavGJPTVzG2tyZblV4MZg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Lim further highlighted the rise in Bitcoin dominance and the overall market, which often occurs at the beginning of a bull market. Based on these observations, Lim believed there might be only a limited time remaining in 2023 or the beginning of 2024 to make stable investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>He further acknowledged <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-risks-crashing-to-20000-amid-blackrock-spot-btc-etf-filing-warns-bloomberg-analyst/">concerns</a> about a potential recession and uncertainties surrounding Fed policies. However, contrary to many&#8217;s belief that Bitcoin could slump in the face of a recession, Lim provided a different perspective. He suggested that the current moment could present an opportune time to consider buying Bitcoin, noting that once the market uncertainties are resolved, it might as well mark the end of the ongoing bull run, opening a window for a potential sell-off.</p>



<p>Lim&#8217;s insights remain significant, especially in light of other key Bitcoin indicators turning green, which further supports the notion of an imminent bull run. On Monday, Glassnode reported that following the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, there has been a consistent decline in the percentage of Bitcoin held within Exchange addresses. This figure has reached a current value of 11.7%, equivalent to 2.27 million BTC.</p>



<p>Importantly, this marks the lowest recorded level since December 21, 2017. The decline in Bitcoin holdings on exchanges indicates a potential decrease in selling pressure and a shift towards long-term investment strategies, which have historically been good for the price.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $30,322 after a 0.17% drop in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-counsel-gives-strong-argument-about-xrp-as-landmark-lawsuit-nears-end/">Stuart Alderoty</a>, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, voiced his opinions about the timing of the lawsuit and the company&#8217;s dedication to defending the case in December 2020, when Ripple Labs was sued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) right before Christmas. Ripple made it clear that they were battling not only for themselves but also for the whole crypto industry in the United States, despite the industry&#8217;s early scepticism.</p>



<p>Alderoty said: <em>“We said from day one that we were going to defend this case not only on our own behalf, but we were going to defend this case on behalf of the entire crypto industry in the United States. […] Everyone understands how important this fight is.”</em></p>



<p>As the case drags on, Alderoty feels that Ripple’s position has been validated and that others broadly supported and believed in their commitment to fighting the case. It has been acknowledged that Ripple&#8217;s determination to stand up to the SEC represents a significant victory for the whole cryptocurrency sector.</p>



<p>Mr. Alderoty conceded that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-moon-time-ripple-eyes-upper-hand-in-sec-lawsuit-as-ceo-garlinghouse-sheds-light-on-case-outcome/">Ripple</a> benefited in certain ways by being sued by the SEC at that specific time. Others in the sector who are just starting to deal with litigation from the SEC are finding inspiration in Ripple&#8217;s defences and story as they draw closer to the conclusion of their legal journey.</p>



<p><em>“And in many ways, Ripple in a perverse way, we&#8217;ve actually been benefited by the SEC suing us when they did because we&#8217;re at the end of our journey and others at the beginning of their litigation journey with the SEC,”</em> Alderoty said.</p>



<p>To some extent, Ripple&#8217;s experiences have prepared the ground and given those in a similar circumstance a blueprint.</p>



<p>Alderoty added: <em>“But I think if you look at the defenses and the narrative around what some of the actors who are now on the wrong side with the SEC, they are reading from the Ripple playbook and that is perfectly fine with us.”</em></p>



<p>The remarks follow the much-anticipated publication of the Hinman documents. The documents associated with the 2018 Hinman speech, which provided guidelines for deciding whether a token qualifies as a security, were recently unsealed. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated days after the release that he thinks the SEC&#8217;s activities show a deliberate effort to exercise control through enforcement.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse emphasized that there is still more work to achieve regulatory clarity for the industry even though the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple is about to conclude. Alderoty’s comments, therefore, highlight both the frustrations and the revelations the team at Ripple have been through the past years in the lawsuit with the SEC.</p>

<ul>
<li>Michael Saylor has given his prediction on the ripple effect of the recent SEC onslaught on the digital asset market.</li>



<li>Saylor tips the BTC market as the biggest beneficiary, as a Bitcoin-focused industry may be triggered.</li>



<li>Digital asset enthusiasts slam Saylor over “<em>greedy” </em>and “<em>insensitive” </em>views at a time when altcoins are in distress.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) market share currently stands at 50.1%, recording a 9% increase this year after a tough 2022 showing its strength as the king asset against all odds.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor has noted that the cryptocurrency market could soon become BTC dominated and centred following the regulatory crackdown on altcoins. Speaking at a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/AjX4twBYBzA">interview</a> with Bloomberg, he said that things could play in BTC’s favour leading to a surging price.</p>



<p>“<em>The SEC’s view is that crypto exchanges should trade and hold pure digital commodities like Bitcoin and so, the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a Bitcoin-focused industry with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen proof-of-work tokens,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>His arguments were based on the principle behind the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crackdown on the sector. The SEC has hinted that many cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities, with Gary Gensler explicitly exempting Bitcoin from that category. Last week, the Commission slapped Coinbase with a lawsuit alleging that the exchange offers services to unregistered securities, which is risky to investors.</p>



<p>Saylor stated that authorities “<em>do not see a legitimate path for cryptocurrencies, and they don’t have love for stablecoins, crypto tokens or crypto-based derivatives.” </em>He noted that BTC would experience a surge 10 times its current value. He further added that the BTC dominance would increase to 80% of the entire market from its current 48%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-critics-smack-saylor-s-views"><strong>Critics smack Saylor’s views</strong></h2>



<p>While Saylor may have his reasons for predicting a Bitcoin-dominated market, crypto enthusiasts and the larger altcoin community have criticized the BTC bulls, with some describing his view as “<em>insensitive.” </em>Anthony Sassano, the host of the Daily Gwei, <a href="https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1666245884626239488?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">expressed</a> his displeasure at BTC bulls like Saylor, happy to see the recent woes on altcoins.</p>



<p>“<em>Incredibly embarrassing to see how many Bitcoiners who self-identify as &#8220;cypherpunks&#8221; are absolutely salivating at the fact that the SEC is going after Coinbase.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Others like the management team of MetaMask, have stated that the entire crypto ecosystem has a “<em>multichain” </em>future because blockchains serve various purposes, and only one dominant coin may not meet the numerous use cases.</p>

<ul>
<li>Market indicators like the futures market, miners&#8217; balance, and institutional demand predict an uphill run for digital assets.</li>



<li>Top assets continue to rally on the back of BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF application for five consecutive days posting surges up to 20%.</li>



<li>As the market awaits the SEC&#8217;s approval of the first Bitcoin ETF, analysts and market executives suggest that we are in the “<em>great accumulation” </em>phase of acquiring BTC.</li>
</ul>



<p>After a brilliant run in the first quarter, the cryptocurrency market recorded its first loss in May, with a 6.9% decline due to uneasy regulation and uncertainty in interest rate hikes.</p>



<p>Major cryptocurrencies are getting out of the woods after recording surging values this week, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting new points not seen in 12 months. Experts suggest that digital assets could still continue their rally due to increased market activity and other indicators.</p>



<p>The surge in mining stocks is a factor that points to a healthy market. A bearish market always leads to plunging mining stocks leaving miners <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-miners-think-outside-the-box-to-survive-crypto-winter-as-top-firms-look-beyond-web3/">scrambling</a> for gains to stay afloat. Bit Digital recorded 77% in its stock following its expansion plans in Europe as well as TeraWulf, which also saw similar growth.</p>



<p>The profitability of BTC mining grew following the sharp popularity of Ordinals on the network. BTC miners generated $916.6 million in May, a 13.7% increase from April. As noted, increased transaction volume led to a boost in gas fees across many networks.</p>



<p>The BTC option market is another surging criterion analysts have relied on to speculate on the price action. The options market recorded trades worth $3.3 billion on June 22, its highest level in the past three months. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vc-and-wall-street-funds-hit-the-market"><strong>VC and Wall Street funds hit the market</strong></h2>



<p>Although observers have noted an increase in almost every market activity, including non-fungible tokens and other decentralized applications, the leading factor in this uphill run has been the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shoots-up-with-30000-in-sight-following-fresh-wave-of-spot-etf-applications/">thirst</a> for “<em>big money”</em> in virtual assets. </p>



<p>Venture Capital investments in the market topped $1 billion for the first time since Sept 2022 and fell significantly lower after the collapse of FTX. VC interest increased by 34% in April, marking the third consecutive rise after a strong showing in Q1 2023. </p>



<p>This past week has ushered in a new drive of institutional investors in cryptocurrency products, with many coming from Wall Street. Following BlackRock&#8217;s application for a spot BTC application, the floodgates for more applications were opened. Several firms, including WisdomTree and Invesco, have made similar applications alongside top bank officials hailing the merger of digital assets and traditional finance.</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sees-surging-adoption-in-the-u-s-fueling-super-bullish-ecosystem-growth-for-ada/">Cardano’s ADA</a> is one of the biggest gainers in the top ten of the crypto market this week. This comes during a price increase of more than 8% from last week despite being down almost 2% in 24 hours. Only <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-could-soar-10x-to-hit-300000-reckons-xrp-holders-lawyer-heres-how/">Bitcoin</a> gained more over the past week in the top ten, with an impressive 13% gain.</p>



<p>Near the overhead resistance level, the ADA/USDT pair has been trading in a constrained range. This suggests that both bulls and bears are unsure of the path forward. Meanwhile, SundaeSwap, one of the most well-known DEXes on Cardano, just crossed the milestone of 600,000 ADA. In total, there are now 1,289,818 Staked Addresses, according to data from Adaverse.</p>



<p>Several new developments have come to the Cardano ecosystem in recent weeks, supporting the price rally and signalling increased adoption.</p>



<p>For instance, Lace, the lightweight Cardano wallet for ADA and web3, released its v.1.2 updates with expanded browser support, enhancing how users can organize their NFTs, improving privacy choices and enhancing speed. At the same time, the Adrestia team focuses on improving the congruity of node v.8.1.1. with the Cardano wallet, database layer improvements, and introducing the capability to delegate functions of a multi-signature wallet.</p>



<p>Cardano’s smart contract language Plutus also sees impressive adaption, adding over 1,000 smart contracts since the beginning of 2023.</p>



<p>The Plutus Tools team achieved significant milestones, which include finalizing the Marconi GetUtxoFromAddress and GetTokenBurnEvent indexers for the Sidechain Tribe. They also conducted a thorough comparison between the GetTokenBurnEvent indexer result and Cardano-db-sync. Additionally, they carefully changed the JSON-RPC request and response for the Marconi-sidechain to follow the API definition. To improve functionality, they also added an AssetId filter to the CLI of the Marconi-sidechain.</p>



<p>The Hydra team performed research and testing in Basho to enhance a head&#8217;s performance on the mainnet. They addressed bugs and issues to prepare for the release of version 0.11.0, including various changes and fixes. The Mithril team worked on bug fixes and updates while concentrating on the signer deployment methodology for SPOs and developing a stress test tool for evaluating the aggregator. Discussions on creating the first Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) framework, which aims to encourage participatory governance within the Cardano ecosystem by incorporating community feedback, went on in Voltaire.</p>



<p>According to EssentialCardano.io, there are now 130 launched projects, with almost 1,300 still building, an impressive 8.44 million native tokens and close to 70 million transactions in the Cardano network.</p>



<p>Going by data from Artemis, at present, over 66,000 daily active addresses participate on Cardano with 77,700 daily transactions and 156 million in Total Value Locked (TVL). Total Value Locked measures the entire value of assets locked or held within a specific protocol, platform, or smart contract frequently used in the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) field. A DeFi platform&#8217;s overall activity and popularity are frequently gauged using TVL. </p>

<p>In a worrying development, hundreds of users have recently fallen victim to phishing scams involving NFT airdrops on the Polygon network, resulting in a shocking loss of over $1.2 million.</p>



<p>On June 23, Scam Sniffer, an onchain anti-scam crypto platform, disclosed concerning details about this scam, warning that as the incident unfolds, more victims are being added to the list.</p>



<p>At the time of Scam Sniffer&#8217;s investigation, scammers had orchestrated approximately 1,354 fraudulent NFTs on the Polygon network, deceptively mimicking legitimate airdrops from well-known projects like RocketPool, ApeCoin, Polygon, Uniswap, and Aave.</p>



<p>Unsuspecting users who received these airdropped NFTs were enticed into visiting websites associated with Inferno Drainer, one of the &#8220;Scam As a Service&#8221; providers responsible for stealing $13 million in recent months. The malicious NFTs were then distributed to an astonishing 530,000 wallets, causing 329 victims to suffer a cumulative loss of $1.25 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the firm, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-scams-will-only-get-worse-with-ai-cardanos-charles-hoskinson-warns/">scammers</a> executed their scheme by transferring malicious NFTs, such as ApeCoin Airdrop NFTs, to their targets using batch transfer. Recipients would open their portfolio trackers or wallets only to discover seemingly harmless NFTs. However, upon clicking on these NFTs, they were redirected to malicious websites. Tragically, victims unknowingly signed malicious signatures during the airdrop claiming process, resulting in the theft of their assets.</p>



<p>By scrutinizing the addresses linked to the airdropped NFTs received by victims, Scam Sniffer further uncovered numerous NFTs exhibiting similar patterns, impersonating airdrops from projects like RocketPool, ApeCoin, Arbitrum, Uniswap, Ethereum, Aave, ChainLink, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of reporting, data from Dune analytics showed that in total, the scammers have so far created 1,531 malicious NFTs, targeting a massive 606,414 wallets and stealing 1.29 million, with all the malicious links leading victims to websites associated with Inferno Drainer.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the scammers have executed the airdrop scam with relatively low gas costs. Analysis of the on-chain data revealed that the total gas expenditure for airdropping to the targeted addresses amounted to only $17,827.</p>



<p>That said, as the crypto landscape continues to evolve, phishing scams targeting NFT enthusiasts have been on the rise, highlighting the immediate necessity for heightened vigilance and enhanced security measures within the cryptocurrency community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/austrian-police-chief-says-investigations-by-indian-agencies-reduced-crypto-scams/">social engineering</a> has emerged as a major factor in these attacks, with scammers employing tactics to manipulate users and extract their personal information, passwords, or seed phrases. Another method attackers utilise is the lure of visiting a website that prompts users to connect their wallets. Unfortunately, if users unknowingly approve the transaction, their funds disappear without any trace, just like the case at hand.</p>

<p>As the lawsuit between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple drags on, lawyer John Deaton has found himself again at the centre of a heated debate surrounding the classification of XRP as a security.</p>



<p>It all started on Friday, June 23, when lawyer and crypto enthusiast Bill Hogan posed the question, <em>&#8220;Does the SEC have evidence from even a single actual holder of XRP that he or she bought XRP expecting a profit from Ripple&#8217;s efforts?&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Responding, Jesse Haynes, founder of equity crowdfunding firm SeedStarter, shared his perspective, stating that he had purchased <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">XRP</a> several years ago with the belief that Ripple would develop its utility and acknowledged that many individuals shared similar expectations. He further revealed that he had received numerous messages from individuals who admitted to purchasing XRP without conducting prior research.</p>



<p>Pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton concurred with Haynes&#8217; assertion stating that through his communication with over 10,000 XRP Holders, he had found that most first-time XRP buyers (over 52%) were unaware of Ripple as a company.</p>



<p>According to him, while they may have recognized the name, Ripple, they were unaware that it was a company selling software to banks at the time of their initial acquisition. <em>&#8220;A lot of people get surprised by this fact, and some claim they don&#8217;t believe it, but I believe it,&#8221;</em> said Deaton.</p>



<p>Further, Deaton acknowledged their presence when asked about investors who were aware of Ripple&#8217;s involvement, including XRPL developers who bought XRP without knowledge of the company. He, however, laid out the grounds for establishing whether XRP was a security at the time. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;If Ripple had direct contact with you and sold you XRP, there is a valid argument that the Howey test was met because in that scenario, 1) you gave money to Ripple for XRP; 2) you entered into a common enterprise with Ripple (through vertical commonality); and 3) you were sitting back expecting profits on your XRP derived by the talents and efforts of its CTO, management team, board of directors, and Ripple, the company,&#8221; </em><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1672398174860787715">added</a> Deaton.</p>



<p>Deaton further emphasized that purchasing XRP indirectly from Ripple or acquiring it for non-investment purposes would present different circumstances. He clarified that even if Ripple sold an investment contract utilizing XRP as the underlying asset, it would not categorize XRP itself as a security, nor would it affect the security status of personal XRP holdings.</p>



<p>Deaton, representing tens of thousands of XRP holders in the suit as amicus curiae, has vehemently opposed SEC&#8217;s assertion that XRP is a security and its perceived regulatory overreach on the crypto sector. Recently, the &#8220;Crypto Law Us&#8221; founder slammed the regulator <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1671875274571411457">suggesting</a> that the recent lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase were to allow the Wall Streeters to catch up. </p>

<p>Authorities in Switzerland have reportedly frozen crypto assets tied to former Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon and other top figures within the cornered company.</p>



<p>Kwon, who was recently sentenced to four months in a Montenegrin prison, stored the assets in Swiss-based digital asset bank Sygnum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-troubles-for-do-kwon"><strong>More Troubles For Do Kwon</strong></h2>



<p>Problems for Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon keep piling up.</p>



<p>According to a recent report from South Korean publication <em>Digital Asset</em>, Swiss authorities froze $26 million worth of crypto assets reportedly belonging to Kwon, Terraform Labs, Chang-joon Han (former CEO of Chai Corporation), and Nicholas Platias (who worked as a head of the TFL research team). The news outlet indicates that these authorities were following requests from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. federal prosecutors of New York.</p>



<p>Prosecutors in South Korea and the United States previously claimed that Kwon transferred 10,000 BTC to a Swiss bank, later identified as Sygnum. Moreover, the SEC stated that the former cryptocurrency mogul allegedly cashed out more than $100 million in bitcoin within months after the catastrophic collapse of Terraform Labs&#8217; algorithmic stablecoin, UST, via the services of the said Swiss bank.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do Kwon S</strong><strong>lapped With A 4-Month Prison Sentence</strong></h2>



<p>Just last week, a Basic Court in Montenegro’s capital Podgorica <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-do-kwon-found-guilty-of-passport-forgery-in-montenegro-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/">sentenced </a>Kwon and his associate Chang-joon Han to four months in jail after they were found guilty of document forgery. The pair has been in custody since March, when they were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">apprehended </a>in Montenegro while trying to flee to Dubai.</p>



<p>After their arrest, authorities seized fake documents, including two Costa Rican passports, two Belgian passports, and two identity cards.</p>



<p>Leading up to Kwon&#8217;s detention in Montenegro, the former executive <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-do-kwon-apologizes-to-luna-victims-insists-he-is-not-on-the-run/">claimed </a>he was &#8220;not on the run,&#8221; even as South Korean authorities commenced a global search for him, including requesting Interpol for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/lunas-do-kwon-bags-a-red-notice-from-interpol-in-bid-to-hasten-his-arrest/">red notice</a>. Authorities in both South Korea and the U.S. have requested his extradition to face criminal charges related to the implosion of the multi-billion-dollar Terra empire in May 2022, which resulted in several related bankruptcies and substantial loss of market capitalization.</p>

<p>The attorney representing XRP holders, John E Deaton, has posed a question to his Twitter followers regarding the immense potential of bitcoin.</p>



<p>BTC is currently trading hands at $30,360.03, and Deaton suggested the possibility of the flagship cryptocurrency rallying to an impressive $300,000. This would represent a staggering tenfold increase from its present price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-could-10x-from-here"><strong>Bitcoin Could ‘10X’ From Here</strong></h2>



<p>In a June 25 <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1672714757533585408">tweet</a>, John Deaton asked his over 276,000 followers whether they think the market capitalization of Bitcoin could one day reach half that of gold. Deaton suggested that if this happened, the price of the dominant cryptocurrency may absolutely surge to $300,000 — which would be ten times higher than its current valuation.</p>



<p>By predicting Bitcoin might attain half of the precious metal’s market cap, the CryptoLaw founder sought to highlight his belief that the current market price is an attractive entry point for long-term investors.</p>



<p>Deaton also drew attention to an exciting development, as the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, Larry Fink, made a U-turn regarding Bitcoin. According to Fink, more than 600,000 customer inquiries about BTC were made on his company’s official website. This, per Deaton, is an important statistic that bolsters his perspective on Bitcoin.</p>



<p>BTC recently achieved a year-to-date high as investors’ excitement over BlackRock applying for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) fueled dreams of a new bull market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BlackRock, Other Spot BTC ETF Filings Spark Bullish Outlook</strong></h2>



<p>The crypto market had been going through a crisis of confidence following the implosion of the FTX crypto exchange last November, but recent filings for spot bitcoin ETFs have helped energize cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">touched the $31,000 level</a> recently amid increasing U.S. regulatory scrutiny, as well as inflation and other macroeconomic concerns.</p>



<p>The world&#8217;s biggest asset manager BlackRock on June 15, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">applied </a>to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin ETF — something that the top American financial regulator is yet to greenlight.</p>



<p>Several other big-name financial firms, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">WisdomTree, Invesco</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Valkyrie Investments</a>, among others, also moved to lodge similar applications for their spot bitcoin ETFs.</p>



<p>The road toward a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has been long. As such, crypto pundits now believe that if the SEC successfully approves BlackRock’s, or the other newly-submitted ETF applications, it would be a seminal moment in the history of crypto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ripples-Chief-Engineer-Calls-It-Quits-—-Will-His-Shocking-Departure-Upend-XRPs-Recovery.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Ripple’s Chief Engineer Calls It Quits — Will His Shocking Departure Upend XRP’s Recovery?" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ripples-Chief-Engineer-Calls-It-Quits-—-Will-His-Shocking-Departure-Upend-XRPs-Recovery.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ripples-Chief-Engineer-Calls-It-Quits-—-Will-His-Shocking-Departure-Upend-XRPs-Recovery-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ripples-Chief-Engineer-Calls-It-Quits-—-Will-His-Shocking-Departure-Upend-XRPs-Recovery-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ripples-Chief-Engineer-Calls-It-Quits-—-Will-His-Shocking-Departure-Upend-XRPs-Recovery-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>The rumour mill was hard at work again when word spread online that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-joins-the-ranks-of-licensed-payment-institutions-in-singapore-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-its-conclusion/">Ripple</a> was preparing a significant buyback of its circulating supply of XRP coins. This action is considered by those that purport the idea as an effort to address concerns about overstock and price volatility while enhancing the usefulness and value of XRP.</p>



<p>The would-be buyback program is said to stabilize prices, draw institutional investors, and positively affect the Ripple ecosystem. Additionally, it might increase transaction efficiency and liquidity on RippleNet, the company&#8217;s worldwide payment network. According to proponents, the buyback announcement demonstrates Ripple&#8217;s faith in XRP&#8217;s future and its capacity to overcome regulatory obstacles.</p>



<p>If real, the buyback would have been large-scale, with 10 Billion XRP or 10% of the total token supply at a current market value of USD 4.8 Billion at press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>Prominent crypto lawyer John Deaton wasted no time jumping to Twitter to state: <em>“I don’t believe Ripple is buying back 10B XRP until I hear it from Ripple.”</em></p>



<p>And Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, also known on Twitter under the moniker Joel Katz, weighed in, stating that: <em>“We do sometimes buy XRP. But I don&#8217;t know of anything specific that this could be referring to. And there&#8217;s no official source mentioned.”</em></p>



<p>The rumours about a buyback have been making their way around social media for some time now but have gained traction with a recent blog post in CryptoAlert, which crypto Twitter took and ran with. However, it is no surprise that Ripple trades in XRP; after all, Ripple holds approximately 50 Billion XRP tokens in its Escrow.</p>



<p>In theory, by limiting the number of tokens in circulation, a buyback could help control the supply of XRP, potentially raising its value through more scarcity. A buyback also increases liquidity, facilitating users&#8217; buying and selling of XRP and encouraging wider adoption.</p>



<p>Given that Ripple has such large amounts of XRP, it begs the question of why Ripple would buy more XRP at this point, especially given the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-moon-time-ripple-eyes-upper-hand-in-sec-lawsuit-as-ceo-garlinghouse-sheds-light-on-case-outcome/">ongoing lawsuit</a> and the huge cost Ripple has with the litigation.</p>



<p>On where the money for such a large acquisition would come from, Bill Morgan, an Australian crypto lawyer, said: <em>“Where are they obtaining the $5 Billion to buy it at its current price. Who would lend Ripple the funds, given the lawsuit, to buy back a token under a litigation cloud &#8211; unless there is another source of funding such as an IPO.”</em></p>



<p>The XRP community, meanwhile was divided, with some spreading the rumors while others urged for calm and caution. Popular YouTuber Crypto Eri said: <em>“Is it time we start to research before retweeting?”</em></p>



<p>This, of course, underlines the increasing role that social media plays in the crypto economy and urges caution, bringing us to the all-important phrase &#8220;do your own research&#8221;.</p>

<p>Ethereum (ETH) remains the king of decentralized finance (DeFi) and looks set to increase its dominance as most altcoins fight a potential “<em>securities” </em>tag by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Ethereum’s dominance among altcoins has grown in recent years using several metrics. The market share of ETH was 18% trailing only Bitcoin (BTC) in 2020 but has increased to 20% this year amid strong competition. Among altcoins, ETH is top with a market share of 40.6% leaving its closed rival BNB at 7.2%.</p>



<p>The network has remained the leader in decentralized applications and smart contracts attracting big-name developers and startups since its inception. In terms of total value locked, Ethereum has a TVL of $24.6 billion while being followed by Tron and BNB chain with $5.4 billion and $3.3 billion respectively. ETH dominates the TVL market share with a whopping 58%.</p>



<p>A major reason for Ethereum’s dominance is the non-fungible token (NFT) market. Despite pressure from Solana and Polygon, Ethereum continues to outclass its competitors. Solana and other networks boast of cheaper gas fees to mint NFTs and have gained a considerable market share in recent months but the sale volume on Ethereum puts it at an advantage. According to data from CryptoSlam, NFT sales on Ethereum hit $380 million in the last 30 days while Polygon, BNB, and Solana pulled a cumulative sale of $93 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developers-pick-ethereum-before-others"><strong>Developers pick Ethereum before others</strong></h2>



<p>Aside from NFTs, Ethereum has the most developers among others leading to stronger and widely accepted technology. The number of active developers on Ethereum stands above 1,870, while competitors like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Solana have 752, 511, and 383, respectively.</p>



<p>Ethereum has also been hailed as being more decentralized than other networks although it faced <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-becoming-highly-centralized-after-transition-to-proof-of-stake-pundits-warn/">criticism</a> after centralized exchanges dominated staking on the network due to the high threshold. The blockchain now has over 700,000 validators with Lido and Coinbase controlling 32% and 9.6% respectively.</p>



<p>The derivatives market remains key for Ethereum’s growth with institutional investors more attracted to the asset than its rivals. ETH cash-settled futures was added to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a feat only Bitcoin has attained. ETH futures aggregated interest is above $5.4 billion, while BNB and Solana remain at $380 million and 178 million respectively. Many observers around the community have tips for Ethereum to remain on top of the altcoin market except rivals described as the “<em>Eth killers” </em>make significant network upgrades. </p>

<ul>
<li>Gemini’s co-founder Cameron Winklevoss believes the market is experiencing a great accumulation of Bitcoin between retail and institutional investors.</li>



<li>The surge in the adoption of digital assets from institutional players has pushed the market further, leaving many wondering about the next step for regulators and users.</li>



<li>Meanwhile, the Bitcoin fear and greed index stands at greed level 65 following the recent surge.</li>
</ul>



<p>Traditional finance executives are pivoting to digital assets in full force, with many aligning that “<em>the future of banking is cryptocurrencies.” </em>Industry executives share their opinion on what may happen if the current trend remains constant.</p>



<p>The co-founder of Gemini, Cameron Winklevoss, has <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1671525634131066881?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">stated</a> that the “<em>Great Accumulation of Bitcoin” </em>has kicked off between retail investors and financial institutions. He explained that with the recent institutional demand, there would be a struggle to acquire the top asset between both classes of investors. </p>



<p>According to his analogy, buying Bitcoin before the Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) hit the public was akin to getting a slice of a company before the Initial Public Offering adding that “<em>floodgates” </em>to buying BTC are closing fast. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor believes the institutional investors will have the last laugh.</p>



<p>“<em>The window to front-run institutional demand for Bitcoin is closing,” </em>he noted after the launch of the digital asset exchange backed by Wall Street firms, including Fidelity Digital, Citadel Securities, and Schwab. Recent institutional demand has seen the price of Bitcoin soar above $30,000, with bulls setting their sights on a huge run after the asset ticked an 80% growth this year. At press time, BTC exchanges hands at $30,390.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scramble-for-21-million-assets"><strong>The scramble for 21 million assets</strong></h2>



<p>Popular Bitcoin investor Anthony Pompliano in a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/apompliano/status/1671667985260453891?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">interview</a> with CNBC, said that a tug of war is looming between Wall Street and smaller investors, noting that smaller investors may refuse to sell to Wall Street making Bitcoin “<em>highly illiquid” </em>for a period.</p>



<p>“<em>We have institutions and individuals scrambling to try to get their share of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be in existence. The retail investor for 15 years now has a head start and has accumulated all the Bitcoin that’s been mined and put into circulation, but 68% of that hasn’t moved in a year.”</em></p>



<p>He also added that the price will experience a shift with a higher demand because “<em>Bitcoin went from $0 to nearly $1 trillion market cap with almost no institutional participation.”</em></p>



<p>Dylan LeClair, a Bitcoin expert, believes that the price of the asset is “<em>extremely inelastic” </em>but added that no ETF application would be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) until early 2024.</p>

<p>Popular crypto analyst and host of Crypto Capital Venture, Dan Gambardello, has shared insights on the XRP lawsuit&#8217;s potential impact on Cardano (ADA).</p>



<p>In a YouTube video on Monday, June 19, Gambardello discussed the recent adverse reaction of ADA&#8217;s price to the latest regulatory headwinds, including the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-devs-vigorously-dispute-secs-classification-of-ada-as-a-security-as-robinhood-mulls-delisting-coin/">classification of ADA as a security</a> by the SEC in its onslaught against Binance.</p>



<p>He drew a comparison to the Ripple case, stating that a potential settlement for Ripple could be significant for the entire crypto market, possibly marking the bottom of the bear market. Accordingly, he acknowledged that the ongoing XRP lawsuit holds relevance for ADA holders.</p>



<p>Comparing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-at-5-analysts-set-huge-ada-price-expectations-for-2023-as-key-metrics-surge/">ADA&#8217;s price</a> movement to XRP&#8217;s in the past, he highlighted the similarities between the behaviour of the two cryptocurrencies, particularly concerning momentum oscillators and other technical indicators for both cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p><em>“You can see the move for XRP right there, it (oscillator) fell into oversold right and then it kind of just popped up…if we look at ADA now…it just tanked well below the oversold line actually to a historical low. The only two times it&#8217;s really touched that area was March 2020 low and the last bear market low eight is there right now. And so, the similarities though right there on the momentum oscillator very similar as well in terms of these two moves XRP versus ADA,”</em> said Gambardello.</p>



<p>The pundit also emphasized the striking similarities in both cryptocurrencies&#8217; Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating comparable momentum and movement patterns.</p>



<p>Lastly, he highlighted the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence&nbsp;(MACD) indicator for both cryptocurrencies. However, while XRP showcased signs of recovery, with its MACD crossing above the signal line, ADA lagged amid challenging market conditions. Nevertheless, he expressed hope in ADA’s MACD catching up, noting that the indicator turning positive on XRP&nbsp;is “<em>something that we can use to kind of start identifying is Ada going to kind of get closer to being out of this mess.”</em></p>



<p>Overall, the pundit expressed confidence in the rebounding market, stating that “we could be around a year away from really those bull market doors truly being broken.”</p>



<p>In the meantime, however, he anticipated that ADA and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-sec-director-says-judgment-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-to-come-within-days-xrp-to-10/">XRP</a> would continue to exhibit volatility given the current uncertainty surrounding the overall market. He cautioned that the two cryptocurrencies remained susceptible to further price declines.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.49, up 0.27% in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, ADA soared about 2% over the same period and was trading at $0.29.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) continued to hold up strong this week after an impressive surge over the past week. At press time, the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $0.000007862 after surging over 16% in the past seven days.</p>



<p>The strength of Shiba Inu can be attributed to significant ecosystem developments that have reignited the interest and enthusiasm of the Shiba Inu community. On Wednesday, Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, dropped yet another bombshell on the launch of Shibarium, the highly anticipated decentralized ecosystem.</p>



<p>In a telegram chat shared by “Jolt”, a popular <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-outlook-hangs-on-as-shib-network-activity-surges-ahead-of-shibarium-launch/">Shiba Inu</a> fan on Twitter, Kusama reiterated his unwavering dedication to the community, generating waves of excitement among community members as the launch of Shibarium draws near. When asked about updates on the LEASH token, a Shibarium admin received a confident and determined response from Kusama, saying, &#8220;<em>Incoming. All incoming. I&#8217;m not playing around. We finish strong.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Kusama’s assertions came a day after he disclosed yet another significant update on the ecosystem. In a Wednesday blog, he introduced two notable advancements, namely the &#8216;Shibacals&#8217; and the release of Shiba Inu&#8217;s World Paper. As per the blog, the so-called Shibacals will be a service that allows real-world assets to be connected to NFTs. This service aims to provide proof of ownership and will be a part of the upcoming Shibarium ecosystem rollout.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the World Paper was described as a comprehensive guide that explores the various elements of the SHIB ecosystem, including tokens, platforms, products, and services. The paper will also outline the long-term plan for achieving a complete decentralization of Shiba Inu. Kusama noted that the World Paper would be revealed alongside the mainnet launch of Shibarium.</p>



<p>These updates come on the back of growing concerns among the Shib community over when Shibarium will launch. For over a year, the Shib Army has been expressing concerns about the lack of clarity surrounding Shibarium&#8217;s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">launch</a> date, giving room for various speculations and FUD in the community. However, mid-last month, Lucie, a Shiba Inu marketing team member, hinted at the Layer 2 protocol launching soon.</p>



<p>“<em>It is closer than you expect,</em> and we are speeding the time of releasing it since things are going in a good direction in testing etc.,” said Lucie when asked by a member “, Wen Shibarium?”</p>



<p>That said, it is worth noting that SHIB&#8217;s growth is not occurring in isolation. Other tokens, such as DOGE and PEPE, have equally experienced impressive price thrusts gaining approximately 7% and 68% in the past week, reviving investor interest in meme coins.</p>
