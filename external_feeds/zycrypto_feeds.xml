<p>The United States government has once again moved Bitcoin tied to Silk Road, the now-shuttered darknet marketplace.</p>



<p>Two wallets belonging to the U.S. Justice Department moved over $300 million worth of Bitcoin to two new addresses on Wednesday morning. The transfer was conducted in three different transactions, as <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/bc1qmxjefnuy06v345v6vhwpwt05dztztmx4g3y7wp">shown </a>by on-chain data from Blockchain.com.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-300-million-in-btc"><strong>$300 Million In BTC</strong></h2>



<p>Some of Silk Road’s bitcoins are on the move once again.</p>



<p>Fed-controlled wallets sent a total of 9,825 Bitcoin, equating to approximately $301 million. Wednesday’s transaction follows an even bigger transaction in March when roughly <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1633331891347820544">$1 billion worth of BTC</a> was transferred, a move that prompted a drop across all top cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. authorities have control of BTC that&#8217;s been confiscated from bad actors and occasionally move it around. Previously, they&#8217;ve done so because they plan to sell it — but not all the time.</p>



<p>The latest transfer has stoked investor fears that intense sell pressures could drive down the price of Bitcoin. BTC dipped after the transaction was sent. The premier cryptocurrency was, at the time of publication trading hands for $30,327.04 per coin, a 0.8% 24-hour drop. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Silk Road Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Feds seized more than 50,000 bitcoins in November 2022 from hacker James Zhong, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud over the hack of these digital assets from the Ross Ulbricht-run Silk Road back in 2012.</p>



<p>Ross Ulbricht is the proprietor of the Silk Road online black market, which was used to mostly buy and sell illicit goods such as weapons, drugs, and stolen credit card information and primarily used bitcoin as a payment method before authorities closed it in 2014. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in federal prison back in 2015 in a high-profile case. He’s currently serving a double life sentence plus 40 years without the possibility of parole. </p>



<p>Court filings contained details of related BTC wallets, allowing online sleuths to track these wallet addresses. Feds have been selling the seized BTC bit by bit. After selling the crypto in March, the U.S. authorities said they intended to dump the remaining bitcoin in four more batches throughout 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a much-anticipated release, CoinMarketCap, the renowned cryptocurrency information platform, exposed its &#8220;Unveilling the Crypto Market&#8221; exchange <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/unveiling-the-crypto-market-a-comprehensive-guide-to-exchange-activities-in-h1-2023">report</a> for the initial half of 2023. This comprehensive analysis delves into two prominent categories: centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX), presenting valuable insights into the market dynamics. This report offers a captivating snapshot of the current landscape by scrutinizing the trading volume disparity between CEX and DEX and evaluating the performance of exchange tokens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinmarketcap-centralized-exchange-cex-data-revealed"><strong>CoinMarketCap Centralized Exchange (CEX) Data Revealed</strong></h2>



<p>First, the report looks at the total spot trading volume of the top 20 exchanges in the past four quarters. It is recognised that the trading volume in the first quarter of this year has increased by about 26% compared with the previous quarter. CoinMarketCap believes that there will be such apparent growth. Bitcoin rose 72.1% in the quarter, driven by the asset&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>However, trading volumes slowed significantly in the second quarter, down about 36% quarter-on-quarter. CoinMarketCap says current trading volumes are very similar to market conditions observed during the recovery phase of the FTX crash.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1HGpmyrVPa2ovku8WvEuQQGxO1ZSK8-3P6BC8eBKJ8bYz1e9hnq6GlAeLfBC-Jr_W1MDRfolWgtCh1pFu1llk8yUz_P6v8b559OE6ck1CTjSRIz8DycBbblGZ_I4eZW4jBMO3ZccgfR06Gc1w7vxos8" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Looking at the various exchanges separately, Binance still exhibits dominance on the spot market share and reached nearly 60% in February this year &#8211; which later dropped to about 47%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fjYRItVGxuCPfJo05hbwBO-ZLiA6TPqIIVvv6EQuQdkMZr2xhgyDdpg5-FB0nQvOEwdpyZV2ATV9wRTZHFFd7hPNwxvaBGGUMiQbyeQQbK5YdGV8t5IvZthWPjmMX0y6XhJM65-XNukRvV0yEQ4tV8E" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Among these exchanges, Gate.io has the most trading pairs (Current Number of Markets), followed by Binance. However, regarding the number of cryptocurrencies (Current Number of Coins), Binance shares less spotlight. CoinMarketCap said that this is mainly due to Binance selecting high-quality mainstream coins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6ZBAozSO8Ke6ZaElxH7HtfBdcuzXP1uEHSS5xU7M6_o6CBJOQ8WnWt4IErbrjDfiSX2_AOsgwXOCI-8oWuO42cwAjtJr1myKLyo2pMwiwL2V3Ew33OPTD-f-zsfWMNmv5aIkUYGqz-HCjZhI4g7mgV0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>As for security, Binance ($57 billion), OKX ($10 billion) and Bitfinex ($10 billion) have the highest proof of asset reserves among the disclosed exchanges, with most exchanges holding more than 1,000 bitcoins Coins and stablecoins.</p>



<p>As the figure below highlights, Binance’s reserve assets declined significantly in June. This phenomenon is related to the market triggered by the SEC’s prosecution. The outflow of funds led to a decrease of about 20 billion U.S. dollars in Binance’s reserves.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DC5_1BJu4MQRmyzpWDnBlWTDuzyHjj-K0aA8eIDS24Kvx6--cXo5VBB5xfW1parHYvAwDzTAXMDMKgAUyeUIgC2JEIhqfrGLyfyTukYvvGuJaD4dKmkC_arBNeuMR8jt4ijv6fBDI9DT49FxFBLbSCE" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Although the trading volume of exchanges this year is not particularly outstanding, and the market conditions are relatively deserted, most exchange tokens are flat or rising this year, and only Huobi Token has experienced a significant decline.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OPDO3PUAqRkRi2_EQ1g4MaEZ8tt9ilR00gsTcJ9bgmepRi6K3fobCJsZMf5Nh0Gk4B3Um-UZX6MuTsBaonXdfyD8x08tDVWyV_VbS4bVI8vE8CI9X4CCtcLT-AaDzizh1bDW6f92M7JNQnUewm1ZkdY" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinMarketCap Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Data Revealed</strong></h2>



<p>Following the examination of CEXs, the report brings down the data of DEXs. The trading volume of the top 15 exchanges peaked in March this year. Although the trading volume dropped in the second quarter, the factor maintains stability. Transaction volume in the second quarter was $189 billion, down 24% quarter-over-quarter.</p>



<p>Among these exchanges, Uniswap has the highest proportion of trading volume this year, 57.5%, far exceeding other competitors. It is then followed by Pancakeswap and Curve, with 12.7% and 11.5% respectively.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K5GuMOV8lv_1OhWr5kPYKyqfWqXuss-cz-ZmQYdcTQVgbnevcd8K4cYOlHvtCsrBk9mPptcqEhyYBcjEi8ZBTGt3ApePap3_ckBI1gfw6Oh8IRN63qSx__beHMlcR_ot2yVn4C4n6JLogGEgJNl9ZQY" alt=""/></figure>



<p>If Uniswap is compared with centralized exchanges, its trading volume is equal to Coinbase&#8217;s but still far from Binance&#8217;s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/d9CCzqkzJu0p7yIxbo4albGNhiUiMe1DBHc6qNHFEKr3w8Qne-YMxaI6WImJFKgFgIhQ5xE4nldpKr8X8qiRoWoDGErsuYpifxf6jDvMobYh_lbRRsw9WjVXBYb3eG51LtCCyvO87XTfE_jXjWNWxcY" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Since the beginning of this year, the ratio of DEX trading volume to CEX spot trading volume has gradually increased and is currently about 1:8. CoinMarketCap believes this can be attributed to several factors, including:</p>



<ol>
<li>The latest developments in DEX products.</li>



<li>Regulatory intervention raises concerns about CEXs.</li>



<li>More favourable environment and lower gas costs.</li>



<li>The current market has a higher proportion of cryptocurrency-native participants.</li>
</ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yWU9AAAdPrxQ5Jymt_KnWDcxcMskOz7LaG0HvZ6WM6ZqntiVvVhh5xpTweCCGjwh6z5AdSq2RhrxkDuuArgoJv6X-AwpLIP11FP92oWsq_69Aonw3_wiD5TmfpXiH4Rik4W-WQJxa9EelauJMF1csRA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Finally, Ethereum usage still dominates all blockchains, with about 80% of DEX transaction volume happening on Ethereum and its Layer 2. However, in the second quarter of this year, the DEX transaction volume on the BNB chain also increased, accounting for about 15%</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EBWcmuB8qIChU7LWmuX7hytwQt9cv0xaMam6D5X0-WV3Ko3sXEQGXHOWWPZJSJaLtfRZqB_W6DG48ygE5Vk6Hv3AiM0WbiciRqYnxZKVengyxGv26UhQsj7XpqW5OWCbYY9m5QmMEfOAf82ODXztGFg" alt=""/></figure>

<p>Some metrics on the Bitcoin blockchain appear to reflect a pattern that implies confidence amongst market players. According to data from Glassnode’s on-chain insight, the current level of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/will-bitcoin-reach-120000-by-2024-standard-chartereds-optimistic-btc-outlook-proves-attainable/">Bitcoin’s On-Chain Activity</a> reveals that metrics are approaching levels associated with a re-accumulation period.</p>



<p>As Glassnode explains, the supply held in profit vs in loss has reached equilibrium. This is often synonymous with several month-long &#8216;re-accumulation periods&#8217; in previous times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Find out more in the latest Week On-Chain assessing the current level of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> On-Chain activity, where several metrics are approaching levels associated with a &#39;re-accumulation period&#39;.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447-1f3fc.png" alt="👇🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/WzrxyJz3tJ">https://t.co/WzrxyJz3tJ</a> <a href="https://t.co/Hec1XLqcHH">pic.twitter.com/Hec1XLqcHH</a></p>&mdash; glassnode (@glassnode) <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1679049380303601665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The market is currently consolidating below the $30,000 midpoint, and 75% of the total supply is still in-profit, while 25% is held in loss. Notably, this pattern imitates the same balance recorded when prices reached the midpoints in 2016 and 2019.</p>



<p>The 75:25 balance of supply held in profit:loss is an equilibrium point for the apex cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, higher Profit-to-Loss balances have been recorded on 50% of all trading days, while the remaining 50% was recorded on a lower one.</p>



<p><em>“This equilibrium point has historically taken time for the market to digest and re-consolidate around. Many Bitcoin analysts refer to this as the &#8216;re-accumulation period&#8217;, which tends to straddle the halving event. We can visualize this by looking at the proportion of the Market cap held at an Unrealized Loss. During the primary bear, the market is plunged deep into the red, with investors gradually capitulating out.” &#8211; Glassnode.</em></p>



<p>It bears mentioning that as the market forms and rallies off the lows, profitability levels have risen sharply to reach levels aligning with current market patterns. In the past, re-accumulation periods have been characterized by a lack of macro market direction which tends to be volatile and trades sideways for months.</p>



<p><em>“With the market back at this equilibrium point, it remains to be seen if a similarly lengthy and choppy process is needed to overcome it. On-chain activity for Bitcoin is cooling down somewhat, driven mostly by a decline in Inscription activity. Monetary transfer volumes, however are starting to pick up, displaying positive momentum often associated with growing liquidity and adoption.” Glassnode asserted.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin still struggles to sustain momentum at the $30,000 price level. The leading cryptocurrency has recorded a mild price decline over the last 7 days. Bitcoin now trades at a press time price of $30,356, not long after hitting a high of $30,959 a day ago.</p>

<p>John E. Deaton, the well-known crypto lawyer who represents over <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-joining-75000-xrp-holders-against-the-sec-does-not-affect-potential-recovery-for-xrp-holders/">76,000 XRP holders</a> in the lawsuit of the SEC against Ripple, went to Twitter recently to clarify his views on why XRP is not a security, drawing on lessons from other recent lawsuits.</p>



<p>He opened his argument by stating: <em>“XRP is not a security. Just as beavers, orange groves, whiskey, chinchillas, condos, and Bitcoin are not securities. All of these assets may have been once marketed, packaged, offered, and sold as an investment contract, but the asset remained what it always was.”</em></p>



<p>Although BTC was initially offered as an investment contract, that specific sale did not change the cryptocurrency&#8217;s nature from that of a digital commodity.</p>



<p>While many attorneys believe Judge Torres won&#8217;t address XRP or secondary sales, Deaton disagrees. He contended that Judge Torres would have to reject a sizable chunk of the SEC&#8217;s argument on XRP to ignore the underlying asset issue or secondary sales.</p>



<p>Deaton believes that Judge Torres would immediately address the fundamental asset issue and secondary sales in the ongoing lawsuit concerning Ripple, similar to her colleague Judge Castel who presided over the Telegram case in the Southern District of New York. He noted that Judge Castel provided two decisions in the Telegram case that specifically addressed these problems.</p>



<p>In Telegram 1, Judge Castel disagreed with Telegram&#8217;s description of security, pointing out that the security was not just the GRAM token itself but the entire scheme and set of agreements governing its sales and distribution. The Judge extended the scope of GRAM beyond mere alphanumeric code and pointed to the Howey test.</p>



<p>Judge Castel further explained in Telegram 2 that concentrating only on the early buyers and their agreements would overlook the crucial point that the &#8220;security&#8221; covered the entire scheme rather than just specific agreements. By addressing the problem of secondary market transactions, the Judge considered them a component of the broader plan. He emphasized that the GRAM Purchase Agreements and Telegram&#8217;s related understandings and commitments were part of the strategy.</p>



<p>This included the hope and aim that those making the initial purchases would sell GRAM to other people. Judge Castel remarked that the anticipated sale of GRAM through Telegram&#8217;s conduits into the secondary market would probably include American buyers and satisfy the requirements for Morrison’s transactional test.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;Morrison&#8217;s transactional test&#8221; refers to a legal test drawn from the case Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case dealt with how the American securities rules should be applied internationally.</p>



<p>Deaton admits that <em>“some could read Telegram as negative against Ripple because Judge Torres could find that Ripple’s intent was to create a secondary market for XRP, therefore, finding the secondary market was part of the ‘scheme’.”</em></p>



<p>In contrast to XRP, the GRAM token used by Telegram was not classified by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (USGAO) as a &#8220;virtual currency&#8221; in 2014. Furthermore, unlike XRP, FinCEN did not classify GRAM as a &#8220;virtual currency&#8221; in 2015. Additionally, MoneyGram did not use Gram the way it did with XRP, which included filing documentation with the SEC demonstrating XRP&#8217;s use in MoneyGram&#8217;s international business. Deaton highlights the lack of companies like Bailard Inc., which issued ethics declarations stating their intention to solely purchase and trade the three digital currencies BTC, ETH, and XRP, usually recognized by the industry as non-securities. This list does not include GRAM.</p>



<p>Deaton said: <em>“Unlike Telegram, the XRPL was fully functional, and XRP had been traded for 7.5 years openly and publicly. Unlike the GRAM token, SEC staff could own XRP up until 2019.”</em></p>



<p>As far as the SEC is concerned, according to the CryptoLawUs founder, Ripple has been engaged in an ongoing initial coin offering (ICO) for more than ten years. Every sale of XRP, regardless of the seller or circumstances, is regarded as a security by the SEC because of its purported association with “the scheme”.</p>



<p>Deaton feels that the case&#8217;s judge, Judge Torres, must examine the underlying asset and secondary market sales. The court may choose to ignore these concerns and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-crypto-lawyer-sheds-light-on-imminent-judgment-in-sec-case-as-xrp-army-awaits-verdict/">issue a judgment</a>, but doing so would be viewed as judicial activism and would contradict the SEC&#8217;s approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Binance’s founder says challenges with regulators will steel the resolve of the exchange’s employees.</li>



<li>In recent months, the exchange has come under fire over non-compliance issues with regulatory agencies, casting a shadow of doubt over its future.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite the regulatory headwinds against Binance, the exchange’s CEO Changpeng Zhao claims that camaraderie amongst employees is at its zenith as he shares the “secret” for building resilient teams.</p>



<p>On July 10, the embattled CEO took to <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1678277304307404800?s=20">Twitter</a> to reveal the formula for building a hardy team spirit in the face of mounting challenges. According to Zhao, the secret lies in the right amount of “external pressure” designed to forge a resilient culture in the workplace.</p>



<p>He pressed his point home using the analogy of an alien invasion of Earth, noting that “all the issues between the US and China would disappear in a heartbeat.” Zhao noted that fancy team-building dinners and coaching exercises may assist in building resilience but has the flaw of being only a temporary measure.</p>



<p>“While I’m not suggesting the pressure needs to be life-threatening, fighting in the trenches together is the best way to build time teams,” said Zhao. “It builds resilience, alliance, resilience and most importantly trust between the team members.”</p>



<p>Zhao added that while adversity may create internal trust, companies can foster external trust through “collaboration and cooperation,” citing Binance as an example of a resilient team.</p>



<p>Binance has been in the eye of the storm in recent weeks as the exchange, following allegations of financial impropriety by US regulators and an investigation from French authorities for aggravated money laundering. Things went from bad to worse after the exchange was forced to exit Dutch markets, and a fresh investigation from Australian officials seemed to compound Binance’s regulatory woes.</p>



<p>“If the allegations against Binance are true, they implicate very serious criminal and civil misconduct, including national-security related issues,” remarked Alex Zerden, CEO of Capital Peak Strategies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-crack-in-the-wall-for-binance"><strong>A crack in the wall for Binance</strong></h2>



<p>Despite claims of a resilient team, there appears to be a mass exit of leading executives at the exchange. Binance’’s Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of Compliance left their roles at the company with multiple reports claiming the exits were linked to a probe by the US Department of Justice.</p>



<p>However, Zhao hit back at the claims saying that the exits are normal occurrences in the lifespan of every company, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-cz-shrugs-off-news-of-senior-executive-personnel-resigning-as-attempts-to-spread-fud/">confirming</a> that Binance will “continue to hire” new staff to fill existing vacancies.</p>



<p>Early in the year, the company lost Matthew Price as its Global Head of Intelligence and Investigations, while <a href="https://zycrypto.com/brian-brooks-steps-down-as-binance-us-ceo-after-only-three-months/">Brian Brooks</a> left his role as Binance.US CEO in 2021, only three months after his appointment.</p>

<p>A handful of factors primarily determine the price movement of any cryptocurrency asset. This squally ranges from a fundamental level to a technical level. For a leading asset like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/glassnode-co-founder-optimistic-as-ethereum-reclaims-key-support-setting-stage-for-bullish-momentum/">Ethereum</a>, fundamental and technical developments have repeatedly swayed market sentiments.</p>



<p>With Ethereum (ETH) preparing to enter the third quarter of 2023, market players are curious to gain insight into the factors stimulating the asset’s continuous price growth. According to recent data from CryptoQuant, the upsurge in Ether’s price value can be traced back to DEXs. </p>



<p>Decentralized exchanges, also known as DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces allowing users to carry out transactions with other crypto traders without needing a third party.</p>



<p>The on-chain metrics platform CryptoQuant asserted that a significant portion of Ether’s bullish price performance could be tied to the rise in the number of DEX transactions carried out this year.</p>



<p><em>“Starting from 2023, when observing the volume of ETH traded on DEX, particularly the volume of transactions where ETH is swapped, we can see that it tends to move in a similar direction to the price of ETH.”</em> CryptoQuant asserted. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DEX Transaction Volume and Its Impact on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> Price: A 2023 Overview<br>Quicktake Post by <a href="https://twitter.com/Woo_Minkyu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Woo_Minkyu</a> <br><br>Thread<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/4fjWJpGda8">pic.twitter.com/4fjWJpGda8</a></p>&mdash; CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1678200781621559303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The pattern was first spotted in January 2023, CryptoQuant noted. Since then, the volume of trades involving ETH on decentralized exchanges has consistently risen. Later in March, the network recorded an enormous volume of trades after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on many <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-wants-four-months-to-make-a-recommendation-on-coinbases-call-for-crypto-clarity/">centralized exchanges</a>.</p>



<p>Although this might have been another factor that boosted the price of ETH, the volume of ETH being swapped on decentralized exchanges has been decreasing consistently since March.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s still unknown where the market is. It is still unclear whether or not Ether has peaked. As CryptoQuant asserts, “We now need to determine whether the current price of ETH will continue to adjust upwards or if the current stage signifies a bottom signal, indicating a good buying opportunity.”</p>



<p>At the time of this report, most altcoins on the market are trading in the red zone. Ether trades for $1,875 after dropping by 4.30% over the last week. Bitcoin has also not been spared by the mild downswing, as it has lost 0.45% in the last hour and more than 2% of its gains within the last 7 days. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/standard-chartered-bank-says-bitcoin-price-likely-to-hit-50000-this-year-120000-by-2024/">Bitcoin</a> now trades at a press time price of $30,610.</p>

<p>Major international bank, Standard Chartered, has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/standard-chartered-bank-says-bitcoin-price-likely-to-hit-50000-this-year-120000-by-2024/">revised its prediction</a> for the price of Bitcoin for the next 18 months. While the bank is still predicting a price increase by the end of next year, it has changed its earlier projection of $100,000 per BTC and now estimates that Bitcoin could, in theory, reach $120,000 by the end of 2024.</p>



<p>The British bank believes the current increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s price would encourage miners to stockpile more BTC, further impacting its value.</p>



<p><em>“The rationale here is that as well as maintaining the bitcoin ledger, miners play a key role in determining net supply of newly mined BTC,”</em> said Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick, adding that <em>“Increased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher.”</em></p>



<p>Standard Chartered&#8217;s optimistic outlook reflects rising confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s performance and reinforces the belief by some that the crypto winter has come to an end.</p>



<p>But others are not so eager regarding miners’ profits, especially around the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Nearly half of Bitcoin miners aren&#8217;t operating as efficiently as they should be, which could cause problems after the next halving, according to Jaran Mellerud, a crypto mining analyst at Hashrate Index.</p>



<p>Indicating that these miners, along with others who do not own their mining rigs, are likely to be greatly impacted by the halving, he notes that about 40% of BTC miners run at a greater cost per kilowatt-hour than the anticipated post-halving break-even price.</p>



<p>Given the ongoing high costs for energy worldwide, there are concerns that more miners may need to forfeit their operations if they cannot source cheaper electricity.</p>



<p>Standard Chartered’s updated projection signals a 20% increase in their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/100k-bitcoin-price-next-for-standard-chartered-bank-after-ringing-crypto-winter-dead/">earlier $100,000 forecast</a>, indicating solid expectations for Bitcoin&#8217;s future performance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bullish-outlook-but-with-a-caveat"><strong>Bullish Outlook, But with a Caveat</strong></h2>



<p>Some also see the potential onboarding of major financial institutions like BlackRock and others who have applied for a Bitcoin ETF as a major driver for the price of BTC. However, the CEO of Trust Machines, Muneeb Ali, has a slightly different view about where the Bitcoin price is headed.</p>



<p>In an interview on CNBC’s Crypto World, Ali highlighted the significance of custody concerning any spot Bitcoin ETF. If companies like BlackRock can address custody issues and actively participate in the Bitcoin network, it would be significant since it shows genuine ownership of and relationship to the underlying asset.</p>



<p>This, in turn, sends a positive message to other conventional financial organizations. Because they view Bitcoin as an established and safe investment, this could encourage more organizations to investigate and experiment with it. Ultimately, it remains to be seen how these factors will influence the Bitcoin price; as for a Bitcoin ETF, the SEC has denied every single application so far.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), the world&#8217;s second-largest meme coin, has been grabbing attention in the cryptocurrency markets lately, sparking curiosity and raising questions about its potential.</p>



<p>On July 6, crypto onchain analytics firm Santiment highlighted the significant rise in the creation of new daily addresses for Shiba Inu, averaging over 2,500 per day in the past couple of weeks. In a tweet, the firm noted that while the price performance of SHIB may have been underwhelming in the past year, there is hope behind one of 2021&#8217;s favourite meme coins.</p>



<p>Delving deeper into the underlying trends, the firm highlighted several factors contributing to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-looks-nigh-as-shiba-inus-testnet-sees-rising-activity-ahead-of-shibarium-mainnet/">positive spin</a> on Shiba Inu&#8217;s recent developments. First, the network growth of SHIB has been quite high lately, indicating increasing interest and engagement. Additionally, the network realized profit loss is completely underwater, which suggests that investors who bought SHIB are still holding onto their tokens despite potential losses. Furthermore, the supply of SHIB on exchanges is at its lowest point since 2022, indicating a decrease in available tokens for trading.</p>



<p>According to the firm, the implications of this situation can be interpreted from two different perspectives. On the one hand, the sudden attention on meme coins like SHIB could be seen as &#8220;a toppish indicator&#8221;, potentially signalling a market top or peak, which could imply market saturation or a future decline.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Santiment argued that the recent surge in interest could also bring new life into SHIB, which was flying under the radar.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;As suggested by our proprietary metrics, daily active addresses for SHIB were lacklustre before this surge in interest, indicating a newfound demand for the token,&#8221;</em> the firm wrote.</p>



<p>Moreover, the surging interest in Shiba Inu can also be attributed to anticipation around the mainnet launch of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-core-dev-teases-shibarium-launch-timeline-amid-super-bullish-strategy-for-shib/">Shibarium</a>, the ecosystem&#8217;s layer-2 scaling solution. Over the past few months, speculations around the product have been on the rise, with several proponents in the community, including Shiba Inu devs, suggesting that release dates may be closer than expected.</p>



<p>Notably, in the latest blog, Shytoshi Kusama dropped another hint at <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">Shibarium launching in August</a> while announcing Shib&#8217;s sponsorship of the Blockchain Futurist Conference, Eth Toronto, and Eth Women, set to be held in Toronto that month. According to the lead developer, the event will serve as a platform to showcase completed projects, including Shibarium.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Shibarium Beta Testnet, or Puppynet, has also seen significant adoption and engagement. According to data from Puppyscan, the total transactions and the number of wallet addresses connected to the Shiba Inu layer-2 test network have reached new highs of $27.37M and 17M, respectively.</p>



<p>These developments, combined with the ongoing substantial investments in SHIB by investors, are anticipated to ignite the upcoming bull run for the cryptocurrency to the highly envisioned $0.001 price point. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.000007518 after a 0.36% drop in the past day.</p>

<p>Prominent crypto lawyer John E. Deaton was recently asked about the possibility of more XRP holders joining the civil case against Ripple in Oakland, California, if the verdict in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-vs-ripple-hinman-documents-release-is-a-boost-to-ethereum-jpmorgan-analysts-share-opinion/">SEC vs Ripple</a> goes against Ripple and the judge declares XRP a security. Just last week, a California Judge certified a class of American purchasers of XRP in a complaint accusing Ripple Labs of selling unregistered securities. This second legal concern Ripple is facing is the subject of the tweet that prompted the question.</p>



<p>Concerning the ongoing legal conflict between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Deaton discussed the possible options and their potential impact on Ripple, XRP investors, and the SEC.</p>



<p>Regarding any money flowing from Ripple to the SEC, the lawyer is sure it won&#8217;t happen for years and only if Ripple were to lose on appeal.</p>



<p>Deaton said: <em>“If the Supreme Court takes it on appeal (which I believe they will if Congress hasn’t acted by then), I believe Ripple hands down wins with this Supreme Court. If the SEC wins Ripple will appeal and the status quo that exists today will continue over the next 2-5 years.”</em></p>



<p>He claims that if the SEC prevails and the civil case attorneys triumph because the Californian judge upholds Judge Torres&#8217; decision, Ripple will also appeal that case and no money will change hands, possibly never. If Ripple loses all of its challenges in five years, the SEC, not the civil claimants, would be responsible for collecting the $1.3 billion.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the SEC would receive this money rather than the civil claimants. In response, the SEC would create a repayment fund akin to the Veritaseum case, enabling holders of XRP to sell their tokens.</p>



<p>Deaton emphasizes an intriguing aspect of the situation that some may have missed. He argues that if the SEC were to lose, the damages that could be recovered in civil litigation would rise. Conversely, an SEC victory could make obtaining any financial losses more challenging for the civil lawsuit&#8217;s plaintiffs.</p>



<p>Deaton stresses that signing up for the 75K list, a list of XRP owners he represents in SEC vs Ripple, does not constitute a waiver of any rights or claims. Being on the list instead aids in identifying a sizable potential class of XRP holders. Holders of XRP on the list would probably be informed if there was ever a financial recovery in either the civil or SEC lawsuit.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“Also if Ripple loses and Congress fixes this regulatory mess during the 5 years of appeals, it all goes away anyway. Bottom line, being on the list didn’t waive anything and, if anything, it identified your claims (if you have any) long ago.”</em></p>



<p>Critics who claim that joining the 75K list and claiming that XRP is not a security would be damaging if XRP holders received financial compensation are dismissed by the attorney. He clarifies that even if a judge and an appeals court found differently, being mistaken about XRP&#8217;s security status would not result in punishment.</p>



<p>Given the possible outcomes, Deaton expresses doubt about the civil lawsuit&#8217;s impact. He contends that, paradoxically, XRP investors would gain if the SEC finally wins since it would receive the largest settlement and the best resolution.</p>



<p>These observations from John E. Deaton offer helpful perspectives on the probable outcomes and repercussions for all parties involved as the Ripple-SEC legal dispute continues.</p>

<p>During his latest interview, Jay Clayton voiced his openness to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman noted that he was doubtful about trading in the BTC market during his time in office. However, he admitted that the emergence of reputable institutions in the crypto industry is an impressive development not seen before. </p>



<p>As such, he believes it would be &#8216;hard to resist&#8217; okaying a physically-backed bitcoin ETF as long as the requisite regulatory protections are in place, similar to those in the futures market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clayton-bullish-on-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval"><strong>Clayton Bullish On Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval</strong></h2>



<p>In July 2013, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed paperwork to introduce the first-ever Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). A decade later, the industry is still waiting for a spot Bitcoin product.</p>



<p>Speaking during a Monday <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1678381857367289856">interview </a>with <em>CNBC</em>, the former chair of the SEC, Jay Clayton, pinpointed the noteworthy changes he has witnessed in market sentiment toward crypto since his tenure. &#8220;This is an offshore, retail, nothing close to what I would say are the core of our financial markets,&#8221; Clayton posited of Bitcoin&#8217;s earlier days.</p>



<p>While Clayton was previously wary of the Bitcoin market due to concerns of wash trading and market manipulation, the former securities regulator recognized the remarkable steps the industry has made, particularly in terms of institutional investment.</p>



<p>Prominent reputable companies are now foraying into Bitcoin, showing increasing confidence in the industry’s regulatory safeguards and trading credentials. “The fact that we have these institutions that know markets better than anybody and saying we&#8217;re going to put our reputation behind it, I find that pretty remarkable,&#8221; Clayton observed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Time For Bitcoin ETF Approval</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking of spot bitcoin ETFs, Clayton said he thought applicants have a strong chance at approval if they can ascertain that it’s a more efficient way for investors to invest in the crypto asset.</p>



<p>“If they’re right that the spot market has similar efficacy to the futures market, it would be hard to resist approving a bitcoin ETF.”</p>



<p>The former Wall Street regulator is popularly known for launching an unprecedented suit against Ripple and two of its top executives in late 2020 while he was still chair of the SEC. He is also responsible for the rejection of numerous physically backed bitcoin ETFs during his stint as the 32nd chairman of the commission.</p>



<p>As of right now, there&#8217;s still no spot Bitcoin ETF trading in the United States, but BlackRock’s application a couple of weeks ago signalled to the industry that the time may be coming when that changes. In recent weeks, we’ve seen around half a dozen new filings for a spot bitcoin ETF. Has the market matured enough to support an ETF as Clayton suggests, and can applicants give the SEC adequate guarantees that an ETF would be safe for investors?</p>



<p>While Clayton is bullish on the approval of a spot crypto ETF if certain conditions are met, he did not say when he expects such a long-awaited product to happen in the U.S finally.</p>

<p>Terraform Labs&#8217; trouble continues as the Seoul Southern District Court on Monday conducted the first hearing for Daniel Shin and seven other employees of the company. Shin, who was indicted in April by South Korea on violations of capital-markets law, among other charges, skipped the hearing. His legal team requested additional trial preparation time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-legal-proceedings-for-daniel-shin-begin-in-seoul"><strong>Legal Proceedings For Daniel Shin Begin In Seoul</strong></h2>



<p>A trial preparation hearing for Terraform co-founder Daniel Shin kicked off in a Seoul Southern District Court.</p>



<p>According to a report from local news outlet <em>News1 Korea</em> on July 10, the Seoul court held the preliminary hearing for Shin and seven of his alleged accomplices. However, the former Terra exec reportedly did not personally show up for the hearing. His attorneys argued that this case is more technical and asked for extra time. Judge Jang Seong-hoon approved the request and set August 28 as the second trial date.</p>



<p>Shin and the seven others were indicted without detention on April 25 by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor’s Office for myriad charges, including illegal trading. At the time, prosecutors said the entire Terra project was “fictitious” and bound to fail.</p>



<p>Prosecutors have alleged that Shin and his accomplices misled investors and manipulated the price of some tokens via media coverage and transactions beginning in 2018. They reportedly accrued “unfair profits” of around 462.9 billion won (over $350 million). Shin’s attorneys denied all the allegations in April. Nonetheless, the authorities said at the time that they had already frozen 246.8 billion won ($184.7 million) in assets from the people indicted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shin co-founded Terraform Labs with Do Kwon back in 2018. His legal team has previously asserted that he left the company in 2020, prior to the spectacular May 2022 implosion of the Terra ecosystem. Per his LinkedIn profile, Shin then went on to launch payments firm PortOne Global. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Global Legal Fallout</strong></h2>



<p>The catastrophic meltdown of Terra caused by its algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) dropping from its peg with the U.S. dollar sent shockwaves throughout the crypto markets, triggering a series of high-profile bankruptcy cases.</p>



<p>Legal fallout from the multi-billion-dollar Terra cataclysm now spans multiple countries following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">detention </a>of Do Kwon and chief financial officer Han Chang Joon in Montenegro in March.</p>



<p>Both the United States and his native South Korea are pushing for Kwon’s extradition, but he and Joon must first face charges of using forged travel documents in Montenegro. As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-do-kwon-found-guilty-of-passport-forgery-in-montenegro-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/">reported</a> last month, Kwon was sentenced to four months in prison in the Balkan nation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the cornered crypto founder has moved to dismiss charges brought against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on the basis that Terra-linked tokens don’t qualify as securities.</p>

<p>Multinational bank Standard Chartered, which in December 2022 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-05/bitcoin-sinks-further-70-in-standard-chartered-list-of-possible-2023-upsets?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google&amp;sref=323RPL5z">predicted </a>that the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-reveals-what-market-conditions-could-supercharge-bitcoin-price-to-310000/">bitcoin price</a> was on track to plummet as low as $5,000 in 2023, now believes that the world&#8217;s first and largest cryptocurrency will cost ten times more by year-end and an astounding $120,000 in 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-120-000-bitcoin-supply-shock-will-slingshot-btc-skyward"><strong>$120,000: Bitcoin Supply Shock Will Slingshot BTC Skyward</strong></h2>



<p>Standard Chartered has shared a rosy outlook for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/standard-chartered-bumps-up-bitcoin-forecast-120000-2023-07-10/">report </a>by Standard Chartered Bank’s Global Head of Research &amp; Chief Strategist, Geoff Kendrick, Bitcoin has the potential to reach $50,000 this year. Thereafter, the top crypto will climb to $120,000 by the end of next year.</p>



<p>In the banking group’s opinion, the price boom would be driven by one key factor: bitcoin supply dynamics. As network miners use more resources to secure the network, they dump less of their BTC coins, causing a demand-supply disparity that favors the bulls.</p>



<p>“Increased profitability for miners to mine Bitcoin means they can reduce sales while maintaining cash inflow, reducing the net supply of Bitcoin and driving up Bitcoin’s price,” Kendrick opined.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exciting Times Ahead For Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Standard Chartered giving a bullish forecast on Bitcoin’s future price makes it the latest firm to conclude that digital assets are here to stay especially after BlackRock&#8217;s recent entry into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) arena. BlackRock’s ETF application could make it much easier for fellow Wall Street firms to embrace cryptocurrencies and subsequently transform the BTC market.</p>



<p>Assuming the financial giant succeeds in its ETF quest and other institutional investors follow suit, it would stabilize the Bitcoin price at a considerably higher level than the current $30,000.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">popping above $31k</a> in June, bitcoin has changed hands between $29,500 and $31,500 levels. The crypto was little changed on Monday, dropping by 0.1% over the past 24 hours to trade at $30,252.43 at press time, according to CoinGecko.</p>



<p>That being said, the involvement of huge financial institutions, whether it be for ETF filings or the new EDX crypto exchange marks a substantial shift and a pivotal moment for the crypto industry in the United States and globally.</p>

<p>According to data from Glassnode, the Bitcoin network has seen an upsurge in the amount of Bitcoin held by market players. Notably, this uptrend was spotted amongst Bitcoin holders in the United States.</p>



<p>Glassnode asserted that the new development was triggered by BlackRock’s recent announcement concerning its spot Bitcoin ETF application. The new development signals a potential inflection point in the asset’s supply dominance if the trend continues.</p>



<p><em>“Following the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF request announcement on June 15th, the share of Bitcoin supply held/traded by US entities has experienced a notable uptick, marking a potential inflection point in supply dominance if the trend is sustained.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Following the Blackrock <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF request announcement on June 15th, the share of Bitcoin supply held/traded by US entities has experienced a notable uptick, marking a potential inflection point in supply dominance if the trend is sustained. <a href="https://t.co/DvRCYB4BUF">pic.twitter.com/DvRCYB4BUF</a></p>&mdash; glassnode (@glassnode) <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1677637186559135745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The price of Bitcoin could also benefit from the success of the Bitcoin ETF request, as it will become the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the country. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with Fox News, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, made some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-holds-above-31k-as-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-lauds-bitcoin-for-digitizing-gold/">bullish remarks about Bitcoin</a>, as he explained that the asset is pioneering the digitalization of gold differently.</p>



<p><em>“I do believe the role of crypto is [that] it’s digitizing gold in many ways. Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, as hedge against the onerous problems of any country, or the devaluation of your currency.. let’s be clear: Bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.” Fink asserted.</em></p>



<p>Sentiments around BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF filing are mixed at this time. While some market participants are positive that the ETF proposal by the $10 trillion asset manager could usher in more institutional investors, others insist that the ETF poses a more significant risk to the Bitcoin market.</p>



<p>Notably, Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, stated that the SEC would likely reject BlackRock’s ETF proposal. Speaking to Fortune Crypto in a recent interview, Wood is <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/we-dont-think-thats-true-cathie-wood-says-blackrock-doesnt-have-an-edge-when-it-comes-to-sec-approval-for-a-spot-bitcoin-etf/amp/">quoted</a> saying; </p>



<p><em>“We [Ark Invest] know that there was a surveillance clause in their prospectus that ours didn’t include, but what I’m told is it won’t take much time for us to amend our prospectus, and that all of the exchanges are moving in this direction.”</em></p>



<p>At report time, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-correlation-with-traditional-markets-and-gold-diminishes-heres-why/">Bitcoin</a> is trading for $30,274. After clearing hourly losses, Bitcoin seems to be positioning itself for a comeback. The apex cryptocurrency could retest its recent high of $30,403 in the near term.</p>

<p>Dr Gavin Wood, the creator of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/uniswaps-groundbreaking-decision-expanding-business-to-polkadot-via-moonbeam-parachain/">Polkadot</a>, made a ground-breaking revelation about his ambitious aspirations to build a global supercomputer on the Polkadot network. The announcement was made during the recent Polkadot Decoded conference when Wood highlighted the vast potential of Polkadot and outlined its key features.</p>



<p>Because of the scattered and incompatible nature of the current internet infrastructure, Wood sees Polkadot as a worldwide supercomputer. He asserts that a decentralized network with seamless data sharing and connectivity between various blockchains and networks is what the future holds.</p>



<p>Wood emphasized the need for a platform to unite specialized blockchains into one cohesive network. He stated, <em>&#8220;Polkadot aims to create a scalable and interoperable platform where different blockchains can communicate and share information, essentially creating a global supercomputer.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Several crucial aspects could help Polkadot take over the market. To begin with, its distinctive architecture enables the effortless movement of any data or asset across several blockchains.</p>



<p>Polkadot emphasizes the underlying resources needed to communicate and interact between chains rather than concentrating simply on chains. Polkadot is a platform for developers to create applications for people, not simply a platform for hosting chains, according to Wood.</p>



<p>And then, of course, the resilience of Polkadot is a key feature. Even though the word &#8220;unstoppable&#8221; has been used to characterize blockchain networks, Wood thinks the word &#8220;resilience&#8221; is more accurate and better describes Polkadot&#8217;s capacity to withstand attempts to interfere with how it is supposed to work. Polkadot ensures the network&#8217;s integrity by offering resilience against the corruption of purpose.</p>



<p>In a broader sense, Polkadot functions as a provider of highly resilient general-purpose computation. Wood compares it to a modern multicore computer, where each core runs separately and simultaneously. These cores, referred to as parachains, operate on Polkadot constantly. He revealed plans to go from a roughly 50-core CPU to 500 or even 1000 cores, giving the network more computational power.  </p>



<p>Polkadot&#8217;s cores have characteristics in common with central processing units (CPUs), including bandwidth, compute power and latency. The quantity of data processed per second, or bandwidth, is now believed to be around 1 MB. The Geekbench 5 benchmark rates a core&#8217;s processing power at about 380. Additionally, there is a 6-second lag between each subsequent chunk of work.</p>



<p>Polkadot&#8217;s promise, meanwhile, goes beyond holding parachains in place. Wood considers the feasibility of directly executing smart contracts on Polkadot cores. Although this implementation is not immediately available, it highlights how flexible and all-encompassing Polkadot&#8217;s computational capabilities are. Developers may run complex logic and keep a lot of state by utilizing Polkadot&#8217;s cores&#8217; power and bandwidth, outperforming the limitations of conventional smart contract platforms.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Polkadot uses a relay chain and parachains structure to guarantee excellent scalability and security. Parallel processing and higher transaction throughput are made possible via parachains, which are separate chains that link to the primary relay chain. Thanks to this design, Polkadot can manage many transactions at once, making it appropriate for enterprise-level applications.</p>



<p>Additionally, the governance structure of Polkadot is intended to be open and democratic. It makes the platform fair and inclusive by enabling token holders to participate in decision-making. This decentralized governance strategy complies with blockchain technology&#8217;s guiding principles and offers a robust and secure framework for developing the Internet.</p>



<p>Dr Gavin Wood has further cemented Polkadot&#8217;s reputation as a pioneer in the blockchain sector by revealing the platform&#8217;s concept for a global supercomputer. The blockchain ecosystem is a strong candidate for the future of decentralized apps and services due to its distinctive architecture, scalability, and democratic governance approach. Polkadot&#8217;s concept has the potential to transform the internet as we know it and bring in a new era of frictionless communication and cooperation across blockchains and networks as the world progresses toward a more connected future.</p>
