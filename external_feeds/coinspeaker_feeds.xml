<p>Local media outlets say that Tesla’s 2022 auto production made up 25% of total automotive production in Shanghai.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-auto-production-shanghai/">Tesla Contributed 25% of Total Auto Production in Shanghai Last Year</a></p>
<p>According to Chinese local media reports, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) cars accounted for approximately a quarter of all auto production in Shanghai last year. The US EV automaker’s 25% automotive production value in 2022 underscores the pace of its increased production output in China.</p>
<p>Last year, Tesla generated an auto production value of 183.9 billion yuan ($26.4 billion) in Shanghai. According to a Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Information official, this figure was 23% of the city’s total automotive manufacturing production. Furthermore, the production of more than 50% of Tesla’s global deliveries last year took place at its Shanghai facility. Reports stated that the plant, which rolled out its first Tesla EV in 2019, can now produce up to 1.1 million cars annually.</p>
<p>The Shanghai government official also said the production value generated by the China factory increased overall industrial production by 1.3 percentage points in 2022. According to Chen Kele, Tesla’s push to localize the procurement of parts has created 100,000 supply jobs. In addition, the American EV manufacturer’s operations have also brought 60 Chinese parts makers into its global supply chain.</p>
<p>Chen further explained that local authorities would continue collaborating with Tesla to drive AI initiatives in Shanghai. This development marks a remarkable turnaround in the disposition of the Chinese city toward Tesla’s autonomous driving and robot modules. Tesla vehicles were previously banned from Chinese military complexes and some government facilities in 2021. At the time, authorities expressed concern that cameras associated with the EVs collected sensitive data.</p>
<h2>Tesla Shanghai Auto Production News Comes After Company Hiked EV Prices in China</h2>
<p>Earlier in the month, Tesla <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-price-model-s-x-cars-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiked the prices</a> of its Model S and X cars in China by almost $3,000. After previously slashing its product prices, the company opted for the increase to remain competitive.</p>
<p>At Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call, CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> said the company targeted higher sales volumes than higher margins. Furthermore, Musk added that he expected Tesla to “generate significant profit through autonomy” over time. At the time, the outspoken business executive explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve taken the view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk also added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We do believe we’re laying the groundwork here, and then it’s better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin and subsequently harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy. This is an extremely important point.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Musk Steps Down as Twitter CEO for Former NBCU Chair Linda Yaccarino</h2>
<p>In other recent developments, Tesla’s shares <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-shares-gains-musk-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw mild gains</a> as Musk is set to relinquish his CEO position at Twitter. The Tesla chief had previously intended to vacate the position before the search for a new CEO began. With new Twitter CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/linda-yaccarino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linda Yaccarino</a> set to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65574826" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">resume office</a> in about six weeks, Tesla investors appear pleased that Musk is setting his priorities right. The outgoing Twitter CEO will instead take on the Executive Chairman and CTO role at the microblogging platform he purchased in October 2022.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/killer-whales-web3-tv-show-nft/">Killer Whales: World&#8217;s First Web3 TV Show for NFT Entrepreneurs</a></p>
<p>Popular crypto analytics service provider CoinMarketCap in partnership with HELLO Labs has launched the world’s first Web3 TV show dubbed Killer Whales.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/events/killerwhales/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, filming has been scheduled for June in Los Angeles, with the show set to air later this year on a combination of the world&#8217;s largest streaming platforms in over 55 countries.</p>
<p>Notably, the show intends to welcome the next billion users into Web3 while entertaining and educating a worldwide audience on all things crypto. By combining entertainment and education, the show may serve as a means to introduce and familiarize a broader audience with the concepts, and technologies in the crypto and Web3 space.</p>
<p>Specifically, projects that are selected to feature on the show will showcase their innovation before a panel of handpicked judges in the industry. The coverage can help make the subject more accessible and engaging, potentially encouraging new users to explore and participate in the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Based on the update, each episode in a series is expected to cover topics engaging Web3 topics such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFTs), cryptocurrency trading, and others. The goal would likely be to provide informative and entertaining content that sparks curiosity and encourages viewers to learn more about the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the inclusion of a “Wildcard” segment where viewers can vote for their favorite projects to appear on the show adds an interactive element and engages the audience in the content creation process. This allows viewers to actively participate and vote on which projects or topics are most interesting or relevant to them.</p>
<p>CoinMarketCap, as co-producers, will take the lead in sourcing the projects that will appear on the show. This implies that the platform will be involved in curating the content and ensuring that the projects shown meet their criteria or aims. Additionally, they will also present on-screen analytics and community feedback during the episodes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the news comes shortly after Altcoin Daily also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/altcoin-daily-to-produce-and-star-in-new-shark-tank-of-crypto-tv-show-killer-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of a similar crypto TV show. With an estimated global TV reach of over 500 million households, the production team plans to comb the globe for the next wave of Web3 unicorns to invite to Hollywood to pitch to the Whales.</p>
<h2>Beyond Killer Whales: Emergence of Crypto TV Shows</h2>
<p>The emergence of crypto TV shows can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing popularity of crypto, the growth of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>, and the interest of investors in the potential of blockchain technology. Crypto TV shows can be used to deliver educational and entertaining content about cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and DeFi.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the entertainment industry continues to investigate the potential of blockchain technology, the development of crypto-themed TV series, movies, and documentaries has increased. This trend has the potential to raise knowledge and comprehension of the crypto business, resulting in increased interest and acceptance.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-buildtheblock-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier by Coinspeaker, Binance Labs is also introducing the BuildTheBlock competition to empower a new set of entrepreneurs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/rakuten-shares-public-offering/">Rakuten Shares Drops 9% on Report of Possible $2.2B Public Offering</a></p>
<p>Shares of Rakuten Group Inc (Tokyo: 4745) closed Monday trading at ¥643, down 9.05 percent from the day’s opening price. The sudden drop in Rakuten shares was attributed to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/japans-rakuten-plans-raise-around-22-bln-via-new-share-issue-sources-2023-05-15/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> by Reuters that the company is in the final stages of issuing new shares in a bid to raise approximately $2.2 billion. According to the media outlet, Rakuten plans to issue shares to founder and CEO Hiroshi Mikitani and a fund controlled by the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>However, the company issued a press statement discrediting the announcement. According to Rakuten, although the company is planning to raise capital, there has been no official announcement to warrant the rumors.</p>
<p>“While the Company has been considering various financial strategies including what has been reported in the news reports, no decisions have been made at this time. If a decision is reached on a matter that requires disclosure, we will do so in a timely and appropriate fashion,” the company <a href="https://global.rakuten.com/corp/news/press/2023/0515_01.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> in a press release.</p>
<p>Reportedly, people familiar with the matter confirmed that the company intends to pay down debt and build base stations for its mobile business with the $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Rakuten&#8217;s recent funding report comes after KKR, a leading global investment firm, increased its stake at Seiyu from 65% to 85 percent.</p>
<p>Hiro Hirano, Co-Head of Private Equity for KKR Asia Pacific and CEO of KKR Japan, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are pleased to deepen our relationship with Seiyu, an iconic Japanese brand in which we continue to see strong promise. We look forward to unlocking the company’s full potential through the continued strategic partnership with Rakuten and Walmart…”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Rakuten Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The Japanese tech conglomerate announced its first-quarter financial results on May 12. According to the announcement, the Rakuten Group recorded revenue of ¥475,635 million, up 9.3 percent year-on-year, during the first three months of the year that ended on March 31, 2023. During the first quarter, the company issued approximately 2 million common shares, thus diluting its stock market. Currently, Rakuten has about 1.59 billion in shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the latest stock data shows Rakuten shares gained approximately 7.9 percent YTD despite dropping about 20 percent last year. Having been rated 16 times, Rakuten shares received an average rating of Hold, according to a survey conducted by MarketWatch.</p>
<p>The company has, however, worked toward diversifying its businesses and widening its market reach. Among its subsidiaries &#8211; including Internet Services, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/fintech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FinTech</a>, and Mobile &#8211; the company significantly integrated them to ensure their future growth prospects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a report from REFINITIV shows that Rakuten posted a net loss of about 735 billion yen in a little more than four years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-lbry-reduces-fine/">SEC Revises Punishment against LBRY, Reduces Fine by 95%</a></p>
<p>In a major development and probably the first, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) has decided to revise its fine against blockchain-based content-sharing platform LBRY, having identified the platform&#8217;s inability to pay a massive sum of $22 million.</p>
<p>As per the filing submitted last week on May 12 in a New Hampshire District Court, the securities regulator sought an amendment to its request for remedies in a case against LBRY. Considering LBRY’s “lack of funds and near-defunct status”, SEC has chosen to withdraw its request for disgorgement, or forfeiture of ill-gotten gains. As per the filing, the securities regulator is now seeking a revised fine of $111,000.</p>
<p>Two years back in March 2021, the US SEC had filed a lawsuit against LBRY while accusing them of offering LBRY Credit tokens (LBC) as unregistered securities and thus violating the federal securities laws. Back then, LBRY CEO Jeremy Kauffman expressed concerns over SEC&#8217;s decision stating that this could become a precedence in the long term and will classify almost every cryptocurrency as security.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that LBRY didn&#8217;t conduct an initial coin offering (ICO) or any kind of public token sale, the SEC alleged that LBRY’s team used a &#8220;pre-mine&#8221; process to retain the token to themselves and later released them on secondary exchanges to generate funds for their operations.</p>
<h2>The SEC vs LBRY</h2>
<p>Through a summary judgment back in November 2022, the SEC secured a win wherein the federal judge ruled that the tokens incentivized LBRY&#8217;s team for developing the network while creating the perception among investors that they could secure profits by investing in LBC in the secondary market.</p>
<p>The SEC had argued that LBRY&#8217;s possession of the LBC tokens hints at the potential of additional unregistered sales, which supports the necessity of an injunction. “LBRY satisfies the factors for injunctive relief and there is a reasonable likelihood it will violate Section 5 again,” the agency <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/sec-lowers-lbry-fine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>Later in December, LBRY hit back to the SEC&#8217;s request of paying $22 million in disgorgement. LBRY stated that &#8220;the amount was not a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to the violation&#8221;. In December 2022, LBRY contended that an injunction is unnecessary since they are already in the process of shutting down the operations and burning existing LBC tokens.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-identifying-fake-ai-images/">Google Launches New Tools for Identifying Fake AI Images</a></p>
<p>Google has unveiled two handy features for identifying, marking up, and labeling fake or misleading AI images.  </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-identifying-fake-ai-images/">Google Launches New Tools for Identifying Fake AI Images</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-identifying-fake-ai-images/">Google Launches New Tools for Identifying Fake AI Images</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is rolling out a tool that identifies fake artificial intelligence (AI) images generated via its search feature. Reports state that the company’s new feature would reduce the spread of misinformation by identifying misleading AI imagery. Google’s new image search tools prove handy since AI tools can now seamlessly create photo-realistic imitations.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/about-this-image-google-search/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> last week by Google heralding its image identification feature read:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As we begin to roll out generative image capabilities, we will ensure that every one of our AI-generated images has a markup in the original file to give you context if you come across it outside of our platforms. Creators and publishers will be able to add similar markups, so you can see a label in images in Google Search, marking them as AI-generated. In the coming months, you can expect to see these from several publishers, including Midjourney, Shutterstock, and others.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Users can access ‘About this image’ on search results, by clicking on the three dots above an image. Likewise, access could also be via searching with Google Lens or swiping up in the Google app.</p>
<h2>Look into New Google Tools for Identifying Fake AI Images</h2>
<p>Google is launching two new features that would label the fake images created with its AI. The first new feature added to image search is ‘About this image’, which provides additional context. These include the index history of a particular image as well as similar ones. Furthermore, ‘About this image’ also provides details regarding where the image first appeared and where else it exists online. The feature aims to help users pinpoint the original image source while shedding light on any previously supplied debunking evidence.</p>
<p>In addition to marking every AI-generated image created by its tools, Google is also working with other platforms to ensure similar compliance on their files. The second feature entails introducing a specific markup within image files that labels them &#8220;AI-generated&#8221;. Google’s intent is to distinguish between AI-facilitated computer-generated imagery and those captured via traditional means.</p>
<p>Although this labeling does not entirely negate AI misinformation, it is vital to improving transparency. Users can discern whether an image is AI-generated or the handiwork of human photographers. Furthermore, reports state that Google would ensure that other platforms add the same verification markups to images they put out. Some of the publishers currently aboard the Google image compliance scheme are Midjourney and Shutterstock.</p>
<h2>Google Pixel Fold Smartphone</h2>
<p>Less than two weeks ago, Google <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-pixel-fold-smartphone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> its latest Pixel Fold smartphone, which it later unveiled at <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-google-i-o-2023-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an annual developer conference</a>. At the I/O Developers conference last week, the tech giant exposited the Pixel Fold, which could directly compete with Samsung’s high-end phones.</p>
<p>Google said the smartphone would initially retail at $1,799, with shipping expected to begin next month.</p>

<p>Amid mounting debt-limit default risks, US investors have turned to Bitcoin as 'digital gold' to better hedge their savings. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-dollar-debt-limit-default-risks/">Bitcoin Preferred to Dollar and Yen as Safe-Haven Option amid Higher US Debt-Limit Default Risks</a></p>
<p>Amid rising debt-limit default risks, Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) is the preferred safe-haven asset compared to other established global fiat currencies. A recent <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/debt-limit-default-risk-higher-000009142.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> stated that investors have turned to BTC to hedge their investments, compared to the US dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc-yielding assets. In addition, Bitcoin&#8217;s growing popularity as a veritable option rivals that of gold now.</p>
<p>The likelihood of a US debt default is at its highest point in recent times and threatens to upend global markets. The ongoing US banking crisis has done little to assuage fears, with more investors repurposing their assets toward crypto. Some analysts believe BTC&#8217;s rising popularity could see the popular crypto <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-2023-price-rally-cryptoquant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revisiting its record high</a> in early 2024. With institutional investors braced to invest in Bitcoin in the second half of this year, the asset is already experiencing a diminishing correlation with stocks. Conversely, Bitcoin&#8217;s correlation with gold is on the rise, being 50% in early April compared with the 20% BTC-stock 20% correlation.</p>
<h2>Gold Still Top Choice in US Debt-Limit Default Risk Outlook</h2>
<p>Gold remains a favorite among investors seeking protection amid the risk of debt-limit default. A recent Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey revealed over 50% of finance professionals would buy gold on a government loan default. However, many American investors were still open to buying US Treasuries if the government failed to honor its obligations. This development is interesting because the risk of defaulting on Treasuries is high.</p>
<p>Political and financial stakeholders have warned about dire implications if the US debt ceiling situation spirals out of control. For instance, US President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> suggested that the &#8220;whole world [could be] in trouble&#8221;. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan</a> (NYSE: JPM) CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jamie-dimon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamie Dimon</a> said the situation could be &#8220;potentially catastrophic&#8221;. The International Monetary Fund was just as grim in its assessment of a full-blown debt limit default case in the US, foreboding &#8220;very serious repercussions&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Investors Believe US Should Not Overlook Precarious Debt-Limit Situation</h2>
<p>Despite the US&#8217; long-vaunted status as an economic superpower, many think the country should pay close attention to its erring debt profile. In a survey, respondents compared the current debt situation with the debilitating debt-limit crisis from 2011. According to 60% of MLIV Pulse participants, there has been an exponential increase in insurance costs from non-payment since 2011. As Invesco&#8217;s head of fixed income, alternatives, and ETF strategies, Jason Bloom, put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The risk is higher than before, given the polarization of the electorate and the Congress. The way both sides are so dug in means there is the risk they don&#8217;t get their act together in time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding, surveyed respondents still believe that the actual possibility of default remains relatively slim. Instead, an overwhelming majority of MLIV surveyed investors anticipate a rally in 10-year Treasuries in the most extreme case.</p>
<p>Some investors also believe that the US debt-ceiling blues has impacted the dollar. For instance, 41% say the greenback could lose its primary global reserve status if the US defaults.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe seeks to use gold-backed crypto tokens to salvage the country’s economic situation.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zimbabwe-39m-gold-backed-tokens/">Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Defies IMF&#8217;s Warning, Sells $39M Worth of Gold-backed Digital Tokens</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zimbabwe-39m-gold-backed-tokens/">Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Defies IMF&#8217;s Warning, Sells $39M Worth of Gold-backed Digital Tokens</a></p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has dammed any potential consequences by selling 14 billion Zimbabwean dollars ($39 million) worth of gold-backed digital tokens. That is despite an earlier warning it received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) not to go ahead with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zimbabwe-central-bank-gold-backed-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the plans</a>. At the time, the International body cautioned about the potential risks of the plan, suggesting that Zimbabwe would be better off liberalizing its foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>As of May 12, the apex bank of Zimbabwe confirmed that it received 135 applications for the gold-backed cryptocurrency. The Friday announcement also noted that, cumulatively, it made a total of 14.07 billion Zimbabwean dollars from the sale.</p>
<p>Recall that Zimbabwe first introduced the crypto tokens last month, noting that they are backed by 139.57 kilograms of gold. It then kicked off the sale on May 8 and allowed it to run through May 12. And while it sold the tokens at a minimum price of $10 for individuals, corporate entities bought them for $5,000.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Zimbabwe is currently planning another sale round for the digital tokens. According to the central bank, interested buyers may submit their applications between now and May 18th.</p>
<h2>Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Aims to Use Gold-Backed Token to Improve Economy</h2>
<p>Like most countries around the world, Zimbabwe is currently facing a turbulent time in its economy. More so, its local currency has been consistently falling against the US dollar. Hence, the reason it seeks to use gold-backed crypto tokens is to salvage the country’s economic situation.</p>
<p>According to a local news report from Herald, RBZ Governor Dr. John Mangudya says the gold-backed digital tokens provide Zimbabwe with more options to preserve value. Mangudya also <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/14bn-gold-digital-tokens-bought-so-far-rbz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">claims</a> that the tokens will “enhance divisibility of the investment instruments and widen their access and usage by the public”.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, it appears that Zimbabwe has carried out due diligence as earlier suggested by the IMF. That is, the African nation seems to have determined that the benefits of its gold-backed token plan outweigh the costs and potential risks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/vice-media-bankruptcy/">Vice Media Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</a></p>
<p>American-Canadian digital media company Vice Media Group has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkap5v/vice-media-llc-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after several years of financial struggle. The company, which was valued at $5.7 billion in 2017, is currently worth less than $1 billion. Top executives of the media giant have failed to give any detailed evaluation of the company’s net worth.</p>
<p>Vice Media’s lenders are planning to take on administrative control of the company through necessary filings. These lenders include Fortress Investment, Soros Fund Management, and Monroe Capital. About five companies have previously shown interest in purchasing the media company.</p>
<h2>Vice Media Bankruptcy Filings</h2>
<p>Vice Media has completed filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. After the approval of the application, interested parties can bid for the company. The inclusion of credit bids will allow the new administrators to swap secured debt for company assets instead of paying in cash. Notably, the consortium’s bid includes a commitment fee of $20 million in cash to cater to the company&#8217;s daily activities throughout the sale process. The sale process is expected to last for 2-3 months.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing covers Vice Media’s multi-platform media brands like Vice News, Vice TV, Pulse Films, Virtue, Refinery29, and i-D. It does not include Vice’s international entities and Vice TV’s joint venture with A&amp;E.</p>
<p>During a short interview with Vice Co-CEOs, Bruce Dixon and Hozefa Lokhandwala, it was mentioned that the sale process would enhance the company’s affairs and prepare it for long-term growth.</p>
<p>They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We will have new ownership, a simplified capital structure, and the ability to operate without the legacy liabilities that have been burdening our business.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Vice Media&#8217;s Restructuring</h2>
<p>Before this announcement, Vice Media had begun to restructure its global organizational workforce. Over the last few months, Vice Media has laid off many workers to slim down their cost of production.</p>
<p>According to the media company, any group intending to purchase her assets will provide $225 million in the form of a credit bid. The fees will also cover some of Vice’s significant liabilities.</p>
<p>Vice Media is not the only digital company forced to restructure its organization due to bankruptcy. Buzz Feed (NASDAQ: BZFD), a global media and technology company, has shut down its news broadcast division and laid off a larger number of its workers. Generally, the low revenue generation in the media space is caused by the sluggish economy and weak advertising market.</p>
<p>Vice began its journey as a magazine that addresses youth-related issues and invariably gained an outstanding presence on social media. The then-thriving company is filing for bankruptcy, which was indirectly caused by the spike in online advertisement championed by Google and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a>. Last year, the media company fell below its targeted revenue mark by more than $100 million.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/litecoin-bullish-lightning-network-integration/">Litecoin (LTC) on Bullish Run after Lightning Network Integration</a></p>
<p>Litecoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/litecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LTC</a>) is seeing a parabolic run through its price today as the protocol has unveiled a major milestone underpinning the network. As <a href="https://u.today/litecoin-ltc-up-7-after-integrating-lightning-network-details" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by several media today, Litecoin has also integrated the Lightning Network as it looks to leverage the ultimate scaling solution that has helped the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> network beat its congestion woes in recent times.</p>
<p>The revelation of the Lightning Network integration has pushed the price of the protocol up by more than 7% in early Monday trading to push the spot valuation to $87.11 per coin. With the price run, LTC has now pared off its losses for the trailing 7-day period, coming off as one of the highest gainers with 6.55% within that time frame.</p>
<p>As revealed by the Litecoin protocol, the integration of the Lightning Network has largely helped push its scalability by 100%. What this implies is that transactions conducted on Litecoin which are naturally relatively faster than that of BTC can now be completed 10x as fast and also cheaper.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">DYK: The very first <a href="https://twitter.com/lightning?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">@lightning</a> transaction was made on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Litecoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">#Litecoin</a>? </p>
<p>One of the latest innovations to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">$LTC</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MWEB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">#MWEB</a>, giving Litecoin 10x scalability. <a href="https://t.co/ekSGVM9cCD" target="_blank">https://t.co/ekSGVM9cCD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Litecoin (@litecoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1657858322266038275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">May 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Lightning Network is a layer-2 scaling solution that is built on the Bitcoin blockchain. The deployment of Litecoin is not just a testament to its versatility, it also depicts the flexibility of the Litecoin protocol to adopt innovations relevant to its growth. The Litecoin adoption of Lightning Network is particularly very beneficial to the crypto project seeing it serves primarily as a payment digital currency.</p>
<p>Litecoin’s emergence and usage thus far have been confined to its use as a payment method. Despite the relative growth of competition today, cryptocurrency has maintained its relevance and is tagged as one of the 4 digital assets that is supported on legacy fintech platforms like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal Holdings Inc</a> (NASDAQ: PYPL).</p>
<h2>Litecoin and Steady Innovation Integration</h2>
<p>The broader digital currency ecosystem is evolving at a very fast pace and legacy Layer-1 protocols are now doing all they can to broaden their influence across the board.</p>
<p>Litecoin is not an exception in this regard as the protocol’s innovation is now tilting toward the growth of Ordinal inscriptions as well as the introduction of LTC-20 tokens, an experimental standard for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/#:~:text=A%20non%2Dfungible%20token%20refers,proofs%20of%20authenticity%20and%20ownership." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFTs) on the network.</p>
<p>Litecoin has also been gaining some momentum since the start of the year with a focus on its next Halving event which is a few months away. While the halving is known to historically boost price growth as it subtly introduces deflation into the tokens, experts believe the price of LTC will respond positively to these fundamentals in the days leading up to the halving.</p>
<p>As a layer-1 protocol, Litecoin is notably going out of its comfort zone to bring additional benefits to its users across the board, and the Lightning Network integration is major in this light.</p>

<p>Samsung and BOK will continue to explore new ways of developing a CBDC ecosystem and leverage the NFC technology to power offline CBDC payments. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/samsung-bank-of-korea-cbdc/">Samsung to Work with Bank of Korea for Offline CBDC Payment Using NFC</a></p>
<p>The latest development in the crypto space is that South Korean tech giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Electronics</a> has decided to work with the central bank &#8211; Bank of Korea &#8211; in order to build an ecosystem for the offline payments of the central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>).</p>
<p>Both players have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at Samsung&#8217;s headquarters in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. As we know, some of the top central banks across the world have already started with CBDC pilots and the Bank of Korea is also working in this regard.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, both Samsung and BOK will continue to conduct research on the CBDC and will specifically focus on its offline use. Last year, both these players had already joined hands for conducting a CBDC pilot. Back then, they also developed an offline CBDC technology allowing device-to-device transfers and payments using near-field communication (NFC) technology. This would be possible even when senders and recipients&#8217; transaction devices are not connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Thus, people will be able to make transactions using their Samsung mobile devices and with no cash or credit cards. This would facilitate CBDC payments even in areas with no internet connections. Sending and receiving money will be possible through a built-in NFC chipset present in Samsung smartphones, equipped with special security features. Speaking on the development, Choi Won-joon, executive vice president and head of Samsung&#8217;s Mobile eXperience (MX) Division R&amp;D office <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2023/05/133_351013.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The collaboration with the BOK allowed us to apply Samsung&#8217;s advanced security technology to the digital currency space. Based on our collaboration, we expect to make a significant contribution to the development of offline CBDC technology in Korea and globally.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>South Korea Focusing on Its CBDC</h2>
<p>As said, central banks across the world have been putting their focus on introducing CBDCs. Samsung and BOK have agreed that both players will explore different ways to cooperate in developing a CBDC ecosystem in the international community.</p>
<p>By leveraging the NFC technology, the two sides will continue research to minimize the security risks associated with offline payments using Samsung&#8217;s smart devices. With NFC, Samsung plans to offer stable CBDC payments in areas with no network connectivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very pleased to have developed the first offline CBDC technology for a central bank with Samsung Electronics.
