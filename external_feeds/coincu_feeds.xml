<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler delivered an essential message about cryptocurrencies in a newly released video.</em></li>



<li><em>He again emphasized that cryptocurrency trading platforms must be registered with the this agency</em>.</li>



<li><em>Gensler warns investors that many current crypto platforms are operating in violation of securities laws.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The president of the US securities regulator, Gary Gensler</strong>, <strong>has taken another blow to the crypto industry who has stated that many crypto platforms are operating in violation of securities laws.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950.png"><img decoding="async" width="931" height="523" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950.png" alt="Gary Gensler Warns Cryptocurrency Platforms Must Be Registered With SEC" class="wp-image-184514" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950.png 931w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950-768x431.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px" title="Gary Gensler Warns Cryptocurrency Platforms Must Be Registered With SEC 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In an April 27 tweet, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1651624244445421591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4-minute video </a>of him describing the crypto asset as an &#8220;investment contract&#8221; before the announcement urges platforms offering such products to register with the SEC to protect US investors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Instead, many crypto platforms are contending that their investment contracts are something else. The law cares about what something is, not what you call it.&#8221;</p>
<cite>He said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC has been at the forefront of the US crypto crackdown, with Gensler repeatedly asserting that essentially all crypto assets &#8211; except Bitcoin (BTC). In Gensler&#8217;s view, many crypto companies and platforms violate securities laws if they don&#8217;t register with the this agency.</p>



<p>However, this is contrary to the assertions before he assumed the current position. This was widely shared in a video from 2018. He stated that three-quarters of the crypto market is commodities, &#8220;not securities&#8221;.</p>



<p>The above information may put Gensler in a more disadvantageous situation. Two weeks ago, Congressman Warren Davidson proposed a bill that would require the dismissal of Gary Gensler for disagreeing with his policies to regulate the crypto industry. Hester Peirce &#8211; SEC Commissioner, also supported Davidson and accused Gensler of destroying the potential of new technologies. In addition, at a House hearing on the evening of April 19, many members criticized Chairman Gary Gensler for his approach to the field of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Currently, the SEC and Coinbase are also having a <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184504-coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fierce legal battle</a> when Coinbase has filed a lawsuit against the this agency for ignoring the questions that the exchange has raised to the committee since July 2022. At the time, Coinbase asked the SEC to answer 50 questions and answers about establishing a complete regulatory framework for the crypto industry, but accused the exchange of listing unregistered securities.</p>

<p>Coinbase is currently facing regulatory issues with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has issued a Wells notice against the exchange, which is a notification that enforcement actions may be taken against the firm.</p>



<p>To appeal the notification, Coinbase&#8217;s executives spoke publicly about the issue. Chief legal officer Paul Grewal spoke at Consensus 2023 and appeared on YouTube in a video with CEO Brian Armstrong. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe title="Coinbase responds to the SEC’s Wells notice | Excerpt" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvbWPUCFdKA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Grewal stated that Coinbase has been operating within the regulatory perimeter since it was approved for listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange two years ago. This suggests that the exchange has been operating within the regulatory perimeter and that any regulatory concerns arise from a lack of clarity or interpretation of relevant laws.</p>



<p>Grewal also stated that Coinbase is already regulated and has a New York state &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; that prohibits the exchange from listing securities. He believes that legislation or rulemaking is needed if the SEC wants to expand its oversight over the industry.</p>



<p>Armstrong reiterated that Coinbase is committed to working within the regulatory perimeter and thoroughly vets its offerings. The company does not list securities and rejects &#8220;some 90%&#8221; of the assets it reviews. Despite the regulatory concerns, the firm is still prepared to go to court to defend its position. However, it believes it does not have to come to that and welcomes an actual dialog about a workable path forward for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>According to Paul Grewal, Coinbase has been in talks with the SEC about its business for many years, including sharing its legal views on its asset listing and staking services. </p>

<p>Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta has been experiencing tremendous growth in April. According to Polygon Labs, total users, contracts deployed, and total value locked (TVL) have all experienced +300% growth. Compared to Ethereum Mainnet, the average daily gas is 7X cheaper on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta. This is great news for users who can benefit from the cost savings.</p>



<p>The number of unique active wallet addresses on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta has almost tripled, with nearly 50k users as of April 24. Transactions continue to grow at a similar pace, with the total number of transactions increasing by +300% since the start of the month. The number of successful transactions is 168k as of April 24, generating 95.25 ETH (approximately $177K) in fees.</p>

<p>Insight into developer activity also shows robust growth. The number of contracts deployed on-chain has nearly doubled, from 540 at the start of the month to more than 1,000.</p>



<p>While TVL is a popular metric, Polygon Labs notes that it isn&#8217;t complete as it is commonly measured in USD, and so it reflects movement in the price of ETH as much as it reflects the day-to-day growth (or shrinkage) of a protocol. </p>

<p>For the purposes of this update, Polygon Labs uses net value bridged (NVB) to describe a larger number referring to all the assets that have been bridged to the network minus those assets that have been bridged back to Ethereum Mainnet. As of April 24, TVB is approximately $8.5M, for a Δ of ~$3.4M.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>An unidentified individual or group raised the alert, naming roughly 1,000 Bitcoin addresses that they allege belong to Russian intelligence organizations.</li>



<li>External parties have previously recognized at least three of the alleged Russian wallet addresses as belonging to Russia, giving credibility to the mystery Bitcoiner&#8217;s claims.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to crypto monitoring company Chainalysis, a clandestine Bitcoin enthusiast seems to have turned the tables on the Russian state by unmasking hundreds of wallets presumably controlled by security organizations.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-1024x682.png" alt="Russian Bitcoin Wallet Linked To Security Agencies Leaked Amid Tension Conflict" class="wp-image-184501" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-1024x682.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-768x511.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-750x499.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-1140x759.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Russian Bitcoin Wallet Linked To Security Agencies Leaked Amid Tension Conflict 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The unknown individual used a feature in the Bitcoin blockchain&#8217;s transaction documentation to identify 986 wallets controlled by the Foreign Military Intelligence Agency (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and Federal Security Service (FSB), according to Chainalysis, a company that works closely with the US government. The vigilante&#8217;s messages, written in Russian, accuse the wallets of being engaged in hacking operations.</p>



<p>The authenticity of the individual&#8217;s statements is yet unknown, and the three organizations have yet to reply to the news. If the claims are accurate, it is clear that the individual gained access to at least some of the addresses they allege are possessed by Russia, either via hacking or even an inside operation.</p>



<p>These charges, made in the weeks preceding Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, provided an unexpected crypto edge to a war already filled with interesting occurrences. The Ukrainian government has used cryptocurrencies to raise tens of millions of dollars for military purposes. Curiously, according to Chainalysis, some of the wallets ostensibly owned by Russia have already remitted payments to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Chainalysis reports that at least three of the reported Russian wallet addresses had already been identified with Russia by external parties, lending legitimacy to the mystery Bitcoiner&#8217;s assertions. Two of these wallets were allegedly engaged in the SolarWinds assault, while another supported servers used in Russia&#8217;s misinformation effort during the 2016 election.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1024x683.png" alt="Russian Bitcoin Wallet Linked To Security Agencies Leaked Amid Tension Conflict" class="wp-image-184502" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1140x760.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Russian Bitcoin Wallet Linked To Security Agencies Leaked Amid Tension Conflict 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to Chainalysis, the mystery Bitcoiner&#8217;s spending habits add credence to their assertions. The person essentially destroyed almost $300,000 in Bitcoin while recording their claims on the blockchain, which is much more than is necessary for using the Bitcoin network&#8217;s OP RETURN field.</p>



<p>In a report, Chainalysis <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/russia-bitcoin-op-return-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The fact that the OP_RETURN sender was both willing and able to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin in order to spread their message makes it more likely in our opinion that their information is accurate.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The sender ceased producing the inscriptions when Russia invaded Ukraine. They thereafter restarted their operations by delivering Bitcoin related to Russia to Ukrainian charity accounts.</p>



<p>If the claims are genuine, the addresses and any Bitcoin they contain are effectively compromised from a security standpoint, as Chainalysis pointed out. The possibility that the OP RETURN sender gained private keys for Russian-controlled addresses casts doubt on the security of the Putin regime&#8217;s crypto activities.</p>

<p>The regulatory environment for crypto in the U.S. is causing some companies to move offshore to avoid regulatory compliance. This move has not gone unnoticed by Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, who believes that crypto markets suffer from a lack of regulatory compliance, not regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>In a new pet-themed video on Twitter, Gensler compared the compliance conundrum of crypto to calling a dog a goldfish in order to skirt leash laws. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Intermediaries for investment contracts are required to comply with securities laws &amp; register with <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@SECGov</a>.<br><br>Instead, many crypto platforms are contending that their investment contracts are something else.<br><br>The law cares about what something actually is, not what you call it.</p>&mdash; Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1651624244445421591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>He stated that it doesn&#8217;t matter if a company calls itself onshore or offshore; it must comply with American laws if it makes securities available to American investors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“In many places around the country, we’re required to use a leash when you walk your dog. But let&#8217;s just say you get stopped because you&#8217;re walking Rover unleashed. What do you think would happen if you told the police officer that, Rover is actually a goldfish? You&#8217;d still get a citation. And that&#8217;s because the law cares about what something actually is, not what you call it.”</p>
<cite>Gensler said</cite></blockquote>



<p>Gensler&#8217;s comments come amid a tussle between the crypto industry and the SEC regarding regulating cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, one of the most vocal companies in this space, recently sued the agency.</p>



<p>Gensler&#8217;s stance is that many crypto platforms are pretending that the investment contracts they offer are more like goldfish, and the lack of compliance by these platforms means that basic investor protections are not in place.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Many crypto platforms are just pretending that these investment contracts that they offer are more like goldfish, and the lack of compliance by these crypto platforms means that you don’t have basic investor protections.”</p>



<p>“It doesn&#8217;t matter if you call yourself onshore or offshore. If you make securities available to American investors, you must comply with American laws.”  “The law is clear.”</p>
<cite>Gensler continued</cite></blockquote>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to PancakeSwap DAO, 70% of the CAKE-holding community voted in favor of curbing inflation and lowering block rewards.</em></li>



<li><em>The DAO proposes reducing the number of tokens stakeholders get as interest for storing their coins.</em></li>



<li><em>The PancakeSwap community opted for an &#8220;aggressive reduction&#8221; in staking incentives this week, causing the CAKE token to fall in value.</em></li>

<p>A community <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x707643dd2c2b941c7274f26a0362922198912e8549050ae9f2d1d9d71ada04bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vote</a> to reduce CAKE block rewards emitted by the decentralized-finance protocol PancakeSwap is nearing completion, with nearly 70% of votes of the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, in favor of an “aggressive reduction.” The vote will end at 15:30 UTC on Friday.</p>



<p>CAKE emissions on PancakeSwap’s main liquidity pool would drop by 94% once the proposal is voted in. Core developers published a proposal to this effect, and voting kicked off earlier this week, although members of the protocols DAO started debating the proposal in early April. The proposal aims to cut down CAKE’s interest to around 3-5%. The current rate above 20% was deemed “unsustainable” by some community members.</p>



<p>The team behind PancakeSwap carefully considered the dialogue surrounding the unsustainable inflation rate of CAKE that required the token to see higher adoption and capital inflow for stakers to earn higher yields. A proposal to aggressively reduce inflation and transform CAKE’s tokenomics to generate higher real yield and favor long-term CAKE stakers was put forward.</p>



<p>To achieve this, the core team will change CAKE emissions from 6.65 CAKE per block to 3 CAKE per block if the proposal is voted for. 70% of community members already voted in favor of this “aggressive reduction.” Emissions refer to the rate new crypto coins are released or added to the total supply.</p>



<p>The first emission reduction will be immediate. Afterward, developers will slash token emissions by 0.5 CAKE per month. This reduction will happen every month for five months till emissions occur at a 0.35 CAKE per month rate.</p>



<p>At press time, 69.33% of voters were in favor of the proposal, 10.41% agreed to a gradual and not aggressive reduction in inflation, and 20.26% rejected both models.</p>

<p>On the weekly chart, PancakeSwap’s native asset CAKE declined by over 20%. The dip in CAKE’s price coincides with an exodus of staked tokens and a community vote to tweak tokenomics.</p>

<p>Google Cloud will add support for Polygon to its Blockchain Node Engine, which currently only supports Ethereum and Solana. Google Cloud will also build infrastructure to support Polygon zkEVM, a new blockchain within the Polygon ecosystem. By the end of Q3, Google Cloud will help developers deploy application-specific blockchains built with Polygon tech on its servers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The industry is experiencing a flight to quality as corporations seek to minimize risk when exploring new possibilities in Web3.</p>
<cite>Mitesh Agarwal, a managing director at Google Cloud, said in a statement</cite></blockquote>



<p>As part of its extensive partnership with Polygon Labs, Google Cloud has announced a range of benefits for Polygon Ventures, including hosting credits on its servers and access to its Web3 startup program. Polygon developers will also receive similar benefits, while Google Cloud will tailor its infrastructure to suit Polygon’s ecosystem. Polygon’s impressive list of clients, which includes Starbucks and Mastercard, demonstrates its growing importance in the industry.</p>



<p>This partnership represents a significant expansion of Google Cloud&#8217;s engagement with blockchain protocols. It goes beyond the level of support provided to Celo developers under the existing Google for Startups Cloud Program. Despite the current regulatory climate and market conditions, Google Cloud&#8217;s increased focus on Web3 is clear. </p>



<p>In the first half of 2022, it created digital assets and Web3 engineering teams and has since partnered with several labs and foundations to support a range of blockchains, including BNB Chain, Solana, Aptos, Tezos, Casper, and Celo.</p>



<p>The partnership with Polygon will help onboard more people into Web3 and minimize risk when exploring new possibilities in the industry.</p>

<p>The recent prank call made to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, by Russian pranksters posing as the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has raised concerns about the security of the financial sector. The pranksters managed to deceive the Chairman and a video of the fake call was posted online, where Powell answered questions on various topics such as inflation and the Russian Central Bank. </p>



<p>The Fed spokesperson confirmed that Powell thought he was speaking to Zelenskiy. The <a href="https://rumble.com/v2kpne4-the-main-victims-of-western-sanctions-prank-with-the-chairman-of-the-fri-je.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://rumble.com/v2kpne4-the-main-victims-of-western-sanctions-prank-with-the-chairman-of-the-fri-je.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">video </a>shows Powell talking to the pranksters who had posed as Zelenskiy in several clips.</p>



<p>Although the video&#8217;s comments appear inconsequential, the prank raises concerns about the ease with which the Federal Reserve Chairman was tricked. The pranksters, Vladimir Kuznetsov, and Alexei Stolyarov, have used similar impersonations. The incident highlights the need to be extra vigilant against potential threats to the financial system, especially regarding high-ranking officials.</p>



<p>The Federal Reserve is responsible for implementing monetary policy in the United States, and the Chairman is a critical figure in the global financial system. Thus, this incident raises serious questions about the security of the Chairman&#8217;s communications and the need to ensure that similar incidents do not occur.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1935.png"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="420" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1935.png" alt="Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Tricked By Russian Posing As Ukrainian President" class="wp-image-184473" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1935.png 640w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1935-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Tricked By Russian Posing As Ukrainian President 31"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While it is unclear what motivated the pranksters to impersonate Zelenskiy, the incident is a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining the integrity and security of financial institutions. It is also a reminder that individuals and organizations must be cautious when communicating with unknown parties, especially those claiming to be high-ranking officials.</p>



<p>The incident also shows that even the most powerful institutions and individuals are not immune to potential threats. It highlights the need for financial institutions to continuously update their security protocols and invest in the latest technologies to ensure that vulnerabilities are minimized and threats are neutralized.</p>

<p>The news comes on the heels of the exchange launching a large fund geared at assisting promising firms with potential listing on the local Launchpad. This year&#8217;s market has been dominated by AI hype. Investors, as well as cryptocurrency leaders, are placing large bets on the AI business.</p>



<p>Fetch.ai offers the foundation for the development of self-driving services. Its main product is the artificial intelligence (AI) agent network, which is a decentralized network of autonomous agents capable of performing a variety of activities, such as data processing and complicated financial modeling. </p>



<p>In addition, the project provides a smart wallet with automation and connection with OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT API. In January 2023, only months after its introduction, the artificial intelligence chatbot topped 100 million users.</p>



<p>Bitget will provide marketing and other essential direction advice to guarantee that the Fetch.ai ecosystem is correctly positioned on the market to capture the attention of the community and possible commercial partners. The listing of Fetch.ai ecosystem tokens or token sales on the Bitget Launchpad platform will also give general assistance for the Fetch.ai ecosystem.</p>

<p>Bitget&#8217;s Managing Director, Gracy Chen, remarked:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We know value when we see it. Fetch.ai already consists of a host of functioning and applicable technological AI solutions that can have a real impact on the way businesses and individuals interact. That is the main reason we have decided to pledge our support to this promising startup and will continue to do so as we identify others in need of assistance from our dedicated fund.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Because of its harmonic heterogeneity, the Fetch.ai network may operate as an off-chain layer for any other layer-1 network and as an interchain bridge between blockchain networks on the market. The Fetch.ai ecosystem&#8217;s core benefit is its capacity to allow modular P2P interactions across numerous services and economic settlements.</p>



<p>The Fetch.ai ecosystem can offer its consumers with a variety of unique software solutions by using its decentralized machine learning algorithms, which are aided by an integrated client library, an indexer for rapid querying, and a CLI tool for contract development and testing.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184263-bitget-exchange-restricts-in-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Bitget services will soon be restricted to Hong Kong consumers owing to new regulatory restrictions that go into effect on June 1. To continue trading on the platform, Hong Kong users must move their assets to BitgetX Hong Kong.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The US GDP growth rate in Q1 2023 was only 1.1%, lower than the expected 2%.</em></li>



<li><em>Weakness in the housing and business investment sectors were attributed to sensitivity to interest rates.</em></li>



<li><em>Policymakers must focus on boosting economic growth in key sectors to ensure long-term stability.</em></li>

<p>The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an important indicator determining a country&#8217;s economic growth, international trade, fiscal policy, investor confidence, and social welfare. The latest data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday reveals that the US GDP has increased at an annual rate of 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>However, this growth is less than the expected rate of 2%, which is slower than the growth rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter. There are several reasons for this slower growth rate. For instance, the housing and business investment sectors experienced weakness in Q1, which can be attributed to their sensitivity to interest rates. The Federal Reserve has attempted to curb inflation by raising rates by approximately five percentage points since early last year.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1928.png"><img decoding="async" width="1004" height="405" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1928.png" alt="US GDP Growth Rate Falls To 1.1% In Q1 2023, Weakness In Key Sectors" class="wp-image-184458" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1928.png 1004w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1928-300x121.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1928-768x310.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1928-750x303.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px" title="US GDP Growth Rate Falls To 1.1% In Q1 2023, Weakness In Key Sectors 39"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Despite increased consumer spending, federal government spending, exports, state and local government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment, the drop in private inventory investment and residential fixed investment partly offset these. This slower growth rate than expected will likely impact investor confidence, fiscal policy, and international trade. Additionally, the news comes when nations worldwide are steering away from dependency on the US dollar.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see how the US government responds to this news and what steps it takes to stimulate economic growth in the future. The slowdown in economic growth will also impact the country&#8217;s social welfare, including job creation and income levels. Policymakers must focus on ways to boost economic growth, particularly in the housing and business investment sectors, to ensure the long-term stability of the US economy.</p>
