<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OSL, a digital assets platform supported by Fidelity, reduced costs as the industry-wide ripple effects of the ongoing volatility in the crypto markets persisted.</em></li>



<li><em>Due to current market conditions, the Hong Kong-based company is reducing expenditures by around 30%, including headcount reduction.</em></li>



<li><em>With the job cuts, OSL becomes the most recent cryptocurrency company to reduce headcount as the market struggles with asset prices that are still far below their peak in late 2021.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>OSL, a Fidelity-backed digital assets platform, is reducing expenses by nearly a third due to the decline in the cryptocurrency markets, according to a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-17/fidelity-backed-osl-cuts-headcount-as-crypto-companies-retrench" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em> report.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Hugh</strong> <strong>Madden</strong>, CEO of BC Technology Group, the parent company of <strong>OSL</strong>, said in a statement on Tuesday that the choice to reduce expenses was <strong>made in reaction “to current market conditions” and &#8220;headcount reduction.&#8221; </strong>OSL, based in Hong Kong, declined to say how many jobs were eliminated.</p>



<p><strong>OSL</strong> provides software solutions for institutional investors as well as trading and custody of digital assets.</p>



<p>With the job cuts, <strong>OSL</strong> is the most recent cryptocurrency company to reduce headcount as the market struggles with asset prices that are still far below their peak in late 2021. When one of the main exchanges, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160875-sbf-denounces-shares-ftx-us-untrue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, abruptly shut down in November, the effects of the crypto winter were exculpated.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160413-cryptocom-announced-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, following a prior round of layoffs in the middle of last year, <strong>Crypto.com </strong>eliminated<strong> 20% of its global employees</strong> last week. According to <strong>Kris</strong> <strong>Marszalek</strong>, the CEO of Crypto.com, the decision was derived from a number of things, including ongoing economic headwinds and unexpected industry happenings. This is one of the notable staff cuts from the beginning of the year to now.</p>



<p>In addition, <strong>Coinbase</strong> <strong>Global</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159274-coinbase-to-cut-950-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost</a> about <strong>950 jobs</strong>, or about <strong>25% of its workforce</strong>. The exchange expects to lay off roughly 950 workers in order to cut operating costs by about<strong> 25%</strong> on a quarterly basis.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>With aspirations to develop a cooperative decentralizing staking pool, Diva just closed a $3.5 million seed round sponsored by A&amp;T Capital.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol is designed to provide benefits to both inactive investors and full-time node operators, with awards being socialized over the network to produce consistent and predictable reward rates.</em></li>



<li><em>In contrast to the centralized delegated pools of today, Diva&#8217;s DVT incorporates a number of advances to provide truly decentralized staking.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>A community-driven Liquid Staking system called <a href="https://divalabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diva</a> has <a href="https://divalabs.medium.com/here-comes-the-diva-liquid-staking-powered-by-distributed-validators-9e5c3bd38896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finished</a> raising seed capital and will shortly go live on the Ethereum mainnet.</strong></h5>

<p>The first product offering a <strong>Liquid Staking Derivative (divETH)</strong> driven entirely by<strong> Distributed Validation Technology is Diva (DVT)</strong>.</p>



<p>Participants earn a <strong>1:1 ratio</strong> of <strong>divETH</strong>, a freely transferable liquid asset, in exchange for staking <strong>ETH</strong> on <strong>Diva</strong>. Staker wallets tally up any <strong>divETH</strong> rewards on a daily basis. After <strong>the March 2023</strong> <strong>Capella</strong> <strong>update</strong>, <strong>DivETH</strong> can be unstaked and exchanged for <strong>ETH</strong> at any time, once more at a<strong> 1:1 ratio</strong>.</p>



<p>On Diva, nodes form groups by posting bonds totaling<strong> 1 ETH </strong>and working together. A full validation node is formed when each group of <strong>16 nodes </strong>is matched against <strong>16 ETH</strong> from diverse network stakers.</p>



<p>When ETH is put into <strong>Diva</strong>, it is added to additional deposits to meet the<strong> 32 ETH</strong> threshold for <strong>Ethereum</strong> <strong>Validators</strong>. Using its P2P consensus layer, the <strong>Node</strong> <strong>Operators</strong> are responsible for managing these validators.</p>



<p>Thanks to its built-in economic incentives and the cryptographic nature of the <strong>MPC DKG</strong> threshold signatures, the platform is tolerant of censorship, outages, and malicious assaults.</p>

<p>In contrast to the centralized delegated pools of today, its <strong>DVT</strong> incorporates a number of advances to provide true decentralized staking.</p>



<p><strong>Staked.vc, Gnosis, Bankless, OKX Ventures, Metaweb, DCV Capital, Alphemy Capital, Very Early Ventures,</strong> and angel investors from projects like <strong>Metacartel</strong>, <strong>Aave, Staking Rewards, zkEVM, ZKValidator, EthGlobal, EigenLayer, Aragon,</strong> and <strong>Stakely</strong> contributed to the <strong>$3.5 million seed round</strong>, which was led by<strong> A&amp;T Capital</strong>.</p>



<p>On <strong>January 23</strong>, the project will make its private testnet available to the public. A preliminary version of Diva is now being audited by its development team, and its mainnet release is anticipated in the coming months.</p>

<p>Solana Foundation, Ripple, and GBBC have formed partnership to support crypto climate change solutions. <strong>The Blockchain x Climate Leadership Network (BxC)</strong> is a new non-profit organization that intends to be &#8220;the greatest single collective gathering of climate action innovators, leaders, and builders worldwide.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>In the fall of 2022</strong>, BxC, formerly known as the Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offsetting Working Group (BICOWG), brought together members from major cryptocurrency and environmental organizations in Colombia. Some of the working groups formed at that meeting are still active today and will form the foundation of BxC. These groups are working on <strong>carbon market registries, standards and auditability, policy formulation, regenerative finance, and emerging markets in the global south.</strong></p>



<p>This year, the presence of cryptocurrency on the promenade outside<strong> the main forum center is comparably low</strong>, and the sector is making a determined effort to draw attention to initiatives with real-world applications and social benefit.</p>

<p>According to Hwang &#8211; BxC strategic adviser, who works on creating the infrastructure for the initiative, such as carbon credit measurements, which <strong>calculate the lowered amount of greenhouse gases produced by human actions</strong>, his team has been gathering every week for the last two and a half years hosting workshops and forums concentrated on education. The initiative aims to <strong>formulate principles of collaboration and methodologies for climate-related blockchain activities in many sectors</strong>, as well as business applications for climate-crypto enterprises.</p>



<p>Efforts to use cryptocurrency to promote climate change mitigation efforts are mostly focused on<strong> developing new economies that do not affect the environment.</strong> The Solana Foundation and Ripple are founding partners, while the environmentally conscious<strong> layer 1 blockchain Regen Network</strong> and the environmental advocacy group Climate Collective are supporting partners. <strong>The program will be led by GBBC and Eqo Networks</strong>, which specializes in developing such climate-conscious leadership networks. The crypto climate is looking forward to the positive change after the collaboration among the three organizations which are Solana, Ripple, and GBBC</p>

<p>According to TaxBit CEO <strong>Austin Woodward</strong>, this will make it easier for institutional customers to manage the process of tracking cryptocurrency transactions and pricing for reporting, which should enable customers to close their books in days rather than months.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;TaxBit historically focused on top-of-market Enterprises, but it became evident that businesses of all sizes accepting, trading, or holding digital assets are in need of automated accounting solutions. As we got to know Tactic, it was clear that their world-class technical team, products, and culture perfectly align with what we are building and how we operate at TaxBit,&#8221; Woodward said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With a single system of records for crypto tax and accounting, <strong>TaxBit</strong> was established in <strong>2018</strong>. In contrast, <strong>Tactic</strong> was introduced in <strong>2021</strong> to assist companies in maintaining their accounting procedures. According to Woodward, Tactic&#8217;s personnel and software will fully integrate with TaxBit over the upcoming months.</p>

<p>To cut down on crypto accounting operations by as much as <strong>75%</strong>, <strong>Tactic</strong> offers accounting automation tools, seamless interaction with other financial software packages, and enhanced visibility.</p>



<p>The acquisition follows a period of intense unrest in the markets for digital assets. The mission-critical requirement for transparency, especially in the form of auditable and verifiable accounting, has been underscored by recent crypto market occurrences. With cutting-edge and legal solutions for tracking, processing, and reporting transactions, <strong>TaxBit</strong> can assist in regaining investor confidence as regulations change and scrutiny rises.</p>

<p>This exchange has implemented the <strong>BNB Auto-Burn burning mechanism</strong>, which promises to help <strong>build a healthy blockchain ecosystem together with the BSC &amp; BNB community</strong>. Currently, there are two main mechanisms for burning BNB. First, part of the gas fee spent on BSC is burned in real time as introduced in <strong>BEP95</strong>. Since Binance did the Bruno upgrade for BNB<strong> on November 30, 2021</strong>,<strong> BSC burns around 860 BNB per day</strong>.</p>



<p>Second, the exchange burns BNB quarterly based on its “<strong>accelerated BNB burn</strong>” plan, with last quarter being the 17th time the exchange burned<strong> 1,335,888 BNB from circulation</strong>. And in the future, Binance&#8217;s quarterly BNB burn plan will be replaced by BNB Auto-Burn.</p>



<p>According to Binance, “BNB Auto-Burn will be objective and verifiable, independent of the revenue generated on the platform through the use of BNB, and will automatically adjust where the burn amount will be based on,”. BNB price, accordingly, will reflect the supply and demand for BNB, as well as the number of blocks produced in a quarter calculated on the basis of on-chain information.</p>

<p>According to Sagi Maman, CEO and co-founder of Xternity, his company intends to expedite blockchain game development by allowing developers to &#8220;<strong>select their own environment</strong>&#8221; and gamers to feel <strong>ownership of digital assets.</strong></p>



<p>Synergy Land is a role-playing game under development <strong>by Synergy Games</strong> that takes place in a fantasy world divided into four ecosystems: earth, water, fire, and ice. The player will assume the role of a hero, exploring dungeons with up to four other players on a great adventure against very powerful creatures, using a fully dynamic and innovative spell system that will allow players to combine elements to cast spells, creating new beneficial or harmful synergies.</p>



<p>Synergy Land is currently a small project that <strong>hopes to complete a &#8220;Initial Game Offering&#8221; by the end of the first quarter of this year,</strong> according to a business release. A team of 25 people is in charge of the game&#8217;s development.</p>

<p><strong>Filecoin</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong> previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/91897-lockheed-martin-filecoin-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an early endeavor with <strong>Lockheed Martin </strong>to deploy<strong> IPFS</strong> in space to speed up data transfer over large distances in <strong>May</strong> <strong>2022</strong> at the <strong>Davos Economic Forum</strong>. By taking advantage of decentralized storage in space and investigating use cases for how <strong>IPFS</strong> may improve interplanetary communication and data transport, this mission is the next stage in that endeavor.</p>

<p>The evaluation of in-space use cases for decentralized storage is being done on this mission for the first time.

<p>A decentralized protocol called <strong>IPFS</strong> is used to store and share data, and it uses content-addressing to identify files in a certain way. The <strong>Filecoin</strong> <strong>network</strong>, a decentralized storage network fueled by cryptocurrencies, is built on the IPFS protocol.</p>



<p>The mission will showcase an IPFS use case for space-to-ground communication. Through the use of IPFS, data from space will be content-addressed and made accessible on the IPFS network. Applications using IPFS will be able to access the data without having to know the precise position of the ground station hosting the data by leveraging the IPFS network.</p>



<p>Space-to-space communication is one of several use cases, architectures, and topologies for which the IPFS software layer is intended to be useful. The software is being developed publicly under an open-source license.</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that the deal was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-17/animoca-s-cryptoslam-forkast-news-merge-in-crypto-consolidation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">steered</a> by<strong> Yat Siu</strong>, the founder and executive chairman of <strong>Animoca Brands</strong>. The agreement&#8217;s terms weren&#8217;t made public.</p>



<p><strong>Forkast</strong> <strong>Labs</strong> wants to create a new benchmark for determining the real worth of Web3 and the digital economy by combining on-chain data intelligence and the media.</p>



<p>The new company will begin by releasing data indices, <strong>APIs</strong>, and business intelligence tools to gauge the digital economy using real-time on-chain data, establishing a common framework for investors to assess blockchain initiatives.</p>



<p><strong>Angie Lau</strong>, a former Bloomberg anchor and the creator of Forkast.News, and<strong> Randy Wasinger</strong>, the creator of CryptoSlam, will serve as <strong>co-CEOs</strong> of <strong>Forkast Labs</strong>. Co-founder of Forkast.News<strong> Sarah Chang</strong> will serve as <strong>COO</strong> of the new company.</p>



<p><strong>Angie Lau </strong>said in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/01/17/2589581/0/en/CryptoSlam-and-Forkast-News-to-Form-New-Data-Intelligence-Platform-Forkast-Labs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This merger comes at a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. The entire industry has been valued against volatile price movements, which has created a high degree of speculation. Trust in crypto has been eroded as a result, but we have the power to change that with this merger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Launched in 2018, <strong>CryptoSlam</strong> is one of the most-used trackers of transactions of <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</strong>. For the data provider, <strong>Animoca</strong> led a <strong>$9 million</strong> seed round one year ago. The Hong Kong-based blockchain investor and gaming studio have previously taken part in a <strong>$1.7 million capital fundraising</strong> for the video journalism company <strong>Forkast.News</strong>.</p>

<p>The digital asset bank <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000131210923000020/ex991si4q22earningsrelease.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> in a <strong>US</strong> <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) </strong>report that it had significant deposit outflows in the fourth quarter of 2022 and took steps to maintain cash liquidity, including selling debt securities and securing wholesale funding.</p>



<p>For the quarter, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160264-silvergate-sued-securities-law-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silvergate</a> reported a net loss of <strong>$1.05 billion</strong> as opposed to a profit of <strong>$18.4 million</strong> at the same time last year. The anticipated <strong>$1.7 billion</strong> in securities that the business plans to sell in the first quarter of 2023 to lower borrowings resulted in a loss on securities of <strong>$751 million</strong> and an impairment charge of <strong>$135 million</strong>, respectively.</p>



<p>The report states that in the fourth quarter of 2022, customers deposited an average of <strong>$7.3 billion </strong>in digital assets. Deposits were approximately <strong>$12 billion</strong> in the third quarter of 2022, which is a big decrease from this.</p>

<p>The business reported a <strong>$949 million</strong> <strong>loss</strong> for the entire year of 2022 as opposed to a net income of <strong>$75.5 million</strong> in <strong>2021</strong>.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s announcement that it had eliminated <strong>40% of its workforce </strong>and seen an <strong>$8.1 billion outflow of customer deposits of digital assets</strong> at the beginning of January predicted the bank&#8217;s performance for the most recent quarter. It anticipates <strong>$8.1 million</strong> in restructuring costs related to the layoffs, the majority of which will be recognized this quarter.</p>



<p>The fallout from the failure of cryptocurrency companies last year, which peaked in November with the closure of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160451-court-approved-ftx-to-sell-4-subsidiaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, shook <strong>Silvergate</strong>.</p>

<p>The corporation stated that despite the losses, it is taking steps to get ready for a prolonged period of fewer deposits. The notice states that <strong>Silvergate is controlling its cost structure, assessing its product line, and reviewing its clientele.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The digital asset industry experienced a transformational shift, with significant over-leverage in the industry-leading to several high-profile bankruptcies. These dynamics created a crisis of confidence across the ecosystem and led many industry participants to shift to a &#8216;risk off&#8217; position across digital asset trading platforms.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the difficulties, <strong>Alan</strong> <strong>Lane</strong>, the CEO of Silvergate, <a href="https://ir.silvergate.com/news/news-details/2023/Silvergate-Capital-Corporation-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-2022-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emphasized</a> that the company still has faith in the digital asset sector and is dedicated to keeping a highly liquid balance sheet and a strong capital position.</p>

<p>Additionally, at around the same time, it launched an offline payment feature for its <strong>e-CNY</strong> payment app. <em>Yicai Global</em> has <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/e-yuan-app-adds-payment-function-for-when-mobiles-are-offline-out-of-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the<strong> Tap to Pay</strong> feature can be utilized to complete payments even when a mobile phone is turned off. Users can pick how much they want to pay and how many times they want to utilize the function after their phone shuts down by activating it in the <strong>e-CNY app</strong>.</p>

<p>From the end of 2022, the <strong>People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC)</strong>, the country&#8217;s central bank, began including the <strong>e-CNY</strong> in its calculations of <strong>M0</strong>, or the entire amount of currency in circulation, including bank reserves.</p>



<p>The <strong>PBOC</strong> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3206421/china-digital-currency-e-cny-included-official-cash-figures-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> on<strong> January 11</strong> that there were over <strong>13.61 billion yuan of <strong>digital yuan</strong> </strong>in circulation across pilot cities at the end of last year, which accounted for roughly<strong> 0.13% </strong>of the <strong>M0</strong> supply at the time.</p>
