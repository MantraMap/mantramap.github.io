In addition, he stated that the central bank views payment stablecoins as a form of money, emphasizing that it would be appropriate to have a robust federal role in what happens in stablecoin regulations going forward.</strong></p>
<h2>Powell on Crypto’s Staying Power</h2>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell answered some questions about cryptocurrency and stablecoins during his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH) stated that crypto currently has a market cap of about $1.1 trillion. He then asked Powell: &#8220;Do you acknowledge that this asset class has staying power in the U.S. economy?&#8221; The Fed chairman replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>It appears to have some staying power.</p></blockquote>
<p>Powell then noted that a year ago the market cap of the crypto market was a lot higher.</p>
<p>Rep. Davidson promptly explained that the crypto market had some &#8220;volatility in large measure due to the lack of legal clarity.&#8221; He added that the committee aims to change this, noting that several bills are coming out, including one on <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20230613/116085/BILLS-118pih-Toprovidefortheregulation.pdf">stablecoins</a>.</p>
<p>The congressman further stated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been active in the crypto space. He emphasized that the upcoming bills should provide clarity for SEC Chair Gary Gensler as well as Congress and industry participants. Last week, Davidson and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) introduced the SEC Stabilization Act to &#8220;restructure the Securities and Exchange Commission and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/republican-congressman-seeks-to-oust-sec-chair-gensler-with-sec-stabilization-act/">remove Gary Gensler</a> as Chair of the SEC.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Powell Sees Payment Stablecoins as a Form of Money</h2>
<p>Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) asked Powell about stablecoins during his testimony. She explained that she and her Republican colleagues have &#8220;proposed a stablecoin bill that will create 58 different licenses, with federal regulatory approval over only two of the licenses. The remaining 56 licenses can be issued by each state, territory, and D.C. with little or no federal oversight, regulation, or enforcement.” Powell told the committee:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do see payment stablecoins as a form of money … We believe that it would be appropriate to have quite a robust federal role in what happens in stablecoins going forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Leaving us with a weak role and allowing a lot of private money creation at the state level would be a mistake,” Powell stressed. He also noted that “In all advanced economies, the ultimate source of credibility in money is the central bank.”</p>

<h2>Cleanspark Secures Georgia Bitcoin Facilities</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cleanspark.com">Cleanspark</a> (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-CLSK/">CLSK</a>) announced on Wednesday that it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire two turnkey bitcoin mining campuses. The facilities, situated in Dalton, Georgia, are expected to accommodate 6,000 Antminer S19 XPs and S19J Pro+s, according to Cleanspark.</p>
<p>Cleanspark revealed that it has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-bolsters-hashrate-with-40-5m-purchase-of-12500-bitcoin-miners/">expanded</a> its operations this year by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-purchases-45000-bitcoin-mining-devices-adding-6-3-eh-s-to-current-fleet/">acquiring</a> a total of 77,500 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-boosts-bitcoin-mining-capacity-with-acquisition-of-20000-bitmain-rigs/">since February</a> of last year. “This acquisition ensures that we have more than enough infrastructure to reach our year-end target of 16 EH/s,” Zach Bradford, the CEO of Cleanspark stated on Wednesday. “It also continues to position us as one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis.”</p>
<p>The publicly listed bitcoin miner asserts that 90% of its energy mix is derived from low-carbon energy sources. Similar to other bitcoin mining companies listed on the stock exchange, Cleanspark&#8217;s shares rose on June 21, 2023, increasing by 10% against the U.S. dollar at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. “We continue to make use of opportunities created by current market conditions to prepare for next year’s bitcoin halving,” Gary A. Vecchiarelli, the CFO at Cleanspark, added during the announcement.</p>

<p>While many bitcoin miners faced difficulties during the crypto winter of 2022, the situation has been quite different for operators in 2023. The price of bitcoin has surged significantly since then, after hitting a low of $16,565 per unit on December 31, 2022, and advancements in next-generation machinery have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-study-highlights-bitmains-s19-mining-rigs-dominate-bitcoin-networks-hashrate/">greatly enhanced</a> the hashrate. Currently, one of the main challenges for miners is the highly intricate mining difficulty, which is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-gears-up-for-fourth-surge-in-mining-difficulty-amid-record-highs-and-unwavering-miners/">anticipated to increase</a> once again on June 27, 2023.</p>

The company’s managing partner Leigh Goehring explained in a recent interview that gold will play a crucial role as a settlement mechanism.</strong></p>
<h2>Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg Predicts Gold &#8216;Will Blow Through&#8217; $2K Thanks to Central Bank Demand</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, June 21, 2023, digital currency markets have <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">risen</a> by 6.98% over the last 24 hours, but <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">precious metal markets</a> have been lackluster. Gold is hovering just above the $1,930 range, while silver is coasting along under $23. Leigh Goehring, a partner from the investment management firm Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg, believes gold could reach the $2,100 per unit range this year. Goehring <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-06-20/Central-banks-are-preparing-for-a-new-monetary-regime-with-gold-playing-a-key-role-says-Goehring-Rozencwajg.html">shared his forecast</a> with Kitco News, explaining that a new monetary regime is forming and gold will be an integral part of the new set of rules and monetary practices.</p>

<p>The executive of the investment firm explained that emerging economies are utilizing their central banks to amass a substantial stockpile of gold. He also observes that the U.S. dollar may forfeit its reserve status globally, with potentially massive repercussions. &#8220;The U.S. dollar might be on the verge of losing its reserve currency status,&#8221; the Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg managing partner stated. &#8220;A change in the dollar&#8217;s reserve currency status would be the most impactful market shock of the last forty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goehring notes that central banks, particularly in emerging economies such as China, India, and Turkey, have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-banks-continue-to-show-strong-demand-for-gold-in-2023-says-world-gold-council-report/">increasing</a> their gold reserves. Central bank gold purchasing reached <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/data-from-october-shows-gold-reserves-held-by-central-banks-tapped-the-highest-level-in-47-years/">record-breaking levels</a> at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The executive believes that assertive gold buying has the potential to propel the price above $2,000 per ounce and play a role in a shift in the monetary regime. In his interview with Kitco, Goehring adamantly maintained that his prediction will materialize. Goehring stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will break through the triple top that we put in place at the $2,000 an ounce level. We will blow through it, and the central bank buying will be the big push.</p></blockquote>
<p>A newly formed monetary regime change will likely happen this decade, Goehring stressed, and he wholeheartedly believes that gold and other valuable commodities will be used for settlement. &#8220;The monetary regime changes in 1930, 1968, and 1998 were hugely stimulative for commodity prices, and we believe the monetary regime change that will take place this decade will be no different,&#8221; Goehring explained.</p>

<p>Goehring&#8217;s view is not uncommon among investors who believe that gold is on the verge of a meteoric rise. Rick Rule, the founder of Rule Investment Media, is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gold-prices-poised-to-skyrocket-as-expert-predicts-fourfold-increase-in-demand/">confident</a> that gold will skyrocket in value in 2023, and the prominent investment bank UBS <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ubs-offers-3-reasons-to-buy-gold-now-forecasts-all-time-high-this-year/">predicts</a> that gold will reach an all-time high this year. Goehring suggested that if gold was chosen to be the ultimate settlement tool, within the new financial order, it could improve capital imbalances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we exploring this idea of trying to undermine the dollar reserve status and settle things in local currencies and be able to eventually take out capital imbalances through gold? It&#8217;s an interesting idea,” the investment management firm Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg&#8217;s executive told the financial news publication.</p>

Lately, these rare satoshi artifacts have captivated the collector community.</strong></p>
<h2>The Quest for Rare Satoshis</h2>
<p>As the popularity of Ordinal inscriptions <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-records-over-12-million-ordinal-inscriptions-miners-accumulate-46-million-as-brc20-market-cap-declines/">surged</a> on the Bitcoin blockchain, individuals embraced the technology to meticulously categorize satoshis, the smallest divisible unit of Bitcoin. Derived from the name of Bitcoin&#x2019;s visionary creator, satoshis represent the smallest fractions of the cryptocurrency thoroughly documented on the ledger.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-594320 size-full" title="Exploring the World of Rare Satoshis: Collectors Embrace the Value of Unique Bitcoin Artifacts" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/numis.webp" alt="Exploring the World of Rare Satoshis: Collectors Embrace the Value of Unique Bitcoin Artifacts" width="600" height="250"></p>
<p>In a recent twist, collectors have begun <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=rare%20satoshis%20&src=typed_query">attributing higher value</a> to particular satoshis, either due to their rarity or their association with legendary milestones. Enthusiasts are now on the hunt for these luxury satoshis, eagerly inspecting their holdings in hopes of uncovering ancient treasures acquired over time.</p>
<p>The topic has been circulating on social media, and numerous individuals have posted <a href="https://twitter.com/0xAbhiP/status/1671227505636966400?s=20">Twitter threads</a> on the subject. Others have authored comprehensive articles explaining rare satoshis and providing instructions on how individuals can verify their ownership of such sats. On May 16, the author known as Old School Crypto published an <a href="https://medium.com/@johnnytdong/what-are-rare-sats-5fc9c8ac890e">editorial</a> that extensively discusses rare satoshis.</p>
<p>The article includes images illustrating the definitions of common satoshis, which encompass any satoshi that was not the first in a block. Uncommon satoshis, on the other hand, represent the first satoshi in a block, and currently, there are nearly seven million of this type.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-594289 size-full" title="Exploring the World of Rare Satoshis: Collectors Embrace the Value of Unique Bitcoin Artifacts" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fzfhdgkagaie_2e.png" alt="Exploring the World of Rare Satoshis: Collectors Embrace the Value of Unique Bitcoin Artifacts" width="1002" height="656" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fzfhdgkagaie_2e-300x196.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fzfhdgkagaie_2e-768x503.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fzfhdgkagaie_2e.png 1002w" sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px"></p>
<p>Another collectible sat is a satoshi that represents the first satoshi of the initial block linked to a new difficulty epoch, with fewer than 3,500 of them available. An epic satoshi refers to the first satoshi in the initial block associated with block-halving events. Additionally, there is the first satoshi in the Genesis block, and other rare satoshis could be connected to significant historical events. These historical events encompass the first transaction, the pizza transaction, a satoshi mined within the first 1,000 blocks, and more.</p>

<p>As described in Old School Crypto&#x2019;s article, the marketplace <a href="https://www.ord.io/">Ord.io</a>, within the Ordinal platform, allows users to explore and filter these types of satoshis using the &#x201C;satributes&#x201D; filter. Ord.io&#x2019;s website showcases nine distinct types of satributes, encompassing uncommon, common, rare, epic, vintage, Nakamoto, first transaction, palindrome, pizza, block 9, and block 78.</p>

<p>The concept of assigning numismatic value to bitcoin is not new, as individuals have linked the currency to notable events such as the Silk Road, Satoshi&#x2019;s first transaction with Hal, and others. Physical bitcoins like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/close-to-250-casascius-physical-bitcoins-were-redeemed-in-6-months-1-9b-in-btc-remain-active/">Casascius coins</a> have gained value beyond their original loadings. In 2011, users on bitcointalk.org <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36020.0;wap2">engaged in discussions</a> regarding the purchase of a single bitcoin for 1.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, which was associated with the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0">2010 pizza transaction</a>.</p>

<h2>Fed Chair Powell on Future Rate Hikes and Inflation</h2>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled more interest rate hikes this year in his prepared remarks before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday. His speech was part of his appearance on Capitol Hill to present the Federal Reserve&#8217;s semiannual Monetary Policy Report. During the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week, Fed officials decided to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">pause</a> raising interest rates after 10 consecutive rate hikes.</p>
<p>&#8220;In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the FOMC decided last week to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5-1/4 percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings,&#8221; the Fed chair detailed, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Given how far we’ve come, it may make sense to move rates higher but to do so at a more moderate pace,” Powell clarified during the question-and-answer session with committee members.</p>
<p>The Fed chair also noted: “The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain.”</p>
<p>Twelve of the 18 Fed policymakers indicated last week that they expect at least two more rate hikes this year while four projected a single rate hike. Only two officials expect the Fed to keep its key rate at its current level through year’s end.</p>

<p>Regarding inflation, Powell stressed that it remains well above the Fed&#8217;s goal of 2%. While noting that “Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,” he emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.</p></blockquote>
<p>When considering the necessary measures to achieve a 2% inflation rate over time, Powell affirmed that the Fed will continue to make its decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account “the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”</p>
<p>Last week, the Fed chairman rejected the possibility of a rate cut in the near future, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-us-dollar-decline-will-be-far-greater-than-yellen-warns-fed-chair-powell-clearly-worried-about-financial-crisis/">stating</a> that while “it will be appropriate to cut rates at a time when inflation is coming down really significantly, we’re talking about a couple of years out.”</p>

A mere five days had elapsed since the 12 million milestone was reached, indicating a persistent demand for these inscriptions that shows no signs of diminishing. Moreover, there has been a recent enhancement in the Ordinal inscription technology, enabling a higher level of interconnectedness among the inscriptions.</strong></p>
<h2>Demand Soars as Ordinal Inscriptions on Bitcoin Blockchain Surpass 13 Million Mark</h2>
<p>Ordinal inscriptions remain significant despite recent criticism. As of this week, a record-breaking <a href="https://ordinals.com">13 million inscriptions</a> have been added to the Bitcoin blockchain, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. Presently, there are 13,059,248 ordinal inscriptions on the chain, and miners have earned <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">1,756 BTC</a>, valued at $50.44 million, in fees from this inscription trend.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ordinal inscriptions have contributed to the BRC20 economy, currently valued at $153.63 million, as <a href="https://www.brc-20.io">reported</a> by brc-20.io. Approximately 34,551 BRC20 tokens are listed, with the token ordi (ORDI) holding the largest market capitalization at $141.81 million. Consequently, the ORDI market represents over 92% of the total BRC20 market share. In the last month, the BRC20 token economy has experienced a significant decline in value, dropping from nearly half a billion dollars.</p>
<h2>Recursive Inscription Upgrade &#x2018;Unlocks Powerful Use Cases&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Apart from exceeding the 13 million mark, ordinal inscriptions have sparked conversations among enthusiasts regarding a recent addition to the Ordinals Protocol known as <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2167">recursive inscriptions</a>. This new feature enhances the efficiency of inscriptions by enabling interconnectedness among them. Leonidas, the operator of Ord.io and host of The Ordinals Show, <a href="https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1668098460766052353?s=20">clarified</a> that prior to the introduction of recursive inscriptions, ordinal inscriptions were &#x201C;self-contained and unaware of the other files that had been inscribed.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Through recursive inscriptions, files gain the ability to solicit the content of other inscriptions using a designated syntax. Leonidas elaborated on the upgrade, highlighting its potential applications, such as inscribing art collection traits for rendering images programmatically or storing code packages. Furthermore, this technology surpasses the current 4-megabyte (MB) limit, enabling larger data storage within <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks. &#x201C;This would unlock powerful use cases that could never be done in under 4 MB,&#x201D; Leonidas stated. &#x201C;The most complex pieces of software are just a bunch of code compiled together after all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The pseudonymous software developer added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now it becomes possible to put a complex 3D video game fully onchain on Bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin have gained significant attention, despite the criticism surrounding the technology. This, in turn, has stimulated inscription advancements on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/litecoins-daily-transaction-count-remains-elevated-as-ltc-ordinals-approach-4-million/">Litecoin</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/drc20-tokens-take-dogecoin-community-by-storm-driving-record-breaking-daily-transactions-on-the-network/">Dogecoin</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/introducing-ethscriptions-ethereums-take-on-inscribed-digital-artifacts/">Ethereum</a>. Moreover, Bitcoin has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/30-day-bitcoin-nft-sales-surge-to-173-million-securing-second-place-in-blockchain-market/">emerged</a> as the second-largest blockchain for non-fungible token (NFT) sales, a position it has maintained for nearly two months. As a result, individuals are now exploring the possibilities of recursive inscriptions, with Leonidas <a href="https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1668267875423887360?s=20">incorporating</a> this feature into the Ord.io marketplace.</p>

China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Qatarenergy inked a 27-year deal, outlining China&#8217;s commitment to procure liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar on an annual basis. Under the agreement, China will import a substantial four million metric tons of LNG per year from the Gulf nation. Moreover, CNPC will also obtain an equity stake in Qatar&#8217;s North Field LNG project, further solidifying their collaboration.</strong></p>
<h2>China and Qatar Sign 27-Year LNG Deal Further Solidifying Relationship Between Both Nations</h2>
<p>China is making steady progress in diversifying its currency deals and lessening its dependence on the U.S. dollar, and that includes fewer natural gas imports from the United States. Alongside various other BRICS nations, the Asian nation has been strategically maneuvering to reduce the prominence of the greenback in international trade.</p>
<p>In a noteworthy development at the end of March, China entered into a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-makes-advances-in-ditching-the-us-dollar-for-settlements-inks-deal-with-brazil-and-completes-first-yuan-lng-purchase/">bilateral agreement</a> with Brazil for the procurement of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with the settlement of the transaction taking place in yuan, facilitated by a French company.</p>
<p>On June 20, Reuters reported that Qatar and China have reached a substantial deal for LNG, with the two countries agreeing to collaborate for 27 years. Similar to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar is an emerging economy. Both regions were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/02/upgraded-the-arab-nations-joining-the-brics.html">upgraded</a> by the financial markets and benchmark firm MSCI in 2014 and joined the emerging BRICS economies.</p>
<p>According to the report, Qatarenergy signed a multi-year partnership with CNPC, enabling China to acquire four million metric tons of LNG annually. The news came after Qatar and the UAE <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-06-19/Qatar-UAE-agree-to-restore-diplomatic-representation-embassies-1kLejLDiyfm/index.html">announced</a> the resumption of their diplomatic ties on Monday.</p>
<p>Simultaneous to the agreement with CNPC, Saad al-Kaabi, Qatarenergy&#8217;s chief, also signed an identical deal with China&#8217;s petroleum and petrochemical enterprise group Sinopec. &#8220;Today we are signing two agreements that will further enhance our strong relations with one of the most important gas markets in the world and key market for Qatari energy products,&#8221; Kaabi stated.</p>

<h2>‘Right Now, China Is a Frenemy,’ Says Louisiana Senator</h2>
<p>American officials are divided on the matter, as an <a href="https://thecradle.co/article-view/26178/qatar-ready-to-ink-new-27-year-gas-deal-with-china">editorial</a> published by The Cradle explains that U.S. House speaker Kevin McCarthy praised China&#8217;s previous reliance on U.S. LNG reserves but questioned its necessity, citing a Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/13/u-s-natural-gas-industry-china-00085407">interview</a>. Thecradle.co also quotes Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy, someone who believes that China&#8217;s purchase of natural gas is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>“China gets guaranteed shipments at a certain price by providing upfront capital,” Cassidy said. “That, in turn, helps U.S. companies build export terminals, which drives demand for more U.S. drilling in places like Louisiana and Texas.” Cassidy further insisted China is a friendly rival. “Right now, China is a frenemy. If they — just like India, South Korea, Japan, the EU — are purchasing or buying, helping to pay for the capitalization of LNG export terminals, well, that’s a good thing.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Will China&#8217;s strategic partnerships and efforts to diversify its energy imports disrupt the dominance of the U.S. in global trade, or is it merely a temporary &#8216;frenemy&#8217; dynamic? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) raced to a six-week high in today&#x2019;s session, as bulls moved to recover all losses that came as a result of the SEC suing Binance and Coinbase</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit an intraday peak of $28,975.62 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $26,668.79.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s move sent the cryptocurrency to its strongest point since May 6, when price traded at $29,850.</p>

<p>Another catalyst for Wednesday&#x2019;s surge was a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>As of writing, price strength has moved beyond a ceiling at 58.00, and is currently tracking at 65.63.</p>
<p>In addition, the 10-day (red) moving average has also shifted course, and is closing in on a crossover with its 25-day (blue) moving average counterpart, which is another sign of upcoming bullish momentum.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also made notable gains on Wednesday, rising to its highest point in over a week.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,715.34 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to a high of $1,821.70 during today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of this move, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency hit its strongest point since June 10.</p>

<p>The 14-day RSI has also made similar strides, moving to a reading of 53.27, which is the most it has tracked at since earlier in the month.</p>
<p>This is marginally below a resistance level at 54.00, which has prompted previous bulls to gradually begin abandoning their positions.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is now trading at $1,811.34, after giving up earlier gains.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the announcement, the round was led by Shima Capital. The event saw the participation of other investors including: DFG, Jsquare, LD Capital, Cronos Labs, GTS Ventures, Bixin Ventures, ViaBTC Capital, Mars DAO, and Mirana Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the new funding will be used to further develop new product categories on Earn Network’s marketplace. The Earn Network has already developed DeFi Staking and soon will be adding three more categories &#8211; Lending, Liquid Staking &amp; Native Restaking. In addition, the funding will also help the platform hire more professionals to join its expert team, grow the community and establish new relationships with more base layers and projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Earn Network claims that existing centralized and traditional investment platforms are unable to harness the substantial value that arises from the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and its wider landscape. As a result, billions of dollars in potential investment opportunities and economic growth remain untapped, limiting the potential benefits for investors and hindering the overall development of the global economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Earn Network solves this by providing a &#8220;no-code&#8221; solution, where any individual can leverage secure and audited templates to create their custom financial products, like staking or borrowing pools. No more hidden fees, middlemen or tedious processes. A fully self-custodial, peer-to-peer platform allows both parties to freely transact. The user-friendly interface opens the door to any investor that is ready to explore new yield-bearing opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bartek Pozniak, CEO of the Earn Network, said:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to onboard millions to generate billions in the DeFi economy. We’ve set an ambitious goal to create a leading financial marketplace that’s ready for tomorrow. We want to create a renowned and user-friendly investment platform that gives equal opportunities to every participant worldwide.” says Bartek Pozniak, CEO of the Earn Network&#8221;.</span></p>

The move comes amid growing fears that a digital version of the common European currency may eventually become the only means of payment in the eurozone, despite currently being touted as merely an alternative.</strong></p>
<h2>Lawmakers in Slovakia Approve Constitutional Provision Preserving Cash Payments</h2>
<p>Slovaks will have the right to buy goods and services with cash guaranteed under an amendment to their constitution approved by a sizable majority in the nation’s parliament. According to a report by the Euractiv news portal, 111 out of 150 members of the legislature backed the respective draft law.</p>
<p>The legislation aims to protect physical payments in case that the use of the digital euro becomes mandatory in the eurozone, of which Slovakia is a member. The digital version of the euro area’s single currency is still under development led by the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>

<p>The amendment was proposed by the right-wing, Eurosceptic Sme Rodina (We Are Family) party. “It is very important that there is a provision in the Constitution based on which we can defend ourselves in the future against any orders from the outside, saying there can only be digital euro and no other payment options,” Miloš Svrček, one of the law’s authors, was quoted as stating.</p>
<p>EU institutions claim they don’t intend to replace cash with the new central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) but rather supplement it. However, critics suspect that transactions with it will be controlled by the ECB and fear <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecbs-panetta-reinforces-digital-euro-focus-on-payments/">digital euro payments</a> may become mandatory across the eurozone. Marián Viskupič, a liberal lawmaker, commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>It may be initially sold as an alternative, but gradually it will become apparent that it can only be exclusive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Viskupič added that the digital euro would facilitate the “monitoring of a person’s entire life” by the ECB and described the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-euro-key-for-european-payment-autonomy-ecb-president-lagarde-says/">CBDC project</a> as “a social engineer’s dream”. Far-right members of the legislature took a similar stance, warning about “total loss of privacy.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the National Council, as Slovakia’s parliament is called, also passed an amendment protecting the interests of merchants refusing to accept cash for “appropriate or generally applicable reasons.” Among them are operators of card-only vending machines and shopkeepers worried about robberies, for example.</p>
