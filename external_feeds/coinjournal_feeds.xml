]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Google search interest in the metaverse is down 92% from its peak, highlighting the fall from grace for the concept</li>
<li dir="ltr">92% of respondents globally said that they have heard of crypto, but only 8% considered themselves to be very familiar with the concept of Web3</li>
<li dir="ltr">Web3 often has trouble defining exactly what it is, with abstract and shifting goals frequently changing with time</li>
<li dir="ltr">Collapse of token economy and pullback in wider crypto space has curtailed enthusiasm</li>
<li dir="ltr">Web3 is not the metaverse, but there are valuable lessons to be had for tokens with regard to lofty goals and abstract descriptions&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Lockdowns, stimulus packages, social distancing &ndash; the year 2021 could not seem more different when looking back on it today.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The same holds true within crypto. The year saw Bitcoin sail past $68,000, El Salvador declare the orange coin as legal tender, cartoon monkey pictures sold for millions of dollars, and a doggy token by the name of Dogecoin at a valuation of $88 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the hysteria, a virtual world was touted more and more as the future. A future world where everybody could work, hang out and more, built on top of blockchain rails. They called it the &ldquo;metaverse&rdquo;. The only problem is, that clamour has become a whisper, as data for the search term &ldquo;metaverse&rdquo; on Google shows below, which is down 92% from its peak.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14727160">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2 dir="ltr">Web3 has also pulled back</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While the metaverse may be low hanging fruit to target, the more ubiquitous- and <em>somewhat</em> related &ndash; concept of Web3 has also struggled to maintain the excitement levels of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite lofty predictions that Web3 was on the verge of a parabolic rise, in a recent <a href="https://consensys.io/insight-report/web3-and-crypto-global-survey-2023"><u>survey</u></a> conducted by YouGov and Consensys, the results suggested this was nowhere near. While 92% of respondents globally said that they have heard of crypto, only 8% considered themselves to be very familiar with the concept of Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With so many aware of crypto yet so few familiar with what Web3 is, it may suggest two things. The first, quite simply, is that Web3 has had trouble catching on; the results not delivering on the lofty promises, the protocols struggling to deliver utility amid a declining crypto environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second is a long-running criticism of Web3; namely, it has trouble defining exactly what it is, at least without venturing into an overly abstract realm.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Interestingly, the same survey indicated enthusiasm around solving problems which proponents of Web3 claim it aims to fix. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">79% want more control over their identity on the Internet</li>
<li dir="ltr">83% think data privacy is important</li>
<li dir="ltr">67% believe they should own the things they make&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">For some enthusiasts, this may be optimistic, as it highlights interest in the problems which Web3 aims to solve and an inevitable target market. And yet, in another way, it sums up the exact problem. These issues are extremely broad and vague. In a survey, it is not surprising that the majority say that they believe they should own the things they make, or that data privacy is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just because people are interested in these things does not necessarily mean that Web3 protocols built with the supposed goals of tackling these &ldquo;problems&rdquo; will succeed. As we have seen, once token prices fall, the climate shifts rapidly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Facebook rebranding to Meta sums up struggles</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps there is no better way to sum up the popping of the bubble quite like Facebook&rsquo;s decision to rebrand as Meta. On last month&rsquo;s earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was forced to outline that the company&rsquo;s determination to focus on the metaverse remains intact.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We remain fully committed to the Metaverse vision as well,&rdquo; Zuckerberg said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working on both of these two major priorities (AI and the metaverse) for many years in parallel now, and in many ways the two areas are overlapping and complementary.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meta&rsquo;s metaverse ventures have hurt shareholders. Last year, its Reality Labs unit, in charge of the Metaverse project, lost $13.7 billion. The year before, a further $10.2 billion was lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guarantee you that I&rsquo;m going to be right about this bet. I do think that this is the direction that the world is going in,&rdquo; Zuckerberg added.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thus far this year, Meta has performed strongly in conjunction with the bouceback in the tech sector. However, the rebound comes after the stock significantly underperformed the Nasdaq, with the underperformance widening after the company&rsquo;s Meta rebrand in October 2021 (not that it is necessarily indicative, but it is interesting all the same).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14711094">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Looking back, the timing of Meta&rsquo;s rebrand was unfortunate. Its public commitment to the metaverse and company name change came on October 28th 2021, only thirteen days before the Bitcoin price peak and the pinnacle of the COVID-driven crypto bonanza.</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14727474">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Of course, the pertinent counterpoint of this is that Meta represents the exact antithesis of what many Web3 believers desire. A dominant big tech company with a questionable history and public image, to say the least. And besides, the metaverse is not Web3 &ndash; although this inability to define it in tangible and actionable terms is part of the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Obviously, the entire crypto sector is hurting badly, not just metaverse and Web3 tokens. Bitcoin remains over 55% off its high. The macro environment has been problematic and risk assets have struggled across the board, with interest rates hiked north of 5% following so many years of treading water near zero.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a more direct comparison, even interest in Bitcoin from the mainstream is down, with search volume for Bitcoin falling to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/interest-in-bitcoin-down-to-two-year-low-google/"><u>two-year lows</u></a>. And yet the damage with regard to the metaverse has been worse. Looking at the coins classified as metaverse on CoinMarketCap, the top currencies are all down at least 84%, with an average 92% drop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14711173">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s been a rough ride for all of crypto. But for metaverse, it has nearly decimated the still-nascent concept. While the metaverse is not Web3, there are many tokens and projects leaning on the promises of the latter while creating nothing of genuine utility. For the projects still around in the space, examining the travails of metaverse coins could be a valuable lesson.&nbsp;</p>

<li>PayPal to pause crypto sales as it works to comply with new FCA rules.</li>
<li>Crypto sales on its platform will likely be resumed in early 2024.</li>
<li>PayPal is slated to launch its own stablecoin in the coming weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>PayPal says its users in the United Kingdom will temporarily lose the ability to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/buy/paypal/">buy cryptocurrencies</a> via its platform from October 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<h2>Why is PayPal pausing crypto sales?</h2>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority has recently announced new rules that make it mandatory for crypto companies to institute &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-introduces-tough-new-rules-marketing-cryptoassets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clear risk warnings</a>&rdquo; as well as a 24-hour cooling-off period before they enable customers to put their money in crypto assets.</p>
<p>According to PayPal, it is &ldquo;deeply committed&rdquo; to complying with the said regulations and will, therefore, suspend crypto sales in U.K. for as long as it takes to make the required changes.</p>
<p>This announcement arrives only a day after the online payments company said Alex Chriss will replace Dan Schulman as its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/paypal-announces-senior-intuit-exec-alex-chriss-as-new-ceo/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL71G-j1S_KYOBzpQaWyFNTzFbwd9ZBt14tt5TN6LTgRaXAN64pl4nnSPc1FHVTgV0gULYav2AppCHvapn1vThmEhi0iIJZ3cg2SKR41q4hyb-6BYZXRyyLnhbGXjkmaaANxBJ1c7fEmUPFWQCA9i10cQ4C7No1m5stk7qR-LkjD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chief Executive</a> on September 27<sup>th</sup>. Its shares have lost about 20% month-to-date.</p>
<h2>When will PayPal resume crypto sales?</h2>
<p>PayPal was not specific in divulging when is it likely to resume crypto sales on its platform. What it told customers in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15rpswj/paypal_is_stopping_crypto_until_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">message</a> today was only that they will be re-enabled in early 2024.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s fair to assume that the pause will remain in place for at least three months considering it starts on October 1<sup>st</sup>. During this time, though, users will be able to hold as well as sell their crypto assets on the platform, as per the digital payments giant.</p>
<p>Note that PayPal is slated to launch PYUSD in the coming weeks. PayPal USD &ndash; its own stablecoin will be issued by Paxos Trust Company and its value will be pegged to the U.S. dollar (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/paypal-launches-a-us-dollar-stablecoin-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/">find out more).</a></p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Sports betting and gambling companies published strong financial results.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer token has raised almost $1.4 million in the past few weeks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Sports betting and gambling revenue jumped in the first half of the year as demand for the services rose. Recently released financial results by companies like Penn National, Entain, and Flutter Entertainment. At the same time,&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/"><u>Chancer</u></a>, an upcoming betting platform that uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/blockchain/"><u>blockchain</u></a> technology, has raised almost $1.4 million in the past few weeks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Betting revenue is soaring</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Publicly-traded companies in the sports betting and gambling companies have published strong financial results in the past few weeks. Flutter Entertainment, the parent company of Fanduel, PokerStars, Paddy Power, Sisal, and Betfair, said that its revenue jumped by 42% in the first half of the year. It made over 4.8 billion in revenue as the number of users soared by 28%. In his statement, the head of Flutter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flutter.com/media/an0n5qzm/flutter-2023-interim-financial-statement-final.pdf"><u>said</u></a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We acquired over two million new players in the period, cemented our leadership position in sports and grew our share in iGaming to 23%. The US business was profitable in the first half with FanDuel generating over $100m in EBITDA.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, Entain had a strong performance, offset by a huge fine in Turkey. Its revenue jumped by 19% in the first half of the year. Most of this growth came from the United States, where the company owns several brands. Its gaming revenue rose by 22%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DraftKings, one of the leading players in the industry also recorded strong results as the company nears profitability. Its revenue jumped to over $874 million in Q2 and EBITDA coming in a positive territory. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other companies in the sector like Penn National, 888 Holdings, and Churchill Downs have all reported strong financial results. As a result, most of these stocks have jumped by more than 20% this year. Entain has underperformed because of the company&rsquo;s legal issues.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chancer is set to thrive</h2>
<p dir="ltr">All these numbers mean that Chancer is set to thrive when its product launches later this year. For starters, Chancer is a company that is building a unique beting platform where people from around the world can participate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its global nature is enabled by the company&rsquo;s use of blockchain technology. $CHANCER, its crypto token, will help to facilitate payments in its ecosystem. Also, holders will be able to create their market, live stream them, and then make money when people place bets on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, $CHANCER holders will take part in the network&rsquo;s governance, where they will be able to vote on key issues. As owners of the platform, they will receive a share of the profits that the network generates. All these features are different from traditional companies that are managed centrally. You can buy the Chancer token&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Chancer token has more room to grow, investors should always do their own research before investing.</p>

<li>Biswap already announced turning off Binance Connect on their website at 01:00 PM UTC, August 15, 2023.</li>
<li>Binance made the difficult decision after its provider closed the supporting card payments service.</li>
<li>Binance has been facing quite some regulatory challenges lately.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a surprise announcement on August 15, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> has through a representative confirmed that it will be closing its licensed buy-and-sell cryptocurrency arm on August 16. The company&rsquo;s representative said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;At Binance, we periodically review our products and services to ensure that our resources continue to be focused on core efforts that align with our long-term strategy. In the last six years, Binance has grown from being an exchange to a global blockchain ecosystem with multiple business lines. We consistently adapt and modify our business approach in response to changing market and user needs.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The same has also been confirmed by BNB Chain decentralized exchange Biswap through a tweet stating that the exchange has disabled Bnance Connect.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p>The announcement comes right on the heels of Binance US <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-seeks-courts-protection-against-us-secs-probe/">filing to limit the US SEC</a> from overstepping its investigation boundaries according to an earlier agreement. Binance and its subsidiaries have been facing increased regulatory handles, especially in the US where it is being accused of offering unregistered securities alongside its rival <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>.</p>

<li dir="ltr">The Binance news saw all three altcoins nosedive double-digits.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Serum (SRM) was down 29%, Sonm (SNM) shed 58% and DFI.money (YFII) declined by 16% in 24 hours.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Trading on all pairs for the tokens will end on August 22, 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/serum/">Serum</a> (SRM), Sonm (SNM) and DFI.money (YFII) are among the biggest losers in the crypto market today. As of writing, SRM, SNM and YFII have all plummeted double-digits.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Binance to delist SRM, SNM and YFII</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> announced on Tuesday that it will &ldquo;<em>delist and cease trading on all trading pairs</em>&rdquo; for Serum, DFI.Money and Sonm from its platform on August 22. The exchange noted in a notice to customers that the delisting is part of its period review of every listed digital asset.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. We believe this best protects all our users</em>,&rdquo; the exchange said in a general <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-delist-snm-srm-and-yfii-on-2023-08-22-f43511a4c1d347a8a2dd1efbdd2fe716" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although Binance did not specify the reasons for removing support for each of the altcoin, it did cite certain metrics considered during the periodic reviews. These include team commitment, development activity, trading volume and liquidity and network safety with regard to attacks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Market reaction plunges affected altcoins</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to data from CoinGecko, Sonm has seen the most declines in its 24-hour performance as it traded 58% down around 9.45 am ET. The token was changing hands for around $0.105392.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Serum has nosedived 29% in the same period to just above $0.05 to see its 7-day returns reach -35% and over 50% in the past 30 days. Serum, a project linked to FTX and Alameda Research, is down 99.6% from its all-time high above $13 hit in September 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, DFI.money, which is a yield farming aggregator forked from yearn.finance, was down 16% in the past 24 hours to trade around $605. YFII has declined by more than 24% in the past month and traded at a level that&rsquo;s more than 93% down from its ATH of $9,251 reached in September 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Declines for the three altcoins come as most of the top 20 assets by market cap continued to trade flat, with Bitcoin constrained below $30k and Ethereum unable to breach $1,900.&nbsp;</p>

<li>THORChain (RUNE) token price has gained 65% over the past week and 53% over the past month.</li>
<li>There has been a significant surge in social volume around THORChain.</li>
<li>The social volume is driving notable attention toward the cross-chain liquidity protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/thorchain/">price of THORChain (RUNE)</a> is still down 10% from its start of the year price, the token has been on a strong bullish trend since the beginning of August. It has risen by 68% since August 1, pushing the price from around $0.92 to the current price of $1.55.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/15/1692090659788-d5334d29-4591-45da-ab37-d960e0370988.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="615" height="435"></p>
<p>While some are super excited with RUNE&rsquo;s upward trajectory, some are sceptical that the token could experience a pullback seeing that the rise has been so sharp. To fully understand how far the token could rise and the possibilities of a pullback, we shall delve into the factors pushing the price up.</p>
<h2>Why THORChain (RUNE) price is rising</h2>
<p>According to data on Santiment, the THORChain price surge is fueled by a surge in social volume. According to the data, RUNE&rsquo;s social volume increased by 4,300% between August 7 and August 13, driving significant attention toward the THORChain protocol and its native token.</p>
<p>In addition, THORChain&rsquo;s positive investor sentiment also grew 6,100% within the same timeline. This further caused RUNE&rsquo;s trading volume to spike as more investors jumped in.</p>
<p>THORChain, which is a cross-chain liquidity protocol, in April, partnered with the web3 company Unizen to allow users to swap their <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> and Avalanche (AVAX) for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> while also permitting users to store assets on different chains. This has been a great driver of the increased activity in the THORChain ecosystem.</p>

<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin will unlock tokens worth over $31.4 million this week.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Oasis Network will also unlock tokens worth over $8 million.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Injective will also release more tokens this week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies are having their token unlock events this week. The Sandbox unlocked millions of tokens, leading to a major dilution among holders. This dilution, helped push the SAND token to the lowest level since June.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to TokenUnlocks, ApeCoin, Oasis Network, and&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/injective/"><u>Injective</u></a> will flood the market with additional tokens this week. ApeCoin, the native token by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), will release additional 15.6 million tokens on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">These tokens represent about 4.3% of the total circulating supply and will be worth $31.5 million. Most of them will go to Treasury followed by Yuga Labs, Yuga Labs founder, and launch contributors. The last ApeCoin token unlock will happen in June 26th.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/apecoin"><u>ApeCoin&rsquo;s</u></a> token unlock will come at difficult for the ecosystem as demand for BAYC prices retreat. Its price has plunged by over 68% from the highest level this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/oasis-network/"><u>Oasis Network</u></a>, a smart chain platform, will unlock additional ROSE tokens worth over $8&nbsp;<a href="https://token.unlocks.app/oasis-network"><u>million</u></a>. Its last token sale happened in May 18th when the developers unlocked 199.50 million tokens. These tokens will go to partners and reserve, core contributors, and the community. The last token unlock will happen in February 2031.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The last major token unlock will be Injective, the DeFi-focused blockchain backed by Mark Cuban. Injective will release tokens&nbsp;<a href="https://token.unlocks.app/injective-protocol"><u>worth</u></a> over $20 million on Sunday, with most of them going to the ecosystem developers. Injective&rsquo;s final vesting will happen in April 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In most cases, token unlocks tend to be bearish for cryptocurrencies since they lead to more dilution. They are often seen as the reversal of share buybacks in the corporate sector.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Logan Paul will face Dillon Danis in a bocxing match on October 14.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Paul, a social media personality and WWE star, is willing to bet $1 million he will win. The bet has attracted widespread criticism.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Meanwhile, decentralised betting platform Chancer has raised over $1.3 million in presale.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">YouTuber and WWE personality Logan Paul is buzzing for his next event &ndash; a boxing bout against Brazilian Dillon Danis. The match is set for October 14 in Manchester, England. Paul, whose YouTube fame has catapulted him into lucrative deals in combat sports, is confident he will beat Danis and is willing to bet $1 million on it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bet proposal has been heavily criticised across crypto &ndash; we tell you why and explain why legit bets such as Logan Paul&rsquo;s could find a home on a new <a href="https://coinjournal.net/learn/what-is-blockchain/">blockchain</a>-based betting platform called <a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>Chancer</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Logan Paul&rsquo;s $1 million bet &ndash; what&rsquo;s the criticism?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">28-year old Logan Paul has had some high-profile matchups, including an exhibition bout against Floyd Mayweather. His appearances on WWE have also been great shows.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now he&rsquo;s hyping up his upcoming boxing match against Dania, a 29-year old jiu-jitsu black belt holder and trainee of former UFC champion Conor McGregor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paul is confident he will beat the Brazilian and has proposed a $1 million bet with McGregor.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You guarantee a win? I&rsquo;ll bet you $1,000,000 I beat Dildo Danis on October 14 <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousMMA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheNotoriousMMA</a> <a href="https://t.co/cktDrH6jWa">pic.twitter.com/cktDrH6jWa</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1691164336952111104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">The move has been heavily criticised across the crypto community, with many criticising the social media personality for considering such a bet when he hasn&rsquo;t followed through with a promise to reimburse victims of his CryptoZoo (ZOO) project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CryptoZoo launched in 2021, promising a cryptocurrency game powered by the ZOO token and NFTs. The project rallied (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/where-to-buy-cryptozoo-zoo-jumps-109-as-nft-games-rise-up/">read more here</a>) as NFTs exploded onto the scene during the bull market. However it has largely failed to live up to projections and Paul <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64210289" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> earlier this year that he&rsquo;d make it right with the affected investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That hasn&rsquo;t happened yet and the latest events where he&rsquo;s willing to bet $1 million on a match&rsquo;s outcome has left many unamused. Shouldn&rsquo;t he be using that money to refund CryptoZoo NFT buyers? Danis himself had a go at Paul via a post on X (fka Twitter).</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bro has the money to bet $1 million but can't pay off the people he scammed, that's crazy &#128514; <a href="https://t.co/icaMQKljB5">https://t.co/icaMQKljB5</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">While Logan Paul comes under fire for his crypto &ldquo;scam&rdquo;, the one thing that one can take from his bet proposal is that betting is here to stay. And so is crypto and, likely, the new betting project Chancer.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What&rsquo;s unique about Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The gambling and betting sector is one major global industry, currently projected to grow double figures annually for the next ten years. Traditional bookmakers will no doubt see this growth. But investors are taking note of a potential game-changer for the whole industry &ndash; Chancer?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is an online betting platform built on blockchain and offering a revolutionary model that could transform betting for millions of people. This is because unlike centralised betting companies, Chancer will allow users to create their own bets on thousands of events, from mainstream sports, esports, and entertainment and so on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Chancer, users can set their own odds and play by their own rules, including live streaming bets to invite others from across the globe to join. The peer-to-peer platform could therefore grow into the leading decentralised social betting platform in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Learn more about how Chancer works <a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Global investors flock to Chancer, over 31 million tokens sold in weeks</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is looking to disrupt an $80 billion global gambling industry with its new blockchain-based betting platform. Investors have taken note of the potential for the project&rsquo;s revolutionary offering and are aggressively allocating funds to help bring it to the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That sentiment is what&rsquo;s likely behind the huge interest in the native $CHANCER token, whose presale has been one of the few highlights of an otherwise dull summer for crypto. So far, investors have scooped more than 31 million $CHANCER tokens, helping to raise over $1.3 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presale currently has $CHANCER tokens priced at $0.011 and investors can buy with ETH, BNB, USDT and BUSD.</p>

<ul>

<p dir="ltr">Crypto exchange Dasset has denied customer access to funds.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The New Zealand-based crypto exchange has gone into liquidation.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Dasset denies customers access to funds</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Auckland-based crypto exchange Dasset has denied customers access to their funds as it faces liquidation. This is according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/customers-desperate-as-auckland-based-crypto-exchange-dasset-denies-access-to-their-funds/DNBZVIJTLFHJREG4KD3YOKUDTU/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report by The Herald</u></a> earlier today.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the report, some customers have tens of thousands of dollars worth of crypto trapped on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A customer told The Herald that they had been trying to withdraw $40,000 &mdash; their entire life savings &mdash; from their Dasset account for three months. However, their attempts had been unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another customer revealed that had been direct-credited by the company&rsquo;s CEO, Stephen Macaskill. However, they were still unable to access the funds in their account.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CEO said the company has been unable to find a replacement banking provider after losing its previous provider earlier this year. He added that Dasset has gone into voluntary liquidation, and the company has appointed a liquidator.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, a liquidator hasn&rsquo;t been approved, and the customers are still unable to access their funds.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Dasset still accepting new users</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency exchange is still accepting new users despite a halt in withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company has removed email addresses and phone numbers from their website. However, a request form is still available.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dasset is the latest in a long line of cryptocurrency exchanges to face financial challenges. Last year, FTX, one of the leading crypto exchanges at the time, filed for bankruptcy following some financial mismanagement by the CEO and other executives.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Auckland-based Dasset exchange was launched in 2017. However, compared to Binance, which was launched around the same period, Dasset remains a relatively small cryptocurrency exchange.&nbsp;</p>
