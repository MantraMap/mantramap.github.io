<p>Global interest in non-fungible tokens has sharply plummeted as the base prices of prominent NFT collections have declined since 2022. Peaking at $5.8 billion in January 2022, NFT trading volume dropped to $707.70 million in June 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Quartly-Janeiro, CSO of Bitrue, a Tier 1 crypto exchange, says:</p>

<p>"FOMO fueled the massive surge in the NFT market, but the decline in trading volume by 90% from the last year&rsquo;s peak shows the dynamics has shifted. Barriers such as skepticism towards NFTs as potential scams, lack of sustained interest, scalability challenges, and lack of clear use cases are hindering the wide adoption of non-fungibles."</p>

<p>As fundamental elements of Web3, NFTs, and metaverse projects have a lot of scope and opportunity. In this shifting environment, mainstream digital media is poised to play a significant role, given its power to amplify trends or foster skepticism.&nbsp;</p>
