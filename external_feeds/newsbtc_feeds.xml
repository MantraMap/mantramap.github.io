					<description><![CDATA[Polkadot provides interoperability among several blockchains for users while maintaining high scalability and speed in processing transactions. Also known as a multichain network, Polkadot supports many parachains, enabling developers to build their blockchains seamlessly. Several blockchain projects exist in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. These platforms usually emerge with different products and services related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Subsequently, users became intrigued with the full potential packed in the DeFi space. However, there was the challenge of how a user could access more than one blockchain and DeFi application through a single platform. This is where the value proposition of the Polkadot became prominent. Related Reading: Why The VIX Could Predict A 20% Bitcoin And Crypto Rally The last few months in 2022 were tough in the crypto market as most crypto assets and projects saw a drastic drop in performance. In addition, the unexpected collapse of the FTX crypto exchange brought a devastating condition that created losses in the crypto space. However, DOT has a positive story to tell. The multichain network reports massive growth in its ecosystem during Q4 2022. 1/ The Polkadot 2022 Roundup is here🚀 Despite the difficult year for the industry, the Polkadot and Kusama community were busy building the largest, &#38; most diverse ecosystem of use case specific layer-1 blockchains in the world, making huge strides toward building a better web. pic.twitter.com/sGZDz0zHIW &#8212; Polkadot (@Polkadot) December 31, 2022 The recent achievement cuts across several landmarks and aspects. Notably, the protocol and its projects progressed technically with many collaborative deals and more technological adoption. Parachain Migration From Kusama To Polkadot On Oct 3, 2022, Polkadot recorded its first successful parachain migration from its canary network, Kusama. KILT Protocol completed a full migration from the Kusama Relay Chain to Polkadot Relay Chain. This milestone showcases Kusama as a suitable platform to stress-test digital applications in a real-life environment. Hence, the developers could curb associated risks before all the relevant upgrades to ensure stability and security. By using Kusama before its migration, KILT Protocol achieved decentralization. Also, the protocol included new functionalities in its upgrade, spiking its utility and efficiency. Through its collaboration with Polkadot, KILT integrated digital identities through decentralized identifiers (DIDs).

The multichain network consists of 74 parachains, over 550 projects, 300 decentralized applications, and more than 2,500 active developers in its ecosystem. The growth for the DOT and Kusama communities has been great since the launch of the parachains. Polkadot staking system received striking updates through the launch of nomination pools and the staking dashboard. This encouraged native staking holders to stake as low as 1 DOT to receive rewards. In line with its vision to enhance decentralization, it launched its OpenGov, a new-generation governance system on the Kusama network. The system is the most sophisticated and advanced blockchain governance system. It is proposed to kick off on the mainnet subsequently. Through Web3 opportunities, the DeFi protocol bagged several partnerships with different companies. These include Astra Network, KILT Protocol, Efinity, T-System MMS, and others. For over three years, it has been engaging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the status of its native token, DOT. Finally, the Polkadot broke the barrier with its high achievement as DOT ceased to be classified as a security. It was announced on November 2022 that DOT is now considered as software. This is a feat that placed it higher in Web3 adoption. Also, 2022 marked extensive movement through the Polkadot Ambassador Program. Over 1,600 new ambassadors joined the program signifying more growth for the multichain network. Cover image from Pixabay, Polkadot chart from Tradingview.]]></description>

		<title>Will Solana Price Continue To Surge After The Explosive Price Rally?</title>

					<description><![CDATA[The Solana price has secured 45% appreciation over the last week. The coin made this significant recovery after its yearly low of $8 in December. Over the last 24 hours, the coin fell by 1.6%, which depicted that SOL was consolidating after a period of an explosive rally. As Bitcoin continued to recover, major altcoins also noted northbound price action. The technical outlook for the coin has also pointed towards bullish strength mounting on the chart. Accumulation has been substantial, and demand for the coin has shot up over the last week. Related Reading: Despite A Relief Rally Polkadot Struggles Under $5, What’s Next? At the moment, the altcoin was inside the overbought zone, meaning buyers had taken over the market completely. After a rally, a coin usually faces a correction, and the Solana price might be heading in that direction. Continued consolidation for the coin will eventually cause Solana price to lose its immediate support line. The Solana price has to trade above the $17 price mark for the altcoin to continue its bullish trend over the long term. The market capitalization of Solana rose over the last 24 hours, which meant that bulls were in control as buyers outnumbered sellers at press time. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was exchanging hands at $16.45 at the time of writing. As the coin traveled above the $8 mark, it breached significant resistance levels. The $14 price level was the most significant of these resistance levels. Similarly, the $17 resistance mark is crucial for the Solana price to continue trading upwards. Since the coin bumped into double digits and consolidated underneath the $17 level, the bulls might soon lose vigor. If the price is corrected, the coin will fall to $15.60 and then to $14. Once the coin loses the $14 mark, the bears will be back in the market. The amount of SOL traded in the last session was green, indicating bullishness. Technical Analysis SOL had not touched this level on the Relative Strength Index for months. This marked a multi-month high on the Relative Strength Index. The indicator was above the 80 mark, indicating that buyers exceeded market sellers. Due to increased demand, Solana was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which indicated that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Additionally, SOL was also above the 50-SMA line. This reflected the idea that SOL might soon be correcting itself over the next trading sessions. The altcoin sided with the other technical indicators, which indicated increased demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) portrays price momentum and reversals. MACD was green as it indicated buy signals in anticipation that the price might rise before it starts to retrace on the chart.

<p>SOL had not touched this level on the Relative Strength Index for months. This marked a multi-month high on the Relative Strength Index. The indicator was above the 80 mark, indicating that buyers exceeded market sellers.</p>
<p>Due to increased demand, Solana was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which indicated that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market.</p>
<p>Additionally, SOL was also above the 50-SMA line. This reflected the idea that SOL might soon be correcting itself over the next trading sessions.</p>

<p>The altcoin sided with the other technical indicators, which indicated increased demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) portrays price momentum and reversals.</p>
<p>MACD was green as it indicated buy signals in anticipation that the price might rise before it starts to retrace on the chart.</p>

<p>The Bollinger Bands show price volatility and fluctuations; these bands have expanded significantly, implying chances of heavy price volatility over the upcoming trading sessions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin whales have now started accumulating BTC once more. This comes at a time when the crypto market is seeing struggling prices marked with low momentum. Now, with these large investors picking up the pace with their investments, there could be more movement on the horizon for bitcoin. Bitcoin Whales Fill Up Their Bags Data from on-chain aggregator Santiment shows that large bitcoin whales holding between 1,000-10,000 BTC are accelerating their accumulation. Over the last five days, these large investors have added more than 20,000 BTC to their balances, making it a significant accumulation trend.

This figure represents 23.7% of the total circulating BTC supply as of this moment, suggesting that this accumulation may have factored into the recovery trend recorded by bitcoin over the last two days. BTC whales accumulate over 20,000 coins &#124; Source: Twitter The accumulation trend comes hot on the heels of low activity recorded by these large bitcoin whales. As Bitcoinist reported, large whale transactions fell to only 19% of total bitcoin transactions indicating fatigue on the part of these large wallets.  However, the new accumulation of data points to a more long-term play on the parts of these whales. It also shows a willingness to buy at current levels which could mean that large BTC whales could believe that the price of the digital asset may have hit its bottom. Will BTC Continue Uptrend? Bitcoin is now trading comfortably above the $17,000 level after a late weekend rally pushed it above the important technical level. At current prices, the digital asset is tethering just around its 50-day moving average of $17,212, which puts it in a precarious position. Such levels mean that the price of the cryptocurrency could swing either way and what’s more, is that it wouldn’t take much to trigger a tilt. So while the accumulation of these large whales may have been part of the trigger for the uptrend, there needs to be more demand for BTC to continue upwards and break successfully above its 50-day moving average.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market is still highly unpredictable and volatile in January 2023. The market generally recorded a 0.3% decrease in the last 24 hours. But as most of the assets falter, some tokens record exponential gains. LDO, the governance token of the Lido DAO network, has increased in value in the past week. The token is up by 62.83% in weekly gains and currently trading at $1.99, a 1.31% increase in 24 hours.   The Lido DAO project is a staking platform where users can stake their ETH tokens. The platform also offers DeFi lending services and requires no minimum deposits. With different financial services and the flexibility of its platform, this upsurge shows increased adoption by users for a variety of purposes.  Related Reading: Why The VIX Could Predict A 20% Bitcoin And Crypto Rally Despite the uncertain times in the crypto space Lido DAO (LDO) has continued to perform well since the turn of the year. Some factors are behind this recent resurgence and will influence how long the bullish momentum will last. Why Is Lido DAO (LIDO) On The Rise? Some parameters are responsible for the price surge in Lido DAO. A Twitter user states that the Lido finance native token has soared nearly 60% in the last week. The user attributed this to Ethereum&#8217;s upcoming Shanghai fork. This update will enable users to withdraw their staked ETH tokens. Secondly, BitForex announced the listing of LDO on the exchange. This listing has increased the project&#8217;s scope and is partly responsible for the price increase noted in the token.  However, Twitter user John Cook has expressed pessimism about Lido DAO&#8217;s newfound price momentum. In his tweet on January 8, he referred to the seven-day rise of the token as a pump-and-dump. He also alleged that the project was ripping off retail investors and spending more on marketing costs than engineering.  Despite his protests, the LDO token remains among the top gainers this week. The price surge has seen Lido DAO become the largest Decentralized Finance protocol in the world. The project has a total locked value above $6.9 billion. Can The Bulls Sustain The Rally? LDO token is currently in an uptrend on the chart, with the formation of simultaneous green candles. The support levels are $1.6647, $1.7561, and $1.8495. Its resistance levels are $2.03, $2.13, and $2.22.  LDO is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages. These two indicators are showing a buy signal at the moment. Therefore, it implies that the token&#8217;s short-term and long-term price movement is bullish. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator indicates a buy signal. With the oversold region below 30 and the overbought region above 70, the current RSI value of the token is 82.22. Traders will likely take long positions in the market. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is well above its signal line and shows divergence. The signal is also a buy but might be for the short term. LDO is still off its ATH (all-time high) value of $11.00. The token will likely continue on its ascent as more investors buy into the project.

This feat might be tasking for memes and altcoins to accomplish. Investors must realize that altcoins are more volatile than large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

<h2><b>Why Is Lido DAO (LIDO) On The Rise?</b></h2>
<p>Some parameters are responsible for the price surge in Lido DAO. A Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Daniela81365959/status/1612781708490801152" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">states</a> that the Lido finance native token has soared nearly 60% in the last week. The user attributed this to Ethereum&#8217;s upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1603659353302519808" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shanghai fork</a>. This update will enable users to withdraw their staked ETH tokens.</p>
<p>Secondly, BitForex <a href="https://twitter.com/bitforexcom/status/1612714530668433408" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> the listing of LDO on the exchange. This listing has increased the project&#8217;s scope and is partly responsible for the price increase noted in the token. </p>
<p>However, Twitter user John Cook has expressed pessimism about Lido DAO&#8217;s newfound price momentum. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Lido%20DAO&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet</a> on January 8, he referred to the seven-day rise of the token as a pump-and-dump. He also alleged that the project was ripping off retail investors and spending more on marketing costs than engineering. </p>
<p>Despite his protests, the LDO token remains among the top gainers this week. The price surge has seen Lido DAO become the largest Decentralized Finance protocol in the world. The project has a <a href="https://twitter.com/CheckCryptoNews/status/1612696749407342593" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">total locked value</a> above $6.9 billion.</p>
<b>Can The Bulls Sustain The Rally?</b>
<p>LDO token is currently in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk-07V1_qko" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">uptrend</a> on the chart, with the formation of simultaneous green candles. The support levels are $1.6647, $1.7561, and $1.8495. Its resistance levels are $2.03, $2.13, and $2.22. </p>
<p>LDO is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages. These two indicators are showing a buy signal at the moment. Therefore, it implies that the token&#8217;s short-term and long-term price movement is bullish.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m92X992xytQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a> indicator indicates a buy signal. With the oversold region below 30 and the overbought region above 70, the current RSI value of the token is 82.22. Traders will likely take long positions in the market.</p>
<p>The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is well above its signal line and shows divergence. The signal is also a buy but might be for the short term. LDO is still off its ATH (all-time high) value of $11.00. The token will likely continue on its ascent as more investors buy into the project.</p>

<p>If a digital asset&#8217;s price decreases by 50%, it will need to rally to 100% to return to its former value. This feat might be tasking for memes and altcoins to accomplish. Investors must realize that altcoins are <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2022/05/15/crypto-market-volatility-stablecoins-sanchez-pkg-newday-vpx.cnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more volatile</a> than large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Polkadot price posted significant gains over the last week after Bitcoin showed recovery on its chart. Other altcoins have also moved in the same direction. At the moment, however, DOT has been trying to breach the immediate resistance of $5. In the past 24 hours, DOT noted a fall of 2%, but that could be attributed to a slight fall in demand for the altcoin. The technical outlook for Polkadot remains bullish. Buyers and demand for the altcoin have to keep mounting, and soon DOT will travel above the $5 level to trade near the $6 level. Accumulation has been growing in the last week as buyers have exceeded sellers at press time. It is critical, however, that DOT surpasses the $5 mark, or the coin will begin to trade lower, resulting in a loss of investor interest. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains? The market structure for DOT remains bullish as the coin managed to flip a few resistance marks into support levels in the past week. A push from the buyers will certainly strengthen the bulls&#8217; efforts to cross the stiff price ceiling of $4.90. The Polkadot price is trading 91% below its all-time high secured in 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $4.90 at press time. The $4.90 price level was a strong resistance point for the altcoin. Although DOT managed to break past the $4.80 resistance level, which has proven to be a tough resistance mark in the past, the coin continues to remain underneath the $5 level. The $5 mark is crucial, as the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level also somewhere meets the coin at that mark. A push above $5 will take the coin above $5.20. On the other hand, one bearish push and DOT will land at $4.40 and then $4.16. The amount of DOT traded in the last session declined slightly, mirroring the minor downtick in buying strength. Technical Analysis DOT made a significant recovery in buying pressure over the past week. The Relative Strength Index shot above the 60-mark, signifying the chart&#8217;s bullishness. Similarly, the asset price moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Polkadot was also inching very close to the 50-SMA line, and just a slight push from buyers would help the price topple over it. A move above the 50-SMA will cause another significant rally for Polkadot. Following the increased demand, the technical indicators pointed towards a buy signal for the coin. This usually means that the coin is headed upward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates price momentum and reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Records 9% Rise, Why Traders Bet On More Profits The indicator painted green signal bars, which were buy signals for DOT. The Directional Movement Index was positive because the +DI (blue) line was higher than the -DI (orange) line. The Average Directional Index (red) was above 20, which signified that the present price action was gaining strength. Featured Image From Unsplash, Charts From TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last week, liquid staking cryptocurrencies have been seeing a significant upside. All of these tokens have successfully moved into the green territory, recording double-digit gains for their holders. Although these digital assets seem to be following the general crypto market uptrend, there is another factor pushing up their prices. Why Are Liquid Staking Crypto On The Rise? Liquid staking cryptocurrencies have been receiving more attention ever since the announcement that the Ethereum “Shanghai” upgrade is likely to take place in March 2023. This upgrade is important for the network because it will mean that staked ETH will finally be withdrawable. Related Reading: This Sub-$1 Billion Crypto Is Leading Market Gains, Here’s The Reason Anticipation around this upgrade is already on the rise and liquid staking tokens are enjoying a good portion of this attention. Their popularity comes from the fact that they allow stakers to earn a yield on staked ETH even though they can’t withdraw their ETH. It also makes it possible for stakers to have tokens on hand which they can deploy on other protocols to further participate in the ecosystem. Liquid staking protocols reward stakers with ETH-pegged tokens such as stETH and ankrETH and make it possible for ETH users to stake without having to become validators themselves. But instead of having to rely on centralized exchanges to do this, as was previously the case, these DeFi protocols are decentralized. ETH price crosses $1,300 ahead of Shanghai upgrade &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The higher earning potential of staking with liquid staking protocols has led to more demand for them. With the Shanghai upgrade coming, it is expected that more ETH will be moved to these protocols, leading to more demand for their native cryptocurrencies. The Largest Liquid Staking Protocols The largest liquid staking protocol in the space now is currently Lido Finance. It accounts for around 30% of the total 15 million staked ETH, making it an important contender in the space. Its native LDO token has a market cap of $1.6 billion and its price is up 57% in the last 7 days. Lido is the largest liquid staking protocol &#124; Source: CryptoSlate Next in line is Frax Share whose price is up 21% in the last week. The digital asset’s market cap is almost $403 million, rewarding users with frxETH for their staked ETH at an 8% APR. This is the highest APR of any liquid staking protocol.  Related Reading: Ethereum Reaches New Three-Week High Above $1,300, But Will Rally Last? Rocket Pool takes third place with a market cap above $260 million and is up 18% in the 7-day period.

Others include Ankr Protocol which is up 26% in 7 days, as well as Stafi, pStake Finance, and StakeWise, all of which are up 32%, 20%, and 10%, respectively, in the same time period.  Follow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet… Featured image from Medium, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum price has been trending to the upside over the past week as the general sentiment in the market improves. The second crypto by market capitalization could extend its gains if macroeconomic conditions continue to support the rally.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $34.7M In SHIB From Binance As of this writing, the Ethereum price trades at $1,333 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency records a 10% profit and stands as one of the best performers in the top 10 by market cap.  Ethereum Price Follows Market Sentiment According to a report from analysis firm Blofin, the market sentiment has improved based on widespread reports about an economic recession. These expectations of worse financial data could force the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to loosen its monetary policy.  The financial institution has been hiking interest rates to put a hold on the highest inflation recorded in decades. As a result, the global market is suffering. If conditions decay too much, the market believes the Fed will backtrack, allowing Ethereum and other risk assets to rally.  Today, the Fed will provide further light on its next steps; if it slows down, the Ethereum price will likely continue on its bullish trajectory. The positive expectations are spilling to other crypto financial sectors.  According to Blofin, there have been positive developments in the futures and options sectors. The firm noted the shift in sentiment for Q1, 2023, compared to Q4, 2022: A rebound of expectation is also underway. In the futures market, the positive basis term structure has been maintained for some time. Although the futures&#8217; basis is still around the parity level, Investors&#8217; implicit expectations are not pessimistic as they were in 2022q4. Crypto Market To See More Volatility A decline in the U.S. dollar supports the bullish continuation of the Ethereum price. As measured by the DXY Index (DXY), the currency is re-testing critical support allowing ETH and other risk-on assets to appreciate.  However, the decline in the DXY hints at a spike in the crypto market&#8217;s Volatility. According to Blofin: It is worth noting that the implied Volatility of front-month BTC options has increased somewhat. As the Dec CPI data is about to be released, the game between investors in the spot and derivatives markets may further increase the implied Volatility. Implied Volatility measures future price movement for an asset.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Ethereum price has been trending to the upside over the past week as the general sentiment in the market improves. The second crypto by market capitalization could extend its gains if macroeconomic conditions continue to support the rally. </strong></p>

<p>As of this writing, the Ethereum price trades at $1,333 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency records a 10% profit and stands as one of the best performers in the top 10 by market cap. </p>

<h2>Ethereum Price Follows Market Sentiment</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Blofin_Official/status/1612816967756578821" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a> from analysis firm Blofin, the market sentiment has improved based on widespread reports about an economic recession. These expectations of worse financial data could force the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to loosen its monetary policy. </p>
<p>The financial institution has been hiking interest rates to put a hold on the highest inflation recorded in decades. As a result, the global market is suffering. If conditions decay too much, the market believes the Fed will backtrack, allowing Ethereum and other risk assets to rally. </p>
<p>Today, the Fed will provide further light on its next steps; if it slows down, the Ethereum price will likely continue on its bullish trajectory. The positive expectations are spilling to other crypto financial sectors. </p>
<p>According to Blofin, there have been positive developments in the futures and options sectors. The firm noted the shift in sentiment for Q1, 2023, compared to Q4, 2022:</p>
<blockquote><p>A rebound of expectation is also underway. In the futures market, the positive basis term structure has been maintained for some time. Although the futures&#8217; basis is still around the parity level, Investors&#8217; implicit expectations are not pessimistic as they were in 2022q4.</p></blockquote>

Crypto Market To See More Volatility
<p>A decline in the U.S. dollar supports the bullish continuation of the Ethereum price. As measured by the DXY Index (DXY), the currency is re-testing critical support allowing ETH and other risk-on assets to appreciate. </p>
<p>However, the decline in the DXY hints at a spike in the crypto market&#8217;s Volatility. According to Blofin:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is worth noting that the implied Volatility of front-month BTC options has increased somewhat. As the Dec CPI data is about to be released, the game between investors in the spot and derivatives markets may further increase the implied Volatility.</p></blockquote>
<p>Implied Volatility measures future price movement for an asset. The analytic firm believes that the short-term metrics point to the upside, but the mid to long-term still shows &#8220;a relatively bearish attitude.&#8221; </p>

<p>Options traders are accumulating calls (long positions) for BTC with an expiration date set for January 27. The strike price for these contracts stands at $18,000 and $19,000. In other words, crypto traders are betting on BTC (and therefore the Ethereum price) to be much higher than today&#8217;s levels by the end of the month. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Thomas Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, outlined in a recent CNBC interview why the VIX &#8211; a real-time volatility index from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) &#8211; will become an important indicator for equity markets and possibly Bitcoin in the coming months. VIX was created to quantify market expectations of volatility for the S&#38;P 500. In doing so, the VIX is future oriented, meaning that it only shows the implied volatility for the next 30 days. The rule of thumb is: if the VIX increases, the S&#38;P 500 is likely to decrease, and if the VIX value decreases, the S&#38;P 500 is likely to remain stable or increase. Fundstrat Analyst Expects A 20% S&#38;P 500 Rally In 2023 Lee expects a 20% rally for the S&#38;P 500 this year. Why? According to the chief analyst, inflation surprised the Fed on the downside last year. This year, it will be the other way around. Inflation will fall faster than the Fed recently forecasted. This will have a decisive impact on the VIX, which will decline in value. &#8220;The bond market volatility is below its 200 day [average]. If that happens to the VIX, we would be at 17,&#8221; Lee claims and continues to say that &#8220;since the 1950s, following a negative year, if the VIX is lower on average than the prior year, we are up an average of 22%. So I think we are set up for a 20% year.&#8221; Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Data Shows Weak Baseline For 2023: Report According to the Fundstrat analyst, Thursday will be very telling. If the core CPI is again below consensus, that means the original Fed forecast of 4.8% for PCE is 60 basis points too high. &#8220;And that means inflation is undershooting by a huge margin. The bond market is gonna push the Fed to say that February might be the last hike and after that it cuts,&#8221; Lee asserts.

For bitcoin, the prediction of Thomas Lee is interesting in that the price had a high correlation with the S&#38;P 500 (with a higher beta) over the past year, unless there were crypto-intrinsic shocks like the collapse of FTX or Terra Luna. This meant that the bitcoin price behaved very similarly to the S&#38;P 500, but was more volatile in both directions in response to changes in the market. Related Reading: Why Justin Sun’s Stablecoin USDD Is Struggling To Maintain Its Dollar Peg To that extent, the VIX (currently standing at 22) can also be used as a sentiment barometer for bitcoin. If Lee&#8217;s predicted drop in the VIX to 17 actually occurs &#8211; either as a result of positive CPI data or a pivot by the U.S. Federal Reserve &#8211; BTC could see a rally towards $20,000. As recently as November, Lee said he was sticking to his bitcoin price forecast of $200,000, even if the current market is negative. According to him, the BTC price will rise in tandem with the S&#38;P 500 if there are no more scams and bankruptcies of key players in the crypto industry. At press time, the bitcoin price was showing a slight uptrend over the past week, trading at $17,296. Featured image from Art Rachen / Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>
