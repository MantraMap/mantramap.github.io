<ul>
<li>The Ethereum Foundation has transferred 30 million worth of ETH to Kraken igniting massive sell-off concerns among users.&nbsp;</li>



<li>ETH price plunged by 4%, hanging on to the $1,900 mark on May 7 before sliding below the resistance following the sell-off rumours. </li>



<li>Digital asset analysts have drawn similar patterns with the last two sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-fate-hangs-in-balance-as-exchange-deposits-spike-to-an-8-month-high/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) trades at $1,832 after a rough weekend for digital assets plagued with congestion on the Bitcoin Network and massive sell-off concerns.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xedbb0d22f37376b415e449d582a14afd162b92ba801916547834551f499201c8">data</a> from crypto analytics firm Lookonchain, Vitalik Buterin transferred almost half a million worth of ETH to Kraken before the Ethereum foundation did the same with about $30 million worth of ETH.</p>



<p>At the time of both transactions, ETH exchanged hands at $1,960, with bulls holding on to the thoughts of $2,000. The price of ETH has trickled down weeks after the Shapella update, although its on-chain data still point upwards.</p>



<p>The transfer of millions worth of digital assets to exchange often indicates a rising balance springing up selling pressure from traders. In this case, despite the transfer of $30 million and mounting sell pressure, ETH balances on exchanges dropped from 18.22 million to 18.15 million over the weekend, showing signs of a strong recovery.</p>



<p>Sequel to the news, digital asset analysts compared market trends from past sales of ETH by the foundation and Buterin. The last big sale came in 2021, when 20,000 ETH was sold before the bear market kicked in. On the flip side, the foundation has also made large sales in the past during bull cycles, with the price surging.</p>



<p> Although large sales in the past preceded ETH plunging into the red zone, little or no lines can be drawn to establish a connection between the sale and the market’s bearish outlook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eth-bulls-look-toward-a-breakout-above-2k">ETH bulls look toward a breakout above $2k</h2>



<p>ETH now exchanges hands at $1,847, a 4.32% drop in the past 72 hours as the wider crypto market goes red. Despite this drop, on-chain indicators like ETH&#8217;s 200-day exponential moving average look good to push through the resistance.</p>



<p>Furthermore, data aggregator Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1654355262638288897?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">believes</a> that the huge inflow of ETH in exchanges could spark an initial uptick in price similar to the scenario in 2022. The firm took to Twitter to explain that ETH looks set to decouple from Bitcoin on the verge of breaking $2k.</p>



<p>“<em>Updating our report on #Ethereum&#8217;s sky-high active deposits, exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November 2021. As expected, $ETH is showing decoupling signs and on the cusp of breaking $2k once again,” </em>the tweet reads.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin transaction fees hit the highest point in nearly two years over the weekend, with some users paying a little over $26. </li>



<li>Several voices within the Bitcoin community have viewed the congestion leading to high fees as a direct attack on the network.</li>



<li>Binance temporarily halts transactions twice before reverting to regular business, describing it as a learning process. </li>
</ul>



<p>The debate on the purpose of Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals is now at the fore of community spaces following record ordinal mints leading to the congestion of the network.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin network was overwhelmed through the weekend, resulting in rising transaction fees to the dismay of users. In less than two weeks, unconfirmed transactions on the mempool surged from 134,000 to 469,000 on May 7, causing a 343% increase in transaction fees.</p>



<p>The surge in transaction fees was the highest recorded in two years, with high-priority transactions costing up to 654 sat/vB (approximately $26), according to mempool.space. Most users bemoaned the predicament pointing fingers at Bitcoin Ordinals, while others called it an attack on the network.</p>



<p>Over the past week, BTC Ordinals have occasioned a daily rise in trading volume, with currently over 3 million mints within its first 5 months. Despite chain data pointing to the hike in fees to Ordinals, users took to Twitter to claim their beloved assets were under attack. </p>



<p>Twitter user @proofofjogi <a href="https://twitter.com/proofofjogi/status/1655157035804098561?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">claimed</a> that we are in the “<em>then-they-fight-you stage.”</em></p>



<p><em>“High transaction fees are the chosen pain point by the attacker, probably to make Bitcoin unusable for smaller players. We&#8217;re in the then-they-fight-you-stage,</em>” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin maxi Dylan LeClair also restated the “<em>attack vector” theory,</em> although he added that it will have no impact on the network in the long run.</p>



<p>“<em>Pretty obvious attack vector for three later agencies with an infinite budget over the short-term. Changes nothing over the long term tho, though miners thank ‘em.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-resumes-btc-withdrawals-following-shaky-weekend"><strong>Binance resumes BTC withdrawals following shaky weekend</strong></h2>



<p>Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, temporarily halted BTC withdrawal twice in 24 hours, citing network congestion. The exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419622764720128?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">resumed</a> withdrawals, with transactions now successfully sent to wallets. </p>



<p>In a statement released by the exchange, fees have been adjusted to prevent a similar occurrence. At the same time, close monitoring will continue to be carried out, including exploring the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p>



<p>“<em>We’re looking to enable BTC Lightning network withdrawals for users within the next few months. The BTC Lightning network works just like any network; users can withdraw via the Lightning network from the Binance platform into their private wallets.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The decision of Binance to pause withdrawals sparked concerns about the exchange’s health on social media leading to a slight drop in price. BTC now trades at $27,635 at the time of writing, a 3% fall in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the failed FTX crypto exchange, has filed pre-trial motions to dismiss most of the charges levelled against him by United States prosecutors.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys are arguing that the implosion of FTX in November resulted from the so-called “crypto winter” and not any cruel intention. Their argument also lays blame on the U.S. government over its hostile regulatory environment around crypto assets in recent years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-classic-rush-to-judgement"><strong>“A Classic Rush To Judgement”</strong></h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, who is set to face criminal trial in October, has moved to dismiss all but three allegations against him.</p>



<p>In May 8 filings in the Southern District Court in New York, SBF’s lawyers sought to dismiss everything apart from charges alleging conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sam Bankman-Fried has filed motions to dismiss all but three charges in the criminal case against him.<br><br>The charges he is not contesting atm are:<br>5. Conspiracy to commit commodities fraud<br>6. Conspiracy to commit securities fraud<br>and<br>11. Conspiracy to commit money laundering <a href="https://t.co/0Dk1zxEw4j">pic.twitter.com/0Dk1zxEw4j</a></p>&mdash; Molly White (@molly0xFFF) <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1655751738568196096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The disgraced FTX founder, who is currently on house arrest in his parent’s home in Palo Alto, faces a total of 13 different charges ranging from wire fraud to bribery claims. His lawyers are, however, seeking the dismissal of 10 of these charges. The pretrial motions contend that four of the charges added from February, including foreign bribery, campaign finance, and bank fraud, violate “Treaty’s rule of specialty provision.” According to the “rule of specialty”, the U.S. should only trial Bankman-Fried for the offenses for which he was extradited from the Bahamas.</p>



<p>The early defense effort also asserts that the remaining six charges should be dismissed because the federal prosecutors failed to state an adequate offense in these counts.</p>



<p>Furthermore, SBF’s defence argues that the U.S. prosecutors’ pursuit of the fallen crypto star is a “classic rush to judgment.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blame Crypto Winter, Not FTX: SBF’s Defense Team</strong></h2>



<p>The legal team also contends that the bankruptcy of Bahamas-based FTX — once the third-biggest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume with a valuation of around $32 billion — was the result of a broader “crypto winter” last year, which saw the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dive, rather than failure to back FTX’s native token FTT, or secret loans from FTX to affiliated trading firm Alameda Research as alleged by prosecutors.</p>



<p>The defense claimed that “every major participant” in the crypto sector “cratered,” and compared the fall of various crypto companies to the infamous 2008 global financial crisis, which spurred the popularity of bitcoin and the blossoming of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>“Like many other cryptocurrency market participants and many other start-ups that experience exponential growth in a short period, FTX did not have fully developed controls and risk management protocols,” SBF’s defense posited. “FTX, like other market participants, was susceptible to a broader market collapse.”</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s estimated fortune of $26 billion, largely accrued during the crypto bull market, was seriously eroded after his crypto empire crumbled last year. Still, prosecutors have accused the former crypto mogul of splurging billions of customer funds on luxury property in the Bahamas, funding sports teams, and political donations in the United States.</p>

<p>Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continued to trade flatly towards the weekend, extending a two-week-long period of lacklustre price volatility.</p>



<p>Since plunging following the Shanghai-Shapella upgrade, the asset’s outlook has continued to weaken, with its price bouncing between $1,825 and $1,930. This weakness has resulted from various issues, key among them exchange inflow, which could be fuelling short-selling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exchange-deposits-soar"><strong>Exchange Deposits Soar</strong></h2>



<p>According to crypto analytics firm Santiment, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-mints-more-sharks-and-whales-amid-discounted-prices/">Ethereum</a> is facing another bout of turbulence as it experiences a fresh influx of coins into exchange addresses.</p>



<p>On Friday, the firm noted that the asset’s active exchange deposits had hit an eight-month high, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may soon be poised for increased volatility.</p>



<p><em>“Ethereum&#8217;s active deposits just hit an 8-month high,”</em> the firm tweeted, noting that&nbsp; Ether saw over 9,000 unique deposit addresses on exchanges. Notably, this has been the highest amount since September 15.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="657" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14-1024x657.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80669" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14-1024x657.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14-300x192.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14-768x493.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And while the cause of this surge in exchange deposits is still unclear, the firm warned that this trend could lead to an outcome similar to the spikes observed during the merge and FTX collapse. These incidents caused significant volatility in the Ethereum market, creating an unfavourable trading environment for many.</p>



<p>Today’s news comes just days after the firm reported a single transfer of 273,781 Ethereum tokens to Binance, one of the largest self-custody to-exchange transfers in five years.</p>



<p>“<em>With a $505M transfer of Ethereum tokens onto Binance today, this is one of the largest self-custody to exchange transfers in 5 years,”</em> the firm tweeted on Tuesday, May 2. Reportedly, the transfer also led to the largest daily exchange supply increase since the day before the merge.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ether’s&nbsp;Price Outlook</strong></h2>



<p>Normally, when users deposit cryptocurrencies onto exchanges, it indicates that they intend to sell or trade them. Selling can indicate potential negative price movement, so the recent surge in exchange deposits for Ethereum should be a cause for concern for investors and traders.</p>



<p>In the past two weeks, Ether whales with 1,000 to 10,000 Ethereum have offloaded&nbsp;over 110,000 Ether, according to a recent tweet by crypto analyst “Ali-charts.”</p>



<p>According to analyst “Crypto Patel”, Ether’s chart currently shows a strong range-bound market, with strong support at $1800 and resistance at $1930. In his view, there are currently two potential scenarios for Ether’s price.</p>



<p>Either the $1800 support breaks leading to a drop to $1400-$1500, or the $1800 support holds, and the price pushes to the $1930 resistance. If the price breaches that resistance, it could surge to $2100-$2500.</p>

<p>At press time, Ether was trading at $1,840, down 1.32% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of blockchain payments firm Ripple, has revealed the cost implications of its legal tussle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-200-million-in-legal-fees"><strong>$200 Million In Legal Fees&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>According to Brad Garlinghouse, the cost of Ripple Lab’s lawsuit with the SEC will be well above the nine-figure mark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking to onlookers at the Dubai Fintech Summit on Monday, Garlinghouse said his company will have spent an eye-popping $200 million in legal fees by the time the case is concluded.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">initiated </a>the lawsuit in December 2020, alleging that Ripple and two of its co-founders misled investors by raising over $1.3 billion in unlicensed securities since 2013; Ripple refutes that its XRP cryptocurrency is a security. The company <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-sets-up-regional-headquarters-in-dubai-as-company-considers-abandoning-the-us/">launched </a>a regional base in Dubai in the same year as it considered leaving the U.S.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse stated during the Summit that he would discourage cryptocurrency entrepreneurs from setting up shop in the U.S. as the nation has put politics ahead of policy. “If I were you, I would not start in the United States,” the Ripple boss posited, adding that several American-headquartered and publicly-traded companies would agree.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse went on to note that the United States’ regulatory progress is lagging significantly behind the United Arab Emirates virtual asset regulatory authority and the recent Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) bill in the European Union.</p>



<p>Crypto observers have accused U.S. regulators of using a regulation-by-enforcement strategy whereby watchdogs such as the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) choose to serve up suits and legal threats rather than formulate new laws for the still-nascent industry.</p>



<p>The SEC, in particular, has clamped down on some of the most high-profile crypto players over alleged breaches of securities regulations in recent months since the implosion of the FTX exchange. Ripple CEO, however, argued that the majority of people working in the crypto sector are good actors who want to follow the set rules but need them to be clearly defined.</p>



<p>The SEC vs Ripple suit has dragged on over the years, but it is expected in the next three to six weeks, there will be a judgment. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implications Of The Protracted XRP Lawsuit&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The XRP lawsuit is one closely followed by many members of the cryptoverse as they wait to see on whose side the pendulum will swing.</p>



<p>The ruling on the lawsuit has far-reaching repercussions on the evolving crypto industry. And as such, a victory for Ripple is a victory for the entire crypto industry.</p>



<p>Should District Judge Analisa Torres rule in Ripple’s favour, the regulators will be compelled to provide more straightforward laws for the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Yet, a loss for Ripple would give the SEC the necessary ammunition to continue cracking down on crypto players. Such companies and individuals will be forced to settle rather than pursue a legal fight with the regulatory agency.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has recently experienced a striking downturn, causing concern among investors. Bitcoin, in particular, which three weeks ago topped $30,000 for the first time since June 2022, has dropped roughly 8%, despite its range bound price.</p>



<p>At press time on Monday, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $27,877, down 2.74% in the past 24 hours. Overall, the global crypto market cap was down 2.17% to $1.15T, with about $134.10M worth of crypto being liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10-1024x647.png" alt="BTCUSD Chart by TradingView" class="wp-image-80648" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price decline coincided with a temporary closure of Bitcoin withdrawals on Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, from Sunday until Monday Morning. Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655380303383261185">reported</a> that the closure was due to the large volume of pending transactions, and their team is working on a fix to reopen withdrawals as soon as possible. Although withdrawals have since resumed, this incident caused widespread panic fuelling massive Bitcoin withdrawals from multiple exchanges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-s-price-outlook"><strong>Bitcoin’s Price Outlook</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the recent uncertainty, some experts remain optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term potential. On Sunday, Ali, a well-known crypto analyst, highlighted the surge in Bitcoin fees, indicating a busier network due to full blocks and growing transaction demand. According to him, this could be an early indication of a shift in the macro trend, moving from bearish to bullish.</p>



<p>Earlier on Monday, the pundit shared his analysis of Bitcoin’s price, noting;</p>



<p><em>“The most significant support level for Bitcoin is between $27,430 and $28,250, where 1.58 million addresses bought 560,000 $BTC. This demand wall must hold to prevent a downswing to $24,000-$24,900. On the flip side, BTC needs to break above $29,150 to advance further.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="390" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-1024x390.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80647" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-1024x390.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-300x114.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9-768x293.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-9.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Benjamin Cowen, author of the Into The Cryptoverse newsletter, on the other hand, warned of Bitcoin <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-could-slide-to-24000-as-short-term-holders-take-profit-glassnode/">dropping further</a> as we head into summer.</p>



<p>Today, the analyst predicted that Bitcoin&#8217;s price would fluctuate within the range of $12,000 to $35,000 for the remainder of the year, but he clarified that he does not anticipate the price to reach either extreme. This projection is in anticipation of Bitcoin&#8217;s halving, which is scheduled for next year.</p>



<p><em>“Sometime as we get into the summer months, some of the interest will likely Wane,</em> and in the second half of the year,<em> it could be just a complete opposite of what we&#8217;ve seen in the first half of the year,”</em> Cowen said on his youtube channel. </p>



<p>That said, investors will also be closely monitoring the upcoming release of the Core CPI on Wednesday and its potential impact on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Recently, Bitcoin&#8217;s movements have been influenced by speculation about the U.S. Federal Reserve ending its year-long trend of raising interest rates. If Wednesday&#8217;s figures come lower than expected, they may support dovish sentiments, potentially driving Bitcoin&#8217;s price higher.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu has been on a roll lately, with its unique blend of meme culture and cutting-edge technology captivating the cryptocurrency world: a cute dog mascot and community-driven approach <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-investors-scoop-billions-of-shiba-inu-kucoin-ceo-reveals-why-hes-holding-shib-for-the-long-term/">became a favourite</a> among investors and traders alike. But what really sets Shiba Inu apart is its upcoming Shibarium project and how it could potentially impact the price of SHIB, especially in the face of forecasts of a $0.001 price.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-shibarium-renews-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-shiba-inus-metaverse-sees-major-developments/">Shibarium</a> is essentially an upcoming Layer-2 blockchain network encompassing a decentralized exchange (DEX), Metaverse, and games that will be built on Ethereum for the Shiba Inu blockchain. The DEX will enable users to trade SHIB and other tokens in a completely decentralized manner without the need for a centralized exchange. This is a significant development, as decentralized exchanges are becoming increasingly popular due to their greater security and transparency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-sets-shibarium-apart"><strong>What sets Shibarium apart?</strong></h2>



<p>One of the key benefits of Shibarium is that it will incentivize users to hold SHIB in order to participate in the platform. Users who hold SHIB will be able to stake it on Shibarium and earn rewards in the form of other tokens. This will create a demand for SHIB, potentially increasing its price.</p>



<p>Another way that Shibarium could impact the price of SHIB is through increased exposure. As a decentralized exchange built on the Shiba Inu blockchain, Shibarium will likely attract much attention from the cryptocurrency community. This could lead to more people becoming interested in SHIB, which could increase demand and its price.</p>



<p>Of course, it&#8217;s important to note that the price of SHIB is notoriously volatile, and projections of a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">$0.001 price</a> should be taken with a grain of salt. However, Shibarium could potentially provide some stability to the price of SHIB, as it will create major use cases for the token beyond speculation. If Shibarium proves to be successful, it could also lead to other developments on the Shiba Inu blockchain, which could further increase the value of SHIB.</p>



<p>All in all, Shibarium is a significant development for Shiba Inu and can potentially impact the price of SHIB in several ways. By incentivizing users to hold SHIB and creating exposure for the token, Shibarium will likely drive up demand and create some stability for the price. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are notoriously unpredictable, and investors should always research and approach any investment cautiously.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC price regains $29,000 level after considerable volatility this past week resulting in diverse speculations on the asset’s future growth. </li>



<li>BTC continues to surge this year amid a weaker US dollar and several banking turmoils springing up the “<em>haven” </em>sentiments in the market.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Bitcoin margin and derivatives market show more optimism as the asset reclaims $29,000 after several experts predicted a $25k drop. </li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has had a wild run this year after recording over 72% growth over the past months with several indicators pointing upward despite slight price corrections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The price of BTC was riddled with a little over 10% price fluctuations between $27,000 and $30,000 from April 25 to May 1. On a much <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">positive</a> front, BTC is up 72% year to date (YTD) together with the S&amp;P 500 has made 9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From its yearly high of over $30,000, BTC dropped as low as $21,700 with some experts predicting a sharp decline as low as $25,000 before another upward movement. However indicators like Bitcoin margin and derivatives market contradicts this view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from OKX shows that traders increased their margin lending ratio between April 17 and April 28. On April 27, it recorded a positive 43% ratio on BTC longs marking its highest level in 40 days. Margin trading gives insight into the stance of professional traders because they borrow assets to leverage their positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To properly get a grasp of traders&#8217; sentiment, the long-to-short metric is used which gathers traders’ positions from perpetual and spot contracts giving better analysis. BTC currently trades at $28,190 at press time after ending April at $29,230.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-derivatives-market-is-equally-positive">The derivatives market is equally positive&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Like the margin market, the BTC derivatives market shows strength despite failing to break past the $30,000 level. According to the long-to-short indicator, traders increased long positions with futures between April 17 and April 28.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Binance, the long-to-short ratio increased with longs moving from 1.12 to 1.26 on April 30. A similar increase was also recorded on OKX after the long-to-short ratio increased from 0.66 on April 27 to 0.93 on May 1. As both future and margin market indicators show strength, some BTC faithful have expressed optimism about the asset’s growth. </p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin has climbed this year with a weaker US dollar and several <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-price-makes-slight-gains-in-the-wake-of-first-republic-banks-imminent-price-fall/">banking</a> debacles. First Republic Bank joins Signature and Silicon Valley Banks to become one of the most recent bank collapses this year. The fall in these three banks has sparked widespread speculation on BTC being the haven when traditional finance crumbles. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-warns-that-pepe-has-no-utility"><strong>Binance warns that PEPE has no utility</strong></h2>



<p>Binance warned in their statement that the PEPE token &#8220;has no utility and was created by an anonymous team&#8221;, so they invited their users to properly research before investing in these types of tokens.</p>



<p><em>“FLOKI and PEPE are relatively new tokens that pose a higher than normal risk, and as such will likely be subject to high price volatility. Please ensure that you exercise sufficient risk management, have done your own research in regards to FLOKI and PEPE’s fundamentals, and fully understand the projects before opting to trade the tokens.”</em></p>



<p>Additionally, they explained that “there are signs that certain insiders or team members were able to buy 7% of the total token supply minutes after TGE.” This means that the price of PEPE in dollars could collapse at any time if project members with the largest holdings decide to sell their tokens.</p>



<p>Even on the PEPE website, they warn that &#8220;the coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only&#8221;, and it was created to become the largest of its kind, surpassing popular ones like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PEPE price increased more than 1200% in a week</strong></h2>



<p>Despite Binance&#8217;s warnings, the FUD around these meme coins has been so great that even on Twitter, the hashtag #PEPE became a worldwide trend with more than 4 million tweets at the time of Binance&#8217;s announcement.</p>



<p>This led to the price of PEPE, which already had an increase of over 800% during the last week, rising to a high of 136% today, from $0.0000019 to a peak of $0.0000045.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, PEPE maintains a market cap of over $1.1 billion, according to CoinGecko. This market cap has been amassed in less than a month since its creation.</p>

<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has introduced a new legislative proposal to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and safeguard investors.</p>



<p>Known as the CRPTO Act, the said regulation proposes several measures, such as requiring independent auditing and the publishing of financial statements by crypto companies, preventing individuals who own crypto exchanges from also owning the companies that trade on those exchanges, and prohibiting crypto exchanges from keeping custody of customers’ funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The legislation also seeks to prevent conflicts of interest, financial shenanigans and requires platforms to reimburse customers who are victims of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Rampant fraud and dysfunction have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency and it is time to bring law and order to the multi-billion-dollar industry,”</em> James said in a Friday <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-proposes-nation-leading-regulations-cryptocurrency">statement,</a> adding, “<em>These commonsense regulations will bring more transparency and oversight to the industry and strengthen our ability to crack down on those that don’t pay respect to the law.”</em></p>



<p>The proposed legislation is a response to growing concerns over the cryptocurrency industry&#8217;s lack of transparency and oversight, which has been plagued by rampant fraud and dysfunction, leading to a spate of high-end financial scandals.</p>



<p>The latest proposal comes even as the state of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/new-york-regulator-strengthens-anti-fraud-unit-to-curb-crypto-related-crime/">intensifies efforts</a> to rein over the crypto industry, especially after the collapse of FTX last November. Recently, James filed lawsuits against KuCoin and CoinEx, accusing the two exchanges of failing to register as securities and commodities brokers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, she warned Nexo against operating illegally and ordered it to stop issuing Binance USD (BUSD), the third largest stablecoin by market cap. In addition to cautioning investors against dabbling with crypto assets severally, in November 2022, James urged Congress to adopt legislation prohibiting investing retirement funds in cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>That said, her latest proposal continues to receive support from various lawmakers and industry players who see it as creating fair and several environments for crypto investors in New York.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I applaud New York State Attorney General Letitia James for the timely introduction of this legislation to protect New Yorkers from financial harm by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for the opaque cryptocurrency market,”</em> said&nbsp;State Senator Kevin Parker. <em>“The cryptocurrency industry must be held to the same macroprudential financial regulations as our traditional financial institutions to ensure accountability and market stability.”</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, New York watchdogs aren’t the only ones tightening their nose around crypto. Various federal and government agencies, including the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-congressman-mulls-pushing-legislation-to-remove-secs-gary-gensler/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), continue to scrutinize crypto activities even as the US grapples with adopting comprehensive legislation for the fast-growing industry.</p>

<p>PEPE, the latest <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-and-doge-killer-pepe-coin-eyes-monstrous-highs-despite-already-gaining-2000-in-a-week/">meme coin sensation</a>, has been on a tear, soaring roughly 400% in the past week as investors pour money into the token, hoping to make some returns. On Friday, the meme coin surged as high as $0.0000045 after being listed on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The price, however, faced a sharp pullback Saturday, plunging roughly 40% as some earlier investors, taking advantage of the week’s rally, booked profits. Following the price drop, various investors have been hit hard, with one whale losing just over half a million dollars.</p>



<p>On Sunday, May 2, on-chain analytics firm Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1655083589967683584">highlighted</a> a whale who lost approximately $541,000 worth of PEPE after buying a substantial sum about two days ago. Reportedly, the anonymous entity purchased 962.3B $PEPE worth $2.46M along with 70 $WBTC worth $2.07M and 470 $ETH worth $937K. However, by noon on Sunday, his PEPE stash had taken a loss of approximately $541K.</p>



<p>PEPE was launched mid-last month as a meme coin, paying homage to the popular internet meme Pepe the Frog. Although its website mentions that the token has no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return, investors have been flocking to buy it, especially after some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-this-early-pepe-buyer-turned-260-into-almost-8-million-amid-meme-coin-frenzy/">early investors</a> made staggering profits.</p>



<p>In less than three weeks, the token has attracted a significant market cap of just over $1 billion and currently ranks 44<sup>th</sup> among the largest cryptocurrencies. Notably, Sentiment has been highlighting various whale purchases, with some buyers <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1654351841189318658">swapping</a> meme coins such as Shiba Inu and DOGE for PEPE.</p>



<p>Meme coins have been gaining popularity in the cryptocurrency market recently, despite being absent for nearly a year following last year’s brutal winter. These tokens are created based on popular memes and have no real-world use cases. They are often created as a joke, but some, like Dogecoins and Shiba Inu, have gained significant traction and market value due to their enhanced use cases.</p>



<p>Notably, as PEPE has no formal team or roadmap and is purely for entertainment purposes only, it remains highly speculative and can lead to substantial losses within short periods, according to some experts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“If all of a sudden people realize that PEPE has no value and it collapses, you’re going to wipe a billion dollars off this market in minutes. The sooner these things collapse the better because we don’t want it to create a greater market contagion,” </em>crypto analyst Ran Neuner said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the recent loss incurred by the PEPE whale highlighting the highly volatile nature of meme coins and the risks involved in investing in them, investors must exercise caution and thoroughly research the token and its potential risks before investing.</p>



<p>At press time, PEPE was trading at $0.000002888, down 0.54% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Is meme coin season really back?</p>



<p>Pepe (PEPE), the token which sprouted out of the &#8220;Pepe the Frog&#8221; meme and went live a little over two weeks ago, has already minted many millionaires overnight.</p>



<p>One early PEPE buyer swapped 0.125 ETH worth $260 for 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens last month. Those tokens are currently worth nearly $8 million, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-millionaire"><strong>PEPE Millionaire</strong></h2>



<p>Meme coins have enjoyed somewhat of a renaissance in recent weeks. PEPE has seen <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-and-doge-killer-pepe-coin-eyes-monstrous-highs-despite-already-gaining-2000-in-a-week/">particularly high interest</a> as investors flock to the frog-themed token, hoping to repeat the success of rival dog-themed meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (INU).</p>



<p>The newly-launched PEPE received a massive boost yesterday after the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, listed the token in the platform’s so-called innovation zone. PEPE soared another 124% over the past day, pushing the frog-inspired token’s market cap above the $1 billion mark. One PEPE is currently worth $0.000003 per CoinGecko. With an impressive market value of over $1 billion, PEPE is now the 40th largest cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Arkham recalls that buyer dimethyltryptamine.eth, who remains anonymous, scooped up $260 worth of PEPE last month, and his stockpile has now ballooned to almost $8 million. However, this PEPE holder could encounter problems trying to realize that profit due to liquidity concerns around the meme coin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is PEPE?</strong></h2>



<p>Pepe creators branded it “the most memeable memecoin in existence.&#8221; The token has a circulating supply of 420 trillion, a reference to &#8220;4/20,&#8221; a popular cannabis culture slang.</p>



<p>Traders have a knack for jumping on the meme coin craze, mainly after the meteoric rise of tokens such as dogecoin and Shiba inu — which rocketed to tens of billions in market capitalization during the previous bull market.</p>



<p>Pepe appears to have taken the crown as traders’ favourite meme coin. Earlier this week, trading volume for PEPE surpassed that for both DOGE and SHIB.</p>



<p>While PEPE’s huge rally has turned some early investors into millionaires — on paper, at least — dimethyltryptamine.eth has yet to sell his tokens, underscoring a popular trend of long-term holding strategies among crypto investors.</p>

<p>May 2023 started with yet another tumultuous week for the US Banking sector. On May 1, 2023, the federal government seized First Republic Bank following weeks over which depositors and investors pulled out their money. First Republic Bank was initially bailed out in March 2023 after receiving US$30 billion in deposits from the United States&#8217; (U.S.) largest banks.</p>



<p>According to a May 1, 2023 press release, JPMorgan Chase confirmed that it had acquired a substantial majority of assets and assumed the deposits and certain liabilities of First Republic Bank through a competitive bidding process from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</p>



<p>According to a company blog post, Gemini crypto exchange revealed plans to expand to the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region to grow its international business and capitalize on increasing demand for crypto and Web3 products. On May 1, 2023, Gemini announced that its derivatives platform, Gemini Foundation, was open for trading to eligible customers except those in the U.S., the United Kingdom, and the European Union.</p>



<p>On May 2, 2023, Coinbase Global Incorporation announced the launch of Coinbase International Exchange, which shall offer derivatives trading out of Bermuda. Coinbase International Exchange will offer perpetual Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures to institutional investors outside the U.S.</p>



<p>On May 2, 2023, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for March 2023. The survey revealed that job openings decreased to 9.6 million on the last business day of the month, down from almost 10 million reported for February 2023.</p>



<p>The decline in job openings suggests some softening in the U.S. labour market. The number of hires and total separations remained unchanged at 6.1 million and 5.9 million, respectively, while layoffs and discharges (1.8 million) increased.</p>



<p>On May 3, 2023, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Policy Committee (FOMC) raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, taking the Fed funds rate to a target range of 5.00% to 5.25%. The FOMC will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for future monetary policy.</p>



<p>On May 4, 2023, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided to raise its three key interest rates by 25 basis points, noting that though headline inflation had declined over recent months, underlying price pressures remained. The ECB interest rate hikes are effective May 10, 2023.</p>



<p>In the 24 hours before the Fed’s interest rate decision, Bitcoin and Ether traded at around US$28,300 and US$1,850, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. However, after the Fed interest rate announcement, Bitcoin and Ether tested the US$29,000 and the US$1,900 price marks, respectively, though both cryptocurrencies have retraced slightly as of press time.</p>

<p>Do Kwon, co-founder and former CEO of now-defunct Terraform Labs, is facing a jail term of up to 40 years in South Korea, the country where he committed most of his crimes.</p>



<p>The prosecutor overseeing Kwon’s probe believes that the repatriation of the South Korean national would be the best way to serve justice to investors who were affected by the unprecedented collapse of the Terra ecosystem back in May 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kwon-s-extradition-to-s-korea-would-best-serve-justice-to-terra-victims-prosecutor"><strong>Kwon’s Extradition To S.Korea Would Best Serve Justice To Terra Victims: Prosecutor</strong></h2>



<p>South Korean prosecutors are pushing for Do Kwon to face justice in his native homeland.</p>



<p>Kwon is accused of orchestrating the fall of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) alongside the network’s native asset LUNA, which saw over $40 billion wiped out from the crypto market and sparked fears of contagion across the market.</p>



<p>The leader of the South Korean prosecutors&#8217; team investigating the implosion of the two cryptocurrencies, Dan Sung-han, notes that South Korea is where most of Kwon’s crimes took place and his accomplices are also based there. “Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice [to investors]”, the prosecutor said in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-prosecutor-calls-for-crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-to-face-charges-in-home-country-639f5515">interview </a>with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>



<p>As such, Sung-Han is pushing for the former Terraform Labs CEO to face criminal charges in his home country, despite efforts from the U.S. government to extradite him.</p>



<p>Kwon and his associates are facing charges of fraud, breaches of Korean capital markets laws, using bots to manipulate transaction volumes, bribery, and a string of other financial crimes.</p>



<p>If found guilty, Do Kwon would likely face an unparalleled jail term for a financial crime in the nation’s history. Per Sung-han, it could potentially transcend the 40-year prison sentence handed out to Seoul-based Optimus Asset Management CEO Kim Jae-Hyun.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the disgraced crypto mogul has requested that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">charges </a>brought against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) be dismissed.</p>



<p>Whether Kwon will be extradited to South Korea or the United States will be determined once Montenegro authorities conclude their case against him for document forgery charges.</p>
