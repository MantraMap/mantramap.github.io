The coin price showed a quick rebound of 17.4% and hit the local resistance of $55.6. Using the aforementioned level as base support, the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-stocks/COIN/">COIN price</a> shows the formation of a double bottom pattern in the daily time frame chart.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formation of the double bottom pattern is a sign of potential recovery and trend reversal.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish divergence in the daily RSI slope reflects increasing buying pressure</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a> is a sign of aggressive accumulation of buyers at a particular support. This setup is one of the famous bullish reversal patterns which offers a significant upswing upon the breakout of its neckline resistance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the COIN Price trades at $55.59 and struggles to breach the overhead resistance of $55.6. Under the influence of this pattern, the price is likely to rise another 18.5% to challenge the $66.3 neckline.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout above $66.3 with daily candle closing must trigger the bullish pattern. The post-breakout rally could push the Coinbase share price to the $85.3 mark.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will the $COIN Price Regain the $70 mark?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the double bottom pattern, the Coinbase share price is likely to witness gradual growth in the near future. However, the potential rally could face multiple resistance such as $55.6 and daily EMAs(20, 50, and 100) before hitting the key neckline resistance of $55.6. An upside breakout from this resistance will pave the way for further growth and push the prices to the $66 mark. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relative Strength</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The rising <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> against the sideways price action gives an excellent confirmation of rising bullish momentum for a potential rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exponential Moving Average</strong>: the 20, 50, and 100 <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a> wavering just above the $66.3 barrier indicates the buyers will face multiple resistance on the upside.</span></li>

The current price slip has extended the losses over the past 7 days.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ethereum Profitability Outlook</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite its short term performance, the digital currency has remained one of the most attractive digital currencies for longer term success in the industry. With a market capitalization of $209.26 billion, Ethereum has maintained a relative profitability with its value jumping by 43.96% in the year to date (YTD) period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the turmoil the market has experienced over the past few weeks, more Ethereum addresses are still in profit. </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/ETH/deep-dive?group=financials&amp;chart=inAndOut" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">Per data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from IntoTheBlock (ITB), a total of 57.5 million addresses are in profit, accounting for a total of 59.66% of all total active addresses. In the same vein, addresses in loss totals 36.84 million or 38.22% of the total wallets holding Ether.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_152161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152161" style="width: 1351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-152161" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/18224703/Ethereum-In-Out.jpg" alt="" width="1351" height="513" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-152161" class="wp-caption-text">Ethereum Profitability Chart. Source: <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/ETH/deep-dive?group=financials&amp;chart=inAndOut" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IntoTheBlock</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This data is reflective of the resilience of the digital currency amid the regulatory turmoil that is threatening exchanges and other tokens including Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) amongst others. While the hurdles being faced by these digital assets are supposed to be a boost for Ethereum, many are </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-sees-sharp-selloff-as-it-got-embroiled-in-hinman-email-controversy/"><span style="font-weight: 400">skeptical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the cryptocurrency will be safe should there be a regulatory purge to determine what assets are securities or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Per the data gleaned from ITB, just about 2.05 million addresses are experiencing neutral profitability without a loss or gain.</span></p>
<h2><b>Outlook on Ethereum Price</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-crash-xrp-ethereum-sell-off-market-bleeds-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the industry at this time, Ethereum is one of the top tokens with a good projection to outrank Bitcoin in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Ethereum Foundation has continued to double down on their push to turn the blockchain into a completely functional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with a series of upgrades scheduled for the next few months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riding on its outlook and inherent developmental effort, we can expect the price of the ETH to continue on its upward trajectory in the long term.</span></p>

<h2><b>BabyDogeSwap and the Competition to Beat</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The launch of the BabyDogeSwap platform can be tagged a watershed moment for the memecoin community with broad services now open to all. As the protocol revealed, users can now swap their tokens using its aggregator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond token swapping, users can also functionally create farms and pools on demand, and also utilize the DEX’s free token locker, and also checkout the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) hosted on the trading platform.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While launching its DEX makes BabyDoge special, thelandmark has been pioneered by Shiba Inu which has the ShibaSwap exchange. The ShibaSwap exchange has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/poloniex-shiba-inu-ecosystem-token-bone/"><span style="font-weight: 400">earned itself a place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> among the most used trading platforms in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) world and observers will be looking at whether or not the BabyDogeSwap platform will be beating its distant rival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the moment, ShibaSwap maintains close to a million dollars in daily trading volume according to data from CoinMarketCap.</span></p>
<h2><b>Pursuing Additional Utility</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While it will be focusing on building out its new trading platform, BabyDoge, the memecoin that attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the largest pet donations in the world is also planning to capitalize on existing innovations designed to empower its community members and add to the valuation of its token.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of these innovations is its token burn program and it said users who use its burn portal to burn their BabyDoge will get lower trading fees on the new exchange. Additionally, a Virtual Crypto Card will be made available to let people spend their crypto while also integrating an on-ramp feature to allow users withdraw funds to their accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having built a community with more than 1.9 million followers on Twitter, the launch of the BabyDogeSwap is bound to help boost sentiment on the prospects of the protocol in the long term. While doing all it can to differentiate its growth path from Shiba Inu and </span><a href="https://coingape.com/shibarium-news-puppynet-early-public-beta-release-shiba-inu/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shibarium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the new exchange launch can help reverse the current bearish course of the memecoin which is changing hands at $0.0000000014 at the time of writing.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the $0.0000072 resistance sets the memecoin&#8217;s price up for a quick 6% rise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SHIB price exhibits a temporary relief rally before the downtrend potentially resumes.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of four consecutive days, the SHIB price recorded a 13% growth, reaching the current trading price of $0.00000742. With a sustained rally, prices are likely to rise by 6% before encountering combined resistance at $0.00000783 and the downsloping trendline.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This resistance trendline has been hindering bullish growth in the Shiba Inu coin for the past four months. Therefore, a potential retest could replenish selling momentum and reinforce the continuation of the prevailing downtrend.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For SHIB buyers to maintain trend control, the coin price must breach the overhead trendline with a daily candle closing above it.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will Shiba Inu Kickstart a New Recovery Cycle?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the recent price jump, the SHIB price surpassed the minor resistance at $0.0000072, providing buyers with a solid foundation to ascend in the price chart. However, buyers are currently struggling at the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) slope, which has acted as a barrier preventing progress for over two months. Thus, the daily chart highlights several resistances that could impede sustained growth in Shiba Inu prices.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Average Directional Index</strong>: The high value of the average directional index (ADX) slope reflects instability in the current downtrend, indicating the need for relief before the further downfall.</span></li>

<h2><b>Defining BitGo CEO’s Support for Ripple</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/mikebelshe/status/1670089036172541955"><span style="font-weight: 400">Twitter post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Belshe clarified that his support for Ripple&#8217;s victory in the lawsuit was not driven by personal affection for XRP but rather by a desire to bring about regulatory change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He expressed the belief that a favorable outcome for Ripple would pave the way for regulatory frameworks that foster innovation, just as Bitcoin (BTC) was allowed to develop without being stifled by regulatory burdens in its early stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In his statement, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe drew a parallel between the early days of Bitcoin and the current situation with Ripple and XRP. Belshe pointed out that Bitcoin, despite its vision of decentralization, had a centralized aspect in its early years, similar to Ripple. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Consequently, he suggested that if Bitcoin had been subjected to the same regulatory scrutiny as Ripple is facing now, it could have been labeled a “security”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is worth mentioning that Belshe&#8217;s viewpoint underscores the broader debate surrounding the regulatory treatment of crypto and the need for clear guidelines to accommodate innovation in the digital asset space.</span></p>
<h2><b>Anticipation on the Closure of Ripple vs SEC Case Grows</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Ripple vs. SEC legal battle, which has spanned for two years, is entering its final stages, creating anticipation within the crypto community. The outcome of this lawsuit is highly anticipated due to its potential impact on the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Ripple and the SEC present their arguments and evidence, stakeholders in the crypto industry closely follow the developments, eager to see how the court&#8217;s decision will shape the future of digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/sponsored/ripple-xrp-confident-of-sec-victory-polygon-matic-tvl-rise-sparklo-sprk-launches-unique-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400">expressed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> hope in the ongoing SEC complaint alleging that XRP was offered as an unregistered security. Garlinghouse noted that  the much-anticipated verdict will come shortly.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a recent interview, Garlinghouse </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-ceo-expects-xrp-lawsuit-verdict-in-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hinted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that after resolution over crucial Hinman Docs. a judgment might land in the coming weeks.</span></p>

During this consolidation phase, the daily chart has shown long price rejections at both of these levels, indicating uncertainty among market participants. However, despite the volatility, the coin price has not violated the levels of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/falling-wedge-pattern-what-to-do-if-it-appears-on-a-crypto-chart/#:~:text=By%20Coingape%20Staff&amp;text=A%20falling%20wedge%20pattern%20is,in%20a%20falling%20wedge%20pattern.">falling wedge pattern</a>, suggesting that the Terra Classic coin price is primed for significant growth.</span></p>
<h2><b>LUNC Price Daily Chart:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The range between $0.000102 and $0.0000826 represents a no-trading zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coin traders may face demand pressure at the $0.0000826 level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the LUNC coin is $36.5 million, indicating a 24% gain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/Okfyw2r7.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />(Source: Tradingview)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the broader market sentiment, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic/">LUNC price</a> experienced a downturn from the local resistance of $0.000102. This decline led to a 13% drop in the coin price within a week, bringing it to the current price of $0.0000889.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the bearish momentum persists, there is a likelihood of the coin price plunging another 7% to reach the strong monthly support level of $0.0000826. This retest will serve as a gauge of buyers&#8217; conviction to sustain higher prices and could potentially act as a launching pad for a trend reversal.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as the range levels of $0.000102 and $0.0000826 remain intact, the Terra Classic coin price is expected to continue moving sideways and undergo a volatile phase.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under pessimistic conditions, a breakdown of the aforementioned support levels will intensify selling pressure in the market, potentially pushing the price toward the $0.000062 mark.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will the LUNC Price Kick-Start a New Recovery Cycle?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, a falling wedge pattern is influencing the ongoing correction phase in the LUNC price. The resistance trendline of this pattern has repeatedly thwarted buyers&#8217; attempts over the past seven months. Therefore, a key requirement for buyers to regain control of the trend is a bullish breakout above the aforementioned trendline, which could potentially trigger a rally above the $0.0001 mark.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Despite the lower low in price action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI</a> is showing a noticeable rally, indicating&#8230;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Bands:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The relatively flat upper and lower bands of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger Band indicator</a> can serve as significant resistance/support levels, potentially prolonging the sideways trend.</span></li>

Moreover, the coin price witnessed a surge in buying pressure as the investors got attracted to the discounted price. The resulting relief rally surged the altcoin 8.3% higher to hit the immediate resistance of $1770. Is the ETH price ready to reclaim lost ground?</span></p>

<h2><b>Ethereum Price Daily Chart</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ETH price wobbled in a no-trading range from $1775 and a rising trendline.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A downsloping trendline leads to the current correction in the coin</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.8 Billion, indicating a 37.5% loss.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last three days&#8217; recovery in ETH price faced recuperated selling pressure at $1175 resistance. The long-tail rejection candle at the aforementioned resistance on June 17th indicates the sellers continue to dominate the market, and buyers may struggle to rise higher.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the build-up buying pressure due to discounted price and overall downtrend, the ETH price could see a volatile week ahead. The coin price currently trades at $1731 and could continue to resonate in a narrow range between ascending trendline and $1175 resistance.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the potential buyers must wait for a breakout above the $1175 and overhead resistance trendline to get additional confirmation of a potential rally. The post-breakout rally could surge the prices to $1930, followed by $2020, and $2138.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will $ETH Price Lose $1600?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the long-coming support trendline is intact, the Ethereum buyers can hold to their long positions. However, in case of a bearish breakdown below the support trendline, the sellers will gain an additional barrier to pressurize the price lower. This breakdown will signal a trend change which could plunge the prices to the next significant support of $1375.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the current consolidation, the ADA price shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a> in the 4-hour time frame chart. By the press time, the ADA price trades at $0.266 and continues to resonate within the two converging trendlines.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this triangle pattern usually offers a brief break before the coin price continues to the prevailing trend. Therefore, with a higher possibility a breakdown below the support trendline will accelerate the selling pressure and tumble price by 9% to the bottom support the $0.24.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the ADA price showed a long-tail rejection candle at $0.24 support indicating this level stands as a strong accumulation zone and a crucial point of a trend reversal.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Cardano Price Reach $275 Mark?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Cardano coin price to reclaim higher grounds, the buyers need to breach the overhead trendline of the triangle pattern. This breakout may offer buyers a solid springboard to push prices to higher levels and challenge the immediate horizontal resistance of $253. </span></p>

In essence, the Hinman documents revealed that the SEC was in favor of <a href="https://coingape.com/category/ethereum-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, compared to other crypto tokens. Hinman <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-eth-hinman-sec-ripple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasized</a> that digital assets offered as securities can eventually change into a non-security asset. However, he chose to name only Ethereum as not a security, while the XRP holders have been affected by the Ripple lawsuit on the same argument.</p>

<p>In March 2023, Judge Torres ruled on motions filed by both parties to rule out expert testimony. Over 100 days from the March ruling, the Summary Judgement is still awaited. This delay is longer than the Judge&#8217;s average time taken from Daubert rulings in previous cases, and hence, the Summary Judgement in Ripple lawsuit is expected to come any time.</p>
<h2>Ripple XRP Victory Judgement Before July 1, 2023 ?</h2>
<p>The US Federal Reserve had already <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230315a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the FedNow Service will begin operations in July 2023. The service facilitates instant payment services by financial institutions all over the United States, around the clock and throughout the year. Interestingly, among the banks that have been <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1670235298981367808" target="_blank" rel="noopener">onboarded</a> for the July 1 launch are three Ripple partnered banks: Finastra, Volante Technologies and ACI Worldwide. Hence, the crypto community is wondering whether the Ripple lawsuit judgement has to be delivered before FedNow launch to ensure <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/MarkBas83036774/status/1670236363269058562?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal compliance</a>.</p>

This was when Cuban tried to approach the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> about finding the guidelines on how to register a crypto token. With this, he had boiled down to the real reason why crypto firms find it really difficult to register with the agency, as things stand in terms of the rules. This could also make an interesting case for discussions with lawmakers on crypto, as we head to the election year.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Cuban&#8217;s experience showed that most of the companies in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> would &#8220;love&#8221; to register with the SEC if the agency made it simpler to do so. Another important concern is the relatively high costs and delays when it comes to the registration timeline.</p>
<h2>When Mark Cuban Tried To Register A Token</h2>
<p>According to Marc Cuban, SEC Chair Gary Gensler does not understand three things about crypto and small businesses and start ups: difficulty with approval delay, legal fees and complex rules. He added that he would bet almost all of the companies would love to register with the SEC if these issues are fixed. There are &#8220;zero easy to follow guidelines&#8221; for small crypto start ups to follow, he <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1670131669096095744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I had someone who I work with call the SEC and ask them about how to register a token. Where could we find guidelines. They .. effectively told us that we should probably get a securities lawyer to help.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The investor stressed on the need for legal help for startups with small capital, when it comes to registration and compliance. All the SEC needs to do is make it easy and relatively inexpensive for firms to register, he concluded.</p>

Bigwigs like Wall Street bank JP Morgan and asset manager Blackrock are already in the game, but it is unclear as to how long it would take for US regulators to lay a clear path for crypto regulation. Also, the US presidential election 2024 could be a stumbling block amid efforts in that direction in Washington DC.</p>

<p>Very recently, the crypto market ecosystem in the United States faced a major blow in the form of back to back lawsuits against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. The SEC charged two of the world&#8217;s top crypto exchanges of violating securities laws.</p>
<h2>Raoul Pal On Crypto In US</h2>
<p>Earlier, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-to-be-reality-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Blackrock, the world’s largest assets manager, was filing for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) application with the SEC. This came after the company&#8217;s 2022 launch of a spot Bitcoin private trust. In this context, investment strategist Raoul Pal feels not all is in the red when it comes to SEC Chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s actions on crypto. Pal echoed XRP Lawyer John Deaton&#8217;s views that Gensler was in the crypto enforcement mode to make some way for incumbents to gain some market share before full scale regulation kicks in.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gensler is giving Blackrock the BTC ETF the nod and also got that Prometheum circus going to “prove” that he isn’t stopping crypto entirely. It’s all politics and in the end he throws a bone to Wall St so he can suggest they are “more trusted”.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The macro guru believes Gensler&#8217;s actions are &#8220;all politics&#8221; to throw &#8220;a bone to the Wall Street.&#8221; He also the mentioned the SEC&#8217;s recent &#8216;approval&#8217; of crypto firm Prometheum.</p>

<p>So, back to proper news. The million dollar class action lawsuit filed against Elon Musk for insider trading of cryptocurrency Dogecoin took a new turn today.  Elon Musk&#8217;s lawyer Alex Spiro revealed that Mr. Musk does not own any Dogecoin wallets that were part of price manipulation.</p>
<p>Earlier, a class action lawsuit was filed against the billionaire for allegedly manipulating price of Dogecoin and cashing out $95 Million in pump dump.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Wallets In Lawsuit Does Not Belong To Elon Musk?</h2>
<p>Elon Musk has publicly promoted Dogecoin on multiple occasions mostly to his large number of twitter followers. It was always believed that the billionaire is actually a Dogecoin holder. The ongoing proceedings in the lawsuit filed against Elon Musk particularly mention dogecoin wallets that benefitted from Elon Musk&#8217;s tweets between April 3rd, 2023 to April 9th, 2023.</p>
<blockquote><p>On April 3rd, 2023 <a href="https://coingape.com/why-elon-musk-changed-twitters-logo-to-dogecoin-doge/">Elon Musk changed twitter famous bird logo to Dogecoin</a> symbol representing a Shiba Inu Dog. This was followed by a massive rise of 25% in Dogecoin price in a single day.</p></blockquote>
<p>As reported by <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/15/elon-musk-denies-owning-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-wallets/" rel="nofollow">NY Post</a>, his lawyer today in the court blasted at plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer for assuming that the wallet in trial belong to billionaire Elon Musk. He argued that sole basis for the lawsuit is that these wallets belong to Elon and which is in fact wrong.</p>
<h2><strong>Does Elon Musk Own Dogecoin? </strong></h2>
<p>As falsely reported by many popular publishers, Elon Musk does not own any Dogecoin, but actually he has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/20/elon-musk-discloses-that-tesla-owns-dogecoin-but-how-much-does-it-have/" rel="nofollow">publicly admitted of owning cryptocurrencies</a> including Dogecoin. He may have other wallets which were never a part of pump dump. So, this FUD that Elon Musk is not owning any Dogecoin may be actually untrue.</p>
<p>In a tweet from, October 2021, Elon Musk shared that he own Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Out of curiosity, I acquired some ascii hash strings called “Bitcoin, Ethereum &amp; Doge”. That’s it. </p>
<p>As I’ve said before, don’t bet the farm on crypto! True value is building products &amp; providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452334458066149377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>We will keep you updated as and when we find actual Dogecoin wallets associated with Tesla CEO.</p>

Though the breakdown was supposed to intensify the selling pressure among traders, the price found immediate footing at the long-coming support trendline. This dynamic support has maintained an uptrend in this coin over the past three months, offering a dip opportunity to traders.</span></p>

<h2><b>XRP Price Daily Chart:</b></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower price rejection candles at the support trendline reflect increased demand pressure for the XRP price. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout above $0.487 resistance could kickstart a new recovery cycle </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $07.5 Million, indicating a 40% loss.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/SqDAAkJK.png" alt="XRP Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the XRP price trades at the $0.47 mark and wobbles in a narrow range created between the ascending trendline and the recently breached $0.487 support. The coin price has been wobbling in this range for the past three days and showcased uncertainty among traders with several short-bodied candles.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the market sentiment shows no improvement in the coming days, the XRP price is likely to prolong its consolation for a few more days. Thus, the aforementioned range can be marketed as a no-trading zone for newcomers.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering a bullish outlook, the breakout above the $0.487 resistance with daily candle closing will give additional confirmation for price reversal. Thus, a potential recovery initiated from the bottom trend could assist buyers to rechallenge the $0.55 mark, indicating a growth opportunity of 14%</span></p>
<h2><b>Will XRP Price Lose the $0.45 Mark?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For market buyers, the ascending trendline stands as a crucial support that sustains their bullish outlook. However, with the current negative sentiment, the possibility of trendline breakdown is not completely off the chart. Considering a pessimistic situation, a breakdown below the lower trendline will accelerate the selling pressure and can plunge the XRP price below $0.42</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Fibonacci Retracement level: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing correction in XRP price stayed above the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">FIB level</a> indicating the overall market trend is bullish.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upswing slope of the lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger band indicator</a> can offer significant support.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the regulatory cloud dissipating, CZ can now breathe a sigh of relief and focus on the future of Binance. In a </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1670076255633375236" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the crypto veteran stated that the mutually acceptable resolution will allow Binance move forward even though he highlighted that the SEC’s request for emergency relief was not necessary.</span></p>

<h2><b>Agreement Between Binance and US SEC</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a significant development, the US District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Amy Berman Jackson has approved the “Proposed Stipulation and Consent Order” agreed upon by Binance, Binance.US, and US SEC on Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-binance-us-reaches-deal-with-the-us-sec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consent order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed by Judge Jackson, Binance must “repatriate” all fiat currency and crypto assets related to Binance.US on or before the date the court issued the order.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the agreement </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-court-approves-binance-and-us-sec-agreement/?utm_source=cgtelegram"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stipulates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that only Binance.US employees will have access to customer funds on the US-based crypto exchange. This restriction aims to ensure that Binance.US maintains control over customer funds and can independently manage and safeguard them.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the agreement limits access for Binance Global officials, preventing them from accessing the private keys of all wallets, including both cold and hot wallets. </span></p>
<h2><b>Binance Looks Towards a Positive Direction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the difficulties and regulatory obstacles that Binance has encountered recently, CZ highlights that the firm is committed to continuing operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While expressing satisfaction over the resolved issue with the SEC, Binance CEO emphasized that users’ funds have been and will continue to be safe and secure on all Binance-affiliated services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the ordeal, Binance has consistently prioritized the safety and security of user funds. Binance has implemented robust security measures to safeguard user funds on all affiliated platforms. Recently, there have been indications from Binance that its BNB Chain is </span><a href="https://coingape.com/binances-bnb-chain-to-announce-layer-2-blockchain-solution/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the development and release of a Layer-2 blockchain solution.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dogecoin price witnessed a demand pressure near the $0.056 mark</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the $0.063 resistance could trigger a relief rally in the DOGE price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $187.9 Million, indicating a 0.97% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over a week, the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has remained flattish, trading in a narrow range below $0.632. This sideways action could be the disorder created due to the overall downtrend, the surge in buying pressure developed by discounted prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the DOGE price trades at $0.062 with an intraday loss of 0.03%. The neutral candle reflects the uncertainty continuing among traders, indicating this sideways action could extend longer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a retest to the lower trendline of the channel pattern usually triggers a significant upswing back to the upper trendline. This potential reversal will offer long entry opportunity to traders with a potential target of $0.95</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Dogecoin Price Poke $0.95?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the current consolidation phase, the Dogecoin price respects two technical levels which are $0.063 and the lower trendline of the channel pattern. Under the influence of the chart pattern, the coin price is likely to revert higher to reclaim lost ground. However, interested traders must wait for the breakout of $0.063 immediate resistance to obtain an entry opportunity. The potential recovery could face selling pressure at $0.075, followed by $0.083 and $0.095.</span></p>

<h2><b>Defined Support for DOGE and XRP</b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fans and members of the public who want to get the club’s jerseys and accessories can do so through BitPay which lends support for these digital currencies. Besides Dogecoin and XRP, other digital currencies hosted on BitPay are also featured with Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) also featuring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BitPay as one of the mainstream crypto payment platforms in the Web3.0 world is playing an important role in bridging the gap between mainstream firms and the digital currency ecosystem. As </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-spanish-airlines-partners-with-bitpay-to-accept-crypto-payments/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by CoinGape last year, BitPay helped Spanish Airlines to accept cryptocurrencies for tickets from customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The payment service provider has helped boost the interest of more firms through related partnerships in the past few years, and its efforts has helped transform memecoins like Dogecoin from a mere fun token to one with deep utility.</span></p>
<h2><b>Intersection of Sports and Crypto</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the London Lions basketball club partnership with BitPay is renowned, it cannot be tagged the first of such deals between a sports club and the crypto world.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">London Lions joining the list is evident that the perception about the nascent asset class as a key technological resource to boost blockchain adoption is not waning.

From the peak of $2138, the prices plunged to a low of $1627, registering a loss of 23.5%. However, this retracement backed by decreasing volume indicates the lack of commitment from sellers and a higher possibility of a bullish reversal. With a sufficient sign of demand pressure, the ETH price is likely to resume prior to recovery offering an excellent dip opportunity for traders. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Ethereum Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ascending support trendline governs the current long-term bullish trend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accumulation at crucial support trendline indicates upcoming recovery in ETH price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.8 Billion, indicating a 37.5% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/HPG4p2zX.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-tradingview</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the ETH price shows a long-tail hammer candle at the ascending trendline. This rejection candle shows active accumulation from buyers and a higher possibility of a bullish reversal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the whole correction phase stayed above the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> indicating this pullback health considering the overall uptrend. Previously, when the prices retested this dynamic support, the coin holders witnessed significant recovery, especially in the months of January and March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the anticipated bullish reversal could kickstart a new recovery cycle and may push the price above $2138.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested traders can enter at this dip with a close stop loss below the hammer wick at $1625. However, the safer traders can enter at the breakout of immediate resistance of $1775.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Can $ETH Price Revisit the $2000?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retest to the dynamic support trendline could replenish the bullish momentum in the ETH price and end the ongoing correction. The investors buying at this support can expect sustained growth above $2138 but will face in-between resistance at the $1775 and $2000 marks. On a contrary note, a breakdown below the support trendline will invalidate the bullish thesis and can plunge prices back to the $1400 mark.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish crossover between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) reflect the aggressive influence of sellers and therefore a need for a $1775 breakout to confirm a bullish reversal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The ETH price above 200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> projects long-term growth for ETH remains bullish.</span></li>

<p>Paul Grewal <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1669880095908184070" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> crypto exchange Coinbase can&#8217;t wait until the next week’s deadline to address the US SEC&#8217;s indecisive response to an earlier court order.</p>
<p>Grewal argues it is unusual for the government to disregard a direct inquiry in federal court. The court should rule now as the US SEC has decided not to grant Coinbase&#8217;s rulemaking petition. The US SEC avoiding the rulemaking petition is actively harming the industry amid the government agency&#8217;s escalating enforcement actions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, the SEC’s refusal to say how long it will take to act on Coinbase’s petition confirms the possibility of further delays. The court should order the SEC to report its action within 60 days. If the SEC has not acted by then, the court should rule quickly on the enforcement order.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase claims the petition was originally filed in the summer 2022 and the US SEC is knowingly evading answering to questions related to regulatory frameworks in the US and how the agency regulates the crypto market. The lack of clarity on crypto regulation in the US is impacting the crypto industry and investors.</p>
<p>SEC Chair <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gary-gensler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler</a> continues to believe that most crypto assets are securities. In addition, there&#8217;s still no clarity over whether SEC or CFTC has jurisdiction to regulate crypto.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US House Financial Services Committee has released a <a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-releases-stablecoin-bill-bring-clarity-giving-fed-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draft stablecoin bill</a> and aims to bring clarity over crypto regulation in the US in the coming weeks.

The news has fueled mixed reactions in the industry with experts sharing both positive and negative sentiments about the move.</span></p>
<h2><b>BlackRock Filing May Benefit Grayscale</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amid the broad based regulatory uncertainty in the digital currency ecosystem in the United States, many are projecting that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF product, if approved, will set a major precedent for the industry, a record that top market analyst Adam Cochran </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669731165161267201?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400">believes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> will be more beneficial to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the Blackrock ETF does get approved, the real winner here is going to be <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GBTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$GBTC</a></p>
<p>Because Blackrock will show the path to conversion, and GBTC&#39;s 40%+ discount will resolve on top of industry growth.</p>
<p>Imagine Barry is praying to every deity in every religion right now. <a href="https://t.co/IHfjiFbOuv">pic.twitter.com/IHfjiFbOuv</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669731165161267201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rationale is very obvious as Grayscale has made an attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust product to a full fledged spot Bitcoin ETF product, a proposal the SEC blatantly rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While in reality, the BlackRock filing is technically a Trust which will function like a Bitcoin ETF, its approval will set the tone for Grayscale to double down on its case as it dragged the markets regulator to court following the refusal of the GBTC conversion to Bitcoin ETF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stretching the context of the benefits, Adam noted that the approval for BlackRock’s filing “will show the path to conversion, and GBTC&#8217;s 40%+ discount will resolve on top of industry growth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While highlighting Grayscale as one of the prospective beneficiaries, the major hurdle experts have been debating is whether or not the US SEC will approve the application or not. Adam is convinced that BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-chair-supports-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-schedules-sec-oversight-hearings/"><span style="font-weight: 400">deep ties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> within the Democratic Party and as such, he may have the upper hand to get the market regulator to approve the product.</span></p>
<h2><b>Banking on BlackRock’s Records</b></h2>
