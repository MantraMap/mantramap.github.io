					<description><![CDATA[The conditions of the cryptocurrency market have changed drastically; according to an analysis by QCP Capital, the options market in its current state makes the crypto industry look like a major crisis, such as the shutdown of crypto exchange FTX after filing for bankruptcy, never happened. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach Highest Value Since FTX Crash, Bullish? Trading desk QCP Capital published observations on the crypto industry, revealing some key points to consider for the coming months. The Crypto Market Comes Back To Life QCP&#8217;s analysis points out that Bitcoin (BTC) risk reversals have been trading in positive territory over the past week, which tells us that calls (buys) have been more expensive than puts (sells) since 2021 across multiple tenors. This is unusual for the sector as BTC typically has a persistent put skew, mainly due to miner/treasury hedging activity. The chart below depicts this market behavior and the bullish sentiment impacting the options sector. Put skew drives the price of puts higher and calls lower. This difference in pricing between options is called skew and, under normal circumstances, puts trade with higher volatility than calls precisely because investors are hedging some of their bullish positions. For the trading desk, this means that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market has shifted from bearish to bullish, a culmination of what has been happening in the macro market and the slight recovery in the economy. Bulls Might Get Their Hearts Broken On Valentines Day Ethereum&#8217;s (ETH) implied volatility (IV), which represents the expected volatility of a stock or currency over the option&#8217;s life, has fallen, indicating complacency as the market prices out fears of a price collapse, according to the analysis. The enthusiasm in the market can be measured by the amount of &#8220;fear of missing out&#8221; (FOMO) that has set in, with many chasing prices and the top by buying high delta calls and going long in the spot market over the past week. With the upcoming &#8220;Big Bad&#8221; Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the trading desk expects the market to be more cautious and conservative. According to QCP, the following potentially problematic date will be February 14th, when the following CPI report will occur, which can potentially &#8220;break the heart of the bulls.&#8221; For QCP, this is the same scenario the market experienced in December. Similarly, the price may experience a topside breakout characterized by a highly sharp and violent movement. Bitcoin is currently trading at $23,200 and seems to be paving the way for the conquest of new levels. It has gained 0.7% in the last 24 hours and 10.3% in the last seven days.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin prices have been on the rise in the last couple of weeks and the digital asset has been able to return to its November 2022 levels. This has been a much-needed boost for the market during this time, but an unexpected investor group is reportedly driving the price of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Surges Are Happening During U.S. Hours In a new Matrixport report that was shared with NewsBTC via email, U.S. institutional investors are driving the recent price increase of bitcoin. The report notes that over the course of January, the digital asset is already up over 40% but more than 35% of those increases have happened during U.S. trading hours. As such, the research report concludes that U.S. investors are driving the price.

However, when it does well during Asian hours, then it means that Asian retail investors are buying it. BTC moves the most during U.S. trading hours &#124; Source: Matrixport The most significant movements have happened during this time and the trend lines show very strong similarity to Bitcoin’s movements to this point. But even more interesting is the fact that the data shows that U.S.-based investors are responsible for 85% of the total BTC buying that is happening currently. What Is Driving These U.S.-Based Investors? As the Matrixport report notes, U.S.-based investors have been encouraged by the inflation slow-down. It has put individual and institutional investors in positions where they believe they can take more risks. Hence, there is a marked increase in their exposure to risk assets such as bitcoin.

BTC is currently trading at $22,959 at the time of this writing. The coin is seeing small gains of 0.06% in the last 24 hours but on a seven-day rolling basis, the digital asset is still doing quite well with 9.45% gains.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin exchanges have registered the most significant outflows since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX back in November. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Turn Greedy For First Time Since March 2022 Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Shows Deep Negative Values As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, around 7,000 coins have left the exchange in this latest spike. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;all exchanges netflow,&#8221; which measures the net amount of Bitcoin exiting or entering into the wallets of all centralized exchanges. The metric&#8217;s value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows (the coins going in) and the outflows (the coins moving out). When the indicator has a positive value, the inflows overwhelm the outflows, and a net number of coins are deposited to exchanges. As one of the main reasons investors deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, negative values imply that a net amount of supply is currently being pulled off these platforms. Generally, holders withdraw their coins from exchanges to hold onto them for extended periods in personal wallets. Thus, such metric values can signal that investors are accumulating at the moment, which may have a bullish impact on the price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin all exchange&#8217;s netflow over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite negative recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange netflow recorded a deep negative spike during the past day. This outflow amounted to around 7,000 BTC, leaving the wallets of these platforms the largest value the metric has seen since the FTX crash back in November of last year. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the aftermath of FTX&#8217;s collapse saw some substantial outflow values. The reason behind that is that a known exchange like FTX going belly up instilled fear among investors and made them more aware of the risks of keeping their coins in centralized platforms. Naturally, these holders fled exchanges in masses (causing the netflow to plunge into red values) so that they could store their Bitcoin in offsite wallets, the keys they own. Interestingly, the latest negative netflow spike was recorded while Bitcoin has been observing a sharp rally. Usually, inflows are more commonly seen in periods like now, as investors rush to take some profits.

That would be only if these investors made the withdrawals with accumulation in mind. In the scenario that they transferred out these coins for selling through over-the-counter (OTC) deals instead, Bitcoin could instead feel a bearish impulse. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $23,100, up 8% in the last week.

The reason behind that is that a known exchange like FTX going belly up instilled fear among investors and made them more aware of the risks of keeping their coins in centralized platforms.</p>
<p>Naturally, these holders fled exchanges in masses (causing the netflow to plunge into red values) so that they could store their Bitcoin in offsite wallets, the keys they own.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the latest negative netflow spike was recorded while Bitcoin has been observing a sharp rally. Usually, inflows are more commonly seen in periods like now, as investors rush to take some profits.</p>

<p>Thus, instead of making these large outflows, investors are showing signs that they are bullish on Bitcoin in the long term and feel that the current rally has more to offer still.</p>
<p>That would be only if these investors made the withdrawals with <a href="https://newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/cardano-whales-start-2023-with-accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accumulation</a> in mind. In the scenario that they transferred out these coins for selling through over-the-counter (OTC) deals instead, Bitcoin could instead feel a bearish impulse.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $23,100, up 8% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amid the ubiquitous rally in the crypto market, multiple crypto assets including MATIC have climbed higher highs, thriving to reach their peak and beyond. While the catalyst behind the rally might be unclear, Polygon&#8217;s (MATIC) bullish trend could be a part of its upcoming zkEVM Network update. As the launch draws near, investors have continued to increase in numbers pouring more funds into the asset.  Polygon is a layer-2 scaling solution built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to improve the network’s scalability. The soon-to-be-launched zkEVM network update is just one of the plans the developers of the Polygon network have announced to enhance the layer-2 scaling solution.  According to Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal&#8217;s recent tweet, the anticipated zkEVM comes soon as the mainnet launch now has an official date which is somewhere around the corner. Related Reading: Polygon-Ethereum ERC-20 Bridge Is the Most Active, Locks $2.18 Billion Polygon (MATIC) Surges Nearly 10% In 24 hours Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has spiked in price by 8.6%, mirroring other altcoins&#8217; bullish trend as the global cryptocurrency market capitalization still holds steady above the previously amassed $1 trillion mark.  The past few weeks have seen a MATIC mark an upward rally movement, especially since the beginning of the year. MATIC has moved from the $0.75 price tag seen late last year to $1.09 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the 1-day chart still indicates more rallies as there is still liquidity at the higher highs to be taken. Notably, MATIC is ranked the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency asset by market capitalization, according to data aggregators CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap. Polygon currently has a market cap of $9.7 billion, higher than Solana with $8.8 billion but below Dogecoin, which sits at $11.8 billion. Though MATIC has been climbing highs since the beginning of the year, it is still far from its all-time high of $2.92, seen in 2021. With the ongoing disbelief in the crypto market among investors, it is still uncertain whether the zkEVM will be a good enough catalyst to drive its value beyond or closer to its peak. Related Reading: MATIC Price Prediction: Rallies 10%, Polygon Bulls Aim Big Polygon Network User Activity Plummets Despite MATIC&#8217;s appreciation in value, the network user activity has recorded a decline in the number of interactions. Polygon’s number of daily users started the year positively moving from roughly 404,000 seen on January 1 to 696,00 users on January 6. However, today, the figure has declined more than 10%, dropping to approximately 399,000, according to data from PolygonScan. The reason behind the plummet is still unclear, as the network activity is expected to increase, given the network’s recent collaborations with multiple top companies.  Last year, Facebook (Meta) added support for the Polygon network. In addition, the layer-2 scaling solution recently partnered with Mastercard to launch a Web3 accelerator program to bring budding musical artists into the spotlight by leveraging Web3 technology and other blockchain-based innovations.

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows investors in the Bitcoin market have turned greedy for the first time since March 2022, after what was the longest stretch of fear ever. Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Now Points At &#8220;Greed&#8221; The &#8220;fear and greed index&#8221; is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin (as well as the wider crypto) market. To represent this sentiment, the metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100. All values below 50 imply a fearful market, while those above this threshold suggest greedy holders. Although this cutoff point might look clean in theory, in practice, the region between values of 46 and 54 is generally considered to belong to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; sentiment. Real breakouts towards fear or greed only take place when the metric crosses below or above this transition region. There are also two other &#8220;special&#8221; sentiments: extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above values of 75, while the latter happens under values of 25. The significance of these extreme sentiments is that tops and bottoms have historically tended to form when the investors have held these mentalities. Because of this, some traders believe extreme fear periods provide ideal buying opportunities (as bottoms have taken place here), while times with extreme greed could be the best selling windows (since tops occur here). Related Reading: CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin PnL Index Forms Bullish Crossover A trading strategy called &#8220;contrarian investing&#8221; is based on a similar idea. As Warren Buffet said in his famous quote, &#8220;be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.&#8221; Now, here is how the current sentiment among Bitcoin (and wider crypto) investors looks like: A greedy cryptocurrency sector &#124; Source: Alternative As can be seen above, the Bitcoin fear and greed index has a value of 55 right now, suggesting that the market has now properly entered into the greed zone. Before this break into the region, the sector had been in the fear region nonstop since March 2022, around ten months ago.

Looks like the metric has observed some growth in recent days &#124; Source: Alternative From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator had spent almost the entire past year not just in the fear zone, but actually all the way down in the extreme fear region. There was only one proper spike into greed during this period, and that was the aforementioned March 2022 instance. This previous surge had only lasted for a single day before the market became fearful again. These continuous streaks of fear and extreme fear during the past year were both the longest runs in the history of the indicator. Greed finally returning to the Bitcoin market after all this while could mean that investors are ready to embrace some bullish action once again, which could be a positive sign for the current rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $22,900, up 9% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[Aave V3 is now live on the Ethereum mainnet. With this upgrade, WBTC, WETH, wstETH, USDC, DAI, LINK, and AAVE are the only supported assets.  Aave V3 Improves Capital Efficiency Stani Kulechov, the co-founder of Aave, said V3&#8217;s flexible design introduces new ways of mitigating risks, reducing gas costs, and improving capital efficiency, all while ensuring better liquidity decentralization. Aave Protocol V3 is now live on the Ethereum market 👻 ”The most exciting aspect of V3 is its flexible design, which enables a variety of new risk mitigation features, and its improved capital efficiency &#38; decentralized liquidity – all while reducing gas costs.” @StaniKulechov pic.twitter.com/QsSnnlhEMr &#8212; Aave (@AaveAave) January 27, 2023 This upgrade came after the Aave community delayed the upgrade. Then, Aave developers assessed that immediately improving V2 Pools to V3 would not have yielded the desired level of compatibility with other Aave V3 pools running on Avalanche, Polygon, and Ethereum layer-2 platforms. Related Reading: Aave Price Surges As V3 Cloud Upgrade Draws Near The current Aave V3 on Ethereum has been reworked. It is negligibly complex and more compatible with other Aave V3 pools outside of Ethereum. The transition to Ethereum, expanding Aave&#8217;s presence in top blockchains, didn&#8217;t immediately affect its total value locked (TVL). Data show that it is 2% lower in the past 24 hours. However, TVL is up 24% in the last month, rising to $4.56 billion as of the time of writing on January 27, according to data streams from DeFiLlama. Aave is now the fourth largest DeFi protocol by TVL, trailing Lido Finance, MakerDAO, and Curve. However, the dApp is the second-largest lending protocol by TVL, behind MakerDAO. By launching on Ethereum, and upgrading from the original V2, the protocol&#8217;s TVL might gradually increase over the coming weeks or months.  This, in turn, may positively impact AAVE prices. Aave is a decentralized money market, allowing crypto holders to actively lend and borrow various assets. Integrating V3 on Ethereum avails the protocol on six other platforms, including Avalanche, Polygon, and Harmony. Polygon is compatible with Ethereum&#8217;s virtual machine, existing as a layer-2 protocol enabling higher scalability and significantly lower trading fees. What Aave V3 Brings  Developers claim Aave V3 introduces various changes that, as the co-founder said, make lending and borrowing more seamless and cheaper.  According to the protocol, this version is optimized to reduce gas costs by around 20-25% across the board. Users can also move assets across all Aave markets, irrespective of the network. By launching on Ethereum, Harmony users, for example, would be free to transfer assets and participate in Aave V3 markets on the most active platform.  Related Reading: Aave Price Recovers Back To $57, But Threat Of New Attack Looms Over Protocol Aave V3 introduces the &#8220;Isolated Mode&#8221; where Aave governance can vote to list new tokens as isolated assets with specific debt ceilings. Aave clarifies that the debt ceiling is the maximum USD reading that a borrower&#8217;s collateral can cover. Only approved tokens, mostly stablecoins, can be borrowed in this mode.

<p>Aave is a decentralized money market, allowing crypto holders to actively lend and borrow various assets. Integrating V3 on Ethereum avails the protocol on six other platforms, including <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/avalanche-crumbles-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche</a>, Polygon, and Harmony. Polygon is compatible with Ethereum&#8217;s virtual machine, existing as a layer-2 protocol enabling higher scalability and significantly lower trading fees.</p>
<h2>What Aave V3 Brings </h2>
<p>Developers claim Aave V3 <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://docs.aave.com/faq/aave-v3-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">introduces</a> various changes that, as the co-founder said, make lending and borrowing more seamless and cheaper. </p>
<p>According to the protocol, this version is optimized to reduce gas costs by around 20-25% across the board. Users can also move assets across all Aave markets, irrespective of the network. By launching on Ethereum, Harmony users, for example, would be free to transfer assets and participate in Aave V3 markets on the most active platform. </p>

<p>Aave V3 introduces the &#8220;Isolated Mode&#8221; where Aave governance can vote to list new tokens as isolated assets with specific debt ceilings. Aave clarifies that the debt ceiling is the maximum USD reading that a borrower&#8217;s collateral can cover. Only approved tokens, mostly stablecoins, can be borrowed in this mode.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last year, NUCypher and KEEP Network merged and created the Threshold Network, a decentralized organization that addresses the myriad of privacy and security concerns in the blockchain space. Its utility and governance token, T, has been on the rise since the start of 2023 as the network produced more buzz. The coin is up 146% in the weekly, becoming the biggest gainer in the top 100 crypto list of CoinMarketCap today.  Related Reading: Polkadot Hints At Price Recovery – Can DOT Go Past 15% Weekly Ceiling? On-Chain, Off-Chain Developments List Threshold On January 26th, centralized exchange CoinBase announced the support for the Threshold token.

Image: Freepik A Quick Definition Of Threshold (T) The T token is a cryptocurrency that serves multiple purposes, including making payments, influencing the direction of the project through voting, and staking for interest and other incentives. It is one of the most significant Web3 initiatives because of the cross-chain element of the network and the privacy and access control features it employs. Threshold is not your normal cryptocurrency, as it does not want to make its users wealthy through trading and investment, nor does it strive to ensure that transactions are completed in the quickest possible time. Although it does not provide NFTs or a metaverse, it does come with a number of DeFi features. What Does This Mean For Threshold (T)? The token has reached new highs after the CoinBase listing announcement. Threshold is currently trying to break above $0.064 which it has been unsuccessful in doing so. Threshold is supported at $0.042, the same support level that has not eased the May to June crypto market crash levels.  If the token suffers a correction phase, T might revert back $0.033 support which could possibly blunt a bearish market movement.

Meanwhile, as this scenario might play out, Bitcoin is attempting to breach the $23k resistance.  If BTC breaches through this resistance, Threshold can rely on its somewhat high correlation with the king crypto to boost gains. -Featured image by Aviationist]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin, the original memecoin of the crypto industry, has not seen a monumental rise in price unlike other altcoins of late. According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE has only risen 5.56% in the past week with its biggest gains seen in the monthly time frame.  At its current market cap of $11.3 billion, the token is surpassed by other altcoins in terms of growth. However, DOGE still remains a dominant force in the world of memecoins as it has been for a long time.  Related Reading: Polkadot Hints At Price Recovery – Can DOT Go Past 15% Weekly Ceiling? DOGE Compared To Other Memecoins Compared to its peers, Dogecoin is still a popular choice for investors in the crypto industry. In terms of market cap, the token dominates SHIB by a wider margin. Even with Shiba Inu disrupting DOGE’s dominance, it still has a long way to go for SHIB to be level with DOGE.  However, Shiba Inu has been distancing itself from its memecoin past. With Shibarium around the corner, we might see SHIB gain more dominance in space. Since last year, Dogecoin has been silent in the development space with the only spike in activity being the October 2022 upgrade of the token’s wallet.  But external developments still favor DOGE. According to recent news about Tesla’s financials, the company has not bought or sold Bitcoin for two consecutive quarters. Despite this, the company still only accepts DOGE for crypto payments. This gives DOGE some real life utility as a form of payment. However, with the electric vehicle industry facing a tougher time right now, we might see DOGE perform poorly compared to other memecoins, or altcoins in that matter, in the foreseeable future.  Sideways Movement Continues For DOGE As the time of writing, the price movement of DOGE has stagnated and started to oscillate above and below $0.08. Analysts are bullish about the coin’s short to medium term growth with the target set at $0.118.  $DOGE in case we get a breakout of the current handle, this Cup &#38; Handle pattern is what I look for.

					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price could be facing a make-or-break moment in the coming weeks. While the launch of Shibarium is imminent according to the chief developer, the success of the layer-2 blockchain and the emerging ecosystem could determine how the SHIB price will perform. Despite the 43% year-to-date (YTD) price increase, SHIB is still in bearish territory. Ultimately, SHIB needs another boost, whether from a macro perspective or from the successful launch of Shibarium, to return to the bullish ground. The 1-day chart reveals that SHIB is still writing low highs on a daily basis since August last year. However, the year-to-date rally could be the start of a major move to the upside. For now, SHIB has seen a retest of the support zone at $0.000011, but could now push ahead with its rise. If not, there could be more downsides for SHIB. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Declines 6%, Gets Flipped By Litecoin In Market Cap Again At the moment, SHIB is seeing support from the 200-day EMA at $0.00001125. If the price manages to stay above this level, the first target could be the January 18 high of $0.00001292, in order to write a new local high. After that, there would be a possibility of SHIB making a new attempt to break the high of $0.00001519 from October 29. Achieving success could mean a return to the bullish territory. However, the final, biggest hurdle, for now, will be the resistance zone between $0.00001691 and $0.00001799. Shibarium And Whales In The Spotlight For Shiba Inu A look at the fundamentals also reveals a make-or-break moment. With the much-hyped launch of Shibarium, it remains to be seen whether Shiba Inu can grow beyond its meme coin status. The project is a layer 2 solution for the Ethereum-based network and aims to lay the foundation for building a powerful ecosystem that hosts a metaverse, a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain-based games, and NFTs. The decentralized exchange Shiba SwapDEX launched back in July 2021 and reached a TVL of $1.66 billion at the time, but is down to $30 million. Shibarium could give new life to the exchange. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Up 4% As Lead Dev Teases Exact Beta Launch Date In general, however, Shiba Inu will have to prove itself if its move away from a pure meme narrative is to be successful. If the fundamentals are right, the price will follow. If Shibarium is a disappointment, the SHIB price could see further downside. Meanwhile, the popularity of SHIB among Ethereum whales points to a bullish sentiment. A SHIB community member shared data from WhaleStats, according to which SHIB is the top-held non-stablecoin by Ethereum whales. SHIB accounts for 15.76%, only outpaced by USDT (19.52%). Hey #SHIBARMY did you know that SHIB 🐶 is the top-held nonstable coin by ETH whales?Something to think about. 🤑 pic.twitter.com/uKFrjkj2RU &#8212; Shib Dream * Shiba Inu News * Shib Army Social 💎 (@theshibdream) January 26, 2023 Meanwhile, Coinbase director Conor Grogan recently revealed that popular online broker Robinhood holds Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens worth $266 million. In total, Robinhood holds $3.37 billion worth of assets on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. These break down as follows: $2.99 billion ETH (88%), $266 million SHIB (8%), and $54 million MATIC (1.6%). At press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00001152.

For now, SHIB has seen a retest of the support zone at $0.000011, but could now push ahead with its rise. If not, there could be more downsides for SHIB.</p>

<p>At the moment, SHIB is seeing support from the 200-day EMA at $0.00001125. If the price manages to stay above this level, the first target could be the January 18 high of $0.00001292, in order to write a new local high.</p>
<p>After that, there would be a possibility of SHIB making a new attempt to break the high of $0.00001519 from October 29. Achieving success could mean a return to the bullish territory. However, the final, biggest hurdle, for now, will be the resistance zone between $0.00001691 and $0.00001799.</p>

<h2>Shibarium And Whales In The Spotlight For Shiba Inu</h2>
<p>A look at the fundamentals also reveals a make-or-break moment. With the much-hyped launch of Shibarium, it remains to be seen whether Shiba Inu can grow beyond its meme coin status.</p>
<p>The project is a layer 2 solution for the Ethereum-based network and aims to lay the foundation for building a powerful ecosystem that hosts a metaverse, a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain-based games, and NFTs.</p>
<p>The decentralized exchange Shiba SwapDEX launched back in July 2021 and reached a TVL of $1.66 billion at the time, but is down to $30 million. Shibarium could give new life to the exchange.</p>

<p>In general, however, Shiba Inu will have to prove itself if its move away from a pure meme narrative is to be successful. If the fundamentals are right, the price will follow. If Shibarium is a disappointment, the SHIB price could see further downside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the popularity of SHIB among Ethereum whales points to a bullish sentiment. A SHIB community member shared data from WhaleStats, according to which SHIB is the top-held non-stablecoin by Ethereum whales. SHIB accounts for 15.76%, only outpaced by USDT (19.52%).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase director Conor Grogan recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1618807649231077376" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that popular online broker Robinhood holds Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens worth $266 million.</p>
<p>In total, Robinhood holds $3.37 billion worth of assets on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. These break down as follows: $2.99 billion ETH (88%), $266 million SHIB (8%), and $54 million MATIC (1.6%).</p>
<p>At press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00001152.</p>
