<p>According to a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1659289748341653510">report</a> by Messari, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) experienced significant growth during the first quarter of 2023. Key indicators highlighted a surge in activity, with a 13.9% increase in daily active addresses and a 10.7% rise in daily transactions.<br /><br />The most notable development was the impressive 55.5% price increase of XRP, surging from $0.35 to $0.54. This boost was largely influenced by positive news from the ongoing legal case between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).<br /><br />The Q1 report also emphasized the evolution of the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrpl-nft-marketplace-reports-record-breaking-traffic-shortly-after-launch-of-xls-20-that-brings-native-nft-support/"> XRPL</a> ecosystem. The introduction of the XLS-20 standard facilitated NFT transactions, with five new transaction types established and five more proposed. Despite a slight decrease in NFT activity compared to the previous quarter, Q1 still saw 436,000 NFT mints and 277,000 accepted NFT offers. Additionally, the Coreum and Flare Network sidechains, focusing on interoperability and decentralized data, successfully reached their mainnet.<br /><br />XRP&#8217;s financial performance surpassed the overall increase in the total crypto market cap. XRP&#8217;s market cap rose by an impressive 59.9%, from $17.4 billion to $27.8 billion. A positive development in the SEC case against Ripple acted as a significant catalyst, leading to two substantial price surges in March. The transaction fees on the XRPL, which are burned, created deflationary pressure on the total supply of XRP, offsetting the inflation rate and contributing to the price increase.<br /><br />Looking ahead, XRPL developers are focused on NFTs, the metaverse, and smart contracts. The report outlined plans for Futureverse&#8217;s Root Network, Hooks, and an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain. If successfully implemented, these advancements will add a layer of functionality to the XRPL ecosystem, which already offers features such as fast, energy-efficient cross-currency and cross-border payments.</p>

<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-commodity-status-of-bitcoin-and-ether-says-xrp-is-uncertain/">CFTC</a>) has no power to regulate cash crypto markets, admits chairman. According to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Rostin Benham, his agency lacks the legal authority to regulate cash crypto markets. <br /><br />In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-18/transcript-cftc-chair-rostin-behnam-on-the-fight-to-regulate-crypto">interview</a>, Benham clarified that the CFTC&#8217;s jurisdiction is limited to addressing fraud and manipulation in cash markets.<br /><br />However, he emphasized that the CFTC will still regulate the crypto sector through other means to protect investors. Benham considers many cryptocurrency tokens as commodity financial assets, allowing the application of regulations, notices, advisories, and enforcement actions. <br /><br />This aligns with his previous statements in March, where he classified assets like Ethereum and stablecoins as commodities. <br /><br />Despite the unique challenges presented by cryptocurrencies, Benham believes that existing policy approaches can be adapted to address them.<br /><br />It is noteworthy that the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are the two main government agencies responsible for regulating the cryptocurrency space.<br /><br />While SEC chair Gary Gensler believes the CFTC should regulate certain assets without overriding the SEC&#8217;s authority, Benham contends that the CFTC should oversee assets that are not considered securities.</p>

<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W4fSOEFfkM&amp;ab_channel=CNBCInternationalTV">discussed</a> the company&#8217;s hiring strategy in a CNBC International interview, revealing a shift towards focusing on international recruitment. Garlinghouse attributed this decision to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulations in the United States. <br /><br />This ambiguity has prompted entrepreneurs and investors to explore more accommodating jurisdictions, with Europe emerging as a significant beneficiary due to its well-defined and robust regulatory framework for digital assets.<br /><br />Garlinghouse emphasized the impact of regulatory confusion in the United States on <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ripple-teams-up-with-central-bank-of-montenegro-for-cbdc-stablecoin-initiatives/">Ripple</a>&#8216;s operations, explaining that the company has been compelled to allocate a significant portion of its resources outside of the country. He stated,<em> &#8220;95 percent of our customers are non-U.S., and this year most of our hiring will be non-U.S. for some of those exact same reasons.&#8221;</em> Ripple&#8217;s expansion in Europe is partially driven by the favorable regulatory environment offered by the continent.<br /><br />Looking ahead to the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in light of the FTX case, Garlinghouse highlighted nations such as the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Europe for their clear rules and roadmaps. He believes that this clarity enables entrepreneurs and investors to engage more effectively with regulators. The recent acquisition of Swiss-based firm Medico by Ripple was partly influenced by the regulatory clarity found in Switzerland. Garlinghouse stressed the importance of differentiating between issues specific to cryptocurrencies and broader problems like fraud.<br /><br />To illustrate this point, he referred to the FTX case as a fraud issue rather than one specific to cryptocurrencies. He emphasized that fraud can occur in various asset classes and is not limited to the crypto industry. Garlinghouse suggested that the United States could learn from Europe and other countries that provide clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets.</p>

<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/update-on-wrx-token-management/">WazirX</a>, India&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency exchange, made a startling revelation that Binance, the global crypto giant, conducted the initial exchange offering (IEO) for its WRX token and currently maintains control over the token supply.<br /><br />In a statement released on May 16, the WazirX team clarified that Binance had kept all the proceeds, totaling around $2 million, from the IEO for itself. Notably, the WazirX team emphasized that they had not received any token allocations.<br /><br />According to WazirX,<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-shifts-voyager-ftx-tokens-to-innovation-zone-amid-bankruptcy/"> Binance</a> holds control over all wallets containing locked and unlocked WRX tokens. It further revealed that Binance currently holds 580.7 million units of locked and unlocked WRX tokens, equivalent to approximately $74.5 million based on the token&#8217;s current price. Binance has conducted its quarterly burns for the WRX token and held the unlocked tokens in its account.<br /><br />In a series of transactions between April 2021 and March 2022, Binance moved 116.8 million unlocked WRX tokens to its treasury. However, WazirX pointed out that Binance has failed to conduct any of the scheduled quarterly burns for WRX since January 2022. WazirX emphasized that Binance bears the responsibility for executing the quarterly burn of WRX tokens.<br /><br />The relationship between Binance and WazirX has been marred by an ongoing dispute over the ownership structure of the Indian exchange. While WazirX claims to be owned by Binance, the CZ-led firm argues that it merely provides wallet services and technical support to the Indian exchange.<br /><br />This recent disclosure adds another layer of complexity to an already tense relationship. In February, the feud escalated to the point where Binance terminated its partnership with WazirX, instructing the Indian exchange to withdraw its assets from the platform.<br /><br />Amidst these developments, the WRX token has experienced a decline of over 7.1% in the past seven days, currently trading at $0.124. As the situation unfolds, questions regarding the control and management of the WRX token persist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to research conducted by GWI, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/turkeys-central-bank-to-continue-trials-for-digital-lira-in-2023/">Turkey</a> experienced the highest growth in crypto ownership, with a significant surge of 27.1% from July-September 2021 to July–September 2022. Following closely, Argentina and the Philippines secured the second and third spots, respectively, with an impressive increase in their crypto ownership rates of 23.5% and 23.4%, as per GWI research<a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1658874634702319616?s=20"> data.</a><br /><br />The study focuses on individuals aged 16 to 64 and examines their ownership of any form of cryptocurrency. A chart showcasing the top 15 countries with the highest surges in crypto ownership, along with the global average of an 11.9% increase, is provided below.<br /><br />While Turkey claims the top position in the chart, it&#8217;s worth noting that the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and Portugal also witnessed remarkable growth rates. Though the data doesn&#8217;t explicitly state the reasons behind the surge in crypto ownership, the top three countries share a common factor: rampant inflation.<br /><br />In late 2021, the Turkish lira experienced a rapid depreciation of 44% against the US dollar. Additionally, the country&#8217;s inflation rate exceeded 30% in early 2022 and closed the year at a staggering 72.31%. These economic circumstances prompted many Turks to turn to cryptocurrencies, leading to a significant surge in daily trading volume, which averaged around $1.8 billion.<br /><br />Similarly, Argentina faced an alarming inflation rate of 94.8% in 2022, the highest percentage observed since 1991. The devaluation of the Argentine peso likely contributed to citizens embracing cryptocurrencies, much like their counterparts in Turkey. Notably, the adoption of crypto in Argentina became evident when a <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-might-be-accepted-as-payment-option-for-government-services-in-liechtenstein-pm/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> wallet became the number-one application in the country within a week of its launch.<br /><br />The situation in the Philippines mirrors the trends observed in Turkey and Argentina. The country witnessed a notable increase in inflation, with a rate of 8.1% recorded in December 2022, marking a significant 107% surge from the 3.9% registered in 2021. This rise in inflation is also reflected in the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies among the Filipino population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/g7-considers-facebook-libra-as-risks-to-financial-stability-demand/">G7 committee</a> recently gathered in Niigata, Japan, to discuss the potential of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in shaping a global financial system. The meeting brought together leading economies ahead of the annual G7 summit, with a focus on finding ways to enhance payment efficiency while safeguarding the stability and integrity of the monetary systems.<br /><br />Transparency, reliability, and stability for global payments were key priorities for the committee, which sees <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/visa-chief-predicts-meaningful-role-for-stablecoins-and-cbdcs/">CBDCs</a> as a promising avenue to achieve these goals. While CBDCs differ from decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the committee emphasizes the importance of upholding fundamental principles such as compliance with legal requirements, economic governance practices, cybersecurity, and data protection.<br /><br />As the traditional banking system faces challenges and the fiat monetary system teeters on the edge, central banks have resorted to propping it up at the expense of citizens&#8217; purchasing power. The committee recognizes that imposing a CBDC can extend the life of the fiat system, but concerns arise regarding potential control over individuals&#8217; spending and financial freedom.<br /><br />Critics argue that the introduction of a CBDC could grant central banks unprecedented power to monitor and restrict transactions, limiting options like investing in cryptocurrencies. Preserving privacy and financial freedom becomes a significant concern, considering governments&#8217; past actions to freeze accounts and blacklist Bitcoin wallets. With CBDCs, the potential for enhanced financial surveillance raises questions about the balance between innovation and individual autonomy.<br /><br />While history reveals a pattern of increasing control during the decline of world empires, the hope remains that determined independent thinkers will continue to strive for freedom in the face of these challenges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Crypto hardware wallet provider <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-ledger-now-has-native-support-for-nfts/">Ledger</a> is facing severe backlash from its online user base following the release of a controversial update that has raised concerns about significant security flaws. Despite Ledger&#8217;s claims that the new functionality is safe and optional, security experts and cryptocurrency holders are expressing their dissatisfaction and distancing themselves from the company.<br /><br />The discontent began to escalate when a Reddit user named Joe_Smith_Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13itm7u/comment/jkbyyfp/">posted</a> a question demanding a clear answer on whether Ledger has a built-in backdoor for accessing users&#8217; private keys.<br /><br />Private keys are crucial alphanumeric strings that allow users to access their cryptocurrencies on the blockchain. The specific inquiry revolved around Ledger&#8217;s recently introduced &#8220;Ledger Recover&#8221; service, designed for Nano X device owners to <a href="https://www.ledger.com/recover">recover</a> their crypto assets even if they lose both their wallet device and recovery phrase. The recovery phrase represents a user&#8217;s private key in mnemonic form.<br /><br />According to Ledger, the service enabled through firmware update 2.2.1, duplicates the recovery phrase on the device, encrypts the copy, fragments it into three parts, and secures it with Ledger, Coincover, and another unnamed provider. To utilize the service, users must verify their identity using an ID document and a selfie recording.<br /><br />Attempting to address the growing concerns, Ledger took to Twitter to emphasize that the service is completely optional and not automatically enabled through any firmware update. They added that users&#8217; secret recovery phrases are securely generated on their own devices, with no access granted to Ledger.<br /><br />Despite these assurances from Ledger, the community&#8217;s worries persist around one central issue: the update appears to expose that Ledger devices do not provide absolute protection of users&#8217; private keys against external access, contrary to the company&#8217;s claims. Reddit user StPinkie expressed disappointment, stating that trust in the proprietary secure element, which was a cornerstone of the company, has been shattered. <br /><br />They announced that they can no longer recommend Ledger to anyone concerned about maintaining their digital sovereignty.<br /><br />Notable crypto developer, writer, and auditor &#8220;foobar&#8221; echoed this sentiment on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1658458714771169282">Twitter</a>, urging followers to immediately transition away from Ledger wallets. They <a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1658478186408337408">highlighted</a> the update&#8217;s glaring problem of potentially exposing private keys to risk through malicious or accidental firmware updates.<br /><br />Users also pointed out a contradiction between Ledger&#8217;s website claims that users&#8217; keys &#8220;never leave the device&#8221; and the Ledger Recover service, which distributes users&#8217; private keys to three different providers in shards, as explained by CEO Pascal Gauthier.<br /><br />Within the community, many suggested that Ledger introduce a separate wallet dedicated to offering a seed-recovery service rather than rolling it out as a firmware update for existing customers who expected the highest level of security from their devices.<br /><br />It is worth noting tha<a href="https://www.ledger.com/message-ledgers-ceo-data-leak">t Ledger</a> has experienced previous security compromises, including when the personal information of over 270,000 customers was accidentally leaked in July 2020. However, this incident did not impact the security of users&#8217; private keys.<br /><br />Ledger saw a surge in sales following the collapse of FTX in November, as investors sought to secure their cryptocurrencies independently, avoiding reliance on centralized intermediaries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a strong commitment to Bitcoin adoption, business intelligence firm <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/microstrategy-turns-profitable-in-q1-after-betting-big-on-bitcoin/">MicroStrategy</a> is intensifying its efforts to incorporate layer 2 scaling solutions, particularly the Lightning Network, this year. Executive chairman Michael Saylor recently provided an <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1657807531664605185">update</a>, revealing that the company is developing a product to offer a Bitcoin wallet and Lightning address to every corporate account holder.<br /><br />The primary objective behind this initiative is to facilitate the swift and seamless development and deployment of Bitcoin rewards applications for employees, customers, prospects, and partners. The Lightning Network serves as a layer-2 payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling off-chain transactions, increasing payment throughput, and reducing transaction fees.<br /><br /><a href="https://valkyrieinvest.com/daily-market-brief/the-valkyrie-market-brief-02-06-23/">Reports</a> indicate that the adoption of the Lightning Network is gaining momentum, particularly in emerging markets like South America and Africa. This can be attributed, in part, to the efforts of the Bitcoin payment company and wallet provider Strike.<br /><br />Back in December, Saylor shared MicroStrategy&#8217;s exploration of software and solutions that leverage the Lightning Network. These included solutions supporting enterprise marketing and a cybersecurity solution tailored for corporate websites. In April, the 58-year-old billionaire also announced the integration of Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network into his corporate email address. This allows anyone to send BTC to Saylor using his company email address as an identifier.<br /><br />Aside from its focus on the Lightning Network, MicroStrategy has consistently expanded its Bitcoin holdings, making it the largest corporate holder of the flagship cryptocurrency. According to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy currently owns 140,000 BTC, accumulating more portions of the asset throughout all 11 previous quarters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Reports have emerged stating that South Korean prosecutors have <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/05/15/national/politics/korea-upbit-bithumb/20230515201129323.html">conducted raids</a> on the offices of the country&#8217;s two leading cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/upbit-crypto-exchange-announces-49-million-worth-of-ether-was-stolen/">Upbit</a> and Bithumb. The raids are part of an ongoing investigation involving Kim Nam-kuk, a politician who faced public scrutiny over allegations of acquiring 800,000 Wemix tokens without adhering to the necessary regulations. The authorities suspect that the platforms may have somehow been involved in the transfer of the coins from Bithumb to Upbit last year.<br /><br />To unravel the case involving Kim Nam-kuk, local media outlets reported that Korean authorities searched the headquarters of Upbit and Bithumb in Seoul. Recently, the Democratic Party (DP) urged Nam-kuk to sell his 800,000 Wemix coins amid accusations of potentially using insider information to accumulate them a few years ago. It is alleged that Nam-kuk withdrew the assets at the beginning of 2022, several months before the enforcement of legislation requiring cryptocurrency entities to report personal information for transfers exceeding $758. Notably, Nam-kuk was part of the team that proposed a delay in the income taxation on digital assets in South Korea. He has now stated his intention to sell the holdings, which are currently valued at approximately $660,000, in compliance with the DP&#8217;s recommendation.<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1658069446802702336">Wu Blockchain</a> argued that Nam-kuk&#8217;s transfer of 800,000 Wemix coins from Bithumb to Upbit in 2022 may have sparked the investigation against the exchanges. Upbit deemed the transaction &#8220;improper&#8221; and reported it to the government at that time. In January, Korean prosecutors raided Bithumb&#8217;s offices following rumors of price manipulation of an undisclosed coin listed on the platform. The authorities clarified that the raid aimed to secure transaction details for a specific coin and had no direct connection to Bithumb itself.<br /><br />The recent inspection comes shortly after prosecutors sought an arrest warrant for Kang Jong-Hyun, the owner of<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/south-korean-financial-regulator-intends-to-close-11-crypto-exchange-companies/"> Bithumb</a>, on charges of embezzlement and market manipulation. Jong-Hyun&#8217;s sister also encountered legal issues, as the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office claimed she artificially inflated the share price of certain firms through the issuance of convertible bonds.<br /><br />Despite being one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, Bithumb has faced various controversies over the years. In December 2022, Park Mo, the largest shareholder of Bithumb Holdings Co., was found dead in front of his house in southern Seoul. Although initial investigations suggested suicide and found no signs of violence, the crypto community raised doubts. Mo was closely associated with Jong-Hyun and his sister and had supposedly discussed the potential purchase of his organization by the now-bankrupt FTX.</p>

<p>Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Gods Unchained, Ethermon, and Pegaxy are just a few of the varied games.</p>
<h3>6. Forks and Airdrops</h3>
<p>An existing coin forks when it diverges into a new chain. New coins are manufactured and &#8220;dropped&#8221; onto users as a form of reward in an airdrop.</p>
<p>Users have no control over whether or when these occurrences might happen. But, your chances improve if you participate in the crypto economy.</p>
<h3>7. Airdrops</h3>
<p>Before an Initial Coin Offering, crypto projects would use airdrops as a marketing strategy to increase their circulation and popularity (ICO). This entails giving away free copies of the project&#8217;s native token to potential users. As a result, the pass receives more notice and circulates more widely before going on sale.</p>
<p>Airdrops come in a variety of forms. Some provide you tokens only for connecting your wallet, while others make you perform easy requirements like like the project&#8217;s social media page. Even though airdrops are unpredictable or rarely offer big profits, they can be a fun way to diversify your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<h3>9. Create an account on YouTube</h3>
<p>A YouTube channel can still be started. A startling 74% of people in the US use YouTube. A huge audience like that may be attracted for passive income. The issue? It requires a lot of work at first with little to no payoff.</p>
<p>Yet, if you have a long-term outlook and are content with front-loading your effort, a popular YouTube channel has huge potential for passive income. Ads, affiliate sales, sponsorships, branded integrations, and other passive income streams can all add up as you increase your audience, content, clicks, and views.</p>
<h3>10. Learn to Earn</h3>
<p>Some platforms reward users with cryptocurrency for using the learning center. It compensates users for their knowledge of the platform by encouraging them to watch videos and complete quizzes. Users receive these coins at the end of the course, and the content is often centered around a specific altcoin. Users can exchange these tokens for other tokens on the site, sell them for cash, or use the proceeds to buy tokens for another potential project, as some of them may not be suitable for long-term investment.</p>
