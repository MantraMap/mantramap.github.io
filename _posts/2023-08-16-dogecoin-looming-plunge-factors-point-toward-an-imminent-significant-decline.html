Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently witnessed a gradual decline in both its price and Open Interest over the past three days. These developments have raised concerns of a bearish sentiment in the futures market. In a trend that has been unfolding over the last three days, Dogecoin&#8217;s price has experienced a steady descent, accompanied by a decrease in Open Interest. Open Interest refers to the total number of active contracts in the futures market. Its decline is often indicative of waning enthusiasm among traders and investors, suggesting a prevailing bearish sentiment.

As of the most recent data from CoinGecko, the current DOGE price is $0.070578. In the last 24 hours alone, the meme coin suffered a 5.0% drop, while its seven-day performance showed a decline of nearly 5%. The downward trajectory intensified as the market structure of DOGE slipped below the $0.075 mark earlier in the week. The price report noted that amidst the prevailing bearish sentiment, the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator exhibited an opposing trend. Over the past week, the OBV steadily climbed, suggesting an increase in buying pressure. DOGE market cap at $9.8 billion today.
