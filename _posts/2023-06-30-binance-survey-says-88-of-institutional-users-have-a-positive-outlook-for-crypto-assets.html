Institutional investors are paying more attention to cryptocurrencies and digital assets. According to a recent survey report by Binance Research and Binance VIP &#38; Institutional, 88% of institutional users have a long-term, optimistic outlook on crypto for the next decade. The crypto market is known for its high volatility, but the majority of big-money players see crypto as an important part of their portfolio for years to come. Institutional Interest In Crypto Assets Is Growing The Institutional Crypto Outlook Survey, which surveyed 208 Binance VIP and Institutional users from 31st March to 15th May 2023, found out that a growing number of institutional crypto investors are in it for the long haul. According to the survey, 63.5% of these users had a positive outlook on digital assets over the next 12 months, while 88% are more positive over the next decade.

Bitcoin remains Most Popular Crypto Asset Among Institutions Bitcoin remains the most popular choice among institutional investors, with a larger proportion of respondents more positive about Bitcoin as compared to the broader crypto sector. This is not surprising given that Bitcoin is the largest crypto by market cap and the most established. Bitcoin is seen as the &#8220;digital gold&#8221; of the crypto world and a store of value and hedge against inflation.

Institutional Trade Still Mostly Done On Centralized Exchanges Centralized exchanges remain the most popular platform for institutional trading. While many crypto investors advocate for decentralized exchanges on the rise, centralized exchanges like Binance offer a one-stop shop for institutional traders to easily buy, sell and convert a wide range of cryptocurrencies. The survey found that 90.5% of institutional investors would rather trade on centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Whales Dive Into XRP, Accumulating $170 Million Worth: Whatâ€™s Their Game Plan?
