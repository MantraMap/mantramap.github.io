<p>Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has come under fire from the PepeCoin meme coin community after an email to its customers described the popular meme as a "hate symbol" associated with alt-right groups. This has led to outrage and calls for an apology, as well as users deleting their Coinbase accounts and switching to other exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ape Brigade (APES) is all set to launch its brand new DeFi meme coin, which has gained attention for its unique features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase Lashes Out at PEPE</p>
<p>Coinbase is facing backlash from the PepeCoin community after an email was sent to customers describing the meme as a "hate symbol" co-opted by alt-right groups. The email cited a 2016 decision by the Anti-Defamation League to place PEPE in its database of online hate symbols. Fans and holders of the meme coin were outraged, calling for an apology and even deleting their Coinbase accounts. The hashtag #deletecoinbase has been trending on Twitter with more than 14,000 tweets in the last two hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, Coinbase has not indicated whether it intends to list the PEPE token on its exchange. On the other hand, Gemini CEO Cameron Winkelvoss listened to the call, and the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange listed the meme coin for trading on May 9 with a more open-ended description of the token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PEPE's price fell 2.6% in the hours following news of Coinbase's description, and it is currently trading for $0.00000184, down 10.4% in the last 24 hours. Since Binance listed the token for trading on May 5, Pepe-holding members of Crypto Twitter have been asking leaders from various cryptocurrency exchanges to list the token.</p>
<p>Ape Brigade All Set to Launch!</p>
<p>Ape Brigade (APES), a new DeFi meme coin, is poised to enter the market with a range of innovative offerings. Despite being a new player, APES has already announced several unique features that make it stand out from the competition. For instance, the coin will lock 20% of its supply in a liquidity pool, ensuring that holders benefit when demand for the token increases.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>APES is also a technologically advanced ERC-20 token with an NFT Space in development. However, the most exciting feature is the incentivized staking system, which rewards APES stakers based on the amount and duration of their stake. All you need to do is patiently stake as many APES, and you have a chance to win rewards!</p>
<p>Ape Brigade's initiative to support and raise awareness about rescue efforts for wild animals, particularly apes, is perhaps its most compelling feature. A significant 10% of the total supply will go to charitable organizations that rescue apes and wildlife. All the unique offerings the project has in store for its community and the crypto industry as a whole is a clear indication that APES is a meme coin not to be taken lightly.</p>
