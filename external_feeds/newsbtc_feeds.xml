					<description><![CDATA[In a recent note that has caught the attention of both traditional financial markets and the Bitcoin community, Goldman Sachs economists, including the renowned Jan Hatzius and David Mericle, have made a significant prediction regarding the Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary policy. The note suggests that the Federal Reserve may commence a series of interest rate cuts by the end of June 2024. “The cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target,” the Goldman economists wrote. This statement underscores the bank&#8217;s belief that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current stance on interest rates may be too restrictive, especially if inflation rates continue to trend towards the central bank&#8217;s target. The note further elaborates: “Normalization is not a particularly urgent motivation for cutting, and for that reason we also see a significant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady.” This cautious tone suggests that while Goldman Sachs is predicting a rate cut, they also acknowledge the unpredictability of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decisions. Related Reading: US Bitcoin ETF Approval Could See North America’s ETF Volume Rise To 99.5% The recent data, which showed US inflation rising at a slower-than-expected rate of 3.2%, with the core consumer price index at a 4.7% annual pace, further complicates the picture. With the Fed&#8217;s benchmark rate currently set between 5.25% to 5.5%, Goldman Sachs expects it to stabilize around 3 to 3.25%. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? Expectations of a rate cut from Goldman Sachs are in line with market expectations according to the CME FedWatch Tool. In May 2024, 68% already expect there to be at least a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut. However, it remains to be seen whether macro events will influence the Bitcoin price again. In the last few months, BTC increasingly decoupled from macro events while the stock market rallied towards all-time highs and stagnated around the $30,000 mark.

The high expectations for these two events, coupled with a dovish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, could be a massive catalyst for the Bitcoin price.

					<description><![CDATA[The dynamic and ever-evolving blockchain community has shown a great deal of interest in and enthusiasm for Toncoin (TON). Due to its technological underpinnings and innovative answers to the long-standing problems that have plagued the field of decentralized finance, this digital money has risen to popularity very quickly. At the time of writing, TON was trading at $1.46, registering an impressive 10.4% increase in the last 24 hours. Equally impressive is the crypto&#8217;s price rally in the last week, when it registered a 22% climb, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. TON price action today. Source: Coingecko Just lately, the price of Toncoin broke out in a big way, separating itself from a 30-day consolidation. During this period of consolidation, prices moved inexactly between $1.31 and $1.49, showing a restricted and steady trading range. Toncoin Shows Signs Of Resilience Several times throughout this period of consolidation, the cryptocurrency showed signs of trying to rise beyond the $1.50 barrier, which may have suggested a possible upward trend. However, bullish market forces were unable to push the price over the $1.50 level, and the price ultimately closed below that level. The continuation of these adverse influences indicates that traders and investors are currently exercising caution. The bears&#8217; stubbornness implies there&#8217;s a widespread view that the market can&#8217;t handle a prolonged rise above $1.50 just yet. As of today, cryptocurrencies reached a market cap of $1.13 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Toncoin At A Glance The Open Network, or TON for short, is a layer-1 blockchain that is both decentralized and fast. Established in 2018, it is a proof-of-stake (PoS) network that has gained massive adoption among crypto users for its lightning-fast transactions. TON set out to do some very big things, like simplifying transactions inside of Telegram. However, it encountered difficulty at every turn of its path. Despite the project&#8217;s initial focus on Gram, its native digital currency, it ran into trouble when the US Securities and Exchange Commission pointed out Telegram&#8217;s failure to register a substantial preliminary $1.7 billion Gram token sale. Source: Currency.com Possible Revisit Of Resistance Level This regulatory worry caused a brief halt in Gram sales, and the unrevealed offering ultimately led to a legal setback. Simultaneously, a slew of cyberattacks cast a pall over the TON&#8217;s appeal. Meanwhile, the present market structure indicates that the Toncoin price may revisit the resistance level of $1.49 if bulls can push prices above the support turned resistance of $1.31. For this to be even remotely credible, a candle closure over $1.31 would be required. If the TON price, however, rejects $1.31, it may return to the current support level of $1.17.

					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu (SHIB) coin has exceeded even the top 10 established cryptocurrencies this week, posting a solid 15% increase that has captivated the attention of the cryptocurrency community.

<p>Bitcoin, in comparison, was trading at $29,383, down a meager 0.1% in the last 24 hours, while managing to gain 1.3% in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracking site<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Coingecko</a> shows, Sunday.</p>

<p>The current increase in value represents a noteworthy achievement for SHIB, as it has exhibited sustained development throughout the preceding week.</p>
<h2><strong>Shibarium Launch Also Provides Big Price Lift </strong></h2>
<p>Furthermore, the imminent introduction of Shibarium, a Layer-2 protocol with advanced functionality, constructed on the Ethereum network, contributes to the heightened anticipation and price lift for SHIB.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/l24dngPH/" width="2475" height="1179"/></p>

<p>Meanwhile, data obtained from Coinglass provides a compelling depiction of a notable <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/1000SHIB" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">increase in open interest</a> observed in Binance&#8217;s SHIB futures market.</p>
<p>The current surge has exhibited a tremendous growth rate, increasing by almost 100% in just one month.</p>
<p>The substantial rise in open interest and market capitalization of SHIB indicates a considerable influx of capital. The historical context is interesting since it often aligns with instances of Bitcoin price swings.</p>
<strong>SHIB And Its Correlation To Bitcoin</strong>

<p>Over the course of SHIB&#8217;s existence, there have been around seven occurrences in which its open interest surpassed the significant milestone of $100 million. Significantly, each of these instances coincided with fluctuations in the valuation of the alpha crypto, Bitcoin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With multiple applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF already filed, many have continued to speculate when the SEC is likely to give its approval or otherwise. To further add to speculations, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, citing his sources, stated that approval was likely to come within four to six months. However, recent developments seem to suggest that the wait could be longer.  SEC Stalling? In a release dated August 11, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has moved to delay the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF in a move that could be seen as a delay tactic by the regulator.  Related Reading: San Francisco’s SoFi Bank Reveals Significant Holdings In BTC, ETH, And DOGE Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest and 21Shares had collaborated again to refile for a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year after the SEC rejected previous applications. Following the standard procedures, the SEC was meant to approve or disapprove the application by August 13. However, with its latest order calling for public input on ARK 21 Shares application, this deadline is consequently extended.  With this, the general public has three weeks to give further comments on the proposal, while the SEC has another five weeks to respond to any comments it may receive. Furthermore, the SEC can choose to extend the deadline by 240 days at the maximum (a move that could potentially delay a final response until Jan 10, 2024). This news would most likely not come as a surprise to ARK Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood, as she had predicted a delay when speaking to Bloomberg on August 7. She also forecasted that the SEC might approve multiple Bitcoin ETF applications. However, nothing is certain, as the regulator could also deny all applications as it has done in the past.

This is worrisome, considering that the SEC had previously rejected spot Bitcoin ETF applications on the grounds of potential market manipulation.  Furthermore, the SEC’s continued reference to this word may also mean that the regulator, maybe in a bid to frustrate these applications, could ask that they prove that Bitcoin is not a manipulated asset class.  Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange? That will undoubtedly be a huge ask considering that, over time, there have been instances that raised speculations that the crypto market can be manipulated by major players. Furthermore, Bitcoin is a borderless and decentralized currency, and even if the SEC were to move to regulate its use in the US, the ETF market could still be manipulated by external activities from outside the US. The SEC also made raised concerns about Bitcoin not having a “regulated market or significant size,” something which could hinder the approval of any spot-traded Bitcoin ETF. The agency pointed out the fact that Bitcoin Future ETFs were approved because they were regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

					<description><![CDATA[Chainlink (LINK) has been one of the top trending tokens in recent weeks due to a combination of an overall positive price movement as well as exciting on-chain developments.  Following a recent buying spree in the LINK market, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has taken to social media platform X, providing some insights on the token’s potential price action. Related Reading: LINK Price Prediction: Chainlink Turns Attractive On Dips 29,000 Wallets Purchase 295 Million LINK Forming Major Support Level On August 11, Ali posted on X stating that Chainlink has established a strong support zone between $6.63 and $6.88 as about 29,000 addresses purchased over 295 million LINK at this price range based on data from analytics firm IntoTheBlock. Moving on, he postulated that as long as the altcoin was trading above this price zone, investors were likely to continuously remain bullish, especially as Soon-chain data shows that there are no significant resistance levels ahead.  Source: IntoTheBlock According to Ali, a good number of LINK whales have already recognized the $6.63-6.88 zone as “robust” price support and are actively accumulating more tokens. He highlighted that in the past 14 days, LINK whales have purchased an estimated 13 million LINK worth around $91 million.  However, while these developments may be considered indications of a bullish LINK market, Ali states that traders anticipating a market breakout may still need to exercise some patience. Using data from IntoTheBlock, the crypto analyst draws attention to the declining network activity on the Chainlink network in the last three weeks.  Ali stated that during this period, the number of large LINK transactions had gone down from 527 to 118. He concluded his market report by stating a boost in this metric is likely to precede any market breakout. At the time of writing, LINK is exchanging hands at $7.44, with a 1.36% decline in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, the token is up 3.66% and 17.67% in the last seven and thirty days, respectively. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Holds Above 14% Gains As Crypto Market Slumps Heavily More Good News For Chainlink Aside from Ali’s market analysis, there has been other positive news about Chainlink in recent days. Also, on August 11, market intelligence firm Santiment reported LINK had experienced its highest level of dormant coin movements in the last six weeks. According to Santiment, this represented a decline in LINK’s mean dollar invested age curve, pointing to a decrease in the token’s time in wallets which is usually a precursor for a rise in market cap. In addition, Chainlink has maintained a rise in its development activity over the last few months. Based on data from Santiment, development activity on Chainlink went up from 1579.12 on May 31 to 1706.48 on August 3.  LINK trading at $7.432 on the daily chart &#124; Source: LINKUSD chart on Tradingview.com Featured image from Stockhead, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

<p>According to Ali, a good number of LINK whales have already recognized the $6.63-6.88 zone as “robust” price support and are actively accumulating more tokens. He highlighted that in the past 14 days, LINK whales have purchased an estimated 13 million LINK worth around $91 million. </p>
<p>However, while these developments may be considered indications of a bullish LINK market, Ali states that traders anticipating a market breakout may still need to exercise some patience.</p>
<p>Using data from IntoTheBlock, the crypto analyst draws attention to the declining network activity on the Chainlink network in the last three weeks. </p>
<p>Ali stated that during this period, the number of large LINK transactions had gone down from 527 to 118. He concluded his market report by stating a boost in this metric is likely to precede any market breakout.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, LINK is exchanging hands at $7.44, with a 1.36% decline in the last day, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to data from CoinMarketCap</a>. However, the token is up 3.66% and 17.67% in the last seven and thirty days, respectively.</p>

<h2><strong>More Good News For Chainlink</strong></h2>
<p>Aside from Ali’s market analysis, there has been other positive news about Chainlink in recent days. Also, on August 11, market intelligence firm Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1690063262745075712?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> LINK had experienced its highest level of dormant coin movements in the last six weeks.</p>
<p>According to Santiment, this represented a decline in LINK’s mean dollar invested age curve, pointing to a decrease in the token’s time in wallets which is usually a precursor for a rise in market cap.</p>
<p>In addition, Chainlink has <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-developer-activity-link-up-44-june-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">maintained a rise in its development activity</a> over the last few months. Based on<a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts?settings=%7B%22slug%22%3A%22chainlink%22%2C%22ticker%22%3A%22LINK%22%2C%22from%22%3A%222023-02-07T20%3A59%3A59.357Z%22%2C%22to%22%3A%222023-08-07T20%3A59%3A59.357Z%22%7D&amp;widgets=%5B%7B%22widget%22%3A%22HolderDistributionCombinedBalanceWidget%22%2C%22wm%22%3A%5B%22%5B3%3Bpercent_of_holders_distribution_combined_balance%3B100k_to_1M%3B1M_to_10M%5D%22%2C%22dev_activity%22%5D%2C%22whm%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22wax%22%3A%5B0%2C1%5D%2C%22wpax%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22wc%22%3A%5B%22%23FFCB47%22%2C%22%238358FF%22%5D%2C%22ws%22%3A%7B%221%22%3A%7B%22interval%22%3A%227d%22%2C%22node%22%3A%22area%22%2C%22transform%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22moving_average%22%2C%22movingAverageBase%22%3A42%7D%7D%7D%7D%5D&amp;layout=21256" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> data from Santiment,</a> development activity on Chainlink went up from 1579.12 on May 31 to 1706.48 on August 3. </p>
