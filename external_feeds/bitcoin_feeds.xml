According to South African officials, over 40 countries are interested in joining the BRICS group, including 23 nations that have formally applied.</strong></p>
<h2>Morocco Maintains Good Relations With 4 BRICS Countries, Will Not Attend Summit</h2>
<p>South Africa, the host of the BRICS summit this year, claimed last week that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">23 countries</a> have formally applied to join the economic bloc. According to South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor, they are Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belarus, Bolivia, Venezuela, Vietnam, Cuba, Honduras, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Morocco, Nigeria, State of Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>However, at least one country on the list has reportedly denied applying for BRICS membership. Morocco&#8217;s state news agency Maghreb Agence Presse (MAP) reported on Saturday, citing an unnamed source in the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that Morocco has not made a formal request to join the BRICS group. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/morocco-has-not-applied-join-brics-state-media-2023-08-19/">quoted</a> the news outlet as stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>South Africa allowed itself to speak about Morocco&#8217;s ties with the BRICS without prior consultation.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;South Africa has in fact always shown a primary hostility towards Morocco and has systematically taken negative and dogmatic positions on the Moroccan Sahara issue,” the publication added, noting that Morocco has embraced non-divisive multilateralism and has maintained good relations with other BRICS member states. The economic bloc comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morocco certainly maintains meaningful and promising bilateral relations with four other BRICS members and is even linked to three of them with strategic partnership agreements. However, the kingdom has never formally applied to join the BRICS group,&#8221; the Moroccan foreign ministry source reportedly said, adding that there is still &#8220;no framework or clear procedures governing the expansion of this group.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moreover, the Moroccan official stated that Morocco will not attend the BRICS&#8217; upcoming summit in South Africa that will take place on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg. All BRICS leaders are expected to attend, but Russian President <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">Vladimir Putin</a> will not be attending in person.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Morocco, it has never been a question of responding positively to the invitation to the BRICS-Africa meeting planned in South Africa or participating in this meeting at any level. This meeting was organized on the basis of a unilateral initiative of the South African government,&#8221; the source noted. South Africa&#8217;s backing of the Algeria-supported Polisario Front, which aims to establish an independent state in Western Sahara, a territory Morocco claims as its own, has created tension between the two nations.</p>
<p>South African officials also previously revealed that President Cyril Ramaphosa has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">invited</a> 67 leaders of countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean to the summit. In addition, 20 representatives of major international organizations have been invited, including the secretary-general of the United Nations, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, and the president of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank. In July, Anil Sooklal, South Africa’s top diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, said <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">over 40 countries</a> are interested in joining the economic bloc.</p>

<h2>Javier Milei&#8217;s Unconventional Policy Proposals</h2>
<p>Argentinian presidential hopeful Javier Milei’s plan to dollarize the economy of the South American country is &#8220;a far too risky gamble,&#8221; Mark Sobel, the U.S. chairperson of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), has said. According to Sobel, only &#8220;hard work&#8221; and austerity measures can extricate Argentina from its current problems.</p>
<p>During his campaigns, Milei has repeatedly touted full dollarization as the panacea to Argentina&#8217;s economic troubles. He also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/presidential-candidate-javier-milei-claims-he-has-the-funds-to-dollarize-argentina/">claimed</a> to have mobilized funds needed to remove local currency from circulation and abolish the central bank.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.omfif.org/2023/08/solving-argentinas-economic-failures-will-take-hard-work/">op-ed</a> published on Aug 17, the OMFIF chairperson acknowledged that Milei’s victory has seen global investors turn their attention towards the Argentine politician’s unconventional policy proposals. Sobel, a former U.S. Treasury official, argued however that while full dollarization is likely to end officials’ abuse of the discretion that comes with managing a currency, such a policy will bring its problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dollarisation is a potentially perilous &#8216;no exit&#8217; strategy. It could sow the seeds for a huge contraction and crash, while deflecting attention from the tough work of fixing the economy,&#8221; Sobel argued.</p>

<h2>The Collapse of the Convertibility Plan</h2>
<p>To back his assertions, Sobel pointed to how the so-called convertibility plan — a currency board — contributed to Argentina’s soaring current account deficit and rising unemployment between the 1990s and the early 2000s. In addition, the country was also unable to fund its external deficits and lost market access.</p>
<p>This, in turn, set off a chain of events which ended with the collapse of the convertibility plan. According to the OMFIF chairperson, full dollarization without an exit policy for &#8220;dollarisation could well lead to a far more serious economic contraction and collapse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Concerning the painful steps that the new government needs to take, Sobel said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Argentina needs sweeping fiscal consolidation to stop the perpetual cycle of excess borrowing, high and hyperinflation, default and instability. It needs to slam the brakes on reserve money creation. As painful as this will be, it’s necessary for achieving sustainability and a transition to a better future.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that Argentina also needs &#8220;extensive and sequenced liberalisation.&#8221; This cannot be achieved with multiple exchange rates or capital controls but with strong banks, the OMFIF chairperson said.</p>

That is why the BRICS cooperation mechanism is attractive to these countries,” he added.<br />
</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS and De-Dollarization</h2>
<p>Sun Qi, executive director of the Center for Russian and Central Asian Studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told Russian news outlet Tass Friday that more countries joining the BRICS economic bloc will increase the use of national currencies in settlements significantly, which will help accelerate de-dollarization. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. He was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>As more and more countries join the ranks of BRICS + partners, the transition to settlements in local currency or third-party currencies in mutual trade will increase significantly, thereby accelerating de-dollarization.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking about the upcoming BRICS summit that will take place on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg, Qi believes that one of the topics to be discussed is the creation of a single BRICS currency, stating: “BRICS currency, used for transactions between the BRICS countries, can be discussed in full and in detail.”</p>
<p>While some believe that the topic of a common BRICS currency will be discussed at the summit, including Russian Deputy Prime Minister <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-official-says-brics-currency-could-be-discussed-at-upcoming-summit/">Alexei Overchuk</a>, South Africa’s top diplomat in charge of BRICS relations recently said that this topic is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">not on the agenda</a> to be discussed at the summit. South Africa is the host of the BRICS summit this year.</p>

<p>Another topic that will be heavily discussed at the upcoming summit is the expansion of the economic bloc. Noting that in recent years, the BRICS expansion has been hindered by “the coronavirus pandemic, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and other factors,” Qi stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>For most developing countries, development is a top priority. That is why the BRICS cooperation mechanism is attractive to these countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to South African officials, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">over 40 countries</a> have expressed interest in joining the economic bloc, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">23 countries</a> that have already applied.</p>

<h2>Lord Jim O&#8217;Neill Slams Common BRICS Currency Idea</h2>
<p>British economist Lord Jim O&#8217;Neill shared his view on the proposed single BRICS currency in an interview with the Financial Times this week. The BRICS leaders are set to meet at the economic bloc’s 15th summit on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg. South Africa is the host of the BRICS summit this year. However, there are mixed reports on whether the creation of a common BRICS currency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">will be discussed</a> at the summit.</p>
<p>O’Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist, coined the acronym BRIC over 20 years ago to describe the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. South Africa joined the group a few years later, and the acronym was changed to BRICS. O’Neill is now a senior adviser at U.K. think tank Chatham House.</p>
<p>The economist asserted that the BRICS nations had “never achieved anything since they first started meeting” eight years after he created the phrase in a 2001 research note. He believes that a common currency for the BRICS economic bloc would be unfeasible, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s just ridiculous … They’re going to create a BRICS central bank? How would you do that? It’s embarrassing, almost.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Quite what they attempt to achieve beyond powerful symbolism, I don’t know,” he opined.</p>
<p>In June, Lord O&#8217;Neill similarly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-dollar-will-lose-dominant-status-china-and-india-could-play-key-role-in-currency-shift-says-economist-lord-oneill/">described</a> the idea of a single currency for the BRICS nations as “ridiculous” and “amusing.” He stressed that “China and India never agree on anything,” pointing out that the two countries “can’t even really agree on basic things like a peaceful border.”</p>
<h2>U.S. Dollar Could Lose Its Dominance, Lord O&#8217;Neill Warns</h2>
<p>The British economist also commented on the dominance of the U.S. dollar, emphasizing that the USD’s dominant position in the global financial system is not beneficial for emerging countries. He described:</p>
<blockquote><p>The dollar’s role is not ideal for the way the world has evolved. You’ve got all these economies who live on this cyclical never-ending twist of whatever the [U.S. Federal Reserve] decides to do in the interests of the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some economists have predicted that other currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, or the euro, would eventually overtake the U.S. dollar. However, O’Neill cautioned: “None of these things will ever happen until those countries want to have their currencies used by people in other parts of the world.”</p>

<p>The former Goldman economist noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a good job for the West that China and India never agree on anything, because if they did the dominance of the dollar would be a lot more vulnerable.</p></blockquote>
<p>In June, Lord O&#8217;Neill also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-dollar-will-lose-dominant-status-china-and-india-could-play-key-role-in-currency-shift-says-economist-lord-oneill/">warned</a> that the U.S. dollar will lose its dominant status as the world’s reserve currency. He expects the Chinese yuan and possibly the Indian rupee to become “much more important currencies for the world.&#8221; He stressed: “I do think if China and India could ever strongly agree on things as the two biggest countries in the emerging world … then that would probably hasten the end of the dollar’s dominance.&#8221;</p>

<h2>SBF Seeks Daily Meetings With Lawyers at Courthouse and Laptop With Internet</h2>
<p>Disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried is asking to be allowed to leave the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York, five days a week in order to meet with the members of his defense team at the federal courthouse in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The request comes just days after the 31-year-old founder and former chief executive of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-boss-sam-bankman-fried-in-custody-bail-revoked-remanded-to-jail/">jailed</a> in the MDC based on allegations of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-avoid-jail-denies-witness-tampering-in-ftx-case/">witness tampering</a> ahead of his trial scheduled to begin Oct. 2, Bloomberg and Reuters reported.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the former billionaire, who was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the U.S. about a month after FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection in mid-November, had been living under house arrest at his parents’ home in California on a $250 million bond which was revoked.</p>

<p>In a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, his lawyers described as “entirely inadequate” the conditions under which SBF is expected to prepare for his trial. They said that giving him just two days a week to review the large volume of evidence violated his right to effective counsel and pointed he has no dedicated computer or way to share materials with them online.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors had offered to load documents onto hard drives that Bankman-Fried could use on computers at the MDC. According to the government, however, it’s not feasible to load all the documents onto an internet-enabled laptop. In a letter to Kaplan, the prosecutors also insisted that SBF had been offered “extraordinary accommodations” at the Brooklyn jail.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried has been accused of misappropriating funds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> customers worth billions of U.S. dollars. He allegedly used the stolen money to finance his Alameda Research hedge fund, buy expensive property and make <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bankman-fried-donated-100-million-of-ftx-money-to-politicians-prosecutors-claim/">political donations</a>. He has pleaded not guilty. Next week, he will be arraigned on an amended indictment with seven fraud and conspiracy charges.</p>

<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Holesky Set to Replace Goerli Testnet in 2023</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1692283671481573538?s=20">reported</a> by Tim Beiko, a core developer, during the Ethereum <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DyAtbK2MQG4?feature=share">Execution Layer Meeting 168</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/parithosh_j">Parithosh Jayanthi</a> shared an update on the recently launched devnet-8. Beiko mentioned that while some clients faced challenges, most have been addressed or are being fixed. Notably, Lighthouse encountered a problem due to nplex support removal – an issue they plan to resolve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Beiko <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1692284398312538144?s=20">revealed</a> that Ethereum JS rectified a bug related to multiple &#8220;forkChoiceUpdated calls&#8221; during block production. Pre-launch glitches in Geth and Nethermind were identified and corrected. The Ethereum developer also stated that the Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s Devops team joined forces with <a href="https://twitter.com/KurtosisTech">Kurtosis Tech</a> for pre-launch testing and anticipates utilizing it in augmenting test scenarios.</p>
<p>The developer also emphasized that Besu and Erigon have not yet participated in the devnet but plan to once their respective implementations are finalized. Alongside these discussions, Ethereum developers aim to unveil a new testnest called <a href="https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky">Holesky</a> in mid-September. Intended to foster development, an abundance of testnet coins will be introduced to the testing layer.</p>

<p>Core developers agreed to incorporate 1.6 billion Holesky testnet ether. Holesky is set to be a public testnet and will &#8220;replace <a href="https://github.com/eth-clients/goerli">Goerli</a> as a staking, infrastructure, and protocol-developer testnet in 2023,&#8221; according to Holesky documentation. As of now, Holesky is scheduled for launch on September 15, 2023, at 14:00 UTC. This upcoming testnet will be employed for testing purposes in line with future Ethereum upgrades. The next Ethereum core developer Execution Layer Meeting is set for August 31, 2023.</p>

<h2>U.S. Judiciary Designates Tornado Cash as &#8216;Person&#8217; in OFAC Case</h2>
<p>In a legal face-off with the U.S. government, specifically the OFAC, the plaintiffs posited that Tornado Cash is simply decentralized software. On the contrary, the government viewed it as an organization facilitating cryptocurrency mixing. Central to the dispute was whether the OFAC held the power to impose sanctions on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-bans-ethereum-mixer-tornado-cash-platform-added-to-ofacs-sdn-list/">Tornado Cash</a>, and if such an action infringes on the plaintiffs&#8217; freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Yet, the court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1211705/gov.uscourts.txwd.1211705.94.0.pdf">dismissed</a> the plaintiffs&#8217; stance, recognizing Tornado Cash as an entity fit for OFAC designation. The court reasoned that Tornado Cash aligns with the regulatory description of an &#8220;association,&#8221; given the collaborative efforts of its founders, developers, and its DAO governance model towards shared objectives. U.S. judge Robert Pitman declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>The record sufficiently supports OFAC’s determination that the founders, the developers, and the Tornado Cash DAO have acted jointly to promote and govern Tornado Cash and to profit from these activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Judge Pitman identified that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/github-partially-reinstates-tornado-cash-codebase-open-source-code-set-to-read-only-mode/">Tornado Cash</a> holds a vested interest in the smart contracts it establishes, which aligns with the regulatory classification of &#8220;property.&#8221; These contracts, which autonomously generate revenue as fees for Tornado Cash, represent a tangible benefit. Pitman elucidated this perspective in the court documents.</p>
<p>When it comes to First Amendment concerns, Pitman clarified that the government&#8217;s moves don&#8217;t infringe upon safeguarded speech. The designation solely curtails transactions linked to Tornado Cash&#8217;s property rights, without restricting engagement with its open-source code or other services.</p>
<p>Pitman’s judgment emphasized, “The fact that smart contracts do so without additional human intervention, like a vending machine, or that they are immutable, does not affect its status as [a] type of contract and, thus, a type of property within the meaning of the regulation.”</p>
<p>The court documents also revealed that the plaintiff&#8217;s Fifth Amendment claims were essentially set aside, given their lack of follow-through beyond the preliminary grievance, even as the government sought a summary judgment for all claims. In conclusion, judge Pitman negated the plaintiffs&#8217; request for summary judgment while endorsing the government&#8217;s counter-claim.</p>
<p>He said he firmly believed that the OFAC acted within its legal boundaries in its decision concerning Tornado Cash, ensuring no breach of the plaintiffs&#8217; constitutional privileges. The verdict concerning Tornado Cash mirrors a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/notions-of-dao-immunity-sink-as-cftc-lawsuit-declares-ooki-dao-a-person-under-the-law/">preceding lawsuit</a> involving Ooki DAO, initiated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>On June 9, 2023, the CFTC clinched a victory when the judge determined that the Ooki DAO qualifies as a “person” under the Commodity Exchange Act. “This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure,” CFTC Division of Enforcement director Ian McGinley said at the time.</p>

Opensea revealed that the &#x201C;cost to continue supporting BSC outweighs the impact.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Opensea Pivots Away From <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Smart Chain in Strategy Re-evaluation</h2>
<p>On August 18, 2023, Opensea <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1692598153244020776?s=20">proclaimed</a> that they would cease BSC support after incorporating multiple blockchains over recent years. This announcement coincides with Opensea&#x2019;s strategy to phase out the enforcement of NFT royalties. Concerning BSC support, Opensea stated that as the industry advances, the company needs to &#x201C;align resources with the most promising efforts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve decided the cost to continue supporting BSC outweighs the impact,&#x201D; Opensea said. &#x201C;Starting today, you will no longer be able to create new listings for or make new offers on BSC NFTs. However, you will still be able to view, discover, and transfer BSC NFTs on our site.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In response to Opensea&#x2019;s X thread publication, some individuals <a href="https://twitter.com/CosmicRichy/status/1692629965735711179?s=20">claimed</a> they were <a href="https://twitter.com/NFTmmAAXXii/status/1692621790814892187?s=20">unaware</a> of BSC support&#x2019;s existence. Others seized this chance to voice their grievances about the royalty ruling. One individual <a href="https://twitter.com/MemeNFTOfficial/status/1692747312148176929?s=20">commented</a>, &#x201C;IDK what kind of system you guys are running over there but it&#x2019;s not that expensive to run BSC if you do it right.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Opensea concluded by asserting their continued optimism regarding a multi-chain future and shared that they recently added support for layer two (L2) blockchains <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bases-rapid-ascent-136000-daily-users-and-175-million-tvl-in-ethereums-l2-defi-space/">Base</a> and Zora. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re confident this decision will help us direct resources to keep pace with the rapid innovation in our ecosystem,&#x201D; added Opensea.</p>

Furthermore, four days prior, the count of distinct wallets containing WLD surpassed the 500,000 mark.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Plummets Over 50% Since Its All-Time High</h2>
<p>According to statistics, the iris-scanning crypto project <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-opens-probe-into-worldcoin-personal-data-treatment-procedures/">Worldcoin</a>&#x2018;s native token, WLD, has increased 15% in the last 24 hours. Data from July 24 to <a href="https://archive.ph/g6SUj">August 18, 2023</a>, shows WLD has declined 29.1% against the U.S. dollar. Currently, WLD ranks 156 out of more than 10,000 crypto assets listed, with a market value of about $194 million. There&#x2019;s a circulating supply of <a href="https://archive.ph/K46Da#selection-699.0-699.11">178.9 million WLD</a>, trading at $1.53 each. WLD is down 53.46% from its all-time high on July 24, 2023, its listing date.</p>

<p>Of the 178.9 million WLD in existence, <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2766822/4605343">17.45 million</a> are claimed tokens, according to data from Dune Analytics. On August 14, 2023, the number of wallets holding WLD surpassed 500,000, and as of August 18, there are 531,236 unique addresses. The top wallet, which is the contract, holds 97.52 million WLD, or 54.52% of the supply. The second wallet, also under Worldcoin control, holds 30.98 million WLD, or 17.33% of the current supply. The third-largest WLD holder is <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xF977814e90dA44bFA03b6295A0616a897441aceC">Binance&#x2019;s cold wallet</a> with about 11.7 million tokens or 6.54%.</p>

<p>&#x200B;&#x200B;The market maker Wintermute holds the <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0x55697d6ef379C6324e41f350A3db4ee19BAb82A0">fourth-largest WLD wallet</a> with 7.19 million, or 4.03% of the supply. Worldcoin operates the fifth-largest WLD address with about 3.45 million tokens (1.93%), while the sixth-largest Worldcoin wallet belongs to the crypto exchange Okx. As of August 18, the <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xEbe80f029b1c02862B9E8a70a7e5317C06F62Cae">Okx wallet</a> holds approximately 2.13 million WLD, or 1.19% of the total supply. The six aforementioned WLD wallets control 85.53% of the 178.9 million WLD. The top 100 Worldcoin (WLD) holders collectively own 94.04% of the supply.</p>

<p>In the past 24 hours, WLD has seen about $89.76 million in trade volume. The crypto asset&#x2019;s $194 million represents 0.018% of the $1.09 trillion crypto economy. The four most traded pairs for WLD are tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), USD Coin (USDC) and the Korean won, followed by the U.S. dollar. Tether trades make up 96% of WLD&#x2019;s 24-hour trade volume. About $1.01 million of the $89.76 million comes from Uniswap v3 on Ethereum, and roughly $190,000 was recorded in the last day on the Optimism version of Uniswap v3, with the most traded pair being WETH.</p>

Prices recently fell lower for six straight days, however, bulls have reentered the market snapping this streak in the process. Dogecoin also rebounded today. </strong></p>
<h2>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>)</h2>
<p>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>) rose higher on Saturday, following a recent six-day losing streak which pushed the price to a multi-month low.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>/USD climbed to an intraday peak at $0.12 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following a low of $0.1115 the day prior.</p>
<p>The move comes as stellar continued to move away from a support point at $0.110, which was hit on Thursday.</p>

<p>This was the first time the price collided with this floor since mid-June, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) hit its own floor at 30.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index has also rebounded and is now tracking at 34.84, which is marginally below a ceiling at 36.00.</p>
<p>Should it push past this point, the next likely price target will be around a ceiling of $0.1340.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>, dogecoin (DOGE) was also in the green to start the weekend, as it bounced from a floor of its own.</p>
<p>After trading at a low of $0.06079 during Friday&#x2019;s session, DOGE/USD surged to a peak of $0.06385 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The jump in price came as the meme coin moved away from a support point of $0.0600, which is near a recent two-month low.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>, the RSI on the dogecoin chart has bounced from a support point at the 30.00 mark, and is now tracking at 34.13.</p>
<p>The next visible point of resistance is at the 44.00 mark, and should this point be hit, DOGE will likely be near $0.06600.</p>
