										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Twitter head and current chief executive of Block Jack Dorsey has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/04/jack-dorsey-donates-10-million-to-fund-bitcoin-development/?sh=5e277cd2d640" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">pledged a $10 million</a> donation to a non-profit called Open Sats. The money is slated to be fully, 100 percent put towards a bitcoin-focused social media network.</p>
<h2>Jack Dorsey Gives a Lot of Money to Open Sats</h2>
<p>Dorsey has long been a bitcoin and crypto advocate. He <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-will-become-worlds-single-currency-dorsey/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">stated five years</a> ago that he was convinced bitcoin would become the sole currency of the world, and that all other fiat currencies – like the euro, the yen, the U.S. dollar, etc. – would be wiped out. He also (prior to the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coronavirus/" data-wpel-link="internal">COVID pandemic</a>) pledged to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/jack-dorsey-i-will-bring-btc-to-africa/" data-wpel-link="internal">spend three to six months</a> touring Africa to try and get its people to adopt the ways of bitcoin and blockchain so they could benefit financially and otherwise.</p>
<p>Open Sats is based in the city of Raleigh, North Carolina. The company received its non-profit status back in the year 2021 per data site Charity Navigator. Interestingly, the company started out with less than $200K to its name, though this sudden donation from Dorsey is likely to make a huge change for both the company and whatever projects it has on its roster.</p>
<p>In a recent statement, the company made it clear that bitcoin – and assets like it – are aligned with its primary values. The statement read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that free software and open protocols are necessary for a free and prosperous society. Without software that protects the individual user&#8217;s rights and freedoms, and without digital infrastructure that is open to all, modern society risks slipping further into digital totalitarianism.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company’s website says its primary objective is to “support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and contributors, especially bitcoin-related projects and projects which help bitcoin flourish.”</p>
<p>The company’s statement continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Open Sats will fund software developers, but also designers, reviewers, researchers, educators, and others who support these free and open-source tools.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Defending Bitcoin in the Long-Term</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Dorsey came to the aid of several <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/jack-dorsey-is-defending-several-btc-developers-against-craig-wright/" data-wpel-link="internal">developers who had previously</a> worked for Australian computer scientist Craig Wright. The former social media executive created a defense fund for the developers after they were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by their former boss, who over the course of several years, has stuck to the notion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/23/australian-man-craig-wrights-claim-he-invented-bitcoin-to-be-considered-by-uk-court" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">that he is Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, the legendary (and pseudonymous) creator of BTC, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap.</p>
<p>While the identity matter is still up for debate, Dorsey claimed that if Wright gets his way in the upcoming lawsuit, the open-source nature of bitcoin will be put on the line. His goal is to ensure that bitcoin always remains open source so developers can continue to learn from it and benefit from its technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long run, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">banking crisis</a> that we’re presently seeing has helped assets like bitcoin and Ethereum really step into the limelight and do much better than they did in 2022. However, Charles Hoskinson – the co-founder of Ethereum and the creator of ETH rival Cardano – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/06/worse-than-2008-bitcoin-and-crypto-now-braced-for-540-billion-crisis-ethereum-cofounder-warns/?sh=2111d0cdf39f" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">recently stated that he</a> thinks the crisis will get a lot worse, and that in the end, it could have negative effects on crypto.</p>
<h2>Charles Hoskinson on Where Banks Will Go</h2>
<p>In an interview, Hoskinson said he thinks the crisis of 2008 and 2009 will be nothing like what’s coming. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2008, we had $373 billion in tied-up assets. I think we’re over $540 billion now just in the 2023 crisis. We’re just getting started. That whole business model is falling apart when you give it a little bit of a push and then you lose these institutions like Silicon Valley Bank, and they get so politicized, and they get so globalized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, the banking crisis was exacerbated when <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/first-republic-bank-is-gone-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">First Republic Bank became</a> the latest financial institution to join the ranks of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature, and others. FRB went up in smoke and had all its assets sold off or provided to competing firms like JPMorgan Chase, which was glad to step in and offer a helping hand according to head executive Jamie Dimon. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s ironic that both Dimon and JPMorgan both played big parts in the 2008 Great Recession, and it looks like they’re being set up to play big roles again.</p>
<p>Hoskinson is convinced that the events of 15 years ago are not only going to repeat themselves, but they’re likely to be even larger, and he isn’t predicting good outcomes for any assets, whether they be bitcoin, Ethereum, gold, or obscure coins. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>What’s going to happen is ‘too big to fail’ is just going to lead to bigger institutions. We’ve seen this story in 2008, and this is the rerun. I don’t think anybody wants to watch it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What Happens from Here?</h2>
<p>Bill Ackman – chief executive of New York hedge fund Pershing Square – agrees with Hoskinson that the present banking crisis could reach unprecedented levels. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Confidence in a financial institution is built over decades and destroyed in days. As each domino falls, the next weakest bank begins to wobble. We are running out of time to fix this problem. How many more unnecessary bank failures do we need to watch before the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] and our government wake up? We need a systemwide deposit guarantee regime now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus far in 2023, the banking crisis has already (presumably) contributed to the Federal Reserve hiking rates not <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rates-again-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">once</a>, but <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-fed-hikes-rates-again-but-analysts-think-bitcoin-will-surge-soon/" data-wpel-link="internal">twice</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bob Ras is a blockchain executive <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-crypto-record-highs-blockchain-founder-sologenic-ras-currency-markets-2023-5" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">and the co-founder of</a> the distributed ledger company Sologenic.</p>
<h2>Bob Ras on Where BTC Will Go</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Ras explained his thoughts on the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">present banking crisis</a> and what outcome it’s likely to hold for bitcoin in the long-term. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As big banks have been collapsing, it seems clearer by the day that these investors see bitcoin as a hedge because of its decentralized censorship resistance and lack of counterparty risk. There are growing expectations that the Fed will loosen monetary policy and effectively inject a lot more liquidity into the market to shore up the financial system, and bitcoin is front running this scenario, pointing to a future that is effectively a return to relatively low rates. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if $40,000 could be reached by the end of this year.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-could-more-than-double-and-hit-a-new-record-high-next-year-as-the-token-sees-a-big-shakeup-blockchain-exec-says/ar-AA1aOSSH" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">He continued with</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The banking crisis helped to cement the narrative of bitcoin serving as a key store of value that lacks the sort of counterparty risk of holding funds by way of bank deposits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ras was also quick to say what he thinks has been fueling the big bitcoin corrections we’ve been seeing. 2023 has been hugely different from 2022 in that it’s been somewhat bullish. 2022 saw bitcoin reach new lows and lose more than 70 percent of its value over the course of 12 short months.</p>
<p>In November of 2021, the currency hit a new all-time high of about $68,000, but just a year later, it fell into the mid-$16K range. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>A big reason why bitcoin has performed so well was that it was just really oversold during the collapse of FTX. Plus, there&#8217;s on-chain evidence that more and more people and institutions have been accumulating bitcoin during the lows, which essentially translated into a supply shock. With so few sellers left, any uptick in demand has an outsize impact on price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite all the positive sentiment about bitcoin and where he thinks it could go in the coming months, his message did contain a small bit of gloom and doom and a subsequent warning to investors. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest risk would be a sharp credit crisis that causes a rapid contraction. In such a scenario, all assets would have a correlation of one with each other, including bitcoin and even gold. I&#8217;m not sure such a scenario would happen, but it&#8217;s possible and would unleash a tremendous amount of volatility not only for bitcoin, but all markets.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Halving Will Really Help</h2>
<p>Still, however, he’s positive about where bitcoin will be next year, saying 2024’s halving will push it past its previous all-time high. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>When bitcoin&#8217;s halving kicks in a year from now, we&#8217;ll likely be well on our way past the previous all-time high.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buncombe County commissioners in North Carolina are taking a page out of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/some-want-the-crypto-moratorium-in-new-york-to-last-longer/" data-wpel-link="internal">New York’s crypto</a> playbook and are enforcing a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/buncombe-county-oks-1-moratorium-113219118.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">one-year moratorium on all</a> crypto mining operations so they can explore regulations and laws.</p>
<h2>North Carolina County Halts Crypto Mining</h2>
<p>Planning director Nate Pennington said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t often bring a moratorium to the table.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, he commented that because crypto mining is still relatively new and doesn’t run under any specific laws, this period will allow him and his fellow city council members to explore new ideas for ensuring the space remains safe for all who take part in it or benefit from it.</p>
<p>Chris Joyell – the healthy communities director with Mountain True – said the region’s people have been extremely helpful and “proactive” when it comes to the issue at hand. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mountain True has seen several cryptocurrency mines operating in WNC, especially in Cherokee County, where they have proven to be a nuisance to neighbors and a threat to our environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>He said that right now, there are many concerns surrounding the potential noise of the mining machines. There is also a lot of worry regarding the pollution they allegedly emit, and he and his fellow constituents don’t want North Carolina air or water being ruined because people are looking to create blockchain careers for themselves. He continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no way to greenwash crypto mining. Let me repeat: As the value of bitcoin rebounds, the growth of cryptocurrency mining operations put North Carolina in danger of not being able to hit the goals set out by Gov. Cooper and the N.C. General Assembly with House Bill 951.</p></blockquote>
<p>Craig Deutsch has lived in Buncombe County for about ten years. He’s one of the few people who’s against the moratorium, saying that with crypto being such a revolutionary arena, he’s concerned the move could put North Carolina behind in terms of technical achievements. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I urge the county commissioners and planners to take the time to visit bitcoin mines, do research about bitcoin’s benefits to the environment&#8230; and listen to stories about the positive impacts of bitcoin for underserved and underbanked communities… At the end of the day, all bitcoin mining computers do is run code, and code is a form of constitutionally protected speech.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kimberly Stonebraker, who has lived in North Carolina since 1999, said to the commissioners:</p>
<blockquote><p>I urge you to keep an open mind.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Not Good for Residents?</h2>
<p>Finally, Ken Brame – a representative of the Sierra Club – said he fears crypto mining can do a lot of damage to residents. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We live out there for a reason. We need to take the time to figure out what regulations, what management we have in place to prevent that from happening in neighborhoods like mine.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new bill proposed by New York Attorney General Leticia James <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/new-york-attorney-general-seeks-new-crypto-powers-for-state-regulators/ar-AA1aMIFu" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">would give her state a basic</a> framework for crypto regulation. Among the provisions in the bill are exchanges being required to reimburse customers if they are the victims of fraud or theft.</p>
<h2>Leticia James Seeks to Introduce Basic Regulation</h2>
<p>New York and Leticia James have long held strong anti-crypto attitudes. Not long ago, the attorney general sued several digital currency companies including <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-attorney-generals-office-now-suing-ku-coin-exchange/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ku Coin</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/leticia-james-sues-coin-ex-alleging-crypto-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coin Ex</a>, alleging both had taken part in various forms of fraud.</p>
<p>In addition, the state of New York has recently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/some-want-the-crypto-moratorium-in-new-york-to-last-longer/" data-wpel-link="internal">instituted a two-year crypto</a> moratorium to ensure that no new digital currency mining companies can set up shop in the Empire State for the next 24 months. The goal is to make it so that all crypto companies run purely on clean energy and obey present environmental standards. Regarding her recent bill, James stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re proposing common sense measures to protect investors and end the fraud and dysfunction that have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other provisions laid out in the bill include customers being informed of conflicts of interest amongst crypto companies. Also, they would be educated on various risks regarding their investments and the platforms they choose to work with. Lastly, crypto companies would not be permitted to borrow or lend customer assets, clearly a nod to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">the FTX debacle</a> in which customer funds were utilized to pay off loans and invest in luxury Bahamian real estate.</p>
<p>While the items laid out in the bill sound glorious, it would be a mistake to rush forward on the idea that it’s all lollipops and rainbows from here on out, the biggest reason being that James, as mentioned above, has not always liked crypto or held the most positive attitude towards it. Thus, crypto fans need to remain wary.</p>
<p>This is an idea held by many crypto analysts and legal experts including Andrew Hinkes, a partner at law firm K&amp;L Gates. In a recent tweet, Hinkes mentioned that the bill was “destined to fail” in the New York Congress given that it’s written by someone (James) who doesn’t understand crypto.</p>
<p>He explained that the provisions in the bill are virtually impossible to apply to decentralized organizations. He also mentioned that the market, as it stands, cannot provide the kinds of auditing and insurance that James would like to see initiated.</p>
<h2>Being Looked at Carefully</h2>
<p>Right now, the bill is in document form and being observed by New York regulators. They must give the “OK” on the bill for it to become law.</p>
<p>Since the fall of FTX seven months ago, crypto regulation appears to be on the minds of virtually every politician. The company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-the-damage-caused-by-ftx-was-worse-than-initially-thought/" data-wpel-link="internal">accounted for more than</a> $200 billion in crypto funds being wiped off the digital slate permanently.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Between his shady <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-amendment-for-infrastructure-bill-leads-to-more-problems-and-infighting/" data-wpel-link="internal">infrastructure bill</a>, attempting to shut the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-biden-using-an-obama-era-program-to-ban-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto industry out of traditional</a> or standard financial products, and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/biden-wants-to-tax-crypto-mining-companies-at-30/" data-wpel-link="internal">now a 30 percent tax</a> proposal on all crypto mining operations, Joe Biden is arguably turning out to be the most anti-crypto “leader” in the history of the U.S.</p>
<h2>Biden + Crypto = Disasters!</h2>
<p>Crypto has long been a taboo topic in American politics. As we all remember in 2019, some of the democratic hopefuls looking to make their way into the White House in 2020 built their campaigns on the ideas that crypto could be simplified. Men like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/andrew-yang-the-crypto-president/" data-wpel-link="internal">Andrew Yang</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/michael-bloomberg-proposes-clarified-bitcoin-regulation-if-he-takes-the-white-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">Michael Bloomberg</a> said they would do all they could to make crypto laws easier to understand, and they would work to make the industry more mainstream.</p>
<p>However, neither figure was able to make waves with voters, and their plans ultimately came to immediate standstills.</p>
<p>In the end, democrats wound up with Joe Biden. The irony here is that in the beginning, Biden was touted as the man who would put <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/11/15/why-joe-biden-could-be-big-for-bitcoin/?sh=389b95b5f688" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">crypto on the map</a>. He would make it a legitimate, mainstream asset class that could be utilized and enjoyed by all. Since then, however, he’s done the exact opposite, and his anti-crypto rhetoric has become all-too clear.</p>
<p>Things got off to a rocky start in the summer of 2021, just a few months after he was inaugurated. Biden signed a new infrastructure bill into law that instead of working to rebuild our roads, hospitals, and schools (like the word “infrastructure” would imply), contained verbiage aimed at crypto holders. They would be required to report all transactions exceeding specific numbers, and the IRS would likely come down hard on them every April 15 beginning in the year 2024.</p>
<p>Things didn’t stop there, however. Biden initiated several weak economic policies and signed multiple trillion-dollar spending bills into law that ultimately caused record inflation and brought crypto prices down to their lowest points in 2022. That period now stands as the shakiest ever for crypto.</p>
<p>Then, news spread that Biden was working to implement an Obama-era policy that would shut out all crypto businesses from traditional financial tools and services. Things like checking accounts, for example, would no longer be accessible to these firms, but just when you thought things couldn’t get any worse, America’s phony president announced he was urging Congress to consider a 30 percent tax proposal on all crypto mining businesses.</p>
<h2>Trying to Ruin the Mining Sector?</h2>
<p>This would undoubtedly bring the industry to a halt given mining’s where the money is at. It’s also what gives crypto life and brings new digital units into circulation. By defeating miners, you defeat the entire crypto arena.</p>
<p>At this stage, anyone who felt Biden would be America’s “crypto president” should be hiding in shame.</p>

<li>Bitcoin cash is attempting a recovery wave above the $100 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below the $110 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $105 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $106 and $108 to continue higher in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is consolidating above $100 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $108 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $95 level. BCH started a decent increase and was able to clear the $98 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $100 and $102 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $116.83 swing high to the $90.82 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $105 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>It is now trading below the $110 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-bulls-struggle-below-120/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $106 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $108 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $116.83 swing high to the $90.82 low, above which the price may perhaps rise toward the $115 level. Any more gains above $115 could set the pace for a move toward the $120 level.</p>
<p>If not, the price might decline again. Immediate support on the downside is near the $102 level. The first major support sits near the $100 level. The next major support is near $95, below which the bears might aim for $90. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $88 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase Borrow – the official lending protocol of Coinbase, one of America’s largest and most popular digital currency trading platforms – has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/coinbase-to-stop-issuing-new-loans-via-coinbase-borrow/ar-AA1aIdBD" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ceased all operations</a>.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Borrow Closes Its Doors Permanently</h2>
<p>The end for Coinbase Borrow arrived on May 10. This was the last day on which customers could take out loans. Those who received loans prior to the set date were told their financials wouldn’t be affected. This was simply the cut-off date for all new lending customers.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, despite the exchange being under heavy scrutiny from institutions like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the closing of Coinbase Borrow doesn’t appear to have anything to do with the company’s ongoing legal problems. A person allegedly familiar with the matter explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we’re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most. Effective May 10, we will stop issuing new loans through Coinbase Borrow. There is no impact on customers’ outstanding loans, and no action is required from them [currently].</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, many analysts are being forced to come up with their own conclusions and assumptions regarding the reasons for the closure. One can say, for example, that the borrowing and lending arena in the crypto world has been rather up and down over the past year, and thus Coinbase doesn’t want to take any chances.</p>
<p>For example, lending protocols such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-lender-voyager-digital-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Voyager Digital</a> have been forced to close their doors and enter bankruptcy proceedings as a means of protecting themselves against angry creditors who want their money back. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/another-mega-bitcoin-crash-is-in-the-books/" data-wpel-link="internal">These institutions also halted</a> all withdrawals, thus cutting customers off from their hard-earned funds to ensure that they could at least remain relatively stable while they figured out their next steps.</p>
<p>The crypto industry is still reeling from the actions of 2022. While assets like bitcoin have experienced some degrees of healing since the start of 2023, there is still a lot of work to do, and a black cloud is still hanging over the heads of many crypto and blockchain institutions. It may be some time before everything is fully resolved.</p>
<p>Coinbase has been enduring several issues over the past few months. Not long ago, the company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">received a Wells notice</a> from the SEC, informing executives that while charges hadn’t been filed against the company yet, these charges were likely to arrive relatively soon.</p>
<h2>Why Send Us This?</h2>
<p>Coinbase took serious issue with the Wells notice on account of the alleged fact that those in charge met with representatives of the SEC roughly 30 times over the course of nine years to ensure that they remained fully compliant with present securities and financial laws.</p>
<p>The SEC has arguably become one of the biggest crypto bullies around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin endured a small dip in early May after it was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-pulls-back-to-start-may-as-first-republic-bank-saga-comes-to-an-end/ar-AA1aBdVP" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed the drama surrounding</a> First Republic Bank reached a new peak. Right now, the sentiment is that the bank could be the final monetary institution that crashes and burns following a long <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">streak of banks</a> that did the same. The streak includes names like Signature, Silvergate, and Silicon Valley.</p>
<h2>First Republic Bank Has Fallen</h2>
<p>Early last month, regulators acquired First Republic Bank and circulated most of its assets and deposits to institutions like JPMorgan Chase. This marks the third major bank failure this year, and it’s making a lot of people think the days of the 2008 Great Recession are on their way back.</p>
<p>Alex Thorn – head of firmwide research at Galaxy – commented in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the banking crisis narrative can continue to be a boon for bitcoin. Overall, the market lacks clear positive near-term catalysts, with supply issues overhanging bitcoin… Bitcoin accumulation by small addresses is outpacing issuance, and we expect Ethereum staking to increase, each of which provides a supportive supply narrative. Outside of crypto-native factors, we expect a back-of-the-year macro environment to be characterized by tightening, recession, and an expanding multipolarity in the global economy, all of which can be supportive of gold and bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>The banking crisis in America and Europe has been two-fold in many ways. On the one hand, it’s put a lot of people in a state of fear that another big financial crisis like the one we witnessed 14 or 15 years ago is coming again. At the same time, it can be argued that the current baking crisis has brought about a new “safe haven” status for bitcoin and many of its digital cronies.</p>
<p>As a result, we are seeing currencies like bitcoin rise like they never did the previous year, and there are more people backing these assets, supporting them, and investing in them as a means of keeping their wealth stable during this present period of financial and economic strife. Thorn continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin and ether started 2023 inorganically cheap, allowing for plenty of room to move higher off a low-base effect. A widening banking crisis became evident in March, and the contrast with bitcoin&#8217;s transparent and decentralized nature provided a further leg up for bitcoin, while Ethereum&#8217;s successful Shanghai upgrade provided a catalyst for Ethereum.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trouble A-Brewing for Standard Banks</h2>
<p>First Republic Bank reached a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-more-banking-troubles/" data-wpel-link="internal">troublesome point after</a> its stock shares fell by more than 80 percent over the course of just a few days. The dips had a lot to do with lagging deposits in Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>That institution was “notoriously” tied to crypto, which is why so many regulators blamed the digital currency arena for the fall of the latter firm.</p>
