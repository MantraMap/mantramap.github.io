<p>InQubeta is a new crypto project with much attention from investors and AI startups. While built on the ERC20 Ethereum blockchain, the InQubeta platform allows investors to gain unprecedented access to diverse AI startups, each presenting an opportunity to be at the forefront of technological disruption.</p>
<p>QUBE is the world's first cryptocurrency that seeks to revolutionize investment for Al start-ups. As such, the platform uses the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to link investors and Al startups through the NFT marketplace. While investors search through the NFT marketplace for the best NFTs to buy, startups can create and list NFTs representing various rewards and or equity in their company. The NFTs create mutual benefits to help startups raise funds and offer a unique and lucrative opportunity for investors simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its fractional investment opportunity, InQubeta could be the best crypto to invest in 2023 as it allows investors to own a share of any AI startup within the ecosystem. Investors can purchase the NFTs they choose with the ERC20 QUBE token, the in-house currency. This is to ensure&nbsp; seamless, secure, and transparent transactions in the InQubeta ecosystem. With the opportunities and growth trajectory of AI technology, InQubeta could be the best crypto for beginners and experts who want to invest in the future of AI start-ups.&nbsp;</p>
