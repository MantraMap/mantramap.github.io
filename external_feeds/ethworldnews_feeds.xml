<ul><li>Coinbase has signed a licensing deal with Bitpanda to cater to European banks serving crypto clients.&nbsp;</li><li>The partnership will see the American exchange provide liquidity and custody services to Bitpanda.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest deal is part of Coinbase’s efforts to increase its presence abroad amid intensifying crackdown in the U.S.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>American crypto giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-l2-base-mainnet-launch-no-token/">Coinbase</a> has signed a licensing deal with Vienna-based Bitpanda, amid its push to increase its global presence. The deal will see the Austrian crypto exchange connect its American counterpart with European financial institutions that are looking to offer crypto products to their clients. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Seeks To Increase Global Footprint Amid U.S. Crypto Crackdown</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent report by<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/24/bitpanda-partners-with-coinbase-to-help-europes-banks-offer-customers-crypto/" rel="nofollow noopener"> CoinDesk</a>, the new partnership will see Coinbase use Bitpanda’s B2B infrastructure layer provider to cater to European banks and fintech firms. The American exchange will provide liquidity and custody to Bitpanda, which already has relationships with several banks, neo-banks and fintech platforms, including Raiffeisenlandesbank, European mobile </p>



<p>Speaking on the deal with Coinbase, Bitpanda’s COO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that the American exchange will be able to leverage Bitpanda’s services to use an infrastructure middle layer and increase its customer base in Europe. During the announcement, both exchanges highlighted that they are regulated entities that conform to the highest know your customer (KYC) norms.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>They understand how much business they are missing out on, and also how much more of their customer base would do that business, if they had enough trust in the process.” </p><cite>Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, COO at Bitpanda </cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase’s European push comes shortly after the European parliament voted to approve the highly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework for its crypto industry. Apart from the easing regulations in the European market, the crypto exchange&#8217;s latest move is also prompted by the intensifying crackdown on crypto entities in the United States.</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase’s layer 2 network Base recently published its mainnet launch criteria.&nbsp;</li><li>Base’s mainnet will go live after Optimism’s Bedrock upgrade, full audits, and demonstration of testnet stability.&nbsp;</li><li>Since testnet, the network has attracted several builders from gaming, NFTs, and DeFi verticals.&nbsp;</li><li>The L2 network confirmed that there are no plans to issue a network token for now.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase’s layer 2 network Base is gearing up for its widely anticipated mainnet launch. The Base team published a roadmap titled “Path to Mainnet” earlier today that provided an insight into the network’s progress and upcoming milestones in the run-up to its mainnet launch. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-lobbying-dc-nationwide-campaign/">Coinbase</a> also listed a series of objectives to be fulfilled before its L2 solution’s mainnet goes live later this year. </p>



<h2><strong>Base Doesn’t Plan To Issue A Network Token</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://base.mirror.xyz/gxOzGCE-9C7cNZBCo4Ubkkxr87L8BcHDfn5HViSdYGg" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Base, safety and security are the top priorities for the network as it gears up for its mainnet debut. The key milestones to the way to mainnet include the demonstration of testnet stability, Optimism’s successful upgrade of Bedrock, and the completion of reviews and audits. The completed milestones include the completion of the Regolith hardfork in testnet and the infrastructure review with Optimism’s team ahead of the Bedrock upgrade. </p>



<p>The objective remains to increase economic freedom and opportunity around the world by onboarding the next million developers and billion users into the crypto economy. Contradictory to the speculation in the crypto community online, Base stated that there are no plans to issue a network token.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Following Mainnet Genesis begins our Genesis Window — a focused, coordinated window for developers to deploy dapps on Base mainnet. During this window, we will be exclusively focusing on developers and providing support to ensure they are successful.” </p><cite>Base team</cite></blockquote>



<p>Base revealed that it had attracted tremendous interest from the developer community and projects from several spaces. including Gaming, NFTs, Infrastructure, Developer Tooling, Wallets, Security, DeFi, Oracles, Analytics, Bridging, Payments, DAOs, and Social. Among the most exciting builders on Base are Blackbird, Parallel, Thirdweb, and OAK. The team behind the L2 network also launched a “Path to Base Mainnet NFT” that users can mint to commemorate this milestone.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Shaquille O’Neal has been served in Miami by a law firm representing FTX creditors.&nbsp;</li><li>The NBA legend was served for a second time while he was attending a basketball game.&nbsp;</li><li>Shaq was previously served by the same lawsuit, but he disputed the manner in which he was served.&nbsp;</li><li>O’Neal has been accused of evading multiple attempts by process servers to serve the summons.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal has been served in the class action lawsuit against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celebrities-promoted-ftx-victims-cant-sue/">FTX</a> founder Sam Bankman-Fried, again. The law firm representing thousands of customers that were defrauded by the Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange, recently revealed that it had managed to serve the basketball Hall of Famer for a second in Miami. </p>



<h2><strong>Shaq Was Served At Stadium Formerly Known As FTX Arena</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by T<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/shaq-served-again-in-ftx-lawsuitat-former-ftx-arena-a2ccbfd8" rel="noopener">he Wall Street Journal</a>, Shaquille O’Neal was served earlier this week during Game 4 of the NBA’s Eastern Conference Finals held at Kaseya Center in Miami, which was formerly known as FTX Arena. O’Neal was commentating on the match between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics when he was served by the process servers of the Moskowitz Law Firm that represents thousands of the bankrupt crypto exchange’s stranded customers. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It seems absurd to have to go to such great lengths to serve Mr. O’Neal. I hope we can just get to the merits of the case.” </p><cite>Adam Moskowitz, The Moskowitz Law Firm</cite></blockquote>



<p>According to the Moskowitz Law Firm’s Adam Moskowitz, the process servers were instructed to serve O’Neal again for the FTX lawsuit, to ensure that any allegations of improper serving do not hold up the court proceedings in the future. Last month the process servers tossed the legal documents into Shaq’s moving car in Atlanta, Georgia. However, his lawyers attempted to get the lawsuit dismissed on the grounds that the process servers served him improperly by throwing the summons into his vehicle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The judge overseeing the case against FTX and its disgraced founder denied Shaq’s motion to have the case dismissed. Shaq previously defended himself by claiming that he never believed in crypto. “A lot of people think I’m involved, but I was just a paid spokesperson for a commercial,” the NBA star stated at the time.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A High Court in Montenegro repealed bail terms for TerraUSD creator Do Kwon and his colleague Han Chang-Joon.</li><li>Do Kwon and his former CFO Han were each granted €400,000 ($437,000) bail in a travel paper forgery case.</li><li>Local prosecutors appealed the decision, arguing that Kwon and his CFO were flight risks.</li><li>The decision will now return to the Basic Court which initially granted bail a day after Kwon&#8217;s lawyers filed the request.</li><li>Authorities in Montenegro, South Korea, and the U.S. continue to debate extradition rights.</li></ul>



<p>Do Kwon and his former CFO Han Chang-Joon will not be granted bail after a Montenegrin High Court overruled a previous approval for their release, per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>.</p>



<p>A Basic Court ruled to release Kwon and Han on May 12 on the condition that both defendants pay €400,000 ($437,000)  in bail. The terms of the release included home arrest pending further court proceedings. </p>



<p>Local prosecutor Haris Šabotić and the State Prosecutor’s Office in the capital Podgorica <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-bail-appealed-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-bail-appealed-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> the decision all the way, arguing that the amount was not enough to guarantee their presence in the country.  Šabotić stressed that the pair were a flight risk.</p>



<p>Kwon&#8217;s attorneys said that the defendants&#8217; spouses would post bail on behalf of the pair and Kwon himself boasted &#8220;average finances&#8221; when asked by the court. Notably, reports said that the Terraform Labs founder withdrew $100 million to a Swiss bank account last year. South Korean authorities also froze over $170 million in assets belonging to the former Terraform CEO. </p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Next For Do Kwon and His CFO? </h2>



<p>According to reports, the decision will return to the Basic Court which initially <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terrausd-do-kwon-granted-bail-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terrausd-do-kwon-granted-bail-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">granted</a> Kwon his bail. It&#8217;s currently unclear how this misalignment between both courts will play out for the former Terra execs. Both Kwon and Han will remain in detention pending a decision from the Montenegrin judiciary. </p>



<p>In the background, authorities from South Korea and the U.S. remain undecided as to who should extradite Do Kwon and charge him for fraud among other claims in the more than $40 billion collapse of Terraform Labs. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A proposal to launch Uniswap&#8217;s third generation DEX or V3 on Fantom&#8217;s blockchain is currently undergoing a &#8220;temperature check&#8221; governance vote.</li><li>The proposal highlighted a market opportunity that could pull in $30-40 million in weekly trading volume while onboarding a scalable network with low transaction fees for users</li><li>Fantom seems next in line of EVM chains eyed by the leading decentralized exchange after expanding to BNB Chain, DeFi&#8217;s second-largest ecosystem by TVL.</li></ul>



<p>The Uniswap DAO is currently considering <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-v3-deployment-to-fantom/21290" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-v3-deployment-to-fantom/21290" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">launching</a> the third iteration of its decentralized exchange protocol on Fantom, a layer 1 blockchain with a proof of stake (PoS) consensus model and Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatibility (EVM).</p>



<p>Uniswap&#8217;s Business Source License (BSL) expired on April 1 and will allow other entities to leverage the V3 design. This opportunity could lead to &#8220;potentially unsafe forks&#8221; of the startup&#8217;s DEX model, the proposal from Blockchain@Columbia in conjunction with Fantom and Axelar noted. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With the expiry of the Uniswap v3 BSL, other DEXs including Beethoven X, are eyeing the opportunity to seize market share on the Fantom chain. In order to stay ahead of the competition, Uniswap must establish its presence on Fantom quickly and efficiently.</p></blockquote>



<p>Fantom&#8217;s low fees and developer-friendly architecture also offer Uniswap users wider access to larger liquidity pools and a basket of DeFi markets. Fantom users will also be able to access DeFi&#8217;s leading blue-chip trading venue and one of crypto&#8217;s most popular protocols. </p>



<p>Axelar, a cross-chain bridge platform that connects multiple blockchain networks, will act as the bridge infrastructure provider. </p>



<h2>Uniswap Expansion Frenzy</h2>



<p>Several proposals to expand Uniswap beyond Ethereum&#8217;s network have emerged in 2023, possibly propelled by the BSL expiry and a strategy to claim greater market share as the leading DEX. A 0XPlasma Labs plan to launch V3 on BNB Chain &#8211; another EVM-compatible network &#8211; was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-community-greenlights-bnb-chain/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-community-greenlights-bnb-chain/" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a> in January. Wormhole was chosen as the bridge provider. </p>



<p>Another proposal to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-launch-v3-polygon-zkevm/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-launch-v3-polygon-zkevm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch V3 on Polygon&#8217;s zero knowledge EVM (zkEVM)</a> garnered massive support from the governance community. </p>

<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has taken issue with a recent report put out by legacy media house Reuters. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-suspend-aud-withdrawal/">Binance</a> has responded to a report from Reuters earlier today, which alleged that the crypto exchange mismanaged customers’ funds and commingled them with the company’s revenue. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance: Reuters Report Written By A Desperate Journalist</strong></h2>



<p>Citing a former insider at Binance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/crypto-binance-money/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reported earlier today that between 2020 and 2021, the crypto exchange commingled customer funds with company revenue. A person with direct knowledge of the exchange’s finances told Reuters that the commingling occurred on a near-daily basis, with the sum running into billions of dollars. The mixing of funds happened in the accounts that the crypto exchange held at the United States-based Silvergate Bank. </p>



<p>While Reuters wasn’t able to independently verify the figures or the frequency of commingling revealed by the former insiders, it did review a bank record from February 2021, which showed that Binance mixed $20 million from a corporate account with $15 million from an account that received customer funds. Reuters accused the crypto exchange of breaching U.S. banking laws by commingling funds and failing to control internal controls to ensure customer funds were clearly identifiable and segregated from company revenues. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Patrick Hillmann, the Chief Communications Officer at Binance, responded to Reuters’ controversial article on <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1660987014626287617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1660987014626287617%7Ctwgr%5Ece7a86ae7c600962020db0968aeea215ef8df4a2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbinance-customer-fund-mismanagement-denial-against-mainstream-reports" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>. Hillmann brushed aside the report as the work of a “desperate journalist” trying to publish a negative story against the crypto exchange. He indicated that Reuters had framed the allegations in such a way that they would be protected from a libel suit. He further accused the media firm of peddling conspiracy theories without backing them up with evidence. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We’ve been very public about where the company had regulatory shortcomings in the past, there’s no reason for a respected news outlet like @Reuters to continue making stuff up.” </p><cite>Patrick Hillmann, Chief Communications Officer, Binance </cite></blockquote>



<p>According to Hillmann, the report by Reuters was based on the fact that when users purchased BUSD (Paxos) from Binance, they were taken to a transaction page that had the term “deposit” on it. He clarified that users were purchasing a stablecoin that was redeemable by Paxos, which was explicitly stated on the website.</p>

<ul><li>FTX CEO John Ray III has been reviewing plans to reboot the bankrupt crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>Ray spent several hours last month finalizing the material related to the exchange’s reboot for distribution to investors.&nbsp;</li><li>A recent court filing revealed that there is a bidder list that likely contains investors interested in FTX 2.0.</li><li>The bankrupt exchange’s native token FTT surged by over 16% following the latest developments.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s defunct crypto exchange is likely going to be restarted by its new management under the leadership of current CEO John Ray III. A recent court filing of a monthly staffing report and compensation for Ray for the month of April 2023 revealed that the Chief Executive has been working on a reboot plan called FTX 2.0 to make the bankrupt exchange operational again.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>FTX CEO Billed $290k For His Services In April 2023</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://t.co/rcSIuyM2YX" rel="nofollow">filing</a> made earlier today with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, John Ray III charged FTX’s bankruptcy estate more than $290,000 for his services. While the majority of his services pertained to day-to-day administrative and legal work, a few activities mentioned in the filing revealed that the CEO had been working on the FTX 2.0 reboot plan. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FTX CEO John Ray III confirms FTX 2.0 plans. <a href="https://t.co/FeCXOvdrt0" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/FeCXOvdrt0</a></p>&mdash; FTX 2.0 Coalition (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1660753728792584195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>These activities included consulting cybersecurity firm Sygnia to fortify the international crypto platform, reviewing a term sheet for the plan restructuring exchange, exploring the next steps for restarting the crypto exchange, as well as reviewing and finalizing the FTX 2.0 material for distribution to investors. Ray also reviewed a summary of steps sent by investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP regarding the 2.0 reboot plan. The CEO remained in constant communication with the investment bank to discuss the reboot plan. throughout the past weekend. </p>



<p>The court filing further revealed that John Ray III had reviewed a list of bidders for FTX 2.0. As previously reported, venture capital firm Tribe Capital <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftt-22-tribe-capital-interest-ftx-reboot/">expressed</a> interest in restarting the bankrupt crypto exchange. The latest development led to a 16% jump in the native token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/" rel="nofollow noopener">FTT</a> price, which reached as high as $1.16 before dropping to its current trading price of $1.08. </p>



<p>Plans regarding a potential restart of the crypto exchange were shared by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in the bankruptcy court last month. At the time, the law firm stated that customer funds would be employed to bring the reboot plan to fruition. Last week, a court filing shared by a creditor on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1659748127304286208" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that exchange was hiring new developers to work on the 2.0 project. </p>

<p>American crypto giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-subscription-service-zero-trading-fees-higher-staking-rewards/">Coinbase</a> has upped its lobbying efforts in the United States by launching a nationwide campaign called “Crypto: America Moving Forward”. The campaign entails a four-fold approach to highlight the importance of cryptocurrency as a technology that will play a key role in modernizing the global financial system. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase’s TV Ads Will Feature CEO Brian Armstrong</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/crypto-moving-america-forward" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Coinbase, the new national campaign will explain the critical role that crypto will play as an underlying technology that will update the global financial system. The crypto exchange highlighted the developments in the blockchain landscape of rival economies like China and how the lack of proper regulation in the United States will lead to unpleasant consequences. The new campaign will also inform the country’s leadership about the national security risk that stems from technology and innovation moving out of the country. </p>



<p>The campaign will begin with a series of four TV ads featuring CEO Brian Armstrong. These ads will air on popular Sunday shows. The crypto exchange will explain the importance of crypto to the viewers through four chapters set to air each weekend. Coinbase will also promote an educational program about the history of money. Additionally, the exchange’s campaign will include a wallscape campaign on Wall Street and a series of messages aired during the NBA playoffs on the need to update the financial system. The exchange will also have an armored truck turned into a mobile billboard, driven around New York to “show how inefficiently money moves today.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Most of the world is embracing this technology now, to update their financial system. And what I fear is that we’re gonna be sitting here in 5 or 10 years and we’re gonna come back to crypto and think about it like we did with 5G or semiconductors.” </p><cite>Brian Armstrong’s TV Campaign.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase will also organize a Stand for Crypto Day, where members of the crypto community will gather in Washington D.C. to advocate for pro-crypto policies and regulations from their political representatives in Congress. The crypto exchange will also host the State of Crypto Summit in New York on June 22, 2023, in collaboration with the Financial Times. The summit will bring together influential players from the traditional financial sector to discuss the various ways in which crypto is being deployed as financial technology.</p>



<p>The recent developments surrounding Coinbase, including the latest nationwide campaign, appear to have reassured its investors. The crypto firm’s share price has gained over 7% in the past 24 hours, reaching as high as $61. The stock (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/coin" rel="nofollow noopener">$COIN</a>) is up nearly 22% since the beginning of May.</p>

<ul><li>The Philippines SEC has issued a warning to Gemini’s recently launched derivatives trading platform.&nbsp;</li><li>The securities regulator has accused the exchange of illegally operating without the necessary registration.&nbsp;</li><li>Filipino investors have been warned to stop investing in Gemini until it obtains the necessary registrations.&nbsp;</li><li>The new derivatives exchange went live earlier this month in 30 countries including the Philippines.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a warning to the Gemini Foundation for operating in the country without proper registration. The securities regulator has accused the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange’s recently launched derivatives trading platform of violating local securities laws by improperly offering securities to Filipino investors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini May Face Severe Penalties For Securities Laws Violation</strong></h2>



<p>An <a href="https://www.sec.gov.ph/advisories-2023/gemini-trust-company-llc/#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow noopener">advisory</a> issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines earlier today took aim at Gemini’s new derivatives exchange. The securities regulator highlighted that the products offered by the platform involved securities, including derivatives like options and futures contracts. The SEC stated that the sale of such products is prohibited in the Philippines without prior registration with the Commission. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>GEMINI TRUST COMPANY, LLC’s lack of prior registration with the Commission makes their activities of offering and/or selling securities in the form of derivatives ILLEGAL in violation of the provisions of the SRC.”</p><cite>Securities and Exchange Commission of Philippines</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC accused Gemini of violating the Securities Regulation Code by offering securities in the Philippines without the necessary license and operating as a broker/dealer without the proper registration. The securities regulator has also taken issue with the derivatives platform’s advertisements of said securities to local investors. The Commission’s advisory urged Filipino traders to not invest their funds in the new derivatives exchange until it obtains the necessary licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Filipino regulator warned Gemini of potential criminal prosecution and a penalty of up to five million pesos ($90,000) or a penalty of 21 years of imprisonment or both. The derivatives exchange went <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/geminis-crypto-derivatives-exchange-live/">live</a> in 30 countries earlier this month, including the Philippines. News of the warning to Gemini came just hours after the top securities regulator of Malaysia publicly reprimanded Huobi Global and initiated enforcement action against the crypto exchange for illegally operating in the country. </p>

<p>According to the announcement <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-to-be-integrated-onto-strike-leading-global-money-app/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-to-be-integrated-onto-strike-leading-global-money-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the collaboration will address liquidity concerns stifling payments markets and motivate broader adoption of digital currencies, particularly stablecoins. CTO Paolo Ardoino added that the integration will ensure greater financial inclusion as Strike recently expanded to 65 additional countries. </p>



<p>The Strike mobile payments app was only available in a handful of countries like the U.S. and El Salvador. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By combining the stability and utility of Tether&#8217;s digital currency with Strike&#8217;s innovative payment solutions, users will experience a new era of secure and efficient transactions. This collaboration signifies a significant leap toward mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it addresses several key challenges faced by the industry.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Tether&#8217;s Bitcoin Bag</h2>



<p>The Strike integration comes on the back of the company&#8217;s Bitcoin accumulation strategy for its stablecoin reserves. At the end of Q1 2023 in March, Tether&#8217;s quarterly attestation revealed that the company held a massive $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, along with other assets like Gold and short-term treasury bills. </p>



<p>In addition, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-700-m-profit-commercial-paper/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-700-m-profit-commercial-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether</a> said it would start buying more Bitcoin starting in May. The company will allocate 15% of net realized operating profits toward strengthening its BTC reserve. The extra Bitcoin will serve as an extra cushion to USDT&#8217;s reserves that the payments company claims are 100% backed. </p>
