			            <description><![CDATA[The investigation launched by the CFTC in the wake of Celsius’ collapse has concluded, and a lawsuit may be in the wings.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three days after Celsius imploded on the 13th of July 2022, the CFTC, swiftly followed by the SEC, launched separate investigations into the crypto platform’s business practices.</p>
<p>The company was also investigated – and in some cases sued – separately by local <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/celsius-engaged-in-an-unregistered-securities-offering-alleged-vermonts-financial-regulator/" data-wpel-link="internal">authorities</a> in Vermont, New York, and elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I&#8217;m suing the former CEO of cryptocurrency platform <a href="https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@CelsiusNetwork</a> for defrauding investors out of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Alex Mashinsky lied to people about the risks of investing in Celsius, hid its deteriorating financial condition, and failed to register in New York.</p>
<p>— NY AG James (@NewYorkStateAG) <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1611023481285578752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">January 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Charges brought against Celsius by the CFTC, however, would likely be federal.</p>
<h2>Celsius Misled Investors, Says Confidential CFTC Source</h2>
<p>The CFTC’s investigation has now concluded, and individuals within the organization have said that both Alex Mashinsky and his platform misled investors and ignored existing regulations, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/cftc-probe-concludes-crypto-lender-celsius-ex-ceo-mashinsky-broke-rules" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>These allegations are aligned with those posited by NYAG Letitia James, who accused Mashinsky of deliberately making false claims regarding his firm’s financial situation to woo investors.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin. The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. […] My office will stay vigilant and ensure that bad actors trying to take advantage of New York investors are held accountable.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In turn, Mashinsky retorted that the New York Attorney General “fundamentally misunderstood” both Celsius’ business model and the role he played as CEO.</p>
<p>However, the organization itself has so far refused to officially comment on the matter. The sources from within the organization also refrained from specifying which regulations Celsius and Mashinsky broke specifically, outside of failing to register with the relevant authorities.</p>
<h2>Lawsuit Possible by the End of July</h2>
<p>Now that the investigation has concluded, the CFTC will reportedly host an internal vote on what to do with the information they’ve uncovered.</p>
<p>If a majority of CFTC commissioners agree with the interpretation of the research teams’ findings, a federal lawsuit may be filed against Celsius and, very likely, against Mashinsky himself. According to the confidential source, the gavel may drop no later than the end of July, assuming nobody decides to play devil’s advocate within the Commission.</p>
<p>Should the case be brought before a federal court, it would be the latest in a series of over 85 cases filed by the CFTC concerning digital assets. So far, the agency has been the reason for over $4 billion in penalties and restitutions sourced from fraudulent crypto markets, said CFTC director Rostin Benham.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[A majority of Aave token holders have voed in favor of the governance proposal.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Aave proposal took place to decide the fate of $3 million in the protocol&#8217;s treasury.</p>
<p>The holders of the Aave tokens will be voting on a governance proposal on whether 1,600 Ether, worth around $3 million, in the DeFi protocol treasury will be converted to wrapped staked ether (wstETH) and rocket pool ether (rETH).</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=261" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">proposal</a>, created on July 3rd, has received 252,152 affirmative votes out of a required 320,000 at the time of publication. Aave token holders have until July 7th to vote.</li>
<li>For the uninitiated, wrapped Staked Ether (WETH) and Rocket Pool Ether (rETH) are examples of staking derivatives that enable market participants to earn staking rewards.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Aave DAO currently holds 1,786.51 awETH (v2) and 104.548 units of ETH in the Collector Contract. The awETH deposit yield in Aave v2 earns 1.69%, relative to 3.8% with wstETH and 3.13% with rETH. This AIP converts all the unproductive ETH balance, along with aWETH (v2 and v3) into the same amounts of wstETH and rETH.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Aave&#8217;s native token, AAVE, has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/aave-explodes-25-daily-eth-pushes-above-1-9k-market-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">recovered</a> significantly alongside the broader digital assets market over the past three weeks.</li>
<li>It was up by more than 22% over the past week alone and was currently trading at $74.95.</li>
<li>According to the latest <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/aave?tvl=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> compiled by DefiLlama, Aave&#8217;s TVL increased by nearly 60% from $3.74 billion in January to the press time value of $5.98 billion.</li>
<li>While the recovery has been notable, Aave&#8217;a TVL was down by nearly 70% from its ATH of nearly $20 billion in October 2021.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto exchanges in South Africa could face enforcement action they fail to obtain a license with the country's financial regulator by the end of the year.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">South Africa&#8217;s financial regulator has asked exchanges operating in the country to obtain a license before the end of 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto firms who fail to adhere to the directive before the deadline could be fined or have their businesses closed down by authorities.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">New Licensing Regime in South Africa</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/south-africa-to-require-crypto-exchanges-licensing-by-year-end?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">required</a> crypto exchanges in South Africa to secure a license before the November 30 deadline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to FSCA Commissioner Unathi Kamlana, about 20 firms have applied since the watchdog first opened the licensing process a few weeks ago, while expecting more companies to file an application before the deadline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In October 2022, the FSCA <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/Regulatory%20Frameworks/Temp/Policy%20Document%20supporting%20the%20Declaration%20of%20crypto%20assets%20as%20a%20financial%20product.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">declared</a> crypto a financial product after a declaration proposal in November 2022 and a consultation on the draft regulation. Also, the publication of the final declaration mentioned that crypto exchanges in South Africa must be licensed by the end of 2023. Defaulters could be fined 10 million rands ($536,387), face 10 years in prison, or suffer both consequences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the FSCA proposed a four-month window for crypto businesses to submit their license applications, some commentators believed the time frame was insufficient, with some comments suggesting six months and another two years. The financial watchdog, in response, extended the license application period to six months in the final declaration, stating that it was not necessary and unjustified.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">South Africa&#8217;s High-Profile Crypto Scams</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The South African regulator, meanwhile, maintains that the crypto asset industry is risky, with Kamlana stating that &#8220;it is an area where you can lose quite a bit of money, so you must think twice before exposing yourself to it.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The African country, which has seen an increased interest in the asset class, has also experienced some high-profile cryptocurrency scams causing investors losses worth billions of dollars. In June 2021, the founders of South African crypto investment platform Africrypt, the Cajee brothers, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-major-crypto-scam-in-south-africa-two-brothers-and-69000-btc-have-vanished-together/" data-wpel-link="internal">allegedly made away</a> with nearly 70,000 BTC (worth over $2 billion).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, Johannes Steynberg, CEO of the international multi-level marketing scheme Mirror Trading International (MTI), reportedly disappeared with 29,000 bitcoin in customer funds. Following his <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/man-behind-29000-bitcoin-ponzi-scam-is-arrested-in-brazil/" data-wpel-link="internal">arrest</a> in Brazil, a US court recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-african-ceo-ordered-to-pay-a-record-3-4-billion-penalty-in-cftc-bitcoin-fraud-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">ordered</a> Steynberg to pay a penalty worth $3.4 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kamlana further said the FSCA introduced consumer protection measures which include awareness about crypto products and financial education.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the FSCA Commissioner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework. Time will tell the effectiveness of our measures, and we will continue to work together with the industry to refine and make changes where and if necessary.”</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The teens deceived the victim by pretending to be Coinbase's support team. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two teenage boys from Hamilton, Ontario, have been busted for allegedly stealing over $4 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) from an American man through what authorities described as a &#8220;spear phishing attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/crypto-teens-charged-1.6896349" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">local reports</a>, Hamilton police started working with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force to investigate the boys in June 2023.</p>
<h2>A Spear Phishing Attack</h2>
<p>Const. Krista-Lee Ernst of the Hamilton police noted that the boys, both 17 years old, used a spear phishing attack to deceive their victim into giving them $4.2 million in crypto.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-giveaway-twitter-scam-caused-by-a-phone-spear-phishing-attack/" data-wpel-link="internal">A spear phishing attack</a> is a targeted form of phishing used by scammers to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data. Unlike traditional phishing attacks that cast a wide net, spear phishing attacks are highly personalized and tailored to specific individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>In a spear phishing attack, the bad actor conducts thorough research to gather information about the target, such as their name, position, company, colleagues, or even personal details from social media platforms. With such information, the scammer can craft compelling and customized emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source, such as a colleague, supervisor, or a reputable organization the target is associated with.</p>
<p>In the case of the Hamilton teens, the duo, known by their fake aliases &#8220;Felon&#8221; and &#8220;Gaze,&#8221; pretended to be members of the support team of the popular American crypto exchange Coinbase. They aimed to take over the man&#8217;s crypto account on the exchange.</p>
<h2>Over $13 Million Seized</h2>
<p>After successfully gaining control of the account, the boys were able to access the man&#8217;s digital assets stored on the platform.</p>
<p>According to the police, the teens spent some of the funds to purchase the Instagram username &#8220;@zombie,&#8221; a rare username in the gaming community. Police also seized at least $13.4 million worth of digital assets after they were caught.</p>
<p>Although authorities initially arrested both teens, only one was charged with theft of over $5,000 and possession of property or proceeds acquired through criminal means, while the other was released.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inception of blockchain technology started a revolutionary wave of disruptive innovation across many industries, transforming the way we perceive, interact with, and conduct business. With its robust security, decentralization, and smart contract functionalities, blockchain&#8217;s reach goes beyond the conventional financial and supply chain sectors to many other industries — like real estate, healthcare, and, notably, betting.</p>
<p>Enter the world of Chancer, a new entrant that is leveraging the unparalleled potential of blockchain to catapult the betting industry into the future. The Chancer presale is now live, offering a golden opportunity for those who recognize the massive potential this innovative platform holds.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258561" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.png" alt="Picture1" width="468" height="234" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.png 468w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<h2>Why is Blockchain so Important for Betting?</h2>
<p>The betting industry has often been criticized for its lack of transparency, questionable fairness, and the influence of a central authority, but with the advent of blockchain, these industry problems are being rectified. This technology, characterized by its transparent, secure, and decentralized nature, is an ideal fit for betting scenarios. It ensures fairness, reduces the potential for manipulation, and promises enhanced user trust — aspects that have been missing from traditional betting systems.</p>
<p>The Kelbie brothers, founders of Chancer, have astutely recognized these opportunities, and their project has arrived just as the blockchain revolution is gathering momentum, placing them in a prime position to reshape the betting industry. Chancer, with its innovative concept of a decentralized predictions market, is demonstrating the enormous transformative power of blockchain.</p>
<p>This presale phase represents an opportunity for investors and tech enthusiasts alike to join the blockchain revolution, specifically in the world of betting. As experts delve deeper into the nature of Chancer, they are discovering its unique approach to betting and its potential, showing why this platform is set to shake things up.</p>
<h2>What is Chancer?</h2>
<p><a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=cryptopotato" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Chancer</a> is an innovative, decentralized predictive markets app and is making waves in the fast-paced blockchain revolution. This platform is revolutionizing the world of crypto by introducing the concept of a decentralized predictions market to a global audience, and by doing so, Chancer is shaking up the betting industry and empowering users with the freedom to create their own betting markets.</p>
<p>In a departure from the traditional betting house model, Chancer allows its users to participate in and create custom betting scenarios. These scenarios can range from predictions on globally significant events, such as the World Cup or the US presidential elections, to smaller personal wagers within your social group. This unconventional and disruptive approach sets Chancer apart and paves the way for a fair and unbiased betting environment.</p>
<p>The peer-to-peer (P2P) nature of Chancer eliminates the need for a traditional bookmaker, creating an environment where all users have equal opportunities and, with plans to transition into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Chancer becomes even more enticing for investors, especially during the current presale phase.</p>
<h2>How Does Chancer Work?</h2>
<p>At the core of the Chancer platform is CHANCER, the utility token that drives all transactions within the ecosystem. Users place their bets using CHANCER tokens and when they win, their winnings are also paid out in CHANCER, exemplifying its user-friendly design with this streamlined process.</p>
<p>As the Chancer platform gains traction and attracts more users to its novel betting model, the demand for CHANCER tokens is expected to increase. This surge in demand during the platform&#8217;s expansion phase creates an environment ripe for potential token price growth, so investors who participate in the Chancer presale could see massive returns as user numbers start to increase.</p>
<p>The journey towards becoming a DAO aims to add incentives for CHANCER holders, as they will be granted voting rights in proportion to their token holdings, allowing them to influence the platform&#8217;s future through proposals and votes on key decisions. This additional benefit is designed to encourage the long-term holding of CHANCER tokens.</p>
<p>In the crowded arena of crypto investments, CHANCER presents a compelling case. The buzz surrounding the Chancer presale reflects the growing recognition of its potential.</p>
<h2>Can CHANCER Lead the Blockchain Betting Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Chancer project has made a compelling entry into the blockchain betting arena and,, with its innovative use of blockchain technology, Chancer has introduced an element of transparency and creativity that looks set to reshape the betting industry.</p>
<p>While the platform has demonstrated its potential, its ability to sustain momentum and adapt to an ever-evolving market will be crucial, but with such a skilled team in place, early users seem likely to have a fantastic journey ahead of them.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC)’s smallest holders are deploying money into the asset at a record pace this month, reflecting a sense of shared optimism across the Bitcoin market in 2023.</p>
<p>On-chain data shows that “shrimps” – Bitcoin addresses holding less than 1 BTC – haven’t accumulated this aggressively in nearly six years.</p>
<h2>Small Holders Stack Their Sats</h2>
<p>According to Lead Glassnode Analyst James Check on Twitter, shrimps are currently <a href="https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1676498354359111681" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">accumulating</a> an average of 33,800 BTC per month. That’s more than the number of new BTC issued by the network each month, which is 27,000 BTC.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For every 1 new coin, Shrimp are taking 1.25 off the market,” wrote Check. “Crazy conviction on display.”</p></blockquote>
<p>https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1676498354359111681</p>
<p>In BTC terms, the fastest accumulation phase for shrimps remains the post-FTX-panic period, when Bitcoin’s price dropped to a 4-year low of $15,500. However, in dollar terms, Check noted that Shrimps are buying Bitcoin at the fastest rate seen since the peak of the 2017 bull market.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Five years later, they are stacking harder, faster, and in a more sustained manner, despite all the bullshit,” he continued. “Bullish.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin “crabs” – entities holdings between 1 and 10 BTC – are gathering an additional 22,400 BTC per month, making for another 83% of the mined supply. In May 2023, the number of addresses holding over 1 BTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nearly-1-million-blockchain-addresses-now-hold-over-1-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">surpassed</a> 1 million for the first time.</p>
<p>Comparisons to mined supply are relevant for those who believe Bitcoin’s halving – an event that cuts Bitcoin’s supply issuance rate in half every four years – is chiefly responsible for the asset’s notorious 4-year price cycle.</p>
<p>The next halving occurs in April 2024 – though some analysts <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-much-money-does-it-take-to-moon-bitcoin-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">don’t believe</a> it will necessarily catalyze another bull market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin’s Bullish Indicators</h2>
<p>In prior reports this year, Glassnode analysts have pointed to an “ongoing transfer of wealth from investors with high time preferences towards HODLers.” According to the firm, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-hodlers-increase-at-a-record-pace-santiment/" data-wpel-link="internal">over 50%</a> of all BTC in circulation hadn’t changed hands in over two years as of this April.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s price may be reflecting some of these shifting undercurrents, having appreciated 83% this year, and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dominance-soars-to-2-year-high-as-btc-maintains-26k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">reclaimed</a> crypto market dominance above 50%.</p>
<p>Analysts are granting the market <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-the-sec-approve-a-bitcoin-spot-etf-in-2023-lawyer-breaks-down-the-odds/" data-wpel-link="internal">significant odds</a> of getting a Bitcoin Spot ETF past the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year, which is expected to welcome more money into the asset.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[While still supporting other cryptos, CZ said he has a personal passion for Bitcoin.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) explained on Wednesday why Binance spends time supporting cryptocurrencies and blockchains beyond those it chiefly develops.</p>
<p>While the executive remained optimistic about the BNB Chain ecosystem, he said that he personally is a “heavy promoter of Bitcoin (BTC).”</p>
<h2>Are Binance’s Blockchain Centralized?</h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpKkgZnELjKj?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">AMA</a> hosted over Twitter on Wednesday, a questioner raised concerns that the “Binance Blockchain” isn’t being promoted by its namesake company and that many crypto users view it as a “shitcoin.”</p>
<p>CZ explained that Binance would prefer that its many child networks – including BNB Beacon Chain, BNB Smart Chain, and an upcoming “greenfield” chain – remain independent, and decentralized.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Anything associated with Binance is often accused, wrongly, of being too centralized,” he said. “We’re caught in between. We could give a lot more support, or we could let them run on their own.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The “decentralization” of Binance’s blockchains came under scrutiny last year after Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was hacked for $600 million in BNB. The network <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-smart-chain-paused-following-600-million-bnb-hack-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">collaborated</a> with roughly a dozen service providers to freeze the blockchain and stop any more money from escaping at the time, thanking them for their “quick and attentive response.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/gxy3yd8odg" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/gxy3yd8odg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; iNil (@lnil) <a href="https://twitter.com/lnil/status/1578152799858065408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">October 6, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Bitcoin as a Safe Haven</h2>
<p>Amid such scrutiny, CZ said Binance prefers letting such networks be &#8220;independent&#8221; and treating “all blockchains on an equal basis” from the perspective of its exchange business.</p>
<p>“We promote Ethereum. I promote Bitcoin very heavily myself,” said CZ, while still voicing support for BNB – Binance’s native exchange token.</p>
<p>Earlier in the discussion, the executive noted that “blockchain technology” is used worldwide for both fundraising and as a “safe haven asset” by a “dedicated group of people,” possibly numbering in the hundreds of millions. “Especially Bitcoin,” he added, “[and] some of the top crypto assets.”</p>
<p>Demand for Bitcoin surged in March withdrawal panic swept across the major regional banks in the United States, indicating some level of market recognition for Bitcoin as an insurance policy against macroeconomic failures. The asset’s correlation to stocks tapped a two-year low in June.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1674801784550768640</p>
<p>Last month, Binance <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/keep-building-binance-starts-running-bitcoin-lightning-network-nodes/" data-wpel-link="internal">confirmed</a> that it is setting up nodes to support Bitcoin’s layer 2 lightning network. The nodes will help facilitate cheaper and fast BTC withdrawals from the exchange.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Cuban thinks the SEC should have required "the separation of customer and business funds and clear wallet requirements" to prevent investor losses.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The prominent American businessman, TV personality, investor, and owner of the Dallas Mavericks &#8211; Mark Cuban &#8211; lambasted the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for choosing &#8220;the wrong path&#8221; to regulate crypto. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He believes its approach has been one reason why FTX investors in America have parted with substantial sums. On the other hand, he praised the actions of the Japanese regulators, outlining that &#8220;no one in FTX Japan lost money.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cuban Goes on the Offensive</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Billionaire Mark Cuban is the latest person to bash America&#8217;s securities regulator. In one of his recent tweets, he </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1676258204924407808" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">blamed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> it for not setting appropriate standards in the cryptocurrency industry and thus triggering colossal investor losses:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;If the USA/SEC had followed their example by setting clear regulations that required the separation of customer and business funds and clear wallet requirements, NO ONE HERE WOULD HAVE LOST MONEY ON FTX.&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He went further, claiming the SEC has picked the &#8220;wrong course&#8221; by turning its back on the cryptocurrency sector. The regulator is &#8220;not infallible,&#8221; it &#8220;makes mistakes,&#8221; and &#8220;was arrogant&#8221; in thinking that its rules have covered every possible situation, he concluded.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cuban believes Japan is among the countries that have introduced a comprehensive regulatory framework on crypto. According to him, those efforts have protected local investors from the devastating impact of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">the FTX meltdown</a>. Recall that the Japanese subsidiary of the once-leading cryptocurrency exchange </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftx-japan-allow-asset-withdrawals-starting-tuesday-2023-02-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allowed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> asset withdrawals at the end of February. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stark&#8217;s Reaction</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">John Reed Stark &#8211; President of John Reed Stark Consulting LLC and a former executive at the US SEC &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1676284150037225487" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">thinks</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> blaming the watchdog for catastrophes such as FTX, Celsius Network, Terra, and more &#8220;seems a bit of a stretch.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also reminded Cuban that the Commission has saved &#8220;millions, perhaps even billions&#8221; in investor crypto-losses. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For one, it stopped Telegram from scamming individuals with an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO), prevented BlockFi from &#8220;doing to its investors what Celsius did to theirs (and fined them $100M),&#8221; and halted Coinbase from selling a crypto-lending product. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stark believes the digital asset sector is an &#8220;anarchical financial industry&#8221; with no insurance, cybersecurity standards, and licensing program, making the SEC&#8217;s job quite difficult. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also claimed that the crypto community is hard to be pleased with since they reject and find flaws in each proposed legislation:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;For example, whenever any government law, rule, or regulation gets specific about crypto, crypto lobbying groups protest and file interminable lawsuits challenging the action.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Launched just weeks ago, PEPE 2.0 brought at least one anonymous trader a spectacular ROI.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The demand for Pepe Coin ROI is insatiable. 2.0 knockoffs have already racked up enormous gains in July. As Pepe 2.0 rallied through the roof on Ethereum during the last week in June, one trader made $175,000 in just a day of riveting profit-taking.</p>
<p>Due to the relative anonymity of Web 3.0 users, we don&#8217;t know who the mystery trader is. But they left their tracks all over the blockchain. The on-chain transaction data tells the entire story.</p>
<p>Using the popular decentralized exchange, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-to-use-uniswap-guide-and-must-read-risks-before-swapping/" data-wpel-link="internal">Uniswap</a>, the crypto trader locked in 8.3T Pepe 2.0 tokens on June 28 at 8 am for $900.</p>
<p>They got into Pepe 2.0 at the right time.</p>
<h2>Pepe 2.0 Melt-up Earns Trader $175,000 in a Day</h2>
<p>Just ten hours later, from June 28, 6 pm until 3 am the following morning, this hero began selling. The project heated up <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-2-0/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">so fast</a> that they were able to sell PEPE2 back to the market in cool 2ETH increments 43 times.</p>
<p>As Pepe 2.0 really started to melt up, this trader&#8217;s activity peaked in their final two hours of trading. From 1 am to 3 am early June 29, they sold the alt-right altcoin for 2ETH every three to seven minutes.</p>
<p>In total, this stunningly profitable caper earned a 19,400% ROI on a $900 investment in under 24 hours. That&#8217;ll put some pep in anyone&#8217;s portfolio if not their step.</p>
<p>A 100x altcoin gem hunter, Dami-Defi, <a href="https://twitter.com/DamiDefi/status/1674719460790358016" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">remarked</a> on this Pepe 2.0 trade:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This might be the cleanest entry and exit I’ve seen a while!</p>
<p>This #crypto wallet got into #PEPE2 before anyone had heard about it.</p>
<p>Turning $900 to $176k in less than 24hrs!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a tweet thread, Dami-Defi offered some advice for when making these kinds of trades. &#8220;If you don’t have a strategy, greed won’t allow you to take profit, and you’ll most likely end up losing all your profit to the market,&#8221; they averred.</p>
<p>So what they do instead is wait for a new position to 2x &#8211; 3x, then pull out their principal sum to &#8220;get your money back.&#8221; After that, they take profits each time the asset posts another 100% gain.</p>
<h2>Background on PEPE Coin</h2>
<p>An ERC-20 PEPE token launched in April this year went parabolic the first week in May. By May 10, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-coin-explodes-1200-weekly-while-crypto-markets-stagnate-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">PEPE was</a> &#8220;the number one cryptocurrency by means of overall market performance, acquiring a market capitalization upwards of $1 billion in less than three weeks.&#8221;</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Verge ($XVG) has recently exploded with a staggering 380% surge, sparking curiosity among traders about its prospects.</p>
<p>Given its impressive rise, many are now wondering whether $XVG will continue pumping – or whether its momentum is only temporary.</p>
<p>However, Verge isn’t the only crypto catching the attention, with Wall Street Memes ($WSM) and Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA) also on traders’ radar.</p>
<h2>Verge’s Remarkable Surge Puts Spotlight on “Dinosaur Coins”</h2>
<p>Verge is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that focuses on privacy and security, aiming to provide completely anonymous transactions.</p>
<p>Originating in 2014 as DogeCoinDark and rebranded as Verge in 2016, this early crypto player has carved out its niche by offering a level of safety beyond what many in the market offer.</p>
<p>This is achieved by obfuscating the IP addresses and locations of the participants in each transaction.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258832" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-4.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="287" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-4-300x143.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-4-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, Verge’s unique multi-algorithm Proof-of-Work (PoW) system diversifies mining access to ensure fair rewards distribution – making it more democratic than most other PoW cryptos.</p>
<p>These factors are providing the platform for $XVG to stage an incredible comeback, with the token’s price up 380% in the past seven days.</p>
<p>According to one CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/64a4319202407c748bac13cd/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">community member</a>, this increase is part of a broader trend where older cryptos, also known as &#8220;dinosaur coins,&#8221; are becoming more prominent.</p>
<p>This certainly appears to be the case, with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/verge" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a> revealing that $249 million worth of $XVG was traded in the past 24 hours alone – higher than Polygon ($MATIC) and Cardano ($ADA).</p>
<h2>XVG Lays Foundation for Growth Thanks To Privacy-Focused Approach</h2>
<p>Now that Verge is on an explosive uptrend, many in the crypto community question whether the token can sustain its meteoric rise.</p>
<p>The key to Verge’s endurance lies in its unique offering – with privacy and security as its pillars, Verge delivers a product that’s becoming increasingly sought after in a world grappling with data infringements.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258831" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-5.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="244" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-5-300x122.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-5-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, the revival of the aforementioned dinosaur coins is the real shift in the market.</p>
<p>Coins like Litecoin ($LTC) and Bitcoin SV ($BSV) have been soaring lately, fueled by investors looking to rediscover the value in these established but under-the-radar cryptos.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the resurgence in these projects could indicate a new era in the market – one that looks set to benefit Verge tremendously.</p>
<h2>Which Other Coins Could Be Set to Surge?</h2>
<p>While Verge is currently dominating the spotlight, traders remain actively looking for emerging altcoins that might match or surpass the momentum.</p>
<p>Two noteworthy contenders in this regard are Wall Street Memes and Ecoterra, which have been generating significant buzz during their ongoing presale phases.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Draws Influencer Support Amid Presale Buzz</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=this-is-why-the-verge-coin-price-has-exploded-could-wall-street-memes-and-ecoterra-pump-next" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is a brand-new meme coin that benefits from a strong community foundation, with a network that extends to over 1.1 million followers across various social media platforms.</p>
<p>This thriving community is a crucial pillar of the project, driving engagement and drawing people into the official <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<p>What makes the community particularly noteworthy is its capacity for generating hilarious content surrounding financial markets – particularly cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>This has created an environment for the $WSM token to thrive, leading to over $12.6 million being raised through the project&#8217;s presale.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258830" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-5.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="291" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-5-300x145.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-5-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Notably, Wall Street Memes has also managed to attract high-profile personalities to the project.</p>
<p>Leading influencers like <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCryptoJamie" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto Jamie</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aaron_cryptonoob?_t=8dT7rgz3ikE&amp;_r=1" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aaron CryptoNoob</a> have joined as brand ambassadors, lending their credibility and reach to the project.</p>
<p>Moreover, a yet-to-be-revealed third ambassador role has led to intrigue from investors – further enhancing the buzz around Wall Street Memes.</p>
<p>With Wall Street Memes&#8217; presale now in Stage 21 out of 30, investors only have a limited time to purchase $WSM before the token&#8217;s CEX debut.</p>
<p>Currently, tokens are priced at just $0.031 – although this price will only last for a few days before it increases in the subsequent stage.</p>

<h2>Ecoterra Harnesses Ethereum Blockchain for Sustainable Change</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_d432f031.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=this-is-why-the-verge-coin-price-has-exploded-could-wall-street-memes-and-ecoterra-pump-next" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA)</a> is a visionary blockchain project that aims to promote positive climate change action.</p>
<p>Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this new project utilizes the $ECOTERRA token to reward users for eco-friendly actions.</p>
<p>Ecoterra’s innovative Recyle2Earn app incentivizes waste reduction through tokenized rewards for recycling via Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs).</p>
<p>In addition, a novel carbon offset marketplace facilitates the reduction of carbon footprints by purchasing verified offsets using $ECOTERRA (or other tokens).</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258829" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-3.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="381" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-3.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-3-300x190.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-3-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, Ecoterra isn’t stopping there – per the <a href="https://www.ecoterra.io/documents/whitepaper-ecoterra.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, the project will even offer a recycled materials marketplace for providing a platform where businesses can trade recycled resources.</p>
<p>Ecoterra has already established partnerships with industry leaders such as Verra, making it a project worth watching.</p>
<p>Currently, Ecoterra’s presale is in its final stage, where investors have a narrow window to purchase $ECOTERRA for just $0.01 – while also receiving a 10% token bonus.</p>
