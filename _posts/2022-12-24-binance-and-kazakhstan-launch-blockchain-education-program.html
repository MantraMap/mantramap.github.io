<p>Binance has partnered with Kazakhstan state organisations to launch a country-wide blockchain education program. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance this week announced an initiative to qualify university students in the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan to be able to work in the industry. The exchange entered into an agreement with the government of Kazakhstan to add blockchain courses to the curriculum of higher education institutions across the country. The education program is a trading platform that will prepare and equip more than 40,000 students by 2026 with blockchain training at universities and institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>According to a press release from Binance, the exchange is collaborating on the initiative with the Blockchain Center research lab that was established by the Center for the Development of Payment and Financial Technologies of the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), the Astana International Financial Centre, the Ministry of Digital Development, and the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Binance entered into a memorandum of cooperation with the above-mentioned organizations and per these agreements, will provide educational materials and support for a basic course on blockchain. The announcement highlights the fact that Kazakhstan now becomes one of the first countries in the world to offer a blockchain program to its educational programs at universities.</p>
Binance Expands into Business in Kazakhstan
<p>Binance has been eagerly expanding its operations into the Central Asian nation. The educational initiative comes from a meeting between Binance CEO Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao and Kazakhstani President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev earlier in the year. In October, the exchange was granted a permanent license by Kazakhstan&rsquo;s AIFC Financial Service Authority to operate as a digital asset platform and provide custody service at the Astana International Financial Center. By receiving this license, Binance now has the status of a regulated platform in the country.</p>
<p>Asia Regional Head at Binance, Gleb Kostarev said:</p>

<p>We support Kazakhstan&rsquo;s goal to become a leading player in digital technologies which would not be possible without increasing education and blockchain adoption around the country. Binance has always valued education, and Binance Academy is one of the largest learning hubs in the blockchain industry. Our partnership with Kazakhstan state organizations is another step in bringing accessible and standard-setting blockchain and crypto education to all.</p>
