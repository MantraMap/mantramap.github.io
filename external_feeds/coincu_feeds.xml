<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korean prosecutors bring 49 suspects to trial for illegal foreign exchange outflows and $305 million in profits from virtual asset speculation using the &#8220;Kimchi Premium.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>Speculators exploited the Kimchi Premium phenomenon, with domestic virtual asset prices exceeding overseas markets, leading to unfair gains.</em></li>



<li><em>Financial firms and employees are implicated in condoning illicit foreign exchange outflows as authorities intensify efforts to prevent wealth outflow and protect investors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a bid to curb illegal foreign exchange outflows and combat virtual asset speculation, South Korean prosecutors have brought 49 suspects to trial. The suspects are believed to have profited a staggering 390 billion won (approximately $305 million) by exploiting the so-called &#8220;Kimchi Premium,&#8221; <em>News1</em> <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/?5119578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>The crackdown, which began in August 2022, has been a joint effort by the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Customs Office, and the Financial Supervisory Service. Their main target has been speculators who took advantage of the <a href="https://coincu.com/155933-seoul-prosecutors-kimchi-premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kimchi Premium</a> phenomenon, wherein the domestic virtual asset market price surpassed that of overseas markets. This trend emerged amid a surge in domestic virtual asset investments.</p>



<p>Prosecutors uncovered a sophisticated scheme employed by the speculators. They allegedly sent foreign virtual assets to domestic paper companies for sale, subsequently remitting 13 trillion won (approximately $10 million) of false trade proceeds overseas. This maneuver allowed them to capitalize on the Kimchi Premium and reap substantial transaction profits. Based on Bitcoin&#8217;s historical Kimchi Premium average of 3-5% over the past two years, these speculators managed to amass at least $305 million in illicit gains.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the prosecution brought seven employees from a financial firm to trial for their involvement in facilitating these illicit foreign exchange outflows. Despite being aware of the speculators&#8217; falsified data, the employees reportedly continued to leak large amounts of foreign currency in exchange for cash and luxury watches, enabling the illegal activities to persist.</p>



<p>Additionally, two financial companies found guilty of failing to monitor and prevent the illegal outflow of foreign exchange, ranging from tens of millions to trillions of won, also faced legal consequences under the penalty clause.</p>

<p>The prosecution, in its announcement on the matter, emphasized its commitment to taking stringent measures against speculative trading of virtual assets that lead to the outflow of national wealth and harm honest investors. By holding the suspects accountable and pursuing justice, authorities aim to send a clear message that such exploitative practices will not be tolerated in the country.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Italian asset manager Azimut hit by BlackCat ransomware attack.</em></li>



<li><em>Attack did not affect client data but resulted in data theft of over 500GB.</em></li>



<li><em>Attack highlights increasing threat of cybercrime faced by businesses worldwide.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://www.azimut-group.com/en/azimut-group" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.azimut-group.com/en/azimut-group" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azimut</a>, an Italian asset manager, announced that it had been subjected to a BlackCat cyber attack. </strong></h5>

<p>The attack did not result in any harm to the data of its clients. According to reports by Israeli hacking monitoring startup, DarkFeed, the attack was orchestrated by BlackCat, the same ransomware group that had previously stolen significant amounts of data from the state-owned Italian energy services firm GSE in September. The attack on Azimut was carried out on July 21 and was listed as one of BlackCat&#8217;s 477 victims. However, the company had no immediate comment on the attack.</p>

<p>BlackCat, also known as ALPHV, first emerged in late 2021 and has since launched sophisticated attacks on many companies in the US and Europe. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, a Californian cybersecurity firm, also confirmed that BlackCat was behind the attack on Azimut. According to Palo Alto, the hackers claimed to have stolen more than 500GB of confidential data from Azimut. The attack on Azimut is one of 23 similar attacks that occurred in July alone.</p>



<p>Based on its leak site tracking, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 revealed that BlackCat is the second most active multi-extortion ransomware group after LockBit. The hackers have targeted a variety of industries, including law firms, engineering firms, health care systems, and manufacturing, among others.</p>



<p>In a statement, Azimut reassured its clients that the attack did not compromise their personal data or information that could allow access to their financial position or the execution of unauthorized transactions. The company has reported the unauthorized access to its IT systems to the relevant authorities and has successfully limited the impact of the attack through its internal safety procedures.</p>

<p>Despite the company&#8217;s proactive measures, the attack on Azimut highlights the increasing threat of cybercrime faced by businesses worldwide. Companies must remain vigilant and take appropriate measures to protect their systems and data from potential cyber threats.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) announced the launch of &#8220;Made by Apes,&#8221; an innovative on-chain license application platform in collaboration with SaaSy Labs.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform enables NFT creators and users to obtain unique licenses for their products, providing BAYC authenticity verification and distinguishing genuine BAYC &amp; MAYC holders&#8217; creations.</em></li>



<li><em>The initiative showcases BAYC&#8217;s commitment to its vibrant community of builders and sets a new industry standard, ensuring a more secure and transparent NFT ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a groundbreaking move, the renowned NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) recently unveiled &#8220;Made by Apes,&#8221; a cutting-edge on-chain license application platform.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>This unprecedented initiative, developed in partnership with SaaSy Labs, a leading blockchain-based legal contract solutions developer, promises to revolutionize the NFT space with its on-chain record and identification functionalities, including BAYC authenticity verification.</p>



<p>The official announcement made by BAYC on their Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC/status/1683594162908610560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> the world to this game-changing platform. By leveraging the capabilities of Made by Apes, NFT creators and users alike can now effortlessly obtain licenses via the application page.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to introduce this first-of-its-kind on-chain licensing for a club full of builders, done in partnership with SaaSy Labs,&#8221; the announcement stated with enthusiasm.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the launch of Made by Apes, BAYC Apes can now request licenses to register their businesses or products, each assigned a unique license number. Beyond merely being an on-chain license, this novel approach serves as a unifying mark, effectively verifying and distinguishing genuine products made by BAYC &amp; MAYC (Mutant Ape Yacht Club) holders.</p>



<p>The BAYC community has undoubtedly been the driving force behind its monumental success, and the introduction of Made by Apes serves as a testament to the collective power of its builders. Over the past two years, the community has witnessed an astounding number of projects featuring Ape intellectual property, reinforcing the club&#8217;s position as a trailblazer in the NFT domain.</p>

<p>Aiming to create a versatile and inclusive tool, BAYC collaborated with several community brands at the forefront of the NFT industry to pressure test the program. These launch partners played a pivotal role in establishing the standards for commercial rights usage on the platform.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We wanted to build a tool that meets the needs of the whole community, across categories and uses. To do this, we partnered with a handful of community brands that have been pushing the space forward to pressure test this program,&#8221; the BAYC team expressed their gratitude to the launch partners in their statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Highlighting the immense potential of the Made by Apes platform, the announcement also mentioned the forthcoming launch of &#8220;The Bodega,&#8221; which will prominently display all active Made by Ape licenses on the BAYC website. This feature is set to further amplify the exposure of community products and expand the reach of licensed creations.</p>

<p>Analyzing the whale&#8217;s historical patterns, it becomes evident that their previous modus operandi involved strategic buying in batches, followed by a sweeping sell-off of all acquired ETH to Binance, ultimately completing one ETH band.

<p>At present, the whale retains a substantial holding of 22340 ETH, valued at a staggering $41.25 million. This vast cryptocurrency reserve has captured the attention of the crypto community, keen to witness the investor&#8217;s next moves, eagerly speculating whether this figure will continue to be invincible in their strategic maneuvers.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Developers across the Optimism ecosystem are starting to build OP Stack&#8217;s first Fault Proof.</em></li>



<li><em>The Fault Proof System will showcase the power of the OP Stack&#8217;s modularity, making it easy for ecosystem builders to design custom Fault Proof components.</em></li>



<li><em>It also paves the way for adding zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to the OP Stack.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>OP Stack&#8217;s first Fault Proof has been <a href="https://blog.oplabs.co/building-a-fault-proof-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a>. It will allow Collective to make significant progress toward the next level of engineering decentralization and customization available to the Bug Resistant System thanks to the <a href="https://coincu.com/189427-op-stack-brings-optimism-to-superchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OP Stack</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1773-1024x560.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="560" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1773-1024x560.png" alt="Optimism Updates OP Stack&#039;s First Fault Proof System" class="wp-image-205637" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1773-1024x560.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1773-300x164.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1773-768x420.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1773-750x410.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1773.png 1087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Optimism Updates OP Stack&#039;s First Fault Proof System 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The developers of the Optimism ecosystem are developing the Fault Proof System, which includes the error-proof Program (FPP), the fault-proof virtual machine (FPVM), the Dispute Game, and other components of the fault-proof system to demonstrate the powerful modularity of the OP stack.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/karl_dot_tech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@karl_dot_tech</a> just dropped. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>Developers across the Optimism ecosystem are heads down building the OP Stack’s first Fault Proof System. Read the full technical decentralization update here:<a href="https://t.co/NDJst0x0T7" target="_blank">https://t.co/NDJst0x0T7</a></p>&mdash; OP Labs (@OPLabsPBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/OPLabsPBC/status/1683582821103816704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the official documentation, the Fault Proof System is the key to enabling protocol decentralization. It will allow secure connections without centralized redundancy. In fact, its open-source nature and minimal, standard implementation differences make it easy to implement multiple protocols.</p>



<p>This way, ecosystem builders can easily design custom OP Stack proof-of-fault components, from proof-of-concept diagrams to virtual machines and even unique Dispute Games. The separation of FPP and FPVM allows the same operator to run in both FPVM and ZKVM.</p>



<p>With the Modular Error Protection Program (FPP) and Fault Resistant Virtual Machine (FPVM), each component can be improved in parallel, enhancing system performance and innovation.</p>



<p>As the network asserts, the OP Stack is critical to ensuring that the Superchain infrastructure, including the Fault Proof System, is composable, resilient, and future-proof. The Fault Proof System represents an important step toward a more efficient and decentralized Superchain.</p>

<p>Earlier, On the official Twitter, Optimism shared a status line introducing this new solution, aiming to make the platform a &#8220;Superchain&#8221;.</p>



<p>Also, in the blog post, Optimism said that OP Stack is a modular source code with high extensibility. This is not just a &#8220;rollup or an optimistic solution.&#8221; This set of solutions shared by Optimism will be the foundation of a development roadmap to Modular Blockchain.</p>



<p>In addition, a feature that OP Stack will be the foundation to support is atomic cross-chain interaction. Accordingly, different chains can be easily compatible with the toolkit, supporting inter-blocking activities.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has released a report calling for more regulation in blockchain finance, focusing on crypto asset trading platforms and stablecoins.</em></li>



<li><em>The GAO recommends designating a federal regulator to ensure comprehensive oversight and address the lack of coordination between existing regulatory agencies.</em></li>



<li><em>The report also acknowledges blockchain&#8217;s potential to improve government processes, citing the Small Business Administration (SBA) as an example where blockchain integration could resolve data collection and analysis delays.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog agency, has recently <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105346.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a comprehensive 77-page report urging the need for more regulation in the use of blockchain technology within the finance sector.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1024x576.png" alt="US GAO Urges Stronger Oversight: New Report Calls For Enhanced Regulation In Blockchain" class="wp-image-205631" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1770.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US GAO Urges Stronger Oversight: New Report Calls For Enhanced Regulation In Blockchain 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>The report, which was requested before the midterm elections by <a href="https://coincu.com/151496-waters-disappointed-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reps. Maxine Waters</a> and Stephen Lynch highlight the lack of adequate regulation for crypto asset trading platforms and stablecoins. As a result, the GAO recommends designating a federal regulator to ensure comprehensive oversight.</p>



<p>The report sheds light on the regulatory gaps surrounding crypto asset trading platforms and stablecoins, pointing out that they currently lack the robust regulation enjoyed by traditional assets. While some limited oversight is provided by agencies like the Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and state money transmitter licensing, it falls short of providing consistent and comprehensive prudential regulation and oversight.</p>



<p>Stablecoins, in particular, require attention regarding the composition of their reserves, auditing, disclosures, and redemption rights. The current regulatory landscape, which involves various measures from the <a href="https://coincu.com/204120-sec-adds-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-federal-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/205581-binance-cz-file-a-petition-dismiss-cftcs-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a>, and state-level authorities, lacks uniformity and coherence.</p>



<p>Addressing the unique challenges posed by decentralized finance (DeFi), the GAO suggests that regulation should be inversely related to the level of decentralization. When a DeFi ecosystem operates in a fully decentralized manner, it becomes challenging to identify individuals responsible for governance and operations, potentially spanning multiple regulatory jurisdictions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771.png" alt="US GAO Urges Stronger Oversight: New Report Calls For Enhanced Regulation In Blockchain" class="wp-image-205634" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1771-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US GAO Urges Stronger Oversight: New Report Calls For Enhanced Regulation In Blockchain 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>One of the major issues raised in the report is the lack of coordination between regulators, leading to slow responses to market innovations. To address this, the report recommends establishing a formal coordination mechanism among the seven relevant regulatory agencies.</p>



<p>This mechanism would be tasked with identifying risks associated with blockchain-related products and services and formulating a timely regulatory response. The Treasury&#8217;s Financial Stability Oversight Council was already tasked with spearheading efforts to create a unified approach to crypto asset oversight following the March 2022 Executive Order on Responsible Development of Digital Assets.</p>



<p>While the GAO&#8217;s recommendations are not legally binding, they carry significant moral weight. Among the regulatory agencies, the National Credit Union Administration expressed agreement with the need for greater coordination, while others neither agreed nor disagreed.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the GAO has previously acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology to improve various government processes. In a separate report submitted to a congressional request, the GAO highlighted how blockchain integration within the Small Business Administration (SBA) could offer substantial benefits. By leveraging blockchain, the SBA could address the persistent delays in collecting and analyzing information from small businesses, potentially resolving delays of up to 16 months between 2016 and 2021.</p>



<p>As the discussions around blockchain regulation continue to evolve, policymakers will likely consider the GAO&#8217;s recommendations seriously. Striking the right balance between innovation and oversight will be crucial for shaping the future of blockchain technology in the finance sector.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Apple Store has found a malicious phishing program that steals users&#8217; accounts and passwords.</em></li>



<li><em>Scammers reach users by mimicking regular apps.</em></li>



<li><em>Cryptocurrency users who use iCloud to back up their data need to be careful.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Chief Information Security Officer of leading security company SlowMist,<a href="https://twitter.com/IM_23pds/status/1683639652908167168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> tweeted</a> that the latest attack cases on Apple ID A malicious phishing program has appeared in the <a href="https://coincu.com/194673-damus-app-faces-removal-from-apple-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple store</a>, stealing users&#8217; accounts and passwords by mimicking normal apps.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1765.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="715" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1765-1024x715.png" alt="Apple Store Appears A Malicious Scam Program, Users Beware" class="wp-image-205609" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1765-1024x715.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1765-300x210.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1765-768x536.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1765-750x524.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1765-1140x796.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1765.png 1207w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Apple Store Appears A Malicious Scam Program, Users Beware 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The attacker then added his own number to the two-factor authentication trust number to control account permissions. Once attackers gain access to user accounts, they can manipulate 2FA trust numbers by adding their own contact information.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zh" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />注意 Apple ID出现最新攻击案例<br>Apple store 出现恶意钓鱼程序，通过模仿正常应用程序盗取用户账号和密码，然后攻击者把自己的号码加入双重认证的信任号码，控制账号权限！<br>这是一个非常高明的钓鱼方法，用来绕过苹果的 2FA！<br>加密货币用户务必注意，因为目前有不少用户、钱包的备份方案是iCloud… <a href="https://t.co/3Y9bz93NY8" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3Y9bz93NY8</a></p>&mdash; 23pds (@IM_23pds) <a href="https://twitter.com/IM_23pds/status/1683639652908167168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This scheme grants them control over account permissions, allowing them to bypass Apple&#8217;s 2FA security protocols. The consequences of such unauthorized access can be dire, especially for crypto users who store their wallets through iCloud.</p>



<p>Crypto users must pay attention, as iCloud backup is the backup solution for many users and wallets. Once attacked, it can cause property damage.</p>



<p>Storing wallets on iCloud can put them at risk of losing their assets if an attacker compromises iCloud backups. Therefore, users need to take extra security measures to protect their funds.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1766.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="620" height="350" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1766.png" alt="Apple Store Appears A Malicious Scam Program, Users Beware" class="wp-image-205611" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1766.png 620w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1766-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" title="Apple Store Appears A Malicious Scam Program, Users Beware 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Researcher SlowMist reminds crypto users to pay attention, as many users and wallets are now using iCloud backups as their backup solution. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, cybercriminals are adapting their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in various platforms, including mobile apps.</p>



<p>To reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks, users should adopt security best practices, such as using strong and unique passwords for each application or platform. Enabling 2FA on the cryptocurrency wallet itself can also add an extra layer of protection.</p>



<p>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading apps from unverified sources to reduce your risk of exposure to phishing attempts. Cryptocurrency owners should regularly review their account activities and monitor any unusual transactions or unauthorized access attempts.</p>
