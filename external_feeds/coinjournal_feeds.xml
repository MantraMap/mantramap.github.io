<li dir="ltr">BitHK will offer spot trading and looks to launch a P2P exchange for Hong Kong users.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The exchange will submit an application for registration as a VASP with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on 1 June.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Another exchange, Huobi HK is also offering spot trading to Hong Kong users and has submitted an application from the SFC.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">CoinEx, a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/">crypto exchange</a> platform that&rsquo;s been in operation since 2017, has today launched a new crypto trading platform for users in Hong Kong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new platform is called BitHK and is set to roll out several crypto services for CoinEx users in Hong Kong.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Exchanges to seek approval before offer services in Hong Kong</h2>
<p dir="ltr">CoinEx&rsquo;s launch of BitHK comes ahead of the effective date of the guidelines the Hong Kong regulators announced recently and which were set to allow registered cryptocurrency exchanges to offer crypto trading services to retail investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a press release CoinEx published on Monday, the platform will submit an application for approval as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP). The exchange plans to submit the application to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on June 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We will strictly follow the Code of Conduct for Cryptocurrency Exchanges recently released by the SFC and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill 2022. We are dedicated to delivering compliant, fair, and professional services while safeguarding our investors&rsquo; assets. Our goal is to establish a secure and reliable crypto trading environment for Hong Kong users</em>,&rdquo; Haipo Yang, CEO of CoinEx, said in a <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/coinex-launches-bithk-to-provide-crypto-trading-services-for-hong-kong-users-895834994.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">BitHK users can access spot trading and crypto storage services, while CoinEx <a href="https://twitter.com/coinexcom/status/1663200615638663168" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> it will soon introduce P2P trading and HKD transactions.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Huobi also announces Huobi HK&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Monday also another crypto platform Huobi HK announced its crypto services to Hong Kong users. In a tweeted statement, the platform said it would be offering crypto spot trading services to both retail and institutional clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Huobi HK applied for Hong Kong&rsquo;s VASP license on 29 May, 2023, according to the details shared via the platform&rsquo;s Twitter account. This follows Hong Kong&rsquo;s recent announcement that approved exchanges would be allowed to offer crypto trading to retail investors, with major coins Bitcoin and Ethereum among the first to be allowed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In related news, Binance recently announced it would be transitioning all of its users in Japan to a new platform to be called Binance Japan. The process began on 26 May and will continue through the summer.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Berenberg analysts sees upside in MicroStrategy to $340.</li>
<li>They explain their bullish view in a recent research note.</li>
<li>Coinbase stock has a &ldquo;hold&rdquo; rating only at Berenberg.</li>
</ul>
<p>MicroStrategy Inc is a better pick for exposure to cryptocurrencies than Coinbase Global Inc, as per the Berenberg analysts.</p>
<h2>MicroStrategy stock has upside to $340</h2>
<p>Mark Palmer and Hassan Saleem see upside in the technology company to $340 a share &ndash; up another 20% from here. In a recent research note, they said:</p>
<blockquote><p>MicroStrategy which features a unique business model focused on the acquisition and holding of bitcoins, represents an attractive alternative to Coinbase in the current environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>At writing, the Nasdaq-listed firm owns about 140,000 BTC in total. Earlier in May, MicroStrategy said it took an impairment charge of $170 million on its bitcoin holdings in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/03/microstrategy-reports-170m-impairment-charge-on-bitcoin-holdings-in-q1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first quarter</a>.</p>
<p>Its stock price has already nearly doubled since the start of the year.</p>
<h2>Why is Berenberg dovish on Coinbase stock?</h2>
<p>On <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>, Berenberg analysts have a &ldquo;hold&rdquo; rating with a price objective of $55 a share &ndash; roughly in line with where it&rsquo;s currently trading.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dovish primarily due to the ongoing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/coinbase-ceo-on-us-crypto-regulation-sec-lawsuit-international-plans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory scrutiny</a>. In March, the crypto exchange received a &ldquo;Wells Notice&rdquo; from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase&rsquo;s revenue is at risk in the event of an enforcement action are disproportionately profitable relative to its total revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>In comparison, MicroStrategy focuses on <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a> that&rsquo;s already been classified as a commodity and not a security thereby insulating it from such risks. The correlation between MSTR and COIN currently stands at about 0.96.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Russia appears to have ditched plans for a state-run cryptocurrency exchange, according to a new report.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Instead, it is looking to establish a framework to support cryptocurrency exchanges and digital assets in cross-border transactions.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The news was reported today by a local media outlet, citing comments from Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the State Duma committee on financial markets. </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Russia is considering the use of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> to facilitate the settlement of cross-border transactions, according to the latest crypto news from the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Local media publication Izvestiya <a href="https://iz-ru.translate.goog/1519017/mariia-kolobova/novyi-bitok-v-rossii-poiaviatsia-pravila-sozdaniia-i-raboty-kriptobirzh?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revealed</a> this development on Monday, citing a member of the State Duma.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Russia gives up plans for national crypto exchange</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/russian-lawmakers-devise-plan-to-create-a-state-run-crypto-exchange/">&nbsp;<u>reported</u></a> last November, Russian authorities had hinted at plans to establish a state-run cryptocurrency exchange. The country&rsquo;s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov also revisited this idea in April, noting the push to have a new payments system that included crypto in place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As Izvestiya reported today, the country appears to be shelving these plans in favour of a new framework that would support crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The publication quoted Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the State Duma committee on financial markets. According to Aksakov, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/russia/">Russia</a> is now looking to adopt a framework that would see rules for the use of crypto exchanges for cross-border settlements established.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The plans have received the support of the Ministry of Finance, which was reportedly against the launch of a single national digital assets exchange.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ivan Chebeskov, director of financial policy at the Ministry of Finance told Izvestia that the ministry is focused on proper and comprehensive regulation of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<li>Polkadot hodlers are underwater</li>
<li>A bullish scenario remains valid if the lows hold</li>
<li>A move above $7 should lead to more gains</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>It has been a tough period for long-term holders of Polkadot. The DOT/USD exchange rate has moved South relentlessly after peaking at $56 in late 2021.</p>
<p>From $56 to $5, it was a straight decline. It took only one year for Polkadot to frustrate bulls.</p>
<p>And even now, as cryptocurrencies have rallied in 2023, one should be scared looking at the daily chart. After all, the bounce from the lows looks so small when interpreting the bigger picture that it is difficult to find a bullish argument.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/29/1685379552142-7dac14fa-a02c-4f5e-8357-d08b24777f3d.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="488"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOTUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polkadot chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>Polkadot should overcome $7 resistance area for bulls to be in control</h2>
<p>Zooming in, one may see the 2023 rally that brought back optimism in the cryptocurrency market. Sure enough, Polkadot already gave back more than half of its YTD gains.</p>
<p>But the invalidation level for a bullish scenario still holds. Effectively, it means that the recent price action might be nothing but a correction part of a bigger-degree bullish trend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/29/1685379552168-6ca40a35-f033-4965-9d9f-0712d6d4a890.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="488"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOTUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polkadot chart by TradingView</a></p>
<p>The Elliott Waves theory states that an impulsive move (i.e., the one that began at the start of the year) is followed by a corrective structure, an a-b-c.</p>
<p>This a-b-c that corrects a bullish trend should have two waves moving in the opposite direction (i.e., waves a and c), and one that moves in the main trend&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>It means that one may easily say that the move from the 2022 lows is an impulsive structure, and the decline from the 2023 highs is the a-b-c. In this case, the implications are bullish for Polkadot and bearish for the US dollar.</p>
<p>However, only a move above the pivotal $7 level would cement the bullish Elliott Waves scenario. Until then, bulls might wish for the price action to hold above the invalidation area shown on the chart above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin miners&rsquo; revenue from fees dropped 90% since the BRC-20 peak, from $17.8 million daily to $1.7 million per day as of 29 May, 2023.</li>
<li dir="ltr">However, current levels remain within historical levels with only 310 out of 4674 trading days having seen greater fees.</li>
<li dir="ltr">In 2018, transaction fees were higher than recent highs only on two trading days.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin miner revenue from transaction fees has declined significantly since the BRC-20 frenzy that drove network activity higher earlier in the month.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin-mining/">Bitcoin mining</a> is a key component of the flagship cryptocurrency&rsquo;s network operations and miners earn from the set subsidy as well as transaction fees. BRC-20 tokens are a type of fungible tokens created on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are ordinal inscriptions that can are used to represent a variety of things, including digital assets and loyalty points.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Miner revenue from fees falls sharply after BRC-20 frenzy</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to data from Glassnode, a leading on-chain and financial markets data platform, miners were earning roughly $17.8 million from transaction fees per day. This happened as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> traded near the YTD highs and as the BRC-20 craze hit the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, as of May 29, 2023, the earnings had declined considerably and miners were taking home just $1.7 million from network fees per day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Miner earnings from fees has thus fallen by about $16.1 million, or 90.85% from that recent peak, Glassnode highlighted on Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as the platform noted, miners&rsquo; revenues from fees dropping to latest levels still sees the figures near historical ones seen in most trading days. Only 310 out of 4,674 days, or 6.7% of BTC trading days have seen higher miner revenue from fees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Glassnode <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1663124431378567168" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>:<a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1663124431378567168" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>At the peak of the BRC-20 frenzy, Bitcoin miners were earning $17.8M in transaction fees, with only 2 trading days across the 2018 peak recording a larger fee revenue. Currently, miners are earning $1.7M in fee revenue, a -$16.1M decline from the recent peak. However, this remains significantly elevated when compared to historical precedence, with only 310 / 4674 (6.7%) trading days recording greater fees</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Bitcoin network recently saw a massive surge in activity as the demand for BRC-20 tokens soared. The result, as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/why-are-bitcoin-transaction-fees-rising-and-what-are-brc-20-tokens/">highlighted here</a>, was network congestion as the rush to inscriptions helped fees to spike to year-to-date highs.

<li>Bitcoin fails to confirm a reversal pattern</li>
<li>Bulls fight to invalidate a head and shoulders</li>
<li>Friday&rsquo;s jobs report might be key for Bitcoin and the US dollar</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>After an explosive start to the year, Bitcoin&rsquo;s price stopped advancing after meeting stiff resistance at the $30k area. For bulls, it was supposed to be just a matter of time until the resistance would give way to more gains.</p>
<p>But the bears did not give up. Just the opposite, considering that a reversal pattern formed in the last couple of months.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not difficult to spot a head and shoulders pattern. Such a pattern forms at the end of bullish trends and traders look for the market to travel the minimum distance shown by its measured move.</p>
<p>In this case, the minimum distance to confirm the reversal is around $23k. Only the market did not travel there, putting into question the very reversal.</p>
<p>So are we in for an invalidation of the head and shoulders pattern? If so, when will bulls be in control again?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/29/1685375438810-0850eb5d-b281-4e17-8747-dd33c04f68ce.jpg" style="width: 1080px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1080" height="489"></p>

<h2>Friday&rsquo;s NFP report is key for Bitcoin and the US dollar</h2>
<p>It is no surprise to anyone that Bitcoin&rsquo;s negative correlation with the US dollar increased lately. More precisely, since institutional investors started including Bitcoin in their portfolios, the leading cryptocurrency has become nothing more than a regular asset trading in sync with other financial market assets.</p>
<p>The best way to prove this theory is to examine the EUR/USD and Bitcoin price action in the past several months.</p>
<p>EUR/USD bottomed last October below 0.96. Bitcoin bottomed around the same date.</p>
<p>Next, EUR/USD rallied to above 1.10. Bitcoin rallied, too, following a similar pattern.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is not about the euro, but the dollar.</p>
<p>A negative correlation means that the two (i.e., Bitcoin and the US dollar) move in opposite directions. If they move tick by tick, the maximum level the correlation may hit is -1.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is not the case, as such extremes are rarely reached. But one cannot ignore that Bitcoin moves in sync with the dollar.</p>
<p>As such, Friday&rsquo;s NFP report is key for Bitcoin and the US dollar. A miss would send the dollar lower and Bitcoin higher. Hence, bulls should watch the point that would invalidate the head and shoulders pattern &ndash;$30k.</p>
