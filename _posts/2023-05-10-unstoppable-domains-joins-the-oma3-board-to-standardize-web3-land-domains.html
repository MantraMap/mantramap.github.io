<p>San Francisco, California, May 10th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Unstoppable Domains, the leading platform for digital identity, today announced they are joining the Board of Directors of OMA3 (Open Metaverse Alliance for Web3), a consortium of companies creating standards for the decentralized metaverse. Other OMA3 board members include Alien Worlds, Animoca Brands, Dapper Labs, Metametaverse, Sandbox, Space, Superworld, and Upland.</p><p>As a leader in OMA3, Unstoppable Domains is leveraging its expertise in Web3 domains to aid OMA3&rsquo;s efforts to standardize the use of Web3 land domains in the metaverse. The association&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to create an open marketplace of Web3 land domains to make the metaverse easier to navigate. OMA&rsquo;s Portaling and Mapping Working Group will lead efforts to create standards for Web3 land domains.</p><p>Unlike app-specific addresses, Web3 land domains are a special type of universal address that spans metaverse worlds, allowing users to point directly to their virtual lands and parcels. The primary benefit of this approach is the interoperability and universality of the address. For instance, Web3 land domains will allow people to teleport not only to a different world within the metaverse but to a specific location in it as well.</p><p>The cross-world nature of Web3 land domains requires standardization to prevent conflicts and duplicates across different implementations. Standardization will also give developers and users a consistent experience</p><p>Additionally, as a member of the Web3 Domain Alliance, Unstoppable Domains will coordinate efforts between the two industry consortiums. Founded in 2022, the Web3 Domain Alliance is a member-led, member-driven organization dedicated to improving the technological and public policy environments for users of blockchain naming services.</p>&ldquo;As metaverse platforms become more interoperable, it will be important to give users an easy, universal way to uniquely identify metaverse land,&rdquo; said Sandy Carter, COO and Head of Business Development at Unstoppable Domains. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to help OMA3 achieve this goal in an open and developer-friendly manner.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We welcome Unstoppable Domains&rsquo;s participation in OMA3&rsquo;s governance and are grateful for their expertise as a leading provider of Web3 domain names,&rdquo; said Dirk Lueth, Co-founder &amp; Co-CEO, Upland, Founding Member and Chairperson of OMA3. &ldquo;It is commendable that Unstoppable Domains is willing to commit resources to build a system that gives equal opportunity to any name registrar, including their competitors. We welcome other companies in the domain name space to join OMA3 and contribute to the process.&rdquo;&nbsp;<p></p><p>About Unstoppable Domains</p><p>Founded in 2018, Unstoppable Domains is building a platform for user-owned digital identity.
