<ul><li>Uniswap users can now purchase crypto using their credit and debit cards.</li><li>Crypto purchases through fiat will be available on Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.</li><li>The service will be provided with no minimum fees and zero spreads on USDC purchases.&nbsp;</li><li>The protocol is working on an option to convert crypto to fiat to send into bank accounts.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-nft-trading-airdrop-genie/">Uniswap</a>, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by trading volume, has enabled crypto purchases through fiat. Users of Uniswap Protocol will now be able to buy crypto using their credit and debit cards as well as through a bank transfer. This feature has been developed in association with Moonpay.</p>



<h2><strong>Uniswap brings DeFi closer to users</strong></h2>



<p>The new feature has been <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/web-fiat-on-ramp" rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> by the DEX as “direct to DeFi”. The aim is to eliminate the need for a middleman and bring users directly to the DeFi experience through a seamless onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With self-custodial wallets, permissionless and immutable protocols, and a transparent public ledger, DEXs have built-in user protections.” the press release read.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>While card payments will be supported in 160+ countries, bank transfers will be available for most of the US, Brazil, Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), and the UK. As of now, users can purchase DAI, ETH, MATIC, USDC, USDT, WBTC, and WETH. However, WBTC and WETH will not be available for users in the US. As of now, Uniswap is only supporting four chains for this feature, namely Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>No minimum fees</strong></h2>



<p>Uniswap has clarified that this feature has been made available with zero minimum fees. Additionally, users can enjoy zero spreads on their USDC purchases. The protocol is also working to integrate an off-ramp so that users can send crypto back into their bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the feature has been marketed as a push towards DeFi, users who choose to go through Moonpay to purchase crypto will have to comply with its KYC/AML policy. Uniswap has clarified that the customer data acquired by Moonpay will not be shared with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On December 8, a pseudonymous 3Commas and Binance user known as CoinMamba on Twitter alerted their followers to an exploit. Funds were stolen from CoinMamba’s account due to an API submitted to the trading bot, the thread explained.</p>



<p>Friction erupted between CoinMamba and Binance after the user accused Binance of refusing to help with recovery. Binance CEO CZ noted that the exchange cannot verify who stole the API keys as users leveraged third-party software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>A South Korean court ruled in favor of a freeze on assets owned by early investors of Terra&#8217;s ecosystem.</li><li>Prosecutors filed to lockdown assets controlled by seven persons including Kernel Labs CEO Amugae Kim.</li><li>The news is the latest from South Korean investigations into Terra&#8217;s $40 billion wipeout in May 2022. </li></ul>



<p>South Korean prosecutors received permission to freeze $92 million in assets linked to early Terra backers as investigations into Luna and UST’s collapse ramp up. Authorities also seized $108 million in assets from Do Kwon’s co-founder Daniel Shin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Seoul Southern District Court passed a motion authorizing the freeze after investigators discovered illicit proceeds tied to Luna, the governance tokens developed by fugitive Do Kwon and his blockchain company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors argued that sevens persons illegally amassed assets by offering pre-issued Luna tokens for huge profits, local media reported. The filing said that Kernel Labs CEO Amugae Kim and six others profited from this scheme prior to May’s collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kernel Labs was founded in 2018 as a blockchain payments developer and on-chain consultancy company. Investigators said that Kernel Labs and Terra shared a relationship, with some Kernel staff like Kim contributing significantly to Kwon’s blockchain company. Kim’s frozen assets were valued at around $61 million, per <a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202212208809B" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do Kwon was also named by prosecutors as one of the seven persons with illegal gains from pre-issued Luna coins.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Terra Investigations Heat Up</h2>



<p>Terra’s $40 billion implosion sent shockwaves throughout the digital asset industry. Luna was previously a top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. Do Kwon’s algorithmic stablecoin UST ranked third among stablecoins before the token crashed alongside its sister crypto Luna.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Local and international authorities responded with investigations on several fronts, including warrants for Kwon’s arrest from <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/interpol-issues-a-red-notice-against-terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-report/">Interpol</a> and South Korean law enforcement. Sources claimed that Kwon fled to Serbia and currently lives there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineers and developers who worked for Kwon were also barred from leaving South Korea at some point. Co-founder Danie Shin’s property was raided as investigators searched for clues into how Kwon’s company failed. Authorities also raided seven exchanges, confiscating transaction records in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawmakers also pledged to develop regulatory policies aimed at protecting investors without hampering innovation in South Korea’s digital asset economy.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A Bahamian magistrate has issued orders to extend the remand of Sam Bankman-Fried.</li><li>The former FTX CEO was expected to drop his extradition fight today in court.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF was reportedly shaking in the courtroom.</li><li>He will return to the Bahamas’ notorious Fox Hill prison.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Following a rather chaotic hearing today at the Nassau courthouse, Bahamian magistrate Shaka Serville ruled that Sam Bankman-Fried will not be extradited to the United States yet. The magistrate has issued orders to remand the former FTX CEO in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried intended to waive his extradition</strong></h2>



<p>The news comes as a surprise given the widespread reports of Sam Bankman-Fried’s intention to surrender himself to U.S custody. According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-sent-back-to-bahamas-jail-.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a>, even the Bahamian prosecutor acknowledged SBF’s intention to waive extradition. As per the report, Sam Bankman-Fried demanded to see a copy of his federal indictment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was reportedly shaking in the courtroom. His defense attorney informed the court that Bankman-Fried’s presence in the court came as a “shock” to him. “I did not request him to be here this morning,” the attorney said. The former crypto billionaire will be taken away to Fox Hill prison in a heavily guarded convoy following the magistrate’s orders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>No relief in sight for Sam Bankman-Fried</strong></h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was first remanded to the notorious Fox Hill prison last week after the court&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-denied-bail-ftx-judge-bahamas-sbf-fraud-case/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rejected</a>&nbsp;his bail plea citing a flight risk. Given that he needed medical care, SBF was kept in the medical unit of the prison. The prison is known for its precarious condition. Lack of hygienic cells, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and medical care among other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the rejection of SBF’s bail application, his attorneys indicated that they would fight extradition at today’s hearing. However,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>&nbsp;emerged over the weekend that signaled that the former FTX CEO was ready to drop his extradition fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Binance&#8217;s American division successfully bid $1.022 billion for assets under bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital.</li><li>The deal could fast-track unlocking customer funds after Voyager collapsed in July 2022 due to market conditions and exposure to Three Arrows Capital.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX bid $1.4 billion for Voyager&#8217;s asset before SBF&#8217;s crypto exchange crashed in November.</li></ul>



<p>BinanceUS sealed a deal to buy Voyager Digital assets after the crypto broker froze withdrawals and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022. The official statement published on Monday said that BinanceUS was the highest bidder with $1.022 billion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@BinanceUS</a> was selected highest and best bid in Voyager’s reopened bankruptcy asset auction. Once the deal is completed, Voyager users will finally be able to access their digital assets on the <a href="https://t.co/Wc26vMosC4" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/Wc26vMosC4</a> platform.<br><br>Read: <a href="https://t.co/gBK5m3kcYn" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/gBK5m3kcYn</a></p>&mdash; Brian Shroder (@BrianShroder) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianShroder/status/1604825059813920770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to BinanceUS, the bid considered the “fair market value” of Voyager’s crypto portfolio. The massive $1 billion deal also accounted for an incremental value equal to $20 million.&nbsp; BinanceUS noted that should &#8220;sets a clear path forward for Voyager customer funds to be unlocked as soon as possible&#8221;. This means that Voyager users could see their crypto assets returned earlier than previously expected.</p>



<p>The agreement with BinanceUS is subject to a bankruptcy hearing on January 5, 2023, per Monday’s <a href="https://blog.binance.us/voyager-binance-us/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.binance.us/voyager-binance-us/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The sale to Binance.US will be consummated pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan, which will be subject to a creditor vote and is subject to other customary closing conditions. Binance.US and the Company will work to close the transaction promptly following approval of the chapter 11 plan by the Bankruptcy Court.</p></blockquote>



<p>FTX under Sam Bankman-Fried successfully bid $1.4 billion for Voyager&#8217;s assets back in September but the deal fell through after SBF&#8217;s crypto exchange shuttered in November. </p>



<h2>Voyager Digital Crash</h2>



<p>Voyager Digital collapsed around mid-2022 following a downturn in the crypto asset prices and the collapse of several centralized finance digital asset entities. Previous reports cited exposure to bankruptcy crypto hedge fund <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-creditors-july-18/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-creditors-july-18/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Three Arrows Capital</a> (3AC) as another major reason behind Voyager’s tumble.</p>



<p>Voyager’s future was further dimmed after Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto empire imploded in November. The crypto broker previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyager-digital-3ac-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured</a> a $485 million credit line from Alameda Research, SBF’s quantitative trading behemoth. </p>



<p>Other CeFi crypto companies like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-bankruptcy-files-chapter-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlockFi</a>, Celsius, and FTX also filed for bankruptcy amid the 2022 bear market citing liquidity constraints, market volatility, and exposure to other virtual currency entities. </p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to surrender to U.S. extradition laws as authorities prosecute the former FTX crypto exchange founder for fraud and money laundering. Bankman-Fried will appear before a Bahamas court later on Monday to reverse his earlier decision, per reports from three media outlets.</p>



<p>Bahamas authorities arrested SBF on December 12 following a formal request from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutors. Sam Bankman-Fried appeared before a judge and contested extradition to the United States where he faces several allegations of fraud and money laundering. SBF’s $250,000 bail request was also denied, EthereumWorldNews reported.</p>



<p>Reports from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/17/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-will-not-contest-us-extradition-in-alleged-fraud-case-source-says.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/sam-bankman-fried-reverse-decision-contesting-extradition-source-2022-12-17/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/12/17/sbf-prison-bahamas/" rel="nofollow noopener">Washington Post</a> cited sources close to Bankman-Fried who claimed that the fallen founder no longer planned to fight extradition to the U.S. Bahamas Fox Hill prison staff were also cited as sources.</p>



<p>As previously reported, SBF’s extradition hearing will take place on February 8, 2023, barring any changes. Sam Bankman-Fried could remain in Bahamas custody until then, in a prison that many describe as harsh and unforgiving.</p>

<h2>DOJ Filed Eight (8) Charges Against Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>Indeed, the former FTX CEO was charged on eight counts including fraud on customers, lenders, and investors. SBF also faces money laundering charges and campaign finance violations.</p>

<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed a complaint against SBF with damning allegations. CFTC officials accused Sam Bankman-Fried of diverting billions in customer funds to Alameda Research, his trading giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the CFTC, Alameda was already insolvent by May/June 2022 when Terra collapsed. The CFTC alleged that Alameda’s use of customer funds drastically <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/">increased</a> after Luna and UST’s $40 billion wipeout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding users and lenders alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>An exploiter stole around $2.5 million in cryptocurrencies from Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium.</li><li>The team confirmed that a hacker withdrew liquidity pool tokens from its admin wallet on Friday.</li><li>The hacker swapped the stolen digital assets from Solana to Ethereum, per on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. </li></ul>



<p>Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium was exploited on Friday for around $2.5 million in digital assets, the project confirmed via a Twitter thread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Solana DEX, the project’s admin wallet was compromised and liquidity pool (LP) tokens were withdrawn without the team&#8217;s authorization. Raydium said the exploiter assumed “owner authority” in order to drain funds from the LP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nansen confirmed that LP tokens were stolen from the Solana DEX, including some $⅙ million in SOL. Further investigations into the matter are underway, said the team.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Raydium Hack Spells Further Turbence For Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem</h2>



<p>Raydium’s TVL exceeded $45 million despite today’s $2.5 million hack, per data seen on the DEX’s liquidity pool dashboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Friday’s hack on the DEX highlighted pressure in Solana&#8217;s decentralized finance ecosystem. Solana DeFi was thrown into uncertainty after the crash of FTX. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried back’s Solana development, including massive investments in projects like Serum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solana’s total value locked (TVL) fell below $300 million shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11. The Solana Foundation also lost tens of millions stuck on the crypto exchange after withdrawals were paused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFTC, SEC, and U.S. Attorneys from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) have since <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> Bankman-Fried with fraud and money laundering.

<ul><li>Audit Firm Mazars recently halted operations for massive crypto exchanges, including Binance, Crypto.Com, and KuCoin, following FTX&#8217;s Collapse, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>.</li><li>Previous audit reports have been taken down from their website. </li><li>Binance saw a withdrawal of $1B earlier this week following fears of investigations from the US Justice Department. </li></ul>



<p>Audit Group Mazars is halting any work with crypto clients such as Binance, the world&#8217;s current largest crypto exchange. The crypto sector has been under enormous scrutiny recently following the fallout of the significant crypto exchanges FTX and FTX.US. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg </a>report, previous audit reports are currently inaccessible on Mazar&#8217;s website, as the links are broken.</p>



<p>The accounting firm, Mazars, was hired by Binance to conduct a &#8220;proof of reserves&#8221; report. A Binance statement on Friday confirmed that Mazars had indicated they would temporarily pause all work with global crypto clients, including clients such as Crypto.Com, KuCoin, and Binance.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221208065048/https://veritas.mazars.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20221208065048/https://veritas.mazars.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">website </a>responsible for crypto audits appears to be shut down, and Mazars has not issued any further statements.</p>



<p>Most big crypto exchanges, such as Crypto.Com, KuCoin, and Binance, have worked with Mazars to provide audit reports on their reserves in November, following the fallout of crypto exchange FTX.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Binance saw a withdrawal amount of over $1BN as fear in centralized exchanges is at an all-time high. &#8220;Over the past week, Binance passed a stress test that should give the community extraordinary comfort that their funds are secure,&#8221; Binance said on Friday, confirming it was able to fulfill recent withdrawals &#8220;without breaking stride.&#8221;</p>



<p>The following outflow followed due to recent probes by the U.S Justice Department holding Binance under investigation on Money Laundering and Tax Avoidance charges.</p>



<p>Binance previously confirmed it holds more than $60B in assets, ensuring that the funds should be sufficient to honor all withdrawals. Still, it is yet to provide a disclosure of its liabilities. This figure has also been confirmed by Nansen Data which shows that Binance has over 55.6B in asset reserves.</p>



<p>According to a statement shared by Binance on Friday, the exchange confirmed that it has attempted to reach out to multiple large auditing firms, including ones in the Big Four, which are currently unwilling to conduct a proof of reserve for a private company.  Binance is still looking for a firm willing to do so. The exchange did not commit to a timeline on when this would be achieved. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The OKB token shot up in value after Twitter CEO Elon Musk followed OKX&#8217;s account, the crypto exchange behind OKB.</li><li>OKB&#8217;s price rose as high as 7% by press time on the speculations that Musk might unveil crypto payments for Twitter.</li><li>Elon Musk does not follow Binance, another crypto exchange that invested $500 million in equity for his Twitter takeover.</li></ul>



<p>OKX utility token pumped in asset value after traders noticed Elon Musk followed the company’s account on Twitter. OKB is the native token for the OKX cryptocurrency exchange. Users can trade with OKB, using the coin to pay for fees and digital asset transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OKB surged over 72% on the back of Elon Musk’s follow. The token traded for around $24 at press time, per data pulled from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/okb" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinGecko</a>. It’s unclear why Musk followed OKX on the social network. OKX notably advertises its partnership with European Football giants Manchester City on Twitter.</p>

<p>Some crypto participants on Twitter speculated that the OKX follow affirms upcoming web 3.0 payment integrations for the social network. Musk is a known supporter of Dogecoin, a popular crypto meme coin also known as DOGE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hopes that Twitter will roll out support for several blockchain networks only increased after Elon purchased Twitter for $44 billion. Crypto exchange Binance invested $500 million in equity for Musk’s massive Twitter buy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao previously said Twitter&#8217;s best bet was to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-twitter-cryptos-dogecoin-bnb/">integrate</a> multiple blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Musk also suggested that payments on Twitter were a “no brainer”.</p>



<h2>Twitter Announces NFT Trading</h2>



<p>Twitter announced NFT trading days after Elon Musk bought the company in October. The feature promised to allow NFT traders to view, buy, and sell digital collectibles from their Twitter timeliness. Twitter’s so-called “NFT Tweet Tiles” <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/musks-twitter-nft-trading-tweet-tiles/">rolled</a> out on October 27 in beta for select Apple iOS and web users.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Elon Musk Riles Journalist With Suspensions</h2>



<p>Crypto participants noticed the following amid online tension between Musk and several journalists on the social network. Users were outraged after Twitter suspended several accounts of reporters who cover the tech billionaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asides from journalists, Twitter also suspended several other accounts including ElonJet, a profile that tracks Musk’s private jet. Musk claimed these accounts failed to comply with privacy policies and doxxing laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute was appointed to the committee for unsecured FTX creditors.</li><li>Wintermute and eight other members form the committee, according to a court document seen by EthereumWorldNews.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. on November 11, 2022.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Crypto market maker Wintermute was appointed to the unsecured creditor&#8217;s committee for FTX, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to the court document seen by EthereumWorldNews, the committee comprises nine members including Wintermute and GGC, and an entity owned by Genesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankruptcy filing revealed over a million creditors of the collapsed crypto exchange. SBF&#8217;s firm reportedly owes the top 50 creditors around $3 billion. Alameda Research had $8 billion in liabilities on the exchange, per a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complaint</a> from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>



<h2>Unsecured Creditors Committee</h2>

Ltd.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Appointing a creditors committee is common with Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws in the United States. After crypto lender Celsius filed Chapter 11 back on July 13, the bankruptcy court <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-creditor-committee-misconduct/">appointed</a> the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors days after on July 27.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Charged With Fraud</h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on December 13, 2022. Bahamas law enforcement received notice of criminal charges from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). </p>



<p>Prosecutors <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> SBF with fraud and money laundering. The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also filed similar charges. According to the CFTC&#8217;s complaint, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reallocated</a> FTX customer assets to Alameda Research, his trading firm. </p>



<p>FTX CEO John Ray told Congress that Alameda exposed client funds to huge margin trading losses.  The CFTC alleged that Alameda&#8217;s liabilities on FTX exceeded $8 billion. Charges from the SEC also accused SBF of defrauding customers, lenders, and investors. </p>
