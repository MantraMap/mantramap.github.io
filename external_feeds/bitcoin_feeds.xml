Citing the crypto&#x2019;s performance during the regional bank crisis earlier this year, she stressed, &#x201C;That was the flight to safety,&#x201D; emphasizing that bitcoin is the insurance her team believes &#x201C;everyone will want at the end of the day.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Ark Invest&#x2019;s Bitcoin Price Predictions</h2>
<p>Ark Investment Management (Ark Invest) is now more confident in bitcoin&#x2019;s price reaching $1.5 million per coin. The firm&#x2019;s CEO, Cathie Wood, <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1681044467904655362">said</a> in an interview with Bloomberg Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our confidence has increased toward the bull case.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bull case Wood referred to was one of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ark-invest-expects-bitcoin-to-become-a-multitrillion-dollar-market-predicts-btc-price-could-reach-1-48-million/">three scenarios</a> Ark Invest outlined in its annual Big Ideas 2023 that was published in February. In the firm&#x2019;s base case scenario, the price of bitcoin is projected to reach $682,800 by the end of December 2030, while the bull case scenario envisions <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> soaring to $1.48 million in the same time period.</p>

<p>Wood attributed the increased bullishness in bitcoin to the regional bank crisis in March, when several major banks failed, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-regulators-close-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-of-the-largest-bank-failures-since-washington-mutual/">Silicon Valley Bank</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ny-regulators-seize-control-of-signature-bank-depositors-assured-by-federal-bailout/">Signature Bank</a>. &#x201C;As regional banks are going bankrupt, and stocks are imploding across the board &#x2026; bitcoin rallied from $19,000 to $30,000,&#x201D; the Ark Invest CEO noted, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>That was the flight to safety. That is the insurance policy &#x2026; that we believe everyone will want at the end of the day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Multiple people have warned that more banks are about to fail, including Rich Dad Poor Dad author <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-more-banks-are-about-to-fail/">Robert Kiyosaki</a>. Economist Peter Schiff, however, believes that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-all-banks-will-fail-people-will-suffer-massive-losses-as-banking-crisis-unfolds/">all banks will fail</a> and people will suffer massive losses as the banking crisis unfolds.</p>
<p>Wood highlighted that bitcoin is an &#x201C;insurance policy against two things.&#x201D; Firstly, she emphasized its role in protecting against wealth confiscation, whether through direct means or inflation. Secondly, in a deflationary environment, bitcoin serves as a hedge against counterparty risk. Emphasizing the decentralized and transparent nature of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, the Ark Invest executive believes that a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 will not happen. &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t have an &#x2018;08-&#x2018;09 with bitcoin. Everything is decentralized and transparent &#x2014; no obfuscation,&#x201D; she stressed.</p>

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) has unveiled two new reforms for bitcoin if he is elected president. He plans to back the U.S. dollar with the cryptocurrency and eliminate capital gains taxes on the conversion of bitcoin to USD.</strong> <strong>RFK Jr. stressed that his administration&#x2019;s mission is to make America &#x201C;the global hub of cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Kennedy Administration Plans to Back US Dollar With Bitcoin</h2>
<p>U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiled several bullish plans for bitcoin if he is elected president during his speech at a Heal-the-Divide event on Tuesday. Kennedy is a son of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>The presidential hopeful began by outlining the reforms he previously promised regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, stating that his administration&#x2019;s mission is to make America &#x201C;the global hub of cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin, as a means of incentivizing greater investment in green and renewable energy production, attracting engineering, investment, and innovation to our country.&#x201D; He also promised to &#x201C;put an end to the current policies of the Biden administration that are invited by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-30/crypto-claims-chokepoint-2-0-as-wall-street-banks-close-ranks">Chokepoint 2.0</a> to punish banks for dealing in bitcoin, and also to make strong barriers against the issuance of central bank digital currencies [CBDCs].&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to talk today about two additional reforms that we&#x2019;ve given a lot of thought to, and are going to be part of our package,&#x201D; Kennedy said Tuesday. One of the reforms is to back the U.S. dollar with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. He detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Kennedy administration will be backing the U.S. dollar with real, finite assets, such as gold, silver, platinum, and bitcoin, which is the world&#x2019;s hardest liquid asset, to strengthen the U.S. dollar and guarantee its continued success as the world&#x2019;s reserve currency.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;This will include U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. My plan would be to start very, very small &#x2014; perhaps 1% of issued T-bills would be backed by hard currency, by gold, silver, platinum, or bitcoin. And then, depending on the outcome, we would increase that annually,&#x201D; he described. &#x201C;What this will do is &#x2026; ironically, we will be able to use bitcoin to help save the U.S. dollar.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<h2>Capital Gains Tax Exemption</h2>
<p>Another bitcoin reform Kennedy revealed on Tuesday concerns capital gains taxes from converting the cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars. The pro-bitcoin presidential candidate, who recently revealed that he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/democratic-presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy-jr-holds-up-to-250000-in-bitcoin-records-show/">holds up to $250K</a> in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like Singapore, Germany, Switzerland, Puerto Rico and Portugal, the Kennedy administration will exempt the conversion of bitcoin to U.S. dollars from capital gains taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kennedy explained that the benefits of this policy include &#x201C;facilitating innovation and investment, ensuring citizen privacy, [and] incentivizing businesses to grow their business and tech jobs in the United States rather than in Singapore, Switzerland, Germany, and Portugal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moreover, he explained that one of the factors in this decision is that &#x201C;non-taxable events are unreportable,&#x201D; emphasizing that &#x201C;it will be more difficult for governments to weaponize currency against free speech, which, as many of you know is one of my principle objectives, and other civil liberties.&#x201D;</p>

Trump also made several other promises, including getting Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin to make a deal with Ukraine&#8217;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy &#8220;very quickly.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Donald Trump&#8217;s Warnings</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump made several promises and predictions during an interview with Fox News Sunday. He was asked about his plan to get the U.S. economy growing again and whether he thinks the U.S. is going into a recession. “If people think Trump is going to be elected, you&#8217;ll never have a recession … because people will start investing,” the former president claimed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>If people think I&#8217;m not, you&#8217;ll have more than a recession. You&#8217;re going to have a depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>“But, what I would do is very simple. I&#8217;ve got to get interest rates down. We have to get rid of inflation because inflation is a country killer,” he stressed, noting that the Biden administration is “putting the interest rates at a point nobody can borrow.”</p>

<p>Trump also made a number of other promises. For example, he said: “We&#8217;ll close up the border. We&#8217;ll become energy independent, then we&#8217;re going to be energy dominant. We&#8217;ll be taking care of Europe. Energy prices are going to come down. I will get [Russian President] Putin to make a deal with [Ukrainian President] Zelenskyy very quickly. We&#8217;re going to have a great world again.” Moreover, Trump opined: “If we don&#8217;t win in &#8217;24, this country is finished. I really believe that.”</p>
<p>In April, the former president warned that the U.S. dollar is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-president-donald-trump-says-us-dollar-is-crashing-warns-were-very-close-to-world-war-iii/">crashing</a> and soon will &#8220;no longer be the world standard.&#8221; In addition, he cautioned that &#8220;we are very close&#8221; to a third world war.</p>

The move, which opens the door to an official review process, follows last week’s acknowledgment of Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF application. </strong></p>
<h2>U.S. SEC to Review Valkyrie’s Bitcoin ETF Application, Expects Public Feedback</h2>
<p>The United States’ securities regulator has given the nod to an official review of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application submitted by financial services company Valkyrie. The application was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasdaq.htm#SR-NASDAQ-2023-019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> to the government agency’s docket on Monday, July 17.</p>
<p>The listing on the SEC’s calendar comes after this past Thursday the Commission <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-accepts-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-application/">acknowledged</a> a similar application by Blackrock, the world’s largest asset management firm. Public comments on the proposal will be accepted for 21 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<p>Industry players are competing to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., including Bitwise, Wisdom Tree, Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Vaneck, Invesco, and Fidelity, but the SEC has so far rejected a number of applications. Among them, that for Valkyrie’s “Bitcoin Strategy ETF.”</p>

<p>Tennessee-based Valkyrie, which already offers a bitcoin futures ETF, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-funds-joins-race-for-sec-approval-as-it-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">submitted</a> its new application for an ETF named “Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund,” ticker symbol “BRRR,” on June 21. That happened days after the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filing</a> for financial giant Blackrock’s “Ishares Bitcoin Trust” gave cause for optimism that the SEC may finally greenlight a spot bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Then, in early July, Valkyrie amended its filing to add a surveillance-sharing agreement with leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, again following in the footsteps of Blackrock which did the same earlier. Both applicants chose Coinbase as a partner despite the trading platform being one of the companies targeted in the SEC’s ongoing clampdown on the crypto sector.</p>
<p>During the 21-day comment period, the SEC will gather public feedback and suggestions on Valkyrie’s proposal before it decides on the application. The Securities and Exchange Commission is yet to approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S., a step that regulators in neighboring Canada have already taken, while Europe is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/europe-expects-its-first-bitcoin-etf-this-month-report/">preparing</a> for the launch of its first bitcoin ETF later this month.</p>

<h2>Peter Schiff&#x2019;s Son, Spencer, Appears to Have Made Complete Turnaround</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gold-bug-vs-bitcoin-bug-a-look-at-the-curious-relationship-between-peter-and-spencer-schiff/">Spencer Schiff</a>, son of renowned economist and gold advocate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-the-fed-has-lost-inflation-fight-markets-just-havent-figured-that-out-yet/">Peter Schiff</a>, used to engage in debates about bitcoin&#x2019;s value with his father in 2021. Back then, Spencer was a strong supporter of bitcoin, contradicting his father&#x2019;s prediction that the cryptocurrency would plummet to zero. In March 2021, Peter publicly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/100-in-bitcoin-gold-bug-peter-schiffs-son-spencer-all-in-on-btc/">announced</a> that Spencer had gone &#x201C;all in on bitcoin on the last drop below $50K.&#x201D; Spencer also <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1388860200849969156?s=20">advised</a> his father to accumulate Satoshis during discussions about inflation.</p>
<p>On July 18, 2023, Spencer responded to a Tuesday <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1681305390305378304?s=20">morning tweet</a> from Zerohedge discussing potential causes of a &#x201C;coming Great Depression.&#x201D; At 10:29 a.m. Eastern Time, Spencer <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681310274295599107?s=20">retorted</a>, &#x201C;This is pure fearmongering.&#x201D; He further noted that &#x201C;We&#x2019;re about to have an unfathomably enormous economic boom, not a depression. The average American&#x2019;s standard of living will skyrocket over the next 5-10 years (and it will be 100% sustainable). There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about regarding the economy,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-598472 size-full" title="Unlike Father, Spencer Schiff Calls Depression Warning 'Fearmongering,' Predicts Hyperdeflationary Boom, Bitcoin Crash; Banks on AI Future" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no.jpg" alt="Unlike Father, Spencer Schiff Calls Depression Warning 'Fearmongering,' Predicts Hyperdeflationary Boom, Bitcoin Crash; Banks on AI Future" width="1280" height="425" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no-300x100.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no-1024x340.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no-768x255.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Post Spencer&#x2019;s declaration, a respondent suggested that the junior Schiff placed his faith in AI automation and bitcoin to be the panacea, culminating in &#x201C;deflation.&#x201D; Spencer clarified to this individual that his viewpoint was not influenced by bitcoin. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about bitcoin at all. I don&#x2019;t think bitcoin will have a major impact on the world, and its price will probably fall to near zero over the next few years. My thesis is an AI thesis,&#x201D; he <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681322456030560256?s=20">said</a>. Spencer got a great deal of replies to his statement about bitcoin.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Very weird change of views regarding bitcoin &#x2026; his dad probably told him he will not get any inheritance if he didn&#x2019;t get in line. This kid will get humbled like his dad,&#x201D; a Twitter account called Hornet Hodl <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinHornet/status/1681333477440978944?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;&#x2018;Get in line?&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve moved even further away from his views,&#x201D; Spencer <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681335112879812610?s=20">replied</a>. &#x201C;I used to agree with him about the economy and I thought hyperinflation was coming.&#x201D; Spencer added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now I think a permanent hyperdeflationary economic boom is coming, and the USD will soar in value as productivity, economic output, and our living standards all skyrocket. Also, I don&#x2019;t care about inheritance because it&#x2019;s highly unlikely for there to ever be a situation where I&#x2019;m alive while my dad is not alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>When someone asked Spencer what changed his mind about bitcoin, he <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681349197528809482?s=20">replied</a> &#x201C;AI.&#x201D; Another person asked Spencer, &#x201C;Weren&#x2019;t you shilling bitcoin like 2 years ago?&#x201D; and Spencer replied to that comment as well, saying it&#x2019;s good to change perspectives. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m 20, my views should be expected to have big shifts,&#x201D; Spencer <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681340267691929601?s=20">said</a>. &#x201C;Also, I don&#x2019;t own any financial assets. Not a single penny&#x2019;s worth. But if I did have extra money, I would either keep it in USD (because hyperdeflation is coming) or I&#x2019;d invest in AI companies, or a mix of both.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A glance at Spencer&#x2019;s <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff">Twitter timeline</a> reveals his palpable enthusiasm for AI and software like Chatgpt, as evidenced by the numerous AI news and announcements he retweets. In a subsequent tweet on Tuesday, he reiterated his stance on hyperdeflation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Permanent hyperdeflation will start soon because annual economic output is about to skyrocket, potentially as much as 10x, 100x, or 1,000x over the next decade,&#x201D; he <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681347376533893121?s=20">insisted</a>. &#x201C;The U.S. government can print $35 trillion to pay off the national debt and consumer prices will still plummet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Spencer&#x2019;s tweet about bitcoin garnered <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681322456030560256/retweets/with_comments">significant attention and drew criticism</a> from supporters of the cryptocurrency. While some humorously remarked that the apple doesn&#x2019;t fall too far from the tree, others raised concerns about a possible hack of his account.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Peter himself <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-twitter-apparently-hacked-shills-gold-crypto-son-spencer-warns/">fell victim</a> to a Twitter account breach, prompting Spencer to issue a public warning about the incident. A suggestion arose that Spencer might be <a href="https://twitter.com/boredape3433/status/1681429900643926017?s=20">playfully trolling</a> the crypto community on Twitter, including ardent bitcoin maxis, while secretly maintaining his bullish stance on the digital currency.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Spencer&#x2019;s statements on Tuesday, the following day his father spoke about the turnaround. &#x201C;My son [Spencer K Schiff] is no longer bullish on bitcoin,&#x201D; Peter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/peterschiff/status/1681664026592309250?s=46&t=QE8T9AX8awnighdZd6DQUw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#x201C;As young people typically do, he&#x2019;s lost interest in a passing fad and moved on to something new. In this case, it&#x2019;s AI that&#x2019;s captivated his attention. As bitcoin&#x2019;s young fan base matures many more will grow out of bitcoin.&#x201D;</span></p>

The funds have reportedly been sent to the crypto exchange, Kraken. This occurrence marks the fourth instance of activated <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> ICO tokens this year, with a substantial amount of nearly 80,000 dormant ether awakening and becoming active in 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum ICO Whale Moves $116 Million in Ether After 8 Years of Slumber</h2>
<p>Whale Alert, a blockchain parser, <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1681439947876622336?s=20">alerted</a> the community on July 18, 2023, about the awakening of 61,216 ether following an eight-year period of inactivity. Lookonchain, onchain market observers, also <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1681476159253680128?s=20">tweeted</a> regarding the transaction, highlighting that the user paid approximately $0.31 per ether. The Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) occurred from late July 2014 to the first week of September in the same year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Although the user paid under $20,000 for the ether stash, the funds&#x2019; present value amounts to $116.5 million at current exchange rates. Apparently, the funds were sent to an ethereum address identified as a wallet owned by Kraken. As per Whale Alert metrics, before the substantial transfer of 61,216 ether, 8,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> had been <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/0x777afd69de66609ef7ca5fd5fb96065e4559f1620db17db7bc8fbe31308b5469">moved</a> from an ICO wallet on May 27 of this year.</p>

<p>On April 23, 2023, an additional 2,365 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> from the 2014 ICO became <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/0x8d3d8244799e570c0ff45c7343b44b0f9861a295c41ffb33eab80555c4c112c6">active</a>, following a <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/0x16584d3b87b21d6c0e282ce5c143bca6ad1d417c9f445aebba30097f780c0d73">transfer</a> of 7,900 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> from an ICO participant on April 14. Before these four ICO participants moved a total of 79,481 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> valued at $151.26 million, an individual transferred 2,075 ether on November 23, 2022. Notably, there were three instances of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> ICO activations in November 2022, and an additional awakening took place on October 25, 2022, involving the transfer of 200 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>

<h2>U.S. &#x2018;Regulatory Environment&#x2019; Forces Nasdaq to Postpone Crypto Custody Launch</h2>
<p>In late March, Nasdaq <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nasdaq-aims-to-launch-crypto-custody-services-in-second-quarter/">unveiled</a> its plans to introduce a crypto asset custody service. The company applied for a limited-purpose trust company charter from the New York Department of Financial Services.</p>
<p>Initially, it was reported that Nasdaq would provide custody for bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), with plans to expand to additional cryptocurrencies. However, during a <a href="https://ir.nasdaq.com/events/event-details/nasdaq-second-quarter-2023-results">Q2 earnings call</a>, CEO Adena Friedman stated that the project had been paused.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This quarter, considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the United States, we have made the decision to halt our launch of the U.S. digital assets custodian business and our related efforts to pursue relevant license,&#x201D; said the Nasdaq executive. Friedman elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We continue to build and deliver technology capabilities that position Nasdaq as a leading digital assets software solutions provider to the broader global industry. This includes advancing our custody solution as a technology platform to serve the broader, global digital assets marketplace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action against multiple crypto companies for alleged securities law violations, regulatory pressure has intensified in the U.S. The U.S. regulator has categorized 66 digital assets worth over <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/secs-classification-of-so-called-crypto-securities-amounts-to-98-billion-in-combined-value/">$98 billion</a> as securities.</p>
<p>This prompted several businesses such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bakkt-takes-proactive-measures-delists-polygon-solana-and-cardano-amid-regulatory-crackdowns/">Bakkt</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etoro-to-delist-algo-mana-dash-and-matic-for-us-customers-amid-evolving-regulatory-landscape/">Etoro</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">Robinhood</a> to delist some cryptocurrencies. However, after Ripple Labs and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> secured a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">partial victory</a> regarding programmatic sales, numerous exchanges <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-other-crypto-exchanges-relist-xrp-following-ruling-in-sec-v-ripple-case/">opted to re-list XRP</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>What impact do you think Nasdaq&#x2019;s decision to halt its cryptocurrency custody service might have on the broader digital assets market, and how could it influence future regulatory decisions in the U.S.? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The decline came following Friday&#x2019;s move above $32.00, which took the price to an eight-month high. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> has also rebounded today, and looks to be heading for its recent high over $0.9400.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) was one of Wednesday&#x2019;s notable movers, as the token ended a three-day losing streak.</p>
<p>Following a low of $25.12 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $26.57 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move is the first time solana has trended higher since consolidating a recent eight-month high.</p>

<p>From the chart, today&#x2019;s rebound seems to have occurred as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) bouncing from a floor at 66.00</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is at 69.40, with an upcoming resistance point of 71.00 a possible destination for bulls.</p>
<p>Should this ceiling be broken, there is a good chance that solana could head back towards $30.00.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>Sentiment remained largely bullish in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, as traders once again attempted to push prices above $0.8200.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD jumped to a peak of $0.8155 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, before slipping to a current point at $0.7999.</p>
<p>Since climbing to $0.9479 last week, volatility in the token has skyrocketed, with both new buyers, and profit takers, battling for positions.</p>

<p>Market uncertainty has marginally faded, as a result of the RSI breaking out of a ceiling at 73.00. It is now tracking at 75.07.</p>
<p>Despite the next visible point of resistance being at 89.00, price is already overbought, which could lead to a prolonged sell-off.</p>
<p>As of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> remains largely unchanged at the $0.8000 mark.</p>

In 2022 alone, the number of cryptocurrency users has reached 320 million, identifying a huge potential user base.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is an asset that operates on a blockchain, which has the characteristics of decentralization, peer-to-peer, transparency, and irreversibility. Therefore, cryptocurrency is also highly expected to be applied in the payment field. According to Coinbase&#x2019;s cryptocurrency research report in 2021, as of June 2021, the number of merchants supporting cryptocurrency payments has reached 20 million. In addition, according to Visa&#x2019;s data, in the first quarter of 2022, Visa&#x2019;s payment network processed $2.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions, up from $1 billion in the first quarter of 2021. It is easy to tell that crypto payments are becoming a new trend with great demand.</p>
<h4><strong>Advantages of Crypto Payment and Market Demand </strong></h4>
<p>Compared with traditional payment methods, crypto payment has considerable advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions conducted on-chain in a decentralized, peer-to-peer manner, enabling international transfers and payments.</li>
<li>Involving fewer intermediaries and achieving faster settlement speeds (confirmed within a few minutes).</li>
<li>Lower costs (compared to traditional credit cards&#x2019; fees of 1.5% to 3.5%, crypto payment fees are about 1%).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to cryptocurrency investors and payment consumers, residents of areas with severe fiat inflation, such as Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa, also have a strong interest in holding cryptocurrency to resist inflation.</p>
<p>In fact, from the perspective of the cryptocurrency industry, crypto payments usually include two parts: cryptocurrency consumption payments (using cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services, and cross-border transfers are all included), and the other part is the exchange of cryptocurrency and fiat currency, which provides underlying support for the former and is also a potential new demand for various crypto payment roles.</p>
<p><strong>Individual user demand: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cryptocurrency investors usually need to use fiat currency to buy/sell cryptocurrency to expand investment or exit for cash.</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency consumers usually regard cryptocurrency as a &#x201C;value transfer tool&#x201D; and usually exchange cryptocurrency for fiat currency upon reaching their goals.</li>
<li>Users in high inflation areas like Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, etc. do not want to invest or pay for consumption but simply resist inflation (this part of the area is also a potential market for crypto payment business).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market pain points:</strong></p>
<p>There are high barriers to accessing cryptocurrencies, including complex processes, high fees, and potential risks of being included in money laundering. At the same time, some specific regions&#x2019; users can hardly obtain such services, such as CEX (centralized exchange) platforms, which are the main hub for buying/selling cryptocurrencies, do not serve users in some specific regions.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aac.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230719%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230719T094506Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=7ffe93e57d36ecc58ffe913911121352ad04d9ce9fefdf25f03ff86dbb973e66"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-598510" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aac-768x436.png" alt="" width="768" height="436" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aac-300x170.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aac-1024x582.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aac-768x436.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aac-1536x872.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aac-190x107.png 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aac.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></p>
<p><strong>Enterprise user demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto payments are expected to avoid payment fraud, such as the situations that fraudsters buy goods and then refuse to return them and apply for refunds.</li>
<li>Further expand the consumer base through cryptocurrency, attracting more cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors to become their users.</li>
<li>Explore more business models to obtain additional derivative income.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market pain points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Self-built crypto payment interfaces may lead to asset security problems due to inherent crypto technical issues (e.g. private key leakage, etc.).</li>
<li>It is difficult to track consumer/customer data, including settlement and clearing.</li>
<li>The payment portal lacks fiat/cryptocurrency exchange channels, and the users for crypto payments are usually cryptocurrency investors.</li>
<li>Directly building interfaces has certain compliance issues.</li>
<li>Profits from cryptocurrency in some regions may generate potential capital gains tax.</li>
<li>Third-party payment institutions such as Visa, Mastercard and Paypal can meet enterprises&#x2019; business needs for cryptocurrency payment and settlement, further ensuring compliance and security, but the service fee is high and lacks flexibility. For example, each third-party payment system usually has geographical restrictions and cannot meet the needs of all payers.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Crypto Gateway Products Shine in the Payment Field</strong></h4>
<p>Therefore, from the overall perspective of the crypto payment field, there is a new demand for both individual and enterprise users, and from the perspective of business development, individual and enterprise users are usually bound at both ends of crypto payment. Therefore, a crypto payment infrastructure can better provide related services to these two types of users, and can better promote the overall development of this field, rather than focusing on one type of user and lack of support for another type of user.</p>
<p>Here we can give an example. Suppose we want to purchase <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> and have three needs: paying for an online service, transferring money to overseas friends, and investing in DeFi. One approach is to go to CEX platforms such as Binance and Coinbase and purchase some <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> through OTC (over-the-counter) services, which are usually P2P matching trading services provided by CEX platforms for fiat and cryptocurrency. Then, withdraw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> from the trading platform to different addresses to complete payments and transfers to the target address.</p>

<p>If cross-border remittances and payments are high-frequency behaviors of the user (such as businesses and enterprises), this means that every transaction requires confirmation from OTC merchants, fiat currency payments, and withdrawal reviews from CEX platforms, and each step requires a transaction fee.</p>
<p>Currently, although OTC services dominated by CEX still account for the majority of the market, the industry has also seen some crypto gateway products, which can achieve more convenient and low-threshold fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges through a &#x201C;cross-gateway&#x201D; approach.</p>
<p>Crypto gateway protocols integrate the liquidity of fiat currency deposits and withdrawals from CEX, market makers, and other underlying sources. The deposit side integrates most third-party payment channels (PayPal, Visa, etc.) as entrances, and the withdrawal side supports fiat currencies in most countries worldwide, thus enabling one-stop trading.</p>
<p>Currently, crypto gateway payment protocols that have these functions include Alchemy Pay, MoonPay, Banxa, Ramp.Network, etc., but there are some differences in the breadth of payment methods and regional support, as well as the functions that can be realized.</p>
<h4><strong>Challenges and Hurdles in Operating a Crypto Payment Business</strong></h4>
<p>As mentioned above, crypto gateway products have solved some of the pain points and demand for both individual and enterprise users, and as cryptocurrencies are adopted in more scenarios, crypto payments are taking a rising market share in the payments track. However, from the nature of the crypto payment business itself, the payment products take the role of infrastructure and the industry hurdle is extremely high, making them difficult to implement. The team not only needs to have extensive experience in the payment industry to expand localized payment channels, but also needs to spend a lot of time and effort to deal with security compliance issues with varying standards in different places.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5ac.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230719%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230719T094923Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=cc301af9c5a05affef91b78021ce554f77b8b5498a0d2ef9e5c7f1730f76720e"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-598513" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5ac-768x412.png" alt="" width="768" height="412" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5ac-300x161.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5ac-1024x549.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5ac-768x412.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5ac-1536x824.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5ac.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></p>
<p>Firstly, the variations in financial development, mobile phone adoption, network availability, and electronic payment usage across different countries and regions result in significant disparities in the payment market. In this case, crypto gateways not only need to process payments on a global scale, but also need to be tailored to the specific local conditions. It is a test of the team&#x2019;s ability to demonstrate proficiency in local operations while supporting global payment channels.</p>
<p>In addition, security and adherence to regulations are of utmost importance for payment products, as safeguarding users&#x2019; funds takes precedence. Despite some countries permitting cryptocurrency investments and transactions, the industry faces stringent regulatory requirements. Acquiring the necessary licenses for payment and financial services in various countries and regions is an expensive, intricate, and non-repetitive process. Moreover, the lengthy approval cycles pose a significant challenge for companies operating in the crypto payment business. Currently, less than 1% of web3 companies in the crypto payments sector hold the required licenses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the crypto payment business necessitates the gateway to hold a certain amount of funds. Converting fiat and cryptocurrency funds into and out of the gateway entails a specific time delay, leading to the depositing of both fiat and cryptocurrency funds. To provide users with a seamless real-time payment experience, crypto payment gateways assume the responsibility of facilitating fiat and cryptocurrency fund advances. Without a sufficient flow of funds, maintaining the smooth operation of the payment system becomes challenging for crypto payment gateways.</p>
<p>In addition, technologies such as anti-fraud solutions, KYC and anti-money laundering verification are also important aspects of securing payments, and crypto payment gateways need to be fully integrated with these technologies to help improve security levels. For example, MoonPay, a leading crypto payment gateway, uses Sardine Systems to build the gateway&#x2019;s security and anti-fraud foundation, and Alchemy Pay uses Forter, an e-commerce trust platform, to provide customers and users with higher payment approval rates and chargeback guarantees with the help of artificial intelligence. Another platform it works with, Sumsub, is a cutting-edge solution for user verification in the digital payments industry, which aims to provide multiple layers of protection for payments against all types of document fraud.</p>
<p>At present, Alchemy Pay&#x2019;s Ramp product, which was introduced in June last year, has integrated and supported more than 300 payment channels. This achievement positions it as the crypto payment industry&#x2019;s leader in terms of payment channel coverage, making it a highly representative and influential use case.</p>
<p>The company has a background as a conventional payments firm that boasts a decade-long track record. The core team members possess extensive experience, with most of them having over 10 years of expertise in various aspects of payment-related domains. Established in 2017 and headquartered in Singapore, this company has spent six years accumulating knowledge and building up its operation barrier, resulting in the establishment of a strong foothold as a crypto payment gateway. Generally speaking, it faces a wide range of roles, including consumers, merchants/enterprises, and developer users, and has a cryptocurrency-fiat mixed payment solution.</p>
<p>Alchemy Pay is frequently mentioned in many research articles on the crypto payment field. We will introduce Alchemy Pay Ramp in the following part to provide readers with a better understanding of the current development status of the crypto gateway field and the crypto payment industry.</p>
<h4><strong>What Services Can We Get Through Crypto Gateway Products?</strong></h4>
<p>The crypto gateway is not a new concept. Ripple, established in 2012, laid the early foundation for the development of this track. However, its cross-gateway solution could no longer meet the needs of the current market. Alchemy Pay platform has been involved in crypto gateway business since 2018, focusing on the exchange of fiat and cryptocurrency, and has established an independent deposit and withdrawal system. Other platforms that do the same business include MoonPay, established in 2019, and Ramp.Network, established in 2019 (mainly an entrance gateway).</p>
<p>Although OTC based on CEX is still the preferred choice for many users, we have seen that the market share of gateway products has been gradually increasing since 2018, especially as more and more users are starting to try out these crypto gateway services after many CEXs have experienced trust issues (such as FTX last year), and many users have good experiences and positive feedback.</p>
<h5><strong>On & Off Ramp Service</strong></h5>
<p>From the perspective of individual users, Alchemy Pay Ramp can be used for convenient deposits and withdrawals, where on-ramp is its main entrance for deposits, integrating Mastercard, Visa, Discover and Diners Club (credit cards, debit cards, etc.) from 173 countries, as well as SEPA wallets in the European Union and the United Kingdom, GCash in the Philippines, OVO and Dana in Indonesia, MoMo in Vietnam, PayNow in Singapore, Pix in Brazil, and some local payment providers in Peru, Chile, and Colombia.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-mentioned payment channels, ApplePay and Google Pay have also recently become its payment channels and can support most mainstream fiat payments (including non-US users using USD payment). It is worth mentioning that Visa has also listed Alchemy Pay as an ISO merchant (ISO-M), so the authority of Alchemy Pay in the crypto payment track is increasing, and the user group that its ramp product faces is extremely broad.</p>
<p>The off-ramp function supports users to exchange cryptocurrencies for more than 50 local legal currencies in over 50 countries, including USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, INR, PHP, and THB, through the above payment channels.</p>

<p>The highlight of Alchemy Pay Ramp is its convenience and efficiency. Its product logic is similar to that of Web2 products, and we only need three basic steps to complete deposits and withdrawals. For example, with on-ramp, the user selects the type of fiat currency to be paid and the cryptocurrency to be purchased, fills in the receiving address and selects the payment methods to complete the purchase, while with off-ramp the process is similar. Individual users can enjoy convenient and efficient withdrawals and deposits by completing a simple KYC process, and Alchemy Pay has compliance filters in place for its integrated payment channel providers.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8ac.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230719%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230719T095357Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=b0b4572bf3edd844c45748de1f8a586cb84e2dc716e0201d7a5cf4caf707181b"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-598516" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8ac-768x305.png" alt="" width="768" height="305" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8ac-300x119.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8ac-1024x406.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8ac-768x305.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8ac-1536x609.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8ac.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></p>
<p>Most gateway products currently only support custodial accounts and require platform approval to withdraw funds. Alchemy Pay Ramp supports users with a non-custodial address, which is better in terms of cost of use, efficiency and the product itself is closer to Web3. In terms of crypto purchase access, crypto gateway products have an excellent advantage in how it works and it is sure to be the main narrative of the payment field for a long time.</p>
<h5><strong>Crypto Payment Solutions for Enterprise Users</strong></h5>
<p>Aside from individual users, Alchemy Pay also provides the best support for enterprise/merchant users. These business users can directly add Alchemy Pay to their payment/receiving list using the plugins or APIs provided by Alchemy Pay Ramp, and directly use on-ramp and off-ramp to provide payment/exchange services for their users. By integrating Alchemy Pay Ramp, business users can further guarantee security, compliance, and efficiency, and reduce the potential costs of crypto payments without the need for third-party settlement and clearing institutions. Of course, this approach also reduces development costs, as adding a payment interface is extremely complex and risky from a payment perspective.</p>
<p>Currently, Alchemy Pay Ramp is also providing services for Web3 applications (DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi, NFTFi, etc.), supporting the direct purchase of Web3 services via local fiat currency. For example, its NFT Checkout, which is currently launched, can provide faster access to NFT for sale on NFT-related platforms and makes it easier for users to purchase NFT. Its partners currently include LooksRare, Vega, etc. In addition, Alchemy Pay has also established partnerships with networks such as Polygon, Avalanche, Algorand, and Arbitrum, and these ecological applications and developers are expected to receive support from Alchemy Pay Ramp.</p>
<h5><strong>Safeguarding Funds Through Compliance</strong></h5>
<p>Crypto gateway products usually need to obtain compliance support because they become the direct place for the exchange of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Most gateway products currently have made certain breakthroughs in compliance.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9ac.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230719%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230719T095536Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=683438d5032ff7fd851c83dafcbabad6e68b4821fde0a0c5018a39466387a3d2"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-598517" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9ac-768x490.png" alt="" width="768" height="490" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9ac-300x191.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9ac-1024x654.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9ac-768x490.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9ac-1536x980.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9ac.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></p>
<p>For example, Alchemy Pay has a wide layout in some areas with more potential for the development of cryptocurrencies, including Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and holds licenses such as Type 1,4,9 Financial Services License issued by SFC of Hong Kong, Canada and United States MSB license, the license from the Central Bank of Indonesia to operate remittances and fund transfers, and Lithuanian Cryptocurrency Exchange & Wallet License. It also indirectly obtains compliance support through cooperation with some local payment providers in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and other regions. In addition to Alchemy Pay, many other projects that play in the same field, such as MoonPay, Ramp.Network, Banxa, etc., also perform well in compliance.</p>
<p>The promotion of the compliance of crypto gateway products has a great promoting effect on the adoption of cryptocurrencies in payments, especially when it can give high support on the risk control (such as Alchemy Pay achieve high-intensity anti-fraud and risk control through Forter), and the acceptability of cryptocurrencies will be greatly improved.</p>
<h4><strong>Crypto Payments Industry Backed by Blue Ocean Market</strong></h4>
<p>The crypto payment industry is a blue ocean market space. According to Euromonitor International&#x2019;s report on the global payment market, the current global payment scale exceeds 175 trillion US dollars, and commercial payment amounts account for a high proportion. Currently, the number of cryptocurrency holders is exponentially increasing every year, approaching 300 million people in the current, and these users are expected to become potential users of crypto payments. Therefore, based on these facts and with the continuous improvement of the crypto payment infrastructure, crypto payments are expected to enter a period of rapid development in the future.</p>
<p>From another perspective, cryptocurrencies are becoming the &#x201C;lifesaver&#x201D; for users in high inflation areas, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These users maintain a high enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and intend to use cryptocurrencies to reduce financial risks. Overall, these regions are potential markets for crypto payments, and the crypto attempts in El Salvador and the Central African Republic are undoubtedly revolutionary. We have reason to believe that economically underdeveloped regions have stronger demand for cryptocurrencies and greater potential.</p>
<p>Currently, Alchemy Pay has a high penetration rate in these regions, especially in the Latin American and Southeast Asian markets,and offers a more competitive service through access to more localized channels.</p>
<p>In the future, with the further improvement of crypto technology (such as ZK, flow payments, etc.) and the introduction of relevant crypto regulations, crypto payments may become an indispensable and important part of our lives, and will form a deep complementarity with traditional payments.</p>
