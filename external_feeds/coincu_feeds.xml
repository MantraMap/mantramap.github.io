<p>Kraken, known for its high trading volume, <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/product/asset-listings/brick-and-moon-trading-starts-today-on-spot-and-futures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incorporated</a> support for these tokens on August 7, igniting a positive response in the market.</p>



<p>The announcement by Kraken stated that users can now engage in trading the two <a href="https://coincu.com/203618-reddit-community-tokens-skyrocket-over-300-in-just-two-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit-based cryptocurrencies</a> on its platform, encompassing both spot and futures markets. Trading can be conducted through USD and EUR trading pairs and on Kraken Pro. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the inclusion of trading on the Kraken App and the Instant Buy feature is on the horizon, contingent upon market entry and platform liquidity.</p>



<p>Notably, these tokens can be deposited solely through Arbitrum Nova, which predominantly hosts them. While trading commencement specifics remain unclear, users could initiate deposits immediately after the announcement.</p>



<p>Moons and Bricks are integral components of Reddit&#8217;s Community Points initiative, which rewards users for generating high-quality content. Moons are associated with r/CryptoCurrency, catering to a user base exceeding 6.5 million, while Bricks are linked to the gaming subreddit r/FortniteBR.</p>



<p>In the past 24 hours, MOON <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced</a> a remarkable 45% surge. Similarly, BRICK <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bricks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observed</a> an impressive 88% increase in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>The move by Kraken to list MOON and BRICK comes after subtle indications by the exchange&#8217;s support team, sparking anticipation within the <a href="https://coincu.com/194304-reddit-crypto-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit community</a>. </p>



<p>Following the back-and-forth, which boosted MOON holders&#8217; expectations for acceptance, the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com <a href="https://coincu.com/203781-crypto-com-integrates-reddits-moons-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumped</a> in and decided to support the token a few days later.</p>

<p>According to th<a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202308083745B" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202308083745B" rel="noreferrer noopener">e Korea Economic Daily</a>, the CEO allegedly orchestrated the embezzlement of a staggering 10 billion won (approximately US$7.6 million) in deposits and investment funds, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>The charges stem from a web of alleged misdeeds. The CEO stands accused of manipulating computer systems to artificially inflate the prices and trading volumes of virtual assets from January 2019 to May 2021. This maneuver is said to have been designed to mask mounting losses when faced with investor withdrawal demands that couldn&#8217;t be met.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-422.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-422.png" alt="Bitsonic CEO Arrested For Alleged 10 Billion Won Asset Theft" class="wp-image-208979" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-422.png 640w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-422-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="Bitsonic CEO Arrested For Alleged 10 Billion Won Asset Theft 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Prosecutors further allege that in an attempt to hide the truth about the precarious financial situation, the CEO resorted to transferring both cash and virtual assets worth 10 billion won. This transfer was reportedly facilitated by selling crypto-locked products to unsuspecting customers, compounding the web of deceit.</p>



<p>Additionally, the CEO is charged with obstructing his official duties while holding the position of vice president of technology at Bitsonic, leading to an intensification of the legal troubles he now faces.</p>



<p>The Bitsonic CEO&#8217;s trial will undoubtedly be closely watched by both the cryptocurrency community and regulatory bodies alike. The outcome of this case will likely have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry&#8217;s credibility and the measures implemented to curb fraudulent practices.</p>

<p>The decision, if executed, would render the company&#8217;s operations management systems and customer service inaccessible, potentially impacting its user base significantly.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202308083797B" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202308083797B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> predicament</a> stems from the South Korean crypto-finance company&#8217;s complex financial situation, further exacerbated by the restrictions imposed by the bankruptcy court. South Korean crypto-finance company revealed that a range of fees, crucial for the company&#8217;s continued operation, require pre-approval from the court. These fees encompass network hosting, labor costs, and other essential expenses. Despite filing for permission to pay these fees, the court&#8217;s final approval remains pending, leaving Delio in a precarious position.</p>

<p>The critical deadline of August 11 has been marked as the potential turning point for South Korean crypto-finance company&#8217;s web hosting service. Failure to settle the outstanding service fee by this date could result in a suspension of the service, further plunging the company into operational uncertainty. </p>



<p>Delio finds itself under the scrutiny of the Korean virtual property crime joint investigation team. Allegations of cryptocurrency fraud involving Delio, Haru Invest, and WeMade have prompted an investigation, casting a cloud of suspicion over the companies&#8217; activities. This development adds a layer of complexity to Delio&#8217;s ongoing challenges, potentially influencing the course of its future.</p>

<li><em>Gedu Datacenter thrives with 11,000 stable miners, and growth continues.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitdeer Technologies, a Singapore-based Bitcoin mining company founded by Jihan Wu, has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/07/2720183/0/en/Bitdeer-Announces-July-2023-Operations-Updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved</a> a significant milestone by completing the construction of its mining facility in Bhutan.

<p>Linghui Kong, the CEO of Bitdeer, shared that around 15,000 new mining machines were delivered to their Gedu data center in Bhutan in July.</p>



<p>In their latest update for July, <a href="https://coincu.com/203859-bitdeer-dominates-vaneck-crypto-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitdeer</a> reported advancements in both operational and infrastructure aspects.

Notably, Bitdeer mined 220 Bitcoins through its self-mining business in July, representing a remarkable 41% increase compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s proprietary hash rate surged to 7.9 EH/s by the end of July, propelled by the arrival of new mining machines in Bhutan. Approximately 23,000 newly-purchased mining machines were delivered to the <a href="https://coincu.com/195155-bitdeer-100mw-gedu-datacenter-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gedu Datacenter</a> as of the end of July, with an additional 7,000 machines en route. The construction of the Gedu Datacenter has been successfully concluded, with power-on testing underway.</p>



<p>As of August 7, a substantial 11,000 mining machines were operational and stable. This progress not only signifies Bitdeer&#8217;s commitment to growth but also positions them as a prominent player in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining.</p>

<p>The transaction occurred a mere 45 minutes ago and has stirred intrigue due to its magnitude and the entities involved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Justin just yoinked $200M USDT out of JustLend (the USDT he has taken from Huobi) back to his personal wallet, and then transferred to a new address…<br><br>Feeling some heat your excellency? <a href="https://t.co/khywV9Qxn7" target="_blank">https://t.co/khywV9Qxn7</a></p>&mdash; Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1688733773938995201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Adam Cochran, a respected partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, has cast a spotlight on the situation by identifying the enigmatic recipient of the transfer. Cochran stated that the recipient address was allegedly linked to none other than Sun Yuchen, a prominent figure in the blockchain space and the founder of TRON.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="982" height="632" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png" alt="JustLendDAO&#039;s 200M Transfer Raises Justin Sun Connection" class="wp-image-208943" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png 982w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-300x193.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-768x494.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-750x483.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" title="JustLendDAO&#039;s 200M Transfer Raises Justin Sun Connection 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What adds to the intrigue is that after the initial transfer to Sun Yuchen&#8217;s purported personal wallet, another transfer of 200 million USDT swiftly followed, this time to an entirely new address. This sequence of transactions has fueled conjecture about the motives behind such a substantial and swift movement of funds.</p>



<p>Analysts and industry insiders are buzzing with theories about the significance of this transfer and its potential implications for JustLendDAO, TRON, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The identity of the new address remains shrouded in mystery, prompting heightened curiosity among enthusiasts and investors alike.</p>

<p>This significant transfer has sparked speculation about the motivations behind Sun&#8217;s movement of funds from JustLend to Huobi, particularly as Huobi&#8217;s USDT reserves have concurrently surged. Records indicate that Huobi&#8217;s USDT reserves have witnessed an impressive upswing, rising from approximately $85 million to an impressive $285 million.</p>

<p>The timing of this transfer is noteworthy, considering recent developments at Huobi. The platform has been undergoing scrutiny following investigations involving its executives.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD employs advanced security, allowing Paxos to halt functions during threats and legally freeze criminal assets.</em></li>



<li><em>With 26.9 million coins issued, it integrates with Venmo and third-party wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD launch leads fintech in embracing digital currencies for payments, reshaping financial norms.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recent information available on GitHub <a href="https://t.co/zKc5NoYwXr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sheds</a> light on PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin, PYUSD, revealing robust security protocols. In the event of a significant security threat, Paxos, the underlying technology, has the capability to suspend both the authorization and transfer functions of PYUSD.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-1024x631.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="631" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-1024x631.png" alt="PayPal Stablecoin PYUSD May Be Freeze by Paxos If It Has A Serious Security Threat" class="wp-image-208933" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-1024x631.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-300x185.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-768x473.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-750x462.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-1140x702.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="PayPal Stablecoin PYUSD May Be Freeze by Paxos If It Has A Serious Security Threat 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, Paxos can lawfully freeze or seize assets linked to criminal activities. AssetProtectionRole permissions enable designated addresses to initiate freezing, unfreezing, or even clearing the balances of specific accounts, as indicated in a report by <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1688748340979306498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wu Blockchain</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Paxos clarified its stance, stating that it would not execute freeze operations directly, and such instances are expected to be exceedingly rare. Similar to PYUSD, stablecoins USDT and USDC incorporate a comparable blacklist-freezing mechanism.</p>



<p>Paxos officially disclosed the contract address of PYUSD, PayPal&#8217;s US dollar stablecoin, as 0x6c3ea9036406852006290770BEdFcAbA0e23A0e8.</p>



<p>On-chain data <a href="https://coincu.com/208906-pyusd-by-paypal-issued-26-9m-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlights</a> the issuance of 26.9 million coins held by 8 owners, with 175 transactions recorded since its launch.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, PayPal <a href="https://coincu.com/208826-paypal-pyusd-new-stablecoin-u-s-dollar-deposits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> headlines by unveiling its U.S. dollar stablecoin, marking a pioneering step among major financial technology firms in adopting digital currencies for payments and transfers.</p>



<p>Despite stablecoins&#8217; existence for years as crypto tokens tethered to stable assets to mitigate volatility, their integration into mainstream consumer payment ecosystems has remained limited.</p>



<p>Access to <a href="https://coincu.com/208865-paypals-pyusd-connected-to-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PYUSD</a> will gradually become available to U.S.-based PayPal customers, with users of the Venmo payment app also gaining access. Future plans include enabling individuals to hold PYUSD in third-party digital wallets like MetaMask, enhancing the coin&#8217;s accessibility and usability.</p>



<p>This strategic move by PayPal underscores the company&#8217;s commitment to exploring the potential of stablecoins and expanding their adoption in the digital financial landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cathie Wood predicts a delay for ARK Invest&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF approval and cites potential SEC simultaneous approvals.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC&#8217;s possible move to approve multiple Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously could balance the demand by $50 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>Market leaders like BlackRock, Fidelity explore Bitcoin ETFs; Grayscale advocates fairness in the approval process.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ARK Invest&#8217;s CEO and CIO, <a href="https://coincu.com/201934-cathie-woods-ark-invest-cuts-coinbase-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cathie Wood</a>, anticipates the likelihood of a delay in the approval of ARK Invest&#8217;s proposed spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408.png" alt="SEC May Approve Multiple Bitcoin ETFs Worth $50B At The Same Time: ARK Invest CEO" class="wp-image-208922" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="SEC May Approve Multiple Bitcoin ETFs Worth $50B At The Same Time: ARK Invest CEO 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>Wood&#8217;s statement highlighted her expectation that the SEC would not meet the upcoming review deadline for the fund. According to Wood, the SEC might approve multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs concurrently, departing from its past reluctance.</p>



<p>In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/cathie-wood-says-sec-will-approve-multiple-bitcoin-etfs-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, she suggested that if the SEC decides to move forward with any pending applications, it could approve more than one ETF. ARK Investment Management, known for its active participation in cryptocurrency, submitted a Bitcoin ETF application in June, and Wood noted the possibility of several approvals simultaneously.</p>



<p>Initially asserting a leading position for potential approval due to the timing of their application, ARK now aligns with the idea of a level playing field for ETFs. Wood&#8217;s revised stance could foster demand for upwards of $50 billion across various ETFs.</p>



<p>Market giants such as <a href="https://coincu.com/206478-blackrocks-bold-move-partners-with-jio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/202622-fidelity-fires-up-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/196656-wisdomtree-enters-spot-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WisdomTree</a>, VanEck, and Invesco have all submitted applications for similar products to ARK&#8217;s proposed Bitcoin ETF. Differentiating these similar offerings will hinge on the issuers&#8217; marketing strategies, according to Wood.</p>



<p>The push for spot Bitcoin ETFs gains momentum as prominent asset management companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, pursue BTC ETFs. Additionally, <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale</a>, a significant cryptocurrency investor, urges the commission to consider approving all proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously.</p>



<p>Wood&#8217;s perspective resonates with Grayscale&#8217;s proposal to avoid granting an advantage to any particular ETF. Grayscale, in legal conflict with the SEC regarding its Bitcoin Trust application, recommends concurrent approvals to ensure fairness among ETF applicants.</p>
