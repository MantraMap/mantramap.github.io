<p>Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse believes a ruling in its costly lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is coming soon. Garlinghouse expects a verdict in weeks and not months after the recent court news concerning the Hinman documents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-suit-could-be-over-sooner-than-you-think"><strong>XRP Suit Could Be Over Sooner Than You Think</strong></h2>



<p>Bradley Garlinghouse has hinted that a court case resolution is coming immediately after the release of the infamous William Hinman materials.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPnewt/status/1661547535062769669">interview </a>at Redefine Tomorrow 2023 summit, Garlinghouse revealed that in terms of where things currently stand in the courtroom war with the SEC, he is confident of getting a decision in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ripple CEO pointed to the recent court ruling where the SEC’s motion to keep Hinman documents under wraps was rejected by a federal judge.</p>



<p>Back in 2021, Ripple cited the landmark Hinman speech as an indication that the SEC does not deem Bitcoin or Ethereum as a security, contending that XRP should not be classified as a security either. The crypto payments firm then<a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1355212300861513728"> filed for Freedom of Information Act request</a> which would uncover docs explaining how Hinman came to this conclusion.</p>



<p>At the time, the SEC responded by claiming Hinman&#8217;s speech represented his personal opinions and not the agency’s policy. To that end, the SEC wanted to shield the documents relating to this speech from the public eye while also arguing that the materials are protected by a statute that grants privacy for internal deliberations. </p>



<p>But as <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">reported </a>recently, the court believes that these speech drafts and emails are judicial documents and should be made public. The move was viewed as a key win for Ripple, which believes that these internal deliberations and discussions are key evidence in its ongoing litigation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hinman Emails To Give Ripple The Upper Hand?</strong></h2>



<p>Commenting on the upcoming unmasking of the Hinman materials, pro-Ripple attorney John E Deaton <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1660061091525787650">noted</a>:</p>



<p>“I can’t wait for these emails to be released. I predict even non-XRP holders, including Ripple critics, will have to objectively say that what the SEC did is flat-out wrong. The inquiry about the motive behind this lawsuit will go into a higher gear — mark my words.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spectators are now waiting for the summary judgment decision after completing all the briefings. Garlinghouse’s comment that he expects a verdict in weeks’ time is being interpreted by some in the XRP community as an indication that he anticipates a favourable decision by the presiding judge.</p>

<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community has been buzzing with excitement following the leak of the SHIB burn portal on Shibarium, the ecosystem&#8217;s upcoming layer-2 network.</p>



<p>On Sunday, May 21, the pseudonymous Twitter user “SHIB INFORMER” shared a preview of the user interface of the burn mechanism in Shibarium, giving the Shib army a glimpse into what&#8217;s to come.</p>



<p>According to the leaked information, the burn portal&#8217;s interface suggests that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-beckons-as-shibarium-launch-proves-to-be-a-game-changer-for-shib/">Shibarium</a> will facilitate swapping accumulated BONE tokens for Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, which will then be sent to the burn address. This aligns with the original concept of charging transaction fees in BONE tokens. Notably, these fees will be accumulated until a certain threshold is reached, at which point any user will be able to initiate the burn transaction.</p>



<p><em>“The transaction fees destined to burn will be accumulated up to a certain amount and then the Burn will be triggered. My current understanding is that anyone will be able to trigger it after the threshold is reached,”</em> tweeted SHIB INFORMER, sharing the image below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="747" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-1024x747.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81328" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-1024x747.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-300x219.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-768x560.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-324x235.png 324w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the burn process will be manual rather than automatic. Users will play an essential role in triggering the burn transaction once the accumulated threshold is met. The leaked interface is currently in the alpha testing stage, indicating changes may occur before the public <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">beta phase</a>.</p>



<p>The burning mechanism aims to support the burning campaign of SHIB tokens. According to documentation by the Shiba Inu team, Shibarium plans to burn 70% of its base transaction fees in SHIB, with the remaining 30% allocated to network maintenance. This approach is expected to significantly impact the token&#8217;s supply, which is theoretically expected to boost SHIB’s value to the much-coveted $0.001 price point.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, LucieSHIB, a content marketing specialist within the Shiba ecosystem, acknowledged the authenticity of the leaked images and clarified that they represent the alpha version of the mechanism, with the possibility of changes being implemented upon its official launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Note that it is only the alpha version (not beta yet), So the final version may be different, but it&#8217;s good for a look. BONE will convert to SHIB and burn SHIB,”</em> tweeted Lucie, adding, “<em>Each transaction will add to the burn pool. Then anyone will be able to trigger the burn.”</em></p>



<p>Notably, as the Shibarium team continues to make significant developments ahead of its official release, whales have begun accumulating SHIB tokens in the hope that Shibarium&#8217;s developments have the potential to make a significant impact on the token&#8217;s price. According to data from IntoTheBlock, whales have amassed over 26 trillion SHIB tokens in the past week.</p>



<p>That said, the notable progress made on Shibarium has been a boon for the SHIB token, which was trading at $0.000008459 at press time, down 0.49%&nbsp;over the past last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>On Monday, the Malaysian Securities Commission (SC) <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/media/media-release/sc-takes-enforcement-action-against-huobi-global-for-illegally-operating-dax-in-malaysia">ordered </a>Seychelles-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global to cease activities in the country.</p>



<p>The regulator said Huobi was operating a digital asset exchange in Malaysia without the appropriate registration. Operating a crypto exchange without a Recognised Market Operator (RMO) license is a crime under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-huobi-terminates-crypto-services-in-malaysia"><strong>Huobi Terminates Crypto Services In Malaysia</strong></h2>



<p>The SC has served a public reprimand against one of the largest and most trusted crypto exchanges globally, Huobi, and its founder Leon Li. As the company’s CEO, Li has been mandated to supervise the process of winding down local activities, discontinuing any advertisements to Malaysian investors, disabling the website, and removing the mobile application from app stores.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huobi&#8217;s Malaysian investors have been urged to withdraw all their investments from the platform and close their accounts.</p>



<p>The SC’s statement says the enforcement action against Huobi was driven by “concerns about the platform’s compliance with local regulatory requirements and protecting investors’ interests.”</p>



<p>Malaysia&#8217;s securities regulator further encouraged citizens to stop trading with cryptocurrency exchanges in the country illegally.</p>



<p>At the press time, the native token of Huobi Global, Huobi Token (HT), is trading hands at $2.95, up by 1.21% in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huobi is presently the fourth-largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, according to CoinGecko. The exchange has fallen foul of Malaysia&#8217;s markets regulator in the past. Back in August 2022, the Securities Commission Malaysia warned Huobi of operating without a license and <a href="https://twitter.com/SecComMalaysia/status/1561662707572822017">added </a>it to a list of companies not permitted to operate in the country. At the time, Huobi claimed that it was in talks with Malaysian regulators about its regional operations.</p>



<p>The Malaysian regulator’s action marks the latest blow to the crypto industry, which has been facing regulatory pressure from various countries in the world — most notably the United States. The U.S.’s lack of clarity and regulation by enforcement has spooked many crypto companies and investors, who are already looking to relocate to other friendlier jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The Ethereum protocol recently experienced two incidents in which its Beacon Chain stopped finalizing blocks. This occurred on May 11, 2023, when the network was unable to fully confirm transactions for about 20 minutes and again on May 12, 2023, for over an hour.</p>



<p>Generally, block finality refers to a state where a supermajority of validators have attested to the final state of the blockchain, guaranteeing that a block and its processed transactions cannot be modified or eliminated from the blockchain.</p>



<p>Block finality implies that a block of data has been added to a blockchain with some negligible probability of being reversed or altered. Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum show probabilistic transaction finality in that transactions are not automatically or instantly final, but the probability of being reversed decreases as more blocks are added to the chain.</p>



<p>During the two finality incidents, Ethereum end users successfully continued to transact on-chain through the incident. Ethereum Developers released patches to resolve the block finality incidents but said an analysis was underway to determine the root cause of the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a May 21, 2023 blog, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin cautioned against overloading Ethereum consensus beyond its core functions of validating blocks and securing the network, as this could bring high systemic risks to the ecosystem. In the same blog, Buterin called for preserving the chain’s minimalism and helping developers find alternate strategies to achieve their security goals.</p>



<p>The Ethereum protocol has undergone several major upgrades and improvement plans to make it more robust and reliable.</p>



<p>In September 2022, the Merge upgrade was implemented. In the Merge, the Ethereum protocol moved from its original proof-of-work mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The merge aimed to make the Ethereum protocol less energy-intensive, more secure, and better suited to implementing new scaling solutions.</p>



<p>In November 2022, Buterin outlined an updated Ethereum protocol roadmap in line with its vision of enhancing scalability, security, and sustainability. Buterin said that the Ethereum protocol is undergoing several system upgrades and will ultimately enter a state of relative stability that optimizes safety and predictability.</p>



<p>According to Buterin, the Ethereum protocol roadmap consists of six parallel running upgrades: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.</p>



<p>Another upgrade known as the Ethereum ‘Shapella’ upgrade was implemented in April 2023. The Shapella upgrade enabled stakers to unstake ETH and validators to withdraw previously staked ETH. The Shapella upgrade was implemented with other Ethereum Improvement Proposals, including reducing gas fees during peak network periods.</p>

<p>In a blow to Ripple, one of its attorneys in the long-running legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Kylie Chiseul Kim, has called it quits. This departure comes as the XRP community expects a summary judgment ruling any day now.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-the-departure-mean-for-the-case"><strong>What Does The Departure Mean For The Case?</strong></h2>



<p>Attorney Kylie Chiseul Kim has left Ripple Lab’s legal team as the case drags on.</p>



<p>According to the letter filed in the Southern District of New York, Kylie noted that she would no longer have any association with Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel &amp; Frederick, P.L.L.C., the law firm presently representing Ripple. The filing indicated that other lawyers from the same law firm and those from Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP would continue being counsel for the defendants. Notably, Kylie’s motion was granted by the court.</p>



<p>Kylie has long been a key member of the team representing Ripple since July 2022. She was hired alongside Clayton J. Masterman as Ripple was still battling the 2020 XRP lawsuit with the SEC. The U.S. regulator <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">accused </a>Ripple, co-founder and former CEO Chris Larsen, and current CEO Brad Garlinghouse of misleading investors by raising over $1.3 billion in unregistered securities offerings of the XRP token. The onboarding of these two attorneys at the time was viewed as a move to bolster Ripple’s legal team for an expected lengthy legal fight.</p>



<p>Kylie’s surprising departure has left many wondering whether it seals Ripple’s fate in the case. There were mixed reactions to the news of her leaving Ripple’s defence team. Nonetheless, the majority believe her exit had nothing to do with Ripple and did not reflect her view of Ripple’s stakes in the lawsuit but was related to her quitting her former law firm.</p>



<p>The departure, nonetheless, comes as the crypto community anxiously awaits the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">unsealing</a> of the “Hinman documents” on June 13. These docs relate to a 2018 speech given by former SEC Director William Hinman and emails associated with writing it. In the speech, Hinman declared that Ether was not a security due to its decentralized nature. These documents are believed to tip the scales in Ripple’s favour as the company endeavours to prove that XRP should not be considered a security.</p>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon is back in custody after a Montenegrin high court annulled a lower court’s decision to allow Kwon to be released on bail.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-kwon-s-436k-bail-scrapped"><strong>Do Kwon’s $436K Bail Scrapped</strong></h2>



<p>Do Kwon and former chief financial officer Han Chong-joon are back in jail, per a <em>Bloomberg </em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro#xj4y7vzkg">report</a>.</p>



<p>This comes after the high court of Montenegro in Podgorica nullified a decision from two weeks ago to release Kwon and Han to house arrest on 400,000 euros ($436,000) bail each.</p>



<p>After the Basic Court in Montenegro granted the pair bail, prosecutors in the case swiftly appealed the decision. Court spokeswoman Marija Rakovic told <em>Bloomberg</em> that the matter will now head back to the lower court, which must make a decision taking into consideration what the higher court decided.</p>



<p>Kwon and Han were charged with using a fake passport in Montenegro after attempting to travel to Dubai from Podgorica in March with fake Belgian and Costa Rican passports. The two defendants maintain that the passports were issued legally.</p>



<p>TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin designed by Terraform Labs, imploded last spring along with governance token Terra (LUNA), erasing over $40 billion in investors’ wealth and triggering a snowball crisis in the crypto industry last year. Shortly after the catastrophic Terra ecosystem collapse, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/singapore-high-court-approves-liquidators-probe-into-three-arrows-capital-assets/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-offers-to-bail-out-voyagers-customers-but-at-a-price/">Voyager Digital</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-1-month-of-halting-customers-withdrawals-giant-crypto-lender-celsius-goes-bankrupt/">Celsius </a>all declared bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the forgery charges, Do Kwon is also facing criminal fraud charges in the U.S. and also back in his home state South Korea. S. Korea issued an arrest warrant against him last September, alleging that he violated capital market laws. As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-could-be-thrown-in-jail-for-40-years-in-south-korea/"><em>ZyCrypto </em></a>previously covered, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-could-be-thrown-in-jail-for-40-years-in-south-korea/">faces up to 40 years in jail</a> in South Korea, the country where he supposedly committed most of his crimes.</p>



<p>U.S. prosecutors in New York have charged Kwon with eight counts, including commodities fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to manipulate the market. </p>



<p>In the meantime, both the U.S. and South Korea have sought to extradite the Terraform Labs boss from Montenegrin authorities.</p>

<p>Amid legal tensions and murky regulations in the United States, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-may-have-just-bitten-off-more-than-it-can-chew-as-ripple-eyes-very-big-win-in-case/">Ripple</a> has seemingly decided to expand overseas. The San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm has reportedly acquired a stake in the European cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-expands-european-foothold"><strong>Ripple Expands European Foothold</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple Labs is continuing to make power moves.</p>



<p>According to Galaxy Digital’s First Quarter 2023 report, Ripple purchased shares of Bitstamp — one of the world&#8217;s oldest and most established crypto exchanges — which were previously held by crypto VC firm Pantera Capital.</p>



<p>Galaxy says it advised Pantera to sell its stake in Bistamp to Ripple in Q1. It’s unclear how much the acquisition cost Ripple. Bitstamp is currently the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in terms of trading volume, with around $163 million worth of cryptocurrencies traded in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>This Ripple purchase deal comes as Galaxy Digital’s Investment banking team posted stellar growth in the past year, fortifying its position as a leading investment bank for digital assets post-FTX.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Does The Acquisition Mean For XRP?</strong></h2>



<p>The purchase grabbed the XRPArmy&#8217;s attention, who uncovered that Pantera had previously invested in both Ripple Labs and Bistamp.</p>



<p>Notably, Bitstamp is presently the second-largest market for XRP after Binance. Additionally, the exchange previously served as a gateway for Ripple, enabling entry into RippleNet. As we speak, XRP now accounts for 30% of the total trading volume on Bitstamp, with the XRP/Euro pair being the most popular.</p>



<p>The community is trying to make sense of why Ripple proceeded with the deal, as neither the payments firm nor Bitstamp has made an official statement on the matter. Some speculate that the acquisition may be connected to Ripple’s objectives for its Liquidity Hub (LH) or On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that Ripple’s popular ODL solution uses XRP to settle transactions, while the LH does not include the token.</p>



<p>While the specific details and importance of the deal will probably be revealed at a later date, it signals Ripple’s move to boost its offerings further, considering its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">recent acquisition</a> of Switzerland-based crypto custody firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-expands-into-the-institutional-crypto-custody-market-following-250-million-acquisition-of-metaco/">Metaco for $250 million</a> in tokenization push. Whether the latest Bitstamp deal boosts XRP liquidity remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Billionaire investor, “Shark Tank” personality, and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban shared a proposal on Tuesday about how cryptocurrency tokens should be decentralized in the future to avoid being on the receiving end of SEC enforcement actions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cuban-s-proposal"><strong>Cuban’s Proposal</strong></h2>



<p>It all started when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked Grayscale to pull its application to make its Filecoin Trust product more akin to a public company, warning that its underlying asset, Filecoin (FIL), &#8220;meets the definition of a security.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mark Cuban commented on a tweet regarding Filecoin being labelled a security by the SEC and shared some tips on how future crypto-focused firms could become completely decentralized to avoid facing lawsuits from the U.S. regulator for securities violations.</p>



<p>The American billionaire investor <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1661093100490567680">noted </a>that cryptocurrency-issuing companies should consider releasing all their supply without retaining a portion as a treasury. According to Cuban, the released tokens should be used to provide liquidity using DeFi, and the original entity that issued the tokens should thereafter be dissolved. In his view, rogue regulators like the SEC will not be able to “close the token down” alleging it&#8217;s a security as it has done with cryptocurrencies like FIL, and XRP, as there will be “true decentralization”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Holders’ Lawyer Agrees</strong></h2>



<p>John E Deaton, a prominent pro-crypto lawyer and legal representative of XRP holders, has concurred with Mark Cuban’s suggestion. Deaton <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1661175392122617856">posited </a>that it is “smart and probably in someone&#8217;s playbook at the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the CryptoLaw founder emphasized that the crypto community must continue pushing against the false narrative propagated by the SEC that the underlying asset in an investment contract is a security.</p>



<p>The SEC claims that Ripple distributed 14.6 billion units of XRP and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>the company and its former and current CEO, Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, respectively, for failure to register XRP as a security, which is a requirement for the public offering and sale of securities. </p>



<p>Ripple has historically maintained a distance from XRP, but any progress in the long-standing lawsuit has had an impact on the token’s prices. Most recently, XRP surged after a federal judge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">ruled </a>that the SEC cannot seal materials tied to former official William Hinman&#8217;s 2018 speech on ether not being a security. Access to these emails would mean Ripple attorneys can discover how Hinman came to that determination, which could influence XRP’s classification as a security.</p>



<p>Deaton recently <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1660301659887616000">noticed </a>that XRP was in fact, discussed between SEC staff just before the Hinman speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The community should keep a keen eye on June 13, 2023, where we will learn to what extent this will affect the XRP suit, which is when the Hinman documents are set to be <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1659606951938998294">unsealed</a>.</p>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, has overtaken Bitcoin (BTC) as the most traded asset on the largest South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, Upbit and Bithumb.</p>



<p>For the second consecutive day, XRP, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has managed to outshine Bitcoin in trading volume signalling the growing popularity of XRP among Korean investors and a potential change in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>



<p>Currently, XRP maintains its position as the highest-ranked cryptocurrency in terms of daily trading volume. It recorded approximately $208 million daily trading volume on UPBIT and $50 million on Bithumb. In comparison, Bitcoin had a trading volume of $96 million on UPBIT and $27 million on Bithumb during the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>XRP&#8217;s rise to dominance can be attributed to several factors. Ripple&#8217;s strategic partnerships with major Korean financial institutions such as GME, South Korea’s largest remittance service firm and major exchanges have played a crucial role in fostering the adoption of XRP. </p>



<p>Additionally, XRP&#8217;s unique attributes, such as its fast transaction speed and low fees, as well as the ability to facilitate seamless cross-border payments, have made it an appealing choice for Korean traders seeking efficient and cost-effective crypto transactions.</p>



<p>Additionally, the increasing popularity of XRP can be attributed to investors placing their confidence in Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">potential victory</a> in the ongoing legal battle against the SEC. The two-and-a-half-year legal dispute involves the SEC accusing Ripple and two of the firm&#8217;s top officials of violating US securities laws by selling XRP as an unregistered security. On the other hand, Ripple has continually maintained that XRP should be classified as a digital currency, not a security.</p>



<p>As the legal case approaches its conclusion, investors are growing more optimistic about Ripple&#8217;s chances of winning, with the expectation that the SEC will lose key arguments. Such an outcome could potentially drive XRP&#8217;s price to new heights.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that this surge in XRP&#8217;s popularity is not the first of its kind in South Korea. Last month, XRP witnessed an extraordinary surge in trading volumes, reaching billions of dollars on three prominent Korean exchanges, UpBit, Bithumb, and Korbit. Notably, from January 1st to April 18th, the total value of XRP traded in Korea exceeded a staggering $16 billion. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, XRP’s significant increase in trading volume aligned with a price rally of approximately 2% over the past 24 hours. The token currently trades at $0.46, reflecting an overall gain of just over 8% within the past week. On the other hand, Bitcoin was trading at $26,717, down just over 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Cardano, the blockchain platform known for its focus on sustainability, security, and scalability, has achieved a significant milestone in its staking ecosystem. Recent reports indicate that the total value of ADA tokens staked on the Cardano network has reached impressive new heights.</p>



<p>The entire value of ADA tokens held in Cardano&#8217;s staking mechanism has surpassed 430 million, according to data from DeFiLlama. This accomplishment demonstrates the rising faith and confidence in Cardano&#8217;s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus process, which enables ADA holders to actively contribute to the network&#8217;s security and profit from doing so.</p>



<p>Holders of ADA can assign their tokens to a pool through Cardano&#8217;s staking mechanism and earn rewards based on their stake. Users that engage in staking help the network become more decentralized and secure while generating passive revenue through ADA awards. Staking has grown in favour among fans of cryptocurrencies as a substitute for traditional mining, which frequently uses a lot of processing power and energy.</p>



<p>There are several reasons why the total amount of ADA staked on Cardano has increased significantly. First, investors interested in the environment looking for more eco-friendly alternatives to energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) networks have been drawn to Cardano because of its commitment to sustainability. Cardano is a PoS blockchain that uses much less energy yet is exceptionally secure.</p>



<p>The tremendous increase in staked ADA coins is a measure of the Cardano ecosystem&#8217;s strength and maturity. By spreading ADA ownership among more stake pools, more staking participation improves network security. In addition, due to its decentralization, Cardano is more resistant to potential attacks and lowers the possibility of a single point of failure.</p>



<p>Additionally, less ADA is left over for trading when more tokens are staked. A supply-demand imbalance brought on by this decreased supply could boost the market value of ADA. Investors that decide to stake their ADA tokens gain from possible price growth in addition to making a network contribution.</p>



<p>Cardano is an energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol that offers and enhances the security assurances of proof-of-work. To ensure the integrity, longevity, and performance of the protocol and the distributed networks it supports, Ouroboros uses cryptography, combinatorics, and mathematical game theory.</p>



<p>Cardano&#8217;s Ouroboros protocol randomly chooses leaders, or validators, to verify blocks and increase their chances of being selected again. Similar to Bitcoin, after 3-5 approvals, operations are regarded as reliable. The amount of ADA staked impacts the likelihood of becoming a leader, with greater ownership raising the possibility. The algorithm guards against manipulation by taking into account the influences on individual decisions. The validation process involves both validators and verifiers. The protocol is still being improved despite concerns about its viability and use.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, at least at one point the world’s richest man, has issued a grim warning about the original meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>



<p>Speaking at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit in London on May 23, the eccentric billionaire <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-05-23-2023/card/don-t-bet-the-farm-on-dogecoin-elon-musk-says-3w5HNJM4zaycGPD5CNKd">cautioned </a>investors not to allocate all their money to DOGE. “I’m not advising anyone to buy crypto or bet the farm on Dogecoin,” Musk posited.</p>



<p>Despite this warning, the Tesla/SpaceX CEO reaffirmed that Dogecoin remains his favourite crypto in the entire digital currencies market because “it has the best humor and has dogs”. Musk also noted that the most ironic outcome for global currencies would be if a meme coin created merely as a joke emerged as the global currency. As you are well aware, DOGE was invented as a joking tribute to the “doge” meme of a Shiba Inu dog. The idea was to poke fun at the largest and oldest crypto asset, Bitcoin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-musk-s-history-of-endorsing-and-pumping-dogecoin"><strong>Musk’s History Of Endorsing And Pumping Dogecoin</strong></h2>



<p>Musk is known for manipulating the price of dogecoin in the past through his intriguing remarks, actions, and Twitter posts. The self-proclaimed “Dogefather” even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spacex-and-dogecoin-an-uncommon-alliance-to-create-dogestronauts/">planned </a>to bring DOGE to space with a SpaceX satellite launch. Dogecoin developers have also revealed in the past that Chief Twit Musk actually sat in on development calls as they discussed how they would revamp the meme coin. </p>



<p>The entrepreneur still <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1503222294277197829">owns dogecoin</a>, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to his tweets from March last year. Musk even bought some DOGE for his youngest son, X Æ A-Xii, in 2021.</p>



<p>There was speculation that the Tesla boss would soon integrate a permanent Dogecoin payment system on Twitter, the social media giant he overpaid for (<a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-bulls-go-all-in-as-billionaire-dogefather-elon-musk-finally-closes-on-44b-twitter-deal/">$44 billion</a>). However, DOGE’s integration has not yet materialized, leaving fans in a state of great disappointment.</p>



<p>Early last month, Musk <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-soars-over-25-after-elon-musk-replaces-twitters-logo-with-shiba-inu-image/">replaced Twitter’s classic blue bird logo with a sprite of DOGE</a>, triggering a 25% spike in the token’s price — only to remove the Dogecoin logo days later.</p>



<p>Dogecoin dropped sharply today after Musk said not to put life savings in DOGE. The OG meme coin was down 2.8% at the time of writing, trading for $0.071, according to CoinGecko data.</p>



<p>DOGE is currently trading 90.25% lower than its May 2021 all-time high of $0.73.</p>

<ul>
<li>Joe Biden takes a swipe at cryptocurrency traders and “wealthy tax cheats”, insisting they remain undeserving of tax cuts and similar benefits.</li>



<li>The comments have drawn speculations among industry executives on the stance of the White House as budget negotiations resumed on May 22.</li>



<li>Joe Biden reiterated his commitment to ensuring the country does not default on its debt to prevent a looming economic meltdown.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The Biden administration has maintained a tough stance against digital assets over the years. The first blow landed on miners and then traders. How far will the administration stretch this anti-crypto rhetoric?</p>



<p>Joe Biden <a href="https://zycrypto.com/biden-throws-crypto-traders-under-the-bus-in-debt-deal/">criticized</a> digital asset traders and <em>wealthy tax cheats</em> as he wrapped up the G7 summit in Japan. Speaking at a press conference, the President insisted that these crypto traders are not worthy beneficiaries of the tax cuts proposed by Republicans.</p>



<p><em>“Let me be clear, I&#8217;m not going to agree to&#8230; a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly 1 million Americans,&#8221; </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“It&#8217;s time for Republicans to accept that there&#8217;s no bipartisan deal to be made solely on their partisan terms,</em>&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Strong indicators have been that some Republicans are pushing to support “<em>tax loopholes” </em>to aid digital asset investors, including miners. In Biden’s $6.9 billion budget plan, the President has stressed the importance of restructuring the rules relating to digital assets to protect Americans.</p>



<p>The comments come in as budget negotiations intensify ahead of the United States deadline to raise the debt ceiling or risk defaulting on her debts for the first time. Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin Macarthy agreed to resume negotiations on Sunday to prevent an “<em>economic catastrophe as few as 11 days away.&#8221;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dame-tax-is-only-the-first-kick">DAME Tax is only the first kick</h2>



<p>This year, the White House <a href="https://zycrypto.com/white-house-makes-case-for-30-crypto-mining-tax-cites-economic-and-energy-factors-as-key-drive-behind-policy/">released</a> a proposed 30% tax on digital asset miners coupled with a report justifying its position. The administration based the decision on the amount of energy consumed in mining digital assets adding that it creates a hardship for American communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others. It encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,”</em> the report reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposed DAME tax will come into effect in 2024 and will require miners to pay a 10% tax before it grows to 30% in subsequent years. The digital asset community has criticized this move as an attempt to stifle the growth of the sector with many saying the administration has “<em>misplaced priorities.”</em></p>



<p>With the President&#8217;s recent comments, many wonder where the line will be drawn after proposing new regulations, miners&#8217; and trader&#8217;s taxes, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol, Uniswap, has announced its decision to expand its operations onto the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polkadot-tops-rivals-in-developer-activity-following-influx-from-solana/">Polkadot network</a> via the &#8220;Moonbeam&#8221; parachain in a momentous move that promises to revolutionize the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene. This strategic choice could usher in a new era of cross-chain liquidity, improving the DeFi ecosystem&#8217;s effectiveness and scalability.</p>



<p>Uniswap hopes to take advantage of the special features and interoperability provided by Polkadot by utilizing the Moonbeam parachain, thereby providing seamless connectivity with other blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem. The announcement has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community, with industry experts applauding Uniswap&#8217;s pioneering decision. This strategic move is expected to bring about a myriad of benefits, including increased liquidity, reduced transaction costs, enhanced scalability, and improved overall user experience within the DeFi space.</p>



<p>With Uniswap&#8217;s connection with Polkadot through Moonbeam, users can transact assets between blockchains without difficulty. The limits now imposed by segregated blockchains are eliminated by this interoperability, enabling users to access a larger pool of assets and trading opportunities.</p>



<p>Decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts can be created more easily because of the developer-friendly environment offered by the Moonbeam parachain, based on the Polkadot network. When Uniswap uses the Moonbeam parachain, it has access to Polkadot&#8217;s robust infrastructure, security features, and scalability solutions, all of which strengthen and improve the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>The move further emphasizes the rising significance of cross-chain solutions and interoperability within the blockchain sector. Bridging the gap between various blockchains is becoming increasingly crucial for realizing the full promise of decentralized finance as the crypto industry continues to develop and mature. Adding Polkadot to Uniswap establishes a precedent for other DeFi protocols and initiatives, inspiring them to investigate cross-chain partnerships and capitalize on interoperability.</p>



<p>Users can anticipate the exciting potential for smooth asset transfers, effective cross-chain liquidity provision, and cutting-edge financial products thanks to Uniswap&#8217;s participation in the Polkadot network. The adoption of cutting-edge protocols on well-known blockchain networks like Polkadot lays the door for a more integrated and vibrant ecosystem as the DeFi market expands and changes.</p>



<p>Finally, Uniswap&#8217;s plan to expand its company to Polkadot via the Moonbeam parachain is a huge step forward in the evolution of decentralized finance. Uniswap is leading a new wave of innovation in the DeFi industry by embracing interoperability and cross-chain liquidity. The partnership between Uniswap, Polkadot, and Moonbeam has the potential to reshape the future of decentralized finance, unlocking unmatched opportunities for users and catapulting the industry to greater heights as the market eagerly awaits the implementation of this ground-breaking move.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-expands-into-the-institutional-crypto-custody-market-following-250-million-acquisition-of-metaco/">cryptocurrency market</a> has continued to face a period of cautious sentiment as historically low levels of weekly trading volume persist this quarter.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has remained stagnant, trapped within a tight range that started on May 11. This lack of volatility has extended to Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, contributing to overall market weakness. However, despite these prevailing market conditions, Bitcoin enthusiasts have keenly watched various pivotal developments that could potentially shake up the market.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, May 23, renowned onchain analyst Onchain Edge highlighted an intriguing insight for traders from the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). According to the former Ernest &amp; Young (EY) analyst, aSOPR (30DMA) has surged above 1.0 and is retesting the area, signalling a potential bull run.</p>



<p>As ZyCrypto previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-kicks-off-march-in-the-green-as-crypto-markets-see-favorable-capital-inflows/">reported</a>, this indicator has historically proved efficient, with price rallying after the ratio moves above the 1.0 mark and vice versa. According to the pundit, Bitcoin could face a major bull run, akin to the 2020 and 2021 ones, if this ratio stays atop that level.</p>



<p><em>“Want to know when to buy or sell Bitcoin? When aSOPR (30DMA) is above 1.0, it signals a profitable &amp; strong market. Now the aSOPR is at another critical support level at 1.01. This was the level from which BTC started the 2020/21 rally.”</em> Tweeted Onchain Edge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="630" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1024x630.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81244" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1024x630.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-300x185.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-768x473.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1536x946.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-356x220.png 356w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Elsewhere Glassnode, another data analysis firm, likewise shared insight into the ongoing decline of the Bitcoin balance on exchanges. As per the firm, the current epoch has recorded a decline of -680K BTC. This represents a 28% decline from its peak of 3.2M BTC at its peak in 2020 to the current balance of 2.3M BTC. It is important to note that when Bitcoin leaves exchanges, it reduces the likelihood, which, in turn, may contribute to upward price pressure as the scarcity of available Bitcoin increases.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, various industry experts have also begun speculating that Bitcoin may have reached a bottom. Rekt Capital, a well-known figure in the crypto space, highlighted the formation of an &#8220;exaggerated&#8221; bullish divergence on the Daily RSI (Relative Strength Index). According to him, this potentially positive sign hints at the possibility of upside movement.</p>



<p><em>“A potentially positive sign for some upside movement, however important to realize that the key resistance to beat is $27,600,”</em> he tweeted.</p>



<p>Material Indicators, another onchain analyst termed the ongoing sideways movement by BTC a “healthy consolidation”, which he noted strengthens the current zone as a key resistance/support area. He went on to highlight the importance of the 100-Day MA holding as strong support while cautioning that breaking the 200-Week MA could pose difficulties in reclaiming previous levels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81245" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, as the crypto community eagerly awaits the market&#8217;s next move, all eyes are on Bitcoin&#8217;s price action and its ability to stand its ground against bearish pressures. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,178, up roughly 1.65% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>
