<p>Lawyers of Voyager Digital were taken aback when Binance.US called off its deal to acquire the assets of the insolvent crypto lender on Tuesday. The deal had been approved by a judge last week in the bankruptcy court.</p>



<p>Voyager will now have to distribute cash and crypto to customers using its platform following Binance.US’s about-face.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprised"><strong>“Surprised”</strong></h2>



<p>Voyager attorneys were “surprised” Binance.US <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917">terminated </a>its asset buy deal.</p>



<p>In a bankruptcy court in the Southern District Court of New York on Wednesday, the lawyers posited that the exchange was still displaying interest as recently as last week.</p>



<p>“The debtors have been in constant contact and communication with Binance.US, and as lately as this past Friday, Binance.US had expressed the desire to close the transaction as soon as possible,” Christine Okike of law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, representing Voyager, stated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Binance.US Nuked Voyager Deal</strong></h2>



<p>Binance backed out of its deal to acquire Voyager’s assets due to what it described as a “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” Following the termination of the deal, recoveries for Voyager’s creditors will likely be in the range of 40% to 65%, Okike noted. This depends on whether Voyager wins a parallel suit involving now-defunct digital asset exchange FTX and how much recovery FTX offers its creditors.</p>



<p>Voyager was among multiple crypto companies to go under last year after the abrupt fall of Terra’s LUNA governance token and the UST algorithmic stablecoin. The crypto broker declared bankruptcy on July 5.</p>



<p>A number of regulators sought to block the deal, which would have allowed Voyager customers to become Binance.US customers. That included the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Trade Commission, the Texas State Securities Board, and the Texas Department of Banking.</p>



<p>Binance.US’s withdrawal comes after its international affiliate found itself in the cross-hairs of regulators in the United States. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">launched </a>a lawsuit against Binance last month, accusing the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume of violating derivatives rules. In fact, some <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1650941963955236887">speculated </a>that Binance.US’s decision to pull out of the Voyager agreement could be part of the conditions of a forthcoming settlement with the CFTC.</p>

<p>The Bahamas is gearing up to tighten its crypto regulations in a bid to protect investors after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire — largely based in the nation— was swiftly wiped out last November.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stiffer-crypto-regulation-incoming-following-ftx-collapse"><strong>Stiffer Crypto Regulation Incoming Following FTX Collapse</strong></h2>



<p>Months after the implosion of FTX put the Bahamas on the spot, the Caribbean nation is preparing to impose more stringent regulations on crypto assets, as per an April 25 <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf">statement </a>from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB).</p>



<p>The laws, packaged in the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) bill, including expanding the definition of digital assets businesses, measures on stablecoins, proof-of-work mining, as well as covering crypto services such as advice, derivatives, and crypto staking.</p>



<p>Under the new rulebook, “operators of a digital asset exchange must ensure the systems and controls used in its activities are adequate and appropriate for the scale and nature of its business.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Bahamas, which passed crypto laws previously dubbed the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act in 2020, was home to Bankman-Fried and his once multi-billion-dollar digital asset exchange FTX, which went under last year. FTX’s new CEO John Ray III has since accused the Bahamian government of directing unauthorized access to the exchange to obtain digital assets that should be under the control of FTX. </p>



<p>Moreover, Bankman-Fried was also accused of using corporate funds to purchase luxury penthouses in the island nation. The disgraced CEO has pleaded not guilty to charges brought against him for his role in the astonishing FTX collapse, and his criminal trial is set to take place in October.</p>



<p>Ms. Christina Rolle, Executive Director of the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, noted that once passed, the proposed DARE legislation would become “among the most advanced pieces of digital asset legislation in the world and will align with The Bahamas’ commitment to facilitating development and innovation in a well-regulated environment.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bahamas Prohibits Algorithmic Stablecoins</strong></h2>



<p>In order to prevent another crypto disaster, the Bahamas&#8217; regulator is also banning the issuance of algorithmic stablecoins in response to last May’s collapse of TerraUSD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you can recall, the blowup of the Terra ecosystem, which stemmed from the depegging of UST from the U.S. dollar, ignited a deep downturn that obliterated investors’ funds and also undermined the reputation of the entire cryptocurrency sector. It also triggered a domino effect that saw many other prominent crypto-focused firms experiencing liquidity problems or filing for bankruptcy protection.</p>



<p>Specifically, the upcoming regulation will introduce “a new and comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins” whose value is tied to the United States dollar or another stable asset.</p>



<p>Public consultation for the new bill will run until May 31, and the regulator hopes it will become law by the end of the second quarter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin, which has steadily climbed about 70% since the start of 2023, was trading hands at a price of $29,728.28 at press time.</p>

<p>A class action lawsuit brought against Ripple four years ago by investors who claim that XRP is a security is set to continue.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Crypto Law, a regulatory news website for digital assets, provided the update noting that a hearing on the case will take place on April 26 in a California federal court where parties in the Zakinov v. Ripple lawsuit will be heard.</p>



<p>The website further noted that only 500 members of the public should be allowed online access to the proceedings. As per the announcement, “the hearing is for oral arguments on the question of certifying the class of XRP holders suing Ripple.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Background to the Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-suffers-a-serious-blow-as-court-denies-ripples-motion-to-dismiss-securities-lawsuit/">The lawsuit</a> was brought against Ripple and Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, by the plaintiff in 2019, Vladi Zakinov, and two other individuals through investor Bradley Sostack, the lead plaintiff in the consolidated lawsuit.</p>



<p>As per the plaint, Vladi Zakinov sued the defendants claiming that XRP is an unregistered security, after suffering a considerable loss from the sale of XRP in January 2018. The plaintiff also sought to ratify the case into a class action lawsuit that generally included all persons or entities who purchased XRP. However, the defendants maintained that XRP is not a security asking the court to dismiss the claim. </p>



<p>As per the announcement by Crypto Law, today’s hearing will be for oral arguments on the question of certifying the class of XRP holders suing Ripple.</p>



<p><em>“The plaintiff, Bradley Sostak, who owned XRP for two weeks, is asking to be lead plaintiff in the class and is asking to represent all XRP holders who either owned it and sold it at a loss or own it today,”</em> Crypto Law wrote.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, John Deaton, who had previously filed an amicus brief on behalf of 75K+ XRP holders in the case, commented that he intends to follow the proceedings, although his motion is yet to be ruled on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-battle-with-the-sec"><strong>Ripple’s Battle With The SEC</strong></h2>



<p>That said, as Ripple battles out the case, the community is still focused on what will come from the firm’s parallel battle <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-has-the-sec-failed-to-legally-prove-that-xrp-is-a-security-this-web3-lawyer-thinks-so/">with the SEC</a>. With most of the briefs finalized now, it is expected that Judge Analisa Torres could deliver a summary judgement soon.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the ongoing legal battles have increased dilemmas among investors torn between selling their holdings or waiting for the ruling. Nonetheless, with SEC’s apparent onslaught on the crypto sector despite the lack of sufficient regulations, most observers believe Ripple could bag a win, helping XRP to break new ground.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.47, up 3.26% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Announcing the move Tuesday, Solana Labs noted that the new plugin would let users interact with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-smartphone-set-for-early-may-sales-here-are-its-exciting-features/">Solana</a> network directly from ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Chat GPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, a company that was co-founded by billionaire Elon Musk in 2015. Since its launch last November, ChatGPT has quickly garnered global popularity due to its AI-powered chatbot, which generates sophisticated responses to just about any prompt. From passing tough exams in various fields such as business, medicine and law, many now see ChatGPT as revolutionizing work.</p>



<p>To this end, various industries have started to leverage this technology, including players in the crypto sector who seek to enhance user experience and make their products more accessible.</p>



<p>The new ChatGPT plugin allows developers to build AI-powered applications on top of the Solana network, opening up a wide range of possibilities for businesses and individuals alike. It is also important to note that the new reference implementation is fully open-source, meaning anyone can use it to build their applications.</p>



<p>Solana Labs further noted that once ChatGPT plugins are available, users will be able “to check wallet balance, transfer tokens, and purchase NFTs,” sharing a screenshot on what to expect.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1m-grant-from-ai-developers"><strong>$1M Grant from AI Developers</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, earlier today, the Solana Foundation announced that it would be allocating grants to ecosystem teams building AI tools atop Solana. According to the non-profit, such individuals or teams can seek a grant from a $1M fund which aims to give each project from $5,0000 to $25,000.</p>



<p><em>“Solana&#8217;s high throughput and scalability provide a unique opportunity to build brand new ideas with AI. These grants are meant to encourage the Solana ecosystem to explore new use cases of these novel technologies,”</em> the foundation tweeted.</p>



<p>That said, Solana (SOL) has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-predicts-why-solana-could-bounce-back-even-better/">on a tear</a>, soaring over 8% in the past 24 hours to trade at $22 at press time as investors met the announcement with great enthusiasm. Despite suffering incessant network outages, Tuesday’s announcement represents a significant milestone for Solana, considering AI can enhance user experience and improve the network&#8217;s overall health.</p>

<p>On April 24, 2023, the European Central Bank (ECB) published the findings of focus groups and in-depth interviews in all euro area countries from December 2022 to January 2023. The study aimed at soliciting views on the features of a potential digital wallet targeted a cross-section of participants ranging from the general population, the tech-savvy, merchants, and the underbanked.</p>



<p>According to the study, the underbanked category was the only target group uncomfortable with adopting a new digital payment solution. Awareness and knowledge of digital wallets within the underbanked groups were generally low. The focus groups also found that the underbanked had general mistrust of the banking system. The underbanked also carried out most transactions using cash.</p>



<p>As per the ECB study, the underbanked were defined as participants who may hold a bank account but rarely use banking services or other payment apps and direct debits. The underbanked were low-income earners who considered a bank account an unnecessary additional cost. The underbanked who had a smartphone used them mostly for making and receiving calls, using social apps, and playing games.</p>



<p>The focus groups found that the underbanked did not have worthwhile reasons to learn how to use digital banking services for fear that their knowledge would soon be obsolete. The underbanked acknowledged society’s gradual shift from cash and recognized they would have to deal with digital payments at some point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some underbanked imagined having a digital wallet but would not use it for large sums of money to limit their losses in case of any problems. The study found that younger respondents were more willing than older respondents to adopt the digital wallet.</p>



<p>On April 20, 2023, the European Union (EU) Parliament approved the first rules to trace crypto-asset transfers, prevent money laundering, and common supervision and customer protection rules. The <em>“travel rule already used in traditional finance will require information on crypto asset transfers to be stored on both sides of the transfer.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) is the EU’s proposed regulatory scheme that aims to cover issuers of crypto assets, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) and to protect crypto asset holders.</p>



<p>Crypto proponents have argued that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) can enable the underbanked and the unbanked to access opportunities and products not traditionally available to them via traditional finance.</p>



<p>Although proponents have argued that cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide easy access to financial services to the underbanked, opponents of cryptocurrency believe that there are other ways to address financial inclusion rather than through cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The global NFT market has seen a significant downturn recently, with various platforms and investors feeling the impact. As the hype surrounding NFTs subsided last year, the market experienced a correction, leading to a decline in trading volumes and valuations.</p>



<p>OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces, has been hit particularly hard, with its valuation now facing a significant cut by one of its most prominent investors, Tiger Global. According to a recent report by The Information, Tiger Global, a $13 billion tech-focused venture fund, recently disclosed that its equity in OpenSea has dropped from $126.8 million to $30.2 million, representing a 76% drawdown. The firm became one of the largest investors in OpenSea when the NFT platform raised $300 million during a Series C round earlier last year. </p>



<p>Last December, the firm reported a 20% paper loss, with over half of that drawdown coming from its crypto-related investments. The New York-based firm established its venture fund in 2021 before placing sizeable bets on blue-chip crypto startups. Some other notable firms that the firm had reportedly dabbled in include Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs, MoonPay, and FTX, which went under last November, completely wiping out the firm’s investment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFTs Tank Alongside Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the number of NFT projects growing to record highs in the past year, the overall income of the industry has been dwindling as crypto prices dump. In the past year or so, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, have dipped by over 70%, a scenario that could have triggered a loss of interest in NTFs.</p>



<p>In its recent report, Tiger Global valued OpenSea at just $3Billion, despite the popular NFT marketplace hitting a $13.3 billion valuation at the height of NFT mania last year. This value drop has been largely attributed to the drop in NFT sales plummet and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blur-vs-opensea-battle-for-nft-marketplace-supremacy-rages-on/">increased competition</a> from rival platforms like Blur.</p>



<p>But OpenSea is not the only casualty of the NFT market downturn. Other platforms, including Rarible, have also seen a decline in trading volumes and valuations. Meanwhile, high-profile NFT sales have slowed, with many artists and collectors holding back as the market cools off.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-is-still-hope"><strong>There Is Still Hope</strong></h2>



<p>That said, despite the downturn, there are still reasons to be optimistic about the future of NFTs. According to a recent report by DAPP Radar, despite a disappointing end to the year 2022, NFTs had a strong Q1 2023, with a 137.04% increase in trading volume to $4.7 billion, the highest since Q2 2022.</p>



<p>This renewed growth has been fuelled by the launch of new marketplaces and protocols such as NFTFi, which seek to bridge the gap between DeFi and NFT ecosystems by introducing various approaches to unlock liquidity for NFTs.</p>

<p>Hidden in all versions of the Apple MacOS since 2018, a copy of the original Bitcoin white paper penned by the pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto will not be part of the next update, Apple-focused news publication <em>9to5Mac </em>has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/25/apple-removes-bitcoin-whitepaper-from-macos/">reported</a>.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shockingly-bitcoin-whitepaper-has-been-hidden-inside-mac-computers-for-years/"><em>ZyCrypto </em></a>reported about three weeks ago, a post from prominent technologist Andy Baio revealed that a PDF copy of Satoshi’s Bitcoin white paper had been shipped in every version of MacOS from Mojave to Ventura.</p>



<p><em>“Of all the documents in the world, why was the Bitcoin whitepaper chosen? Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple?&#8221; Baio asked on his blog Waxy. &#8220;Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The document was hidden within Virtual Scanner II, which was not enabled by default. The file went unnoticed by the tech giant’s millions of users and was believed to be a joke among Apple engineers or even included as a subtle endorsement of Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. It even prompted self-proclaimed (and much-contested) Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright, who has long attempted to copyright the Bitcoin white paper and has been suing places that host it, to <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_CSWright/status/1643882093875740673">suggest </a>that Apple was breaching his copyright.</p>



<p>However, Apple has now removed the document from the latest version of the Mac operating system. A look at the Beta Software Program, upcoming version 13.4 of MacOS Ventura, shows it does not contain the entire Virtual Scanner 11 tool, which may have been included in the system for testing purposes. The white paper was located in hidden system files and was not intended to be discovered by everyday users.</p>



<p><em>“This pretty much confirms our original theory that both the Bitcoin white paper and the internal tool were never meant to be found by regular users,” 9to5Mac observed.</em></p>



<p>Alongside Satoshi’s white paper was a nondescript image of a sign at Treasure Island in San Francisco.</p>



<p>The enigma surrounding the inclusion and subsequent scrapping of the Bitcoin white paper from macOS remains unanswered. With Apple remaining mum on the subject, the crypto community is left to weigh the implications and the stance of the world’s largest tech company.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC has surged over 8% in the past 24 hours following the news of First Republic Bank’s share slump. </li>



<li>The price gain was recorded across the board as the top 25 digital assets by market capitalization bounced positively with BTC.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Technical indicators show that BTC may continue to rally after gradually breaking the correlation from the S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have hit new highs in April, not recorded in recent months, with bulls keeping up the pressure in the light of the recent traditional financial institution’s debacle.</p>



<p>The price of BTC has moved in an upward trajectory after the news of more woes at First Republic Bank. BTC is up by 8.88% over the last 24 hours, breaking past $28,500 and exchanging hands at $29,839 at press time.</p>



<p>Jake Boyle, a director at crypto brokerage Caleb &amp; Brown, gave his opinion on the issue, highlighting that banking failures led to a new positive outlook.</p>



<p>“<em>With First Republic Bank looking like it could go under, I suspect the market is anticipating yet more liquidity injections to prop up what certainly seems to be an American banking sector that is still very much in the throes of crisis,&#8221; </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The price rally <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_willemsen/status/1650969375707365376?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">sparked </a>off hours after Fox Business Reporter broke the news that bankers working with the institution expect it to go into government receivership. A receivership is a corporate restructuring model that allows creditors to recover funds and firms to avoid bankruptcy.</p>



<p>Other assets in the top 25 also recorded slight gains, with Solana leading the pack with 9%. Leading altcoin ETH gained 7.36% after sliding below $1,900 in a recent price correction which wiped away gains from the Shanghai upgrade. Dogecoin, Polkadot, and Polygon also recorded slight gains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoins-break-away-from-stocks">Bitcoins break away from stocks</h2>



<p>For a greater part of 2022, BTC and stock prices saw a prior correlation as Feds continued to hike interest rates forcing investors to abandon risky assets. New data from crypto analytics firm Santiment suggests that the correlation between BTC and the S&amp;P 500 may take a back seat as investors begin to see Bitcoin as a haven amidst the current traditional banking woes.</p>



<p>First Republic Bank was first reported to be in crisis in March, resulting in top banking institutions, including JPMorgan depositing $30 billion in the embattled bank. Later that month, the US authorities debated creating an emergency lending facility to help with the structural changes in the bank’s balance sheet.</p>



<p>On April 23, the bank announced its Q1 earnings, showing that deposits had plunged by over $100 billion while seeking to pursue “strategic options” to salvage the situation. </p>

<p>Bitcoin has continued to come under pressure, tagging along with Ether and other cryptocurrencies amid regulatory concerns for the crypto sector and profit-taking activities.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,978, down 8.06% since it tapped a ten-month high of $31,000 on April 14. On the other hand, Ether was exchanging hands at $1,859, down just over 13% in the past week, with <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-dogecoin-and-cardano-mount-center-stage-this-month-heres-what-to-expect/">most altcoins</a> being hammered a little bit more.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s gradual decline has led some analysts to focus on cues to help foretell its next possible move.</p>



<p>According to Brian Q, senior market analyst at Santiment, investors should look out for Bitcoin’s utility metric even as the cryptocurrency gets torn between revisiting $30,000 or $25,000. In his view, <em>“without a rising number of coins moving from address to address, and without a rising number of addresses interacting with those rising coins, most price rallies are historically short-lived.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80159" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>He further noted that bull traps often occur when prices rise quickly but utility lags, a scenario that arose in the first quarter of 2023.</p>



<p><em>“Traders become FOMO&#8217;ers and buy into the inflating market caps, and then get blindsided when the rally comes to a quick halt shortly after they bought. We can see that this occurred with the 3-month pump at the beginning of 2023,” </em>he added<em>.</em></p>



<p>On that note, Brian highlighted three more metrics traders should watch out for in determining Bitcoin’s utility. According to him, traders should closely monitor trading volume, daily active addresses, and circulation. While these metrics have not been impressive recently, he emphasised that on-chain utility conditions need to improve for the cryptocurrency’s price to recover.</p>



<p>Despite utility metrics displaying lacklustre behaviour, other vital metrics such as whale activity and the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) have been surging, suggesting increasing interest in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Today, crypto analyst Hoss shared a chart by Glassnode showing that whales with more than 10,000 BTC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/data-highlights-massive-btc-accumulation-by-whales-as-extreme-fear-grips-bitcoin-price/">have been accumulating</a> rapidly while smaller addresses are selling.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the MVRV, an indicator that has historically proven excellent at detecting major tops or bottoms, has recently tapped an 11-month high. This observation was made today by Gaah, an analyst for Santiment who expressed hope for its continued rise.</p>



<p><em>“There is still room to continue the Bitcoin price recovery, causing MVRV to reach the yellow line (intermediate region &#8211; trend transition phase) around 2.10,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p><em>“By projecting the market behaviour of the last bear market in 2018, the Bitcoin price later this year 2023 has great chances to reach $45,000 and build a bullish structure transitioning between the bear market to a new bull market,” </em>he went on, adding that <em>“the probability of new highs in 2023 is still there.”</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Ethereum Transitions Into A Proof of Stake Blockchain After Successful Merge" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>The price of Ether (ETH) has taken a significant hit in the past few days, dropping by over 13% after tapping a ten-month high of $2,137 earlier this month. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has fallen by 1.4% and was trading at $1,826 at press time, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>



<p>Ether’s recent price action can largely be attributed to the Shanghai or <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-and-bitcoin-prices-hold-steady-post-shanghai-upgrade/">Shapella upgrade</a>, which was implemented on April 12. The event enabled withdrawals of approximately $34 billion worth of tokens locked on Ethereum’s staking contracts, marking the network’s complete transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ether-withdrawals-soar"><strong>Ether Withdrawals Soar</strong></h2>



<p>Almost two weeks after Shanghai, Ethereum’s metrics have continued to shine, with 1,668,384 ETH worth just over $3 billion being withdrawn so far, as per data by Dune Analytics. Notably, around 65% of the total ETH withdrawn so far comes from partial withdrawals, while the rest is from full withdrawals.</p>



<p>According to Tom Wan, an analyst at crypto research firm 21 Shares, most Ether withdrawals seem to be coming from centralized exchanges such as Kraken and Coinbase.</p>



<p>According to the pundit, Monday-April 24, had the most full withdrawals, with (278.2k) ETH flowing into Kraken, Coinbase, and Cream. At just over 870,000 ETH, Kraken and Coinbase account for the majority (78.3%) of the principal withdrawals.</p>



<p>However, Kraken&#8217;s leading withdrawal count can be attributed to regulatory scrutiny, which has forced it to shut down its staking services for US citizens. Since Shanghai, Kraken has received 598k $ETH ($1.1B) in both partial and full withdrawals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Institutions Throng to ISPs</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, as CEXs continue taking out their Ether, the number of coins sent to staking pools has surged gradually. In addition to the Merge, which saw Ethereum shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September 2022, the Shanghai upgrade has further sparked the interest of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-shanghai-upgrade-could-spark-decentralization-in-staking-as-big-guns-are-forced-to-step-back/">institutional investors</a> in the second largest cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>According to Wan, Institutional Staking Providers (ISPs) have witnessed significant inflows of ETH staked “as Shanghai has reduced the liquidity risk for investors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Sunday, the analyst highlighted a chart showing the five leading staking service providers for institutional investors &#8211; Bitcoin Suisse, Figment, Kiln, Staked.us, and Stakefish &#8211; have collectively staked 224,000 ETH (About $410 million) in the last 30 days.</p>



<p>Furthermore, institutional investors seem also to be eyeing Ether’s attractive staking rewards even as they continue to bet on higher prices.</p>

<p>Early Bitcoin investor and industry proponent Chamath Palihapitiya, who declared about two years ago that Bitcoin had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-has-effectively-replaced-gold-billionaire-venture-capitalist-chamath-palihapitiya-declares/">usurped gold</a> and forecasted the leading cryptocurrency would skyrocket to the $200,000 level, is now taking a more cautious approach toward crypto assets.</p>



<p>The billionaire businessman claims that the American crypto market now faces potential extinction due to increasing regulatory pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-is-dead-in-america"><strong>“Crypto Is Dead In America”</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. crypto market is in great peril.</p>



<p>This is what Warren Buffett disciple Chamath Palihapitiya suggested during a recent episode of the <em>All-In Podcast</em> alongside fellow investors Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg. Palihapitiya, who is the founder and CEO of Social Capital, a California-based venture capital firm, noted that regulators in the United States have “firmly pointed their guns at crypto”. He added that this could lead to the demise of the fledgling crypto sector within the nation.</p>



<p>It will be recalled that the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, last week tied the implosion of Silvergate and Signature Bank to their bitcoin activities while testifying before a House financial services committee. “You had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto,” Palihapitiya opined.</p>



<p>The SEC has been breathing heavily down Bitcoin’s neck in recent months following the unprecedented collapse of the now-defunct digital asset exchange FTX last November, which sent shockwaves throughout Washington DC, where disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried had become a key political donor.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">sent </a>a Wells Notice to the publicly-listed Coinbase exchange in March, basically warning the company of impending enforcement action due to potential violations of U.S. securities law. In Palihapitiya&#8217;s opinion, despite Coinbase’s efforts to play by the rules and attempts to work with regulators, it has encountered challenges in obtaining requisite licenses. By contrast, fraudulent companies like FTX have come closer to acquiring a license.</p>



<p><em>“[Crypto companies are] probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment, and they were the ones that, in fairness to the regulators, did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy. So now, they’re paying the price for that. The bill has come due for them,&#8221; Palihapitiya stated.</em></p>



<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-ceo-is-considering-relocating-company-outside-of-the-u-s-due-to-unfavorable-regulation/">hinted </a>last week that he would consider relocating the company away from the U.S. if the country does not create a clearer rulebook for the crypto market.</p>



<p>The former Facebook executive Palihapitiya was an early investor in Bitcoin (he bought a million BTC for $80 in 2010). He also speculated in 2017 that the value of Bitcoin could reach a whopping million dollars within two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin is currently changing hands at around $27,681, down by 60.21% from its $69,044 historic record set in November 2021.</p>

<p>Standard Chartered says the fierce crypto winter is finally over. According to the banking giant, there’s nothing but blue sky between here and its $100,000 <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-analyst-sights-100000-for-bitcoins-near-term-price-after-this-pattern-surfaced/">bitcoin price projection</a>.</p>



<p>If the bank is right, the flagship cryptocurrency could hit the six-figure price tag by the end of 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-btc-will-have-hit-100-000-by-2024-year-end-standard-chartered"><strong>BTC Will Have Hit $100,000 By 2024 Year End: Standard Chartered</strong></h2>



<p>With crypto winter finally over, Standard Chartered Bank believes Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and biggest cryptocurrency, will cost $100,000 per single coin by 2024.</p>



<p>In a Monday research report, Geoff Kendrick, the bank&#8217;s head of digital assets research, pointed to several factors that could push BTC to the $100K milestone. The most significant of which is the banking sector turmoil which helped “re-establish bitcoin’s use as a decentralized scarce digital asset.”</p>



<p>“Against this backdrop, bitcoin has benefited from its status as a branded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value, and a means of remittance,” Kendrick wrote.</p>



<p>The Standard Chartered analyst also cited the stabilization of risk assets as the U.S. Federal Reserve approaches the end of its tightening cycle as another potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s climb to the coveted $100,000 mark. “While BTC can trade well when risky assets suffer, correlations to the Nasdaq suggest that it should trade better if risky assets improve broadly,” the report noted.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s supply is halved every four years, making the OG cryptocurrency twice as rare. The next halving is in 2024, which makes Standard Chartered believe the incoming event will give Bitcoin a major lift. “As we approach the next halving, we expect cyclical drivers to become more constructive, as they have in previous cycles,” Kendrick stated.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has gained over 63% since the beginning of 2023. However, the asset’s performance over the past week has faced considerable fluctuations, with a high of around $30,502 on April 15 and a low of $27,045 on April 24.</p>



<p>Standard Chartered predicted in December 2022 that Bitcoin could plummet to as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-risks-crashing-to-5000-in-2023-standard-chartereds-chief-strategist-warns/">low as $5,000</a>. The latest prediction suggests that the banking group is now ultra-bullish on the bellwether crypto.</p>



<p>In the report on Monday, Standard Chartered also identified the possibility of Bitcoin’s dominance rebounding to the 50-60% range. The top crypto’s share of the total cryptocurrency market currently stands at around 44.1%, according to CoinGecko.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is trading hands at $27,256.38 at the time of publication — down over 10% in the past week. For now, the psychological barrier remains at $30,000.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coinbase has asked a federal court to compel the Securities and Exchange Commission to respond to a petition against the body seeking regulatory clarity.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase noted that the actions of the SEC show that the commission is set to continue with its aggressive approach to regulation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pundits and legal experts around the digital asset space have hailed the petition as a step in the right direction as &#8220;the<em> best form of defense is attack.”&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory approach has come under fire by crypto executives and commentators in recent months after the commission filed actions against firms without clear-cut regulations.</p>



<p>Coinbase has <a href="https://www.coinbase.com//blog/coinbase-takes-another-formal-step-to-seek-regulatory-clarity-from-sec-for">filed</a> a suit against the SEC demanding a response from the commission over a petition filed in July 2022. The petition sought clarity on whether digital assets would be treated in line with the current framework for traditional assets. </p>



<p>“&#8230;<em>propose and adopt rules to govern the regulation of securities that are offered and traded via digitally native methods,” </em>a section of tthe petition reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest move by the American exchange giant comes after the chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, insisted during a Committee hearing in Congress that there are rules in place to regulate digital assets, with the Commission requiring more funds and manpower. </p>



<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, stated that the actions of the SEC show that it plans to deny the petition but it should do so to the public.</p>



<p>“<em>From the SEC&#8217;s public statements and enforcement activity in the crypto industry, it seems like the SEC has already made up its mind to deny our petition. But they haven&#8217;t told the public yet. So the action Coinbase filed today simply asks the court to ask the SEC to share its decision,” </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-attack-is-the-last-card-on-the-table">Attack is the last card on the table</h2>



<p>The action filed by Coinbase is the first formal swipe against the SEC after it was served with a Wells Notice with growing concerns over litigation with the commission. In recent months, the SEC has mounted pressure on exchanges and digital asset firms in its regulatory enforcement strategy.</p>



<p>Kraken came under the SEC’s radar and subsequently agreed to cease its staking operation in the US in part of a $30 million settlement. Despite these cases, digital asset firms mull over the lack of clarity in regulation in the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Coinbase does not take any litigation lightly, especially when it relates to one of our regulators. Regulatory clarity is overdue for our industry,&#8221; </em>Grewal added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital asset lawyer Jeremy Hogan is among commentators who <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1650677446604214272?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">hailed</a> the move by Coinbase as a positive step adding that <em>&#8220;the best defense is a good offense.”</em></p>

<p>While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers LUNA, the native token of the Terra ecosystem, a security, a court in South Korea has declared that it does not have attributes of a financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-violation-charges-against-terra-co-founder-dismissed"><strong>Security Violation Charges Against Terra Co-Founder Dismissed</strong></h2>



<p>According to local reports, the southern district court in Seoul has dismissed charges of securities violations against the co-founder of collapsed crypto issuer Terraform Labs Daniel Shin.</p>



<p>The court indicated in the judgment that LUNA (now LUNC) was a non-security under the Korean Capital Markets Act. South Korean prosecutors charged Shin, who left Terraform Labs in March of 2020 to focus on payments app Chai, with allegedly extracting illegal profits as he dumped $105 million of the LUNA token at a market top without notifying investors. The authorities were also seeking an arrest warrant for Shin, arguing that LUNA constitutes a financial investment security.</p>



<p>However, the judge has reportedly said, “It is difficult to see Luna Coin as a financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the latest ruling, the court also rejected the prosecutor&#8217;s request to seize the accused’s assets and arrest based on securities law infringements. The Seoul Southern District Court explained that it was hard to see that the property subject to the allegation had been “acquired by crime or an asset derived from it.&#8221; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Fall Of Do Kwon</strong></h2>



<p>Some crypto pundits thought Do Hyeong Kwon — popularly known as Do Kwon — his algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token LUNA would take them to the promised land. But then the stablecoin veered away from its dollar peg. Everything unravelled. Over $50 billion evaporated. Life savings were erased.</p>



<p>An arrest warrant had been issued for Do Kwon, who co-founded Terraform Labs with Shin in 2018. Kwon, who had been on the run from authorities since the stunning implosion of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, was finally <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">apprehended </a>by Montenegrin police last month for trying to travel with a fake passport. The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">charged </a>the South Korean native with violating securities law following his apprehension. Notably, Kwon’s lawyers are pushing to have these SEC charges dismissed.</p>



<p>Kwon recently<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/do-kwon-loses-bid-to-block-sec-from-seeking-singapore-records?leadSource=uverify%20wall"> suffered a legal blow</a> as a United States judge denied his plea to bar the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from obtaining certain records related to Terraform Lab’s operations in Singapore.</p>



<p>The former Terraform Labs CEO currently faces criminal fraud charges brought against him by U.S. prosecutors and charges relating to violating the Capital Markets Act back home in South Korea. Both the U.S. and South Korea have requested the extradition of the fallen crypto star, but he will likely first face trial in Montenegro.</p>
