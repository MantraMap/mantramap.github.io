<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Chainlink&#8217;s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) goes live on multiple blockchains.</em></li>



<li><em>CCIP enables decentralized finance protocols and SWIFT connectivity for international transfers.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol also offers simplified token transfers and an ARM Network for added security.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chainlink&#8217;s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is now live for early-access users on multiple blockchains, including Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="577" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-1024x577.png" alt="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction" class="wp-image-203475" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-1024x577.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-1536x865.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-1140x642.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol, <a href="https://blog.chain.link/ccip-mainnet-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed</a> to facilitate cross-chain applications and services, has been tested by partners such as Aave and Synthetix and is now transitioning to mainnet general availability.</p>



<p>On July 20, all developers will be able to access CCIP through five testnets: Arbitrum Goerli, Avalanche Fuji, Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Goerli, and Polygon Bombay.</p>



<p>CCIP allows for seamless interoperability between different blockchains, enabling decentralized finance protocols and other applications to adopt cross-chain functionality. It has been a key element in Chainlink&#8217;s partnership with SWIFT, the global banking network used for international money transfers, which plans to connect with various blockchains using CCIP.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1024x538.png" alt="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction" class="wp-image-203476" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol offers simplified and programmable token transfers, making it easier for tokens to be securely transferred and managed across different chains. Simplified Token Transfers provide a plug-and-play solution with audited token pool contracts, handling tasks such as burning, minting, locking, and unlocking tokens across chains while ensuring token sponsors retain control over their Token Pool contract. This enhances the security and composability of native tokens within protocols.</p>



<p>Programmable Token Transfers enable additional instructions to be included with token transfers, allowing for actions such as swapping or staking assets upon arrival at the destination chain. This ensures that tokens can be utilized immediately according to predefined instructions, enhancing the efficiency and functionality of cross-chain transactions.</p>



<p>To ensure the integrity and security of cross-chain operations, Chainlink has implemented an Active Risk Management (ARM) Network. The ARM Network acts as an independent layer that continuously monitors and validates the behavior of the primary CCIP network. It utilizes a separate implementation of the Chainlink node software in Rust, providing client diversity and minimizing external dependencies to prevent supply chain attacks.</p>



<p>Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP aims to solve the challenge of interoperability in the blockchain ecosystem, allowing applications and protocols to seamlessly interact across different chains. By providing simplified and programmable token transfers, along with an independent security layer through the ARM Network, CCIP offers a robust and secure cross-chain solution for the decentralized finance space and beyond.</p>

<p>As CCIP moves towards wider adoption, Chainlink is actively working on payment models to support the monetization and long-term sustainability of its services. These models aim to reduce payment friction for users and provide a greater amount of fees to support Chainlink&#8217;s service providers. Additionally, as Chainlink Staking expands, a portion of user fees for services like CCIP will be directed to stakers, enhancing the crypto-economic security of the network.</p>



<p>With the launch of CCIP on multiple blockchains and the growing adoption by leading protocols, Chainlink is further solidifying its position as a key player in the blockchain interoperability space. The protocol&#8217;s ability to facilitate cross-chain applications and services opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance and other blockchain-based ecosystems, fostering innovation and collaboration across different networks.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/198659-chainlink-data-feeds-go-live-on-celo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Chainlink data streams are now available on the Celo mainnet, allowing developers to construct powerful DeFi apps by providing access to crucial data and services. This advancement is likely to significantly alter the DeFi ecosystem by providing additional chances for developers to implement creative solutions. Additionally, integrating Chainlink data feeds into Celo&#8217;s blockchain would improve platform security by guaranteeing that data is securely delivered straight to the blockchain.</p>

<p>In May, Pika Protocol&#8217;s Discord server fell victim to a compromise orchestrated by scammers. By posting a malicious link in the server&#8217;s announcements channel, they managed to steal over $220,000. A similar pattern emerged with Orbiter Finance, where scammers used a phishing attack to access a team member&#8217;s Discord token and subsequently siphoned off more than $760,000.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1143.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="711" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1143-1024x711.png" alt="ZachXBT Exposes Canadian Scammer For Multi-Million Dollar Theft From Crypto Projects" class="wp-image-203464" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1143-1024x711.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1143-300x208.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1143-768x533.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1143-750x521.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1143-1140x792.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1143.png 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ZachXBT Exposes Canadian Scammer For Multi-Million Dollar Theft From Crypto Projects 6"></a></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://coincu.com/196353-jeffrey-huang-refuted-zachxbts-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZachXBT</a> further alleges that Soup, who inadvertently revealed his wallet address (0x21bc8046245880e9d3ec5ed808048a93518e933a), profited significantly from these illicit activities. Soup reportedly confessed to having made around $1 million, while his partners profited even more. Despite the financial harm inflicted on projects and individuals, Soup appears to show little remorse.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1678384917657296898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous investigations</a> into crypto-related crimes, including allegations against YouTuber Blue, ZachXBT has established a reputation as a crypto crime fighter. After being sued by Jeffrey Huang, also known as <a href="https://coincu.com/196939-machi-big-brother-stated-zachxbt-framed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machi Big Brother</a>, for making allegations about &#8220;pump and dump&#8221; schemes, ZachXBT <a href="https://coincu.com/196101-the-war-between-jeffrey-huang-zachxbt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> substantial donations for legal defense.</p>



<p>ZachXBT has shared additional information about Soup with the victims in the hope that legal action can be taken against the scammer. The exposed activities shed light on the ongoing challenges posed by phishing scams within the crypto community and the importance of remaining vigilant against such threats.</p>

<p>US Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to request an investigation into Elon Musk&#8217;s Tesla&#8217;s connection to Twitter. The letter raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets, and negative impacts to Tesla shareholders. Warren specifically calls for a probe into Tesla&#8217;s board of directors regarding the lack of independence from Musk and possible violations of securities laws and exchange rules.</p>



<p>The nine-page letter was sent on Monday to SEC chair Gary Gensler. Warren&#8217;s concerns echo similar ones she expressed to Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm in 2022. She notes that the inaction and incomplete disclosures raise questions about possible violations of securities laws and exchange rules, which fall under the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Warren expressed concern about Tesla&#8217;s use of employees from Tesla and SpaceX to aid the social media platform, stating that it could represent possible violations of state and federal labor laws. She also stated that Tesla had failed to properly inform shareholders of how the two companies would work in connection.</p>



<p>Although a new Twitter CEO has been appointed, Warren believes that Musk still maintains control as the CTO and executive chairman of Tesla. Thus, maintaining the conflict of interest.</p>

<p>While the cryptocurrency community was taken aback by the revelation, some skeptics argue that the claim comes as no surprise given Sun&#8217;s reputation in the industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer in Lawsuit (Not exactly a shocker) <a href="https://t.co/ybTPmSOmtk" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ybTPmSOmtk</a></p>&mdash; db (@tier10k) <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1680959101814161409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the founder of <a href="https://www.archblock.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.archblock.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archblock</a>, whose identity remains undisclosed, asserts that Sun acquired TUSD, a popular stablecoin, through covert means. The lawsuit alleges that Sun utilized various entities and individuals to carry out the acquisition, deliberately concealing his involvement. If proven true, such actions would raise serious concerns about Sun&#8217;s transparency and integrity within the cryptocurrency space.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="482" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-1024x482.png" alt="image 1139" class="wp-image-203452" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-1024x482.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-300x141.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-768x361.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-750x353.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer In Lawsuit 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The lawsuit further accuses Sun of manipulating the cryptocurrency market through his undisclosed acquisition of TUSD. By secretly amassing a significant amount of the stablecoin, Sun would have had the power to influence its value and potentially manipulate other related markets. This revelation, if substantiated, could have far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>



<p>Although these allegations are yet to be proven in a court of law, they have sparked intense discussions within the crypto community. Many individuals argue that Sun&#8217;s past controversies, including the canceled lunch with Warren Buffett and allegations of plagiarism, have already cast doubt on his credibility. As such, the claims made in the lawsuit do not come as a complete shock to those who have been following his career closely.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="385" height="1024" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-385x1024.png" alt="image 1140" class="wp-image-203453" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-385x1024.png 385w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-113x300.png 113w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140.png 546w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" title="Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer In Lawsuit 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, it is important to note that Justin Sun and his legal team have not yet responded to the allegations. Until the evidence is presented and thoroughly examined, it is crucial to approach the situation with caution and maintain a neutral standpoint.</p>



<p>This lawsuit serves as a reminder of the need for transparency and accountability within the cryptocurrency industry. As the market continues to mature, investors and users alike expect leaders and influencers to uphold the highest ethical standards. Should the allegations against Justin Sun be proven true, it would undoubtedly have a significant impact on his reputation and potentially reshape the way he is perceived within the crypto community.</p>

<p>This new protocol has been designed to allow trading across automated market makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources. The details of this project were released through a press release, while Uniswap Labs CEO, Hayden Adams, was scheduled to make an announcement about it on Monday at the EthCC conference in Paris.</p>



<p>According to DefiLlama, Uniswap currently has around $3.8 billion of collateral or &#8220;total value locked&#8221;. Uniswap has stated that<a href="https://uniswap.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> UniswapX</a> addresses many of the problems that are faced by on-chain trading and self-custody swapping. The features of UniswapX include &#8220;better prices&#8221; through the aggregation of liquidity sources. The press release also claims that UniswapX offers gas-free swapping, protection against maximal extractive value (MEV), and no cost for failed transactions.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="800" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg" alt="UniswapX 1" class="wp-image-203445" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-75x75.jpeg 75w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-350x350.jpeg 350w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-750x750.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="UniswapX Launches: Empowering Traders with Next-Level Cross-AMM Capabilities 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Uniswap has announced that in the coming months, UniswapX will expand to gas-free cross-chain swaps. UniswapX will initially be launched in &#8220;opt-in beta&#8221; on the Uniswap Labs interface for the main Ethereum network, with plans to expand to other chains and the Uniswap wallet &#8220;in the near future&#8221;. However, the company has not yet announced when a final version of UniswapX will be available.</p>



<p>Liquidity pools are a lifeline for swappers looking to execute trades on DEXs, but these pools can sometimes dry up. UniswapX aims to solve this problem by engaging with third-party fillers that can fill swaps directly or route users to appropriate AMM pools. These third-party fillers will have to compete with Uniswap itself, which will help to drive down prices for traders.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png" alt="UniswapX 2" class="wp-image-203446" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="UniswapX Launches: Empowering Traders with Next-Level Cross-AMM Capabilities 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Fillers will cover the gas fees on behalf of swappers, which removes the need for swappers to own a blockchain&#8217;s native network token, such as ETH or MATIC, to participate in trading. This also removes any financial responsibility for unsuccessful transactions. According to Uniswap, fillers incorporate gas fees into overall swap prices. They also have the option to reduce transaction costs by aggregating multiple orders, thereby fostering a competitive environment for achieving the most favorable price.</p>



<p>Uniswap has promised that UniswapX will help to thwart MEV – a scheme that is usually loathed by swappers. This is done by allowing network operators to capitalize on their ability to preview queued transactions.</p>

<p>This marks a continuation of a strong trend, with the last four weeks seeing a cumulative inflow of $742 million, the highest since the final quarter of 2021. Bitcoin remains the dominant asset, attracting the majority of inflows, while Ethereum faced outflows despite its recent price appreciation. Let&#8217;s delve into the details of the latest investment trends.</p>



<p>The majority of inflows were concentrated in North America, with the United States and Canada accounting for $109 million and $28 million, respectively. Europe, on the other hand, experienced minor outflows, with only Switzerland witnessing minor inflows.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/202133-bitcoin-futures-traders-losing-interest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> continued to be the preferred choice for investors, capturing 99% of all inflows with a total of $140 million. However, short Bitcoin investment products faced their 12th consecutive week of outflows, totaling $3.2 million. As a result, assets under management for short bitcoin products declined from their peak of $198 million in April to a mere $55 million.</p>



<p>Despite the recent price appreciation of <a href="https://coincu.com/202925-ethereum-rejects-2000-price-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, the cryptocurrency experienced outflows of $2 million last week. Notably, Ethereum has consistently witnessed the highest outflows year-to-date among digital assets. In contrast, altcoins such as Solana, Polygon, and Litecoin observed minor inflows, ranging from $0.3 million to $0.5 million.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1138.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1138.png" alt="Bitcoin Dominates As Digital Asset Investment Products Record $742M Inflows" class="wp-image-203442" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1138.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1138-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1138-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1138-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Dominates As Digital Asset Investment Products Record $742M Inflows 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>Trading volumes on investment products remained robust, exceeding the year average of $1.4 billion and reaching $2.3 billion last week. These volumes accounted for a larger proportion of total crypto volumes, representing 11% compared to the average of 2%.</p>



<p>The digital asset market continues to attract substantial investment, with significant inflows recorded in the past week. Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for investors, while Ethereum faced outflows despite its price appreciation. As trading volumes on investment products remain high, the market showcases resilience and investor interest in the crypto space.</p>



<p>While the lawsuit is far from over, the true story of the week was <a href="https://coincu.com/202849-ripple-is-bringing-new-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>&#8216;s legal triumph against the SEC. A court concluded that selling XRP tokens to the general public did not violate securities regulations, something the sector has long claimed. This is also the driving reason behind the recent surge in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<li><em>XRP surpasses Bitcoin in trading volume: XRP, the &#8220;liberated&#8221; token, has become the highest volume asset in the crypto market, capturing 21% of all trade volume since last week&#8217;s court ruling.</em></li>

<p>This groundbreaking development is credited to the recent court ruling that declared XRP as a non-security, which sent shockwaves through the industry. According to a report by smart data portal<a href="https://www.kaiko.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.kaiko.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Kaiko</a>, XRP has been responsible for a staggering 21% of all crypto trade volume since the ruling.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#XRP</a> has surpassed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#BTC</a> as the highest volume asset <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>Since last week&#39;s court ruling, 21% of all crypto trade volume has been for XRP. <a href="https://t.co/OLdTQrk1kO" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/OLdTQrk1kO</a></p>&mdash; Kaiko (@KaikoData) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1680865430741700608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>XRP&#8217;s triumph over Bitcoin that is impressive, but the fact that it managed to capture a fifth of the multi-billion-dollar market within a matter of days. This unprecedented growth in trading volume is evident as almost two billion XRP tokens were traded on the Binance spot market within three hours of the announcement.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-1024x768.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Overthrown XRP Takes Command Claims 20 of Crypto Market" class="wp-image-203435" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-300x225.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-768x576.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-750x563.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Overthrown: XRP Takes Command, Claims 20% of Crypto Market 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Just a day before this monumental achievement, based on the same Kaiko data, that XRP had climbed to become the third largest digital asset by trading volume. This upward trend was fueled by investors&#8217; anticipation that the lawsuit would soon be resolved, and their expectations proved accurate.</p>



<p>While some may attribute this seismic shift in XRP trading to the prevailing low volatility in the market at that time, it is important to note that the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVOL), a benchmark of the crypto market, measured at a mere 14.78 on Thursday — comparable to levels seen in December, late April and June. Following the news of XRP&#8217;s surge, the BVOL value skyrocketed by more than 5% in the following days, a significant jump. All in all, it is an exciting time for XRP and the crypto market as a whole.</p>

<p>The bulk of the funds were sent to the cryptocurrency brokerage firm, FalconX. The company received $8.46 million worth of Chainlink (LINK), $7.71 million in Synthetix (SNX), and $3.06 million in BNB. In addition, other assets sent to FalconX include $2.1 million worth of 1INCH, $1.87 million in 0x Protocol’s ZRX token, and $718,000 worth of FTX’s native token, FTT.</p>

<p>The bankrupt lender also transferred roughly $235,000 worth of ShibaSwap’s BONE to the OKX exchange. These transactions were corroborated by blockchain investigator Lookonchain, who added that FalconX was depositing the altcoins to Binance. These transactions appear to be the on-chain evidence that the lender is looking to liquidate the digital assets for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in line with its recent court approval.</p>



<p><a href="https://celsius.network/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://celsius.network/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celsius</a> still holds around $183 million worth of altcoins according to Dune analytics data, including its CEL token, Polygon’s MATIC, Avalanche’s AVAX token, stablecoins, and others. Celsius’s altcoin holding is dominated by its CEL token, worth $106.28 million at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Blockchain analytical firm Kaiko warned on June 10 that Celsius could have trouble liquidating some of its altcoins because of liquidity issues. The firm highlighted how liquidity for CEL is almost non-existent and how the liquidations of other assets could exert pressure on the crypto market.</p>



<p>It is interesting to observe that Celsius’s BTC and ETH holdings account for over $350 million of the total assets in its portfolio.</p>



<p>Amidst Celsius’s efforts to liquidate its assets, the bankrupt firm agreed to a $4.7 billion fine with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on July 13. Meanwhile, Celsius co-founder Alex Mashinsky also faces charges from U.S. regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged that he violated federal securities law. Mashinsky is out on a $40 million bail after he was arrested on July 13. Other regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, CFTC, and FTC, also filed charges against him.</p>

<p>Inspired by an article by <a href="https://coincu.com/192844-arthur-hayes-investors-to-join-the-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arthur Hayes</a>, Ethena aims to create a stablecoin called USDe that is backed by derivatives. The stablecoin will maintain its peg to the US dollar by using collateral from users to hedge price exposure through shorting <a href="https://coincu.com/202925-ethereum-rejects-2000-price-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> using perpetual swaps. This mechanism, known as &#8220;delta-neutral&#8221; stability, ensures that any gains or losses from Ethereum and perpetual swaps are offset, enabling the stablecoin to maintain a constant peg of $1.</p>



<p>In addition to the stablecoin, Ethena is developing the first-ever digitally native savings bond built on top of the stablecoin. The bond token will function similarly to a US treasury but without any reliance on centralized banking institutions or government entities. Together, the stablecoin and bond asset will form a highly scalable digital currency and savings platform, providing an alternative to traditional banking systems for users worldwide.</p>



<p>Ethena&#8217;s goal is to address the need for accessible, permissionless dollar-denominated savings instruments beyond the US. By offering a stablecoin and bond asset that operate independently of traditional financial systems and banking infrastructure, Ethena aims to provide a widely accessible and permissionless internet bond.</p>

<p>The project intends to mitigate the risks associated with existing fiat-based stablecoins, such as custodial and regulatory risks shifted onto users. Ethena&#8217;s stablecoin also aims to address issues of overcollateralization and capital efficiency by breaking ties with external banking infrastructure.</p>



<p>With the seed funding secured, Ethena plans to launch its stablecoin and bond asset in the third quarter of 2023. The team will focus on completing the testnet phase, forming partnerships with industry leaders, and conducting smart contract audits to ensure the security and efficiency of the protocol.</p>



<p>Investors are optimistic about Ethena&#8217;s innovative approach to stablecoins, emphasizing the potential for stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency. The partnership with <a href="https://coincu.com/182535-dragonfly-capital-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragonfly</a> and other industry leaders will help bring Ethena&#8217;s vision to life and create a breakthrough stablecoin with broad user appeal.</p>



<p>Ethena&#8217;s ambitious project seeks to revolutionize the world of stablecoins and provide a global savings instrument that is accessible to investors of all means. By leveraging the power of Ethereum and derivatives, Ethena aims to offer a new financial infrastructure that is transparent, secure, and independent of traditional banking systems.</p>

<p>Michael Gao, Fabric CEO, said that cryptography has a problem. Every day, new protocols, coins, and projects emerge, and the public continues to associate blockchain technology with speculation and a lack of real-world application. The partnership between Nil Foundation and Fabric Cryptography aims to overcome this problem by introducing a new marketplace for cryptography and outsourced proof generation. This marketplace will facilitate faster, more scalable, more private, and interoperable zero-knowledge computing and help developers and proof generators to leverage their skills.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1131.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="200" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1131.png" alt="Fabric Cryptography and Nil Foundation Disrupt Centralized Marketplaces with Decentralization" class="wp-image-203417" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1131.png 200w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1131-150x150.png 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1131-75x75.png 75w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" title="Fabric Cryptography and Nil Foundation Disrupt Centralized Marketplaces with Decentralization 30"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Mikhail Komarov, Nil Foundation&#8217;s founder, believes that developers will appreciate the hardware-accelerated performance of zkLLVM circuits for proving computations. Proof generators can also enjoy enhanced profitability with Fabric&#8217;s VPU on the Proof Market. This partnership will enable developers and proof generators to leverage their skills while building a decentralized marketplace for cryptography and outsourced proof generation. Nil Foundation and Fabric Cryptography hope that this partnership will help to overcome the issues associated with blockchain technology and help to move the industry forward.</p>
