<p>The New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office has slapped a $4.3 million fine on the crypto exchange Coin Cafe due to its allegedly outrageous fee structure.&nbsp;</p>
NY AG Fines Coin Cafe
<p>The New York-based popular cryptocurrency platform has been allegedly charging its users exorbitant fees for using the platform. As a result, it has been ordered to hand over a total of $4.3 million in retribution and fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, noted that</p>

<p>&ldquo;The company was charging investors exorbitant and undisclosed fees to use its wallet storage, despite marketing its wallet storage as &lsquo;free&rsquo; on its website.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the exchange has also been accused of not disclosing the fee structure and draining out entire customer funds.&nbsp;</p>
Fee Restructuring Drains Customer Funds
<p>The matter was first uncovered when multiple customers raised concerns about depleting funds from their Coin Cafe accounts. These allegations against the firm led to an investigation into the company&rsquo;s business practices and fee transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that the firm had initially onboarded clients advertising its crypto wallet as a free product. However, since September 2022, the company changed its fee structure multiple times and surreptitiously added fees without informing customers, which resulted in charges of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in October 2022, Coin Cafe implemented a policy where users who did not engage in cryptocurrency transactions within a 30-day period were subject to a charge of either 7.99% or $99 per month, whichever amount was higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Attorney General&rsquo;s office claimed that the exchange misled its customers and violated consumer protection regulations by failing to disclose these additional charges.&nbsp;</p>
The Settlement Agreement&nbsp;
<p>As a consequence of the investigation, Coin Cafe has had to surrender $4.3 million, which includes restitution of $508,000 to 340 individuals and an additional penalty to the state of New York. Additionally, as part of the settlement agreement, Coin Cafe is obliged to provide refunds to U.S.-based investors who request reimbursement within the upcoming year. By May 23, Coin Cafe must send email notifications to all U.S.-based customers, informing them of their eligibility for a refund.</p>
<p>Finally, The cryptocurrency exchange has also committed to implementing comprehensive changes to its fee structure and ensuring transparency in its operations going forward.</p>
Need For Transparency?&nbsp;
<p>The Attorney General has claimed that the incident highlights the need for increased regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency sector, especially regarding fee structures and consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the company had successfully obtained the state&rsquo;s BitLicense in 2023, it had not officially registered with the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office, which is a requirement for companies dealing with crypto trading in the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, the fact that the company continued to overcharge customers even after obtaining the BitLicense indicates that unfair practices can be conducted right under the nose of the regulatory bodies.&nbsp;</p>
