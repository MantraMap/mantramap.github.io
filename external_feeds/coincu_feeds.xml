<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance cloud mining services were unavailable from Dec. 24-26 due to the severe winter storm in North America.</em></li>



<li><em>On Binance&#8217;s cloud, hashrates must be purchased through subscriptions to mine Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>Texas miners&#8217; decision has caused a 30% slowdown in Bitcoin transactions worldwide. Along with New York, Kentucky, and Georgia, Texas is one of the most active Bitcoin mining states in the United States.</em></li>

<p>Further weather-related failures, according to Binance, will cause cloud mining subscriptions to expire sooner.</p>



<p>Users without mining equipment can now receive mining rewards from Binance Pool thanks to the exchange&#8217;s cloud mining service, which was just about one month old. On Binance cloud, hashrates must be purchased through subscriptions to mine Bitcoin.</p>



<p>A <strong>&#8220;bomb cyclone&#8221; </strong>unleashed high temperatures in the days before Christmas, rendering millions of Americans without electricity and taking hundreds of lives.</p>



<p>Due to the cold weather in Texas, bitcoin miners voluntarily reduced their output and returned power to the grid so that locals could keep their houses warm. <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate was damaged by disruptions, falling to 170.60 Exahashes per second (EH/s) on December 25 from a more typical rate of between 225 and 300 EH/s</strong>.</p>

<p>The Texas miners&#8217; decision has caused a <strong>30% slowdown in Bitcoin transactions worldwide.</strong> Along with New York, Kentucky, and Georgia, Texas is one of the most active Bitcoin mining states in the United States. The bomb cyclone recently had an impact on all states.</p>



<p>Since FTX&#8217;s demise in November, Binance has been the target of FUD, which has led to withdrawals amounting to billions of dollars. The cryptocurrency exchange has kept diversifying its business strategy while fending off rumors. The business also disclosed last month that Binance Labs, its venture capital division, has invested in the Belgian hardware wallet company Ngrave and will manage its Series A investment round.</p>

<p>Now that the results are in. By auctioning off tens of thousands of robotic puppies-themed NFTs, <strong>the automaker raised $100,000 for the nonprofit The Petfinder Foundation</strong>. More than 22,000 animals in shelters have already had their adoption fees paid for thanks to that sum and a further<strong> $500,000 in currency from Kia</strong>, the business announced Tuesday.</p>



<p>The robotic puppy that starred in Kia&#8217;s Super Bowl commercial the previous year is featured in the NFTs, which will be released in February 2022. As a result, Kia joined a growing list of automakers who <strong>now support the donation-via-digital-collectible model. </strong>NFTs have been utilized by companies like Starbucks to support humanitarian initiatives and raise money for the imprisoned creator of the Silk Road. Even London&#8217;s NFT vending machines have joined the fray.</p>



<p>This is how it transpired: <strong>10,000 so-called &#8220;adoption pass&#8221; NFTs were initially claimed via the Tezos blockchain in a free mint. </strong>Then, a week later, in connection with the NBA All-Star Game on February 18, additional 10,000 generated versions went on sale.</p>



<p>On the Sweet NFT marketplace, the $20.22 apiece digital collectibles sold out on the same day, bringing in $100,000. The six-figure fundraising effort also included several more costly and uncommon NFTs.</p>



<p>When a Robo Dog is sold again, a clause in their intelligent contracts calls for a 10% creator royalty to be paid to Petfinder rather than Kia.</p>

<p>As mentioned in an earlier Coincu News article, Kaplan was assigned to join the case on Tuesday, after the judge initially withdrew himself because her husband&#8217;s law firm had advised FTX before it fall.</p>



<p>Prosecutors have accused Bankman-Fried of conspiring and planning the largest scam in crypto history. It&#8217;s been done over the years using customer deposits to support his hedge fund company Alameda Research, buy real estate, and infiltrate political circles.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried was charged with two counts of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy, including money laundering and campaign finance violations, and could face decades in prison if convicted.</p>



<p>Before his arrest on December 12, <strong>Bankman-Fried admitted to risk management failures at FTX</strong>, <strong>but adamantly protested that he did not participate in fraudulent activities</strong> and would not be held criminally responsible.</p>



<p>However, two of his close associates, former Alameda chief executive Caroline Ellison and former FTX chief technology officer, Gary Wang, pleaded guilty to their role in FTX&#8217;s collapse and agreed to cooperation with prosecutors is a major threat to the SBF&#8217;s previous denials.&#8221;</p>

<p>A novel Ethereum-based enterprise called Nouns sells off a single NFT pixel character daily, with all proceeds going into a communal fund. <strong>Owners of Nouns can vote on proposals to use the treasury, which currently has about $32.7 million worth of ETH, to fund initiatives that further the project&#8217;s goal of creating open-source IP.</strong></p>



<p>As previously mentioned, the Nouns glasses were featured on limited-edition Bud Light cans and in a Bud Light Super Bowl commercial. The independent film &#8220;Calladita&#8221; will also feature Nouns, and the DAO has supported projects like physical Noggles, Web3 education programs, and a showing at New York Fashion Week.</p>



<p>In this instance, the DAO granted Stoopid Buddy Stoodios&#8217; request for roughly 610 ETH to support the production of the parade float, costumes, and movie in June. When the application was approved on June 1, <strong>the investment had a value of over $1.1 million, even though 610 ETH now only has a value of roughly $723,000 due to Ethereum&#8217;s dropping value.</strong></p>



<p>A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is an online group of people who come together for a common cause. Membership is often demonstrated by holding blockchain tokens. Ownership of one of the NFTs is required to participate in the Nouns DAO in this scenario, and holders are given one vote per NFT on community proposals.</p>

<p><strong>Key Words:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The DFPI&#8217;s consumer alert page now has 16 alerts from December 27 to 28 warning businesses to appear to be involved in fraud against California consumers.</em></li>



<li><em>The warnings were issued in response to public complaints about the brokers and websites, noting that consumers have losses ranging from $2,000 to $1.2 million.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Over the course of two days, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) has issued 17 different warnings to cryptocurrency brokers and websites it believes to be fraudulent.</strong></h5>

<p>The suspected crypto websites include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Tahoe Digital Exchange</li>



<li>TeleTrade Options</li>



<li>Tony Alin Trading Firm</li>



<li>Hekamenltd/Tosal Markets Limited</li>



<li>Trade 1960</li>



<li>Yong Ying Global Investment Company Limited</li>



<li>Unison FX</li>



<li>VoyanX.com</li>

<li>Rui Win Capital Group LTD</li>



<li>Reliable Option Trade</li>



<li>Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited/ Simex</li>



<li>Sun Bit Proa</li>



<li>UniSwap LLC</li>



<li>eth-Wintermute.net</li>



<li>ZC Exchange</li>
</ol>



<p>Wherein, <strong>eth-Wintermute.net, and UniSwap LLC are the two copycat sites posing as two big names in the crypto sector</strong>.</p>



<p>The DFPI&#8217;s consumer alert page now has 16 alerts from December 27 to 28 warning that these businesses <strong>appear to be involved in fraud against California consumers.</strong></p>



<p>It is unusual for the DFPI to issue so many notifications at once, implying that<strong> the amount of crypto fraud reports may have increased in the final parts of the year</strong>. The DFPI normally issues intermittent warnings concerning company investigations or notices about specific instances.</p>

<p>The warnings were issued in response to public complaints about the brokers and websites, with the DFPI noting that <strong>consumers have reported losses ranging from $2,000 to $1.2 million in certain cases</strong>. The DFPI, on the other hand, just states that these websites &#8220;appears to be engaged in fraud.&#8221;</p>



<p>A significant theme asserted in the majority of these advisories is pig slaughtering schemes, in which <strong>an individual or group creates a phony identity online in order to cultivate fraudulent relationships or friendships via social media, texting, and dating apps.</strong></p>



<p>The ultimate objective is to <strong>convince the victim to invest in cryptocurrency through a spoof version of a real website</strong>, in this case, UniSwap LLC and eth-Wintermute.net or by sending cash to a shady wallet address.</p>

<p>CAKE&#8217;s response to this upgrade was subpar, as is shown on its daily chart, which was highlighted in red. In the last seven days, the price of CAKE has decreased by more than 4,4%, according to CoinCu. Additionally, it had a market value of more than $522 million at the time of publication and was trading at $3.144.</p>

<p>Santiment&#8217;s research did, however, offer some solace since several on-chain metrics suggested that CAKE&#8217;s next price movement would soon be supported.</p>

<p>Over the past week, the token&#8217;s<strong> Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has decreased</strong>, which can be a sign that the market has reached a bottom. The velocity of CAKE also increased, which raises the possibility of a trend reversal even more.</p>



<p>Last week, CAKE&#8217;s social dominance frequently increased, demonstrating its appeal. <strong>Not only was CAKE&#8217;s social supremacy confirmed, but so was its appeal. </strong>This was because it had received the second-most mentions in the past 24 hours among the top BNB Chain initiatives.</p>



<p>The network&#8217;s burn rate for PancakeSwap seems to be somewhat optimistic, given that it recently burned 6,808,702 tokens worth more than $22 million.</p>

<p>Through an investigation, the team said that they discovered multiple fake websites claiming to be 3Commas were used to phish information by tricking users into connecting their exchange accounts to fraudulent web interfaces, noting that <strong>third-party browser extensions or malware may have been involved.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Manchester United&#8217;s NFT collection has been criticised for being too similar to the work of famous NFT artist DesLucrece.</em></li>



<li><em>DesLucrece stated that he, Tezos, and Manchester United are discussing a solution to the problem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>A well-known NFT artist known for his vibrant animated monsters has been compared to an official collection from the Manchester United Football Club that appears a little too much like his work.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>CertiK</strong> has audited many key components of <strong>The Open Network</strong>, including the vesting schedule smart contract, <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Bridge</strong> application, and <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Baselayer</strong>. The company reduces the risk of Web3 services being compromised by security threats using a hands-on approach and automated audits run by artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>In order to give the network an additional layer of security assurance, the audit company also used formal verification. A defense-in-depth strategy is created by combining expert manual review with automated, AI-powered verification, which reduces and guards against the very real hazards that are present in the <strong>Web3</strong> environment.</p>
