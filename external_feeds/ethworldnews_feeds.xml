<p>The U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has concluded its probe into the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wintermute-helped-mashinsky-dupe-celsius/">Celsius</a> Network and found that the crypto lender and its founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky, broke the country’s laws before the firm imploded in mid-2022. The revelation comes almost a year after the crypto lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, leaving thousands of customers and creditors stranded.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>CFTC Could File A Federal Case Against Celsius This Month</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/cftc-probe-concludes-crypto-lender-celsius-ex-ceo-mashinsky-broke-rules" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the attorneys in the CFTC’s enforcement unit determined that Celsius misled its investors. The attorneys further stated that the defunct crypto lender should have registered itself with the commodities regulator. The CFTC has concluded that Celsius and its former CEO Alex Mashinsky broke U.S. regulations. People familiar with the matter revealed that the CFTC could file a federal case against the crypto lender this month if a majority of its commissioners agree with that conclusion. </p>



<p>Mashinsky is already facing a civil lawsuit from the state of New York. In the lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James in January this year, the founder of the defunct crypto exchange was accused of defrauding investors out of billions of dollars by misleading them and misrepresenting the financial health of his crypto firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Court <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11827/PLEADINGS/1182710062280000000010.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filings</a> previously made by the bankrupt crypto firm revealed that it was facing regulatory inquiries from several U.S. agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Massachusetts Securities Division, and the Washington Department of Financial Institutions Securities Division. The latest development in Celsius’ case led to a decline of over 12% in the platform’s native token CEL. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry Fink, the man behind the world’s largest asset manager, has taken a rather friendly stance towards Bitcoin and the broader crypto space. As the Chief Executive of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/nasdaq-blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/">BlackRock</a> Inc, Fink described Bitcoin as an international asset in an interview with Fox Business earlier today. His support for the flagship cryptocurrency came just days after his firm filed an application with the SEC to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF. </p>



<h2><strong>BlackRock Wants To Democratize Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6H4eVwJpSw" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> hosted by Fox Business’ Charles Gasparino, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that his company wants to democratize Bitcoin and the broader crypto market and make it easier and less expensive for investors to explore this asset class. Fink added that he saw the potential in Bitcoin to revolutionize finance by tokenizing assets and securities. He also described BTC as digital gold and compared it with gold in the context of hedging against inflation. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We hope that, like in the past, we could be working with our regulators and get the filing approved one day, and I have no idea what that one day will be, but we’ll see how that all plays out.”</p><cite>Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc. </cite></blockquote>



<p>Larry Fink also revealed that his $8.5 trillion asset management giant was working closely with regulators in the United States to seize the opportunity presented by Bitcoin. BlackRock’s application to offer a spot BTC ETF was recently rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to Fink, the securities regulator should look at the ETF filing as a way to democratize crypto. His latest comments on Bitcoin were the complete opposite of his stance back in 2017 when he described BTC as a tool for money laundering and other illicit activities.</p>

<ul><li>Binance has lost more than 10% of its market share since the beginning of 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>Rival exchanges like Bybit and OKX have absorbed the freed-up market share.&nbsp;</li><li>Meanwhile, the market share of the American arm of the crypto exchange has sunk below 1%.&nbsp;</li><li>Regulatory crackdowns and the lawsuit by the SEC have been blamed for the tanking market share.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The crypto market share of the largest crypto exchange in the world has gone down by double digits since the beginning of 2023. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-probed-derivatives/">Binance’s</a> market share has taken a hit from recent regulatory crackdowns and the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange’s American arm has also lost a significant share of the crypto market. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Expects Heavy Trading Volume</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by crypto analytics firm <a href="https://research.kaiko.com/reports/quarterly-report-q2-2023" rel="nofollow noopener">Kaiko</a>, Binance’s market share of spot volumes has dropped from 64% to 53% since January 2023. The regulatory crackdown, as well as legal trouble associated with the SEC and the CFTC, has led to the shedding of more than 10% of the crypto giant’s market share. Rival crypto exchanges, including Bybit and OKX, have benefitted from Binance’s woes by soaking up the market share lost by the crypto giant. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Binance US’s market share slipped below 1% in the second quarter of 2023. The international exchange’s derivatives volume has also taken a hit this year. Following the lawsuit by CFTC, the exchange’s perpetual market share dropped from 66% to 56%. Kaiko reported that American crypto giant Coinbase also suffered a similar fate with its market share going from 8% to 5.4%.</p>



<p>Despite the sinking market share and mounting regulatory and legal trouble, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao remains optimistic about the future of his crypto exchange. In a recent ask-me-anything session hosted on Twitter, Zhao stated that the trading platform is undergoing a lot of preparation in order to ready the systems to sustain higher crypto trading volumes. Citing historical patterns, Zhao stated that he was expecting increased trading activity in the next 6 to 18 months.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>An analyst from Piper Sandler downgraded the stock of crypto exchange Coinbase earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The analyst cited uncertainty in the crypto market and the ongoing legal battle with the United States SEC.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinbase’s share price fell by more than 4% following the projection from Piper Sandler’s analyst.&nbsp;</li><li>The analyst expects the trading volumes for Q2’23 to be the lowest in two years.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>An analyst from the U.S.-based investment bank Piper Sandler downgraded the country’s largest crypto exchange. Analyst Patrick Moley circulated a note earlier today wherein he shared a grim outlook for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-brian-armstrong-sold-29000-share/">Coinbase’s </a>stock, leading to a considerable decrease in the share price. The downgrade came just a week after German banking giant Berenberg warned that the stock’s recent rally could be short-lived. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Stock Down 4.7% </strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Piper Sandler’s Patrick Moley cited Coinbase’s ongoing legal trouble with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for his latest projections. Moley also highlighted the continued lack of regulatory clarity in the United States, which according to him has created too much uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market to prudently project revenues in the coming years. </p>



<p>In the note shared earlier today, the Piper Sandler analyst downgraded his Coinbase recommendation from overweight to neutral. According to him, the trading volumes and the monthly transacting user totals for the second quarter of 2023 will be the lowest in over two years. Moley cut the price target of the stock from $65 to $60. The crypto exchange’s share price fell over 4% following the news. However, at the time of writing, the stock had slightly recovered and was trading at $78.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bearish projection from Piper Sandler came after the crypto exchange’s stock gained more than 50% over the past 30%. Much of the rally was triggered by applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) from traditional finance giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity which named Coinbase as a crypto custodian. However, Berenberg warned last week that the rally triggered by back-to-back BTC ETF applications may not last long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Valkyrie refiled its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC per a 19b-4 filing seen on Wednesday.</li><li>The asset manager joins other Wall Street titans like BlackRock and Fidelity in filing a second application after the SEC responded.</li><li>Valkyrie, like other asset managers, names Coinbase as its partner for the contentious surveillance-sharing agreement meant to tackle market manipulation.</li></ul>



<p>Trillion-dollar asset manager Valkyrie Digital Assets <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/valkyrie-is-latest-etf-issuer-to-refile-bitcoin-fund-application?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/valkyrie-is-latest-etf-issuer-to-refile-bitcoin-fund-application?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">submitted</a> another application for a spot Bitcoin ETF after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected previous attempts, saying that the filings did not address market manipulation concerns or meet the regulator&#8217;s requirements. </p>



<p>Valkyrie&#8217;s 19b-4 filing with the SEC names crypto exchange Coinbase as its partner for a contentious surveillance-sharing agreement. Notably, other issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity named Coinbase as their surveillance partners as well despite a hanging lawsuit against the exchange from America&#8217;s top securities regulator. </p>



<p>The asset manager argued its case for choosing Coinbase as its partner, noting that Nasqad previously executed a term sheet with the crypto exchange noted as the largest virtual currency trading venue in the U.S.</p>



<p>If approved by the SEC, Valkyrie would boast three separate exchange-traded funds that are tied to Bitcoin. In May 2022, the SEC approved Valkyrie&#8217;s Bitcoin futures ETF application that allows the company to offer two ETFs to investors. </p>



<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETF Wars</h2>



<p>Valkyrie is the latest wall street firm to enter the spot Bitcoin ETF frenzy as issuers race toward being the first to market with the product. Spot Bitcoin ETF will allow issuers to offer a fund that directly invests in Bitcoin. </p>



<p>BlackRock, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fidelity-bitcoin-spot-etf-blackrock/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fidelity-bitcoin-spot-etf-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a>, 21 Shares/ARK Invest, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco, VanECK, and Valkyrie have all filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart confirmed. BlackRock&#8217;s June 15 filing seemingly galvanized a wave of applications. The filing also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-rallies-29000-blackrock-etf-plays/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-rallies-29000-blackrock-etf-plays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> buoyed Bitcoin&#8217;s price above 30,000. </p>

<p>The local office of Binance Australia was probed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) as part of the regulator&#8217;s investigation into crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchange. </p>



<p>According to people familiar with the matter, ASIC&#8217;s search of Binance&#8217;s premises is part of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/binance-australia-offices-searched-by-regulator-as-part-of-derivatives-probe?" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/binance-australia-offices-searched-by-regulator-as-part-of-derivatives-probe?" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">probe</a> into client classification on the platform and its local derivatives business. Bloomberg reported that the trading venue is cooperating with local authorities. </p>



<h2>Binance Australia Stuck In Derivatives Debacle</h2>



<p>Today&#8217;s search comes after 500 derivatives positions were liquidated on the platform in February. The issue also reportedly affected user accounts, and some accounts were mysteriously closed down. </p>

<p>Binance is also under heavy scrutiny in jurisdictions across the U.S. and Europe. The company&#8217;s office in Paris was stormed by officials investigating allegedly &#8220;aggravated money laundering&#8221;. Crypto&#8217;s leading CEX also pulled back from the U.K. and Cyprus. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A proposal on Aave DAO to move $3 million in ETH from the treasury into wrapped staked ETH and rocket pool ETH is active in the project’s governance forum.</li><li>The proposal with 252,152 votes in favor argues that converting 1,600 ETH to liquid staking derivatives will earn higher yield for the protocol.</li><li>Staking wstETH would earn 3.8% yield and 3.13% by staking rETH while retaining liquidity for the DeFi service, the proposal noted. </li></ul>



<p>Aave DAO members are <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=261" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=261" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">voting</a> on a proposal to earn higher yield by converting 1,600 unstaked Ether (ETH) from the DeFi platform&#8217;s treasury into two liquid staking derivatives &#8211; wrapped staked ETH (wstETH) and rocket pool ETH (rETH). </p>



<h2>Aave DAO To Staked Unproductive ETH Balance</h2>



<p>The proposal argues that Aave would generate a higher yield by converting part of its unstaked ETH treasury into LSD. Currently, staking on the DeFi lender&#8217;s version 2 or V2 platform generates 1.69%.  Staking-wrapped ETH and rocket pool ETH would earn the protocol 3.8% and 3.13% respectively. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Aave DAO currently holds 1,786.51 awETH (v2) and 104.548 units of ETH in the Collector Contract. The awETH deposit yield in Aave v2 earns 1.69%, relative to 3.8% with wstETH and 3.13% with rETH. This AIP converts all the unproductive ETH balance, along with aWETH (v2 and v3) into the same amounts of wstETH and rETH.</p></blockquote>



<p>LSDs like wrapped staked ETH and rocket pool ETH allow stakers to lock up their tokens without losing access to liquidity. Liquid staking derivatives achieve this by accepting collateral &#8211; which is the staked crypto like ETH &#8211; and offering a derivative of that token. </p>



<p>At press time, 252,152 votes support the move of out the 320,000 required for the proposal to pass. Notably, 236,000 of the votes were cast by a single wallet with the ENS &#8220;aavechan.eth&#8221;.  The DeFi protocol&#8217;s token was down 2% in the last 24 hours at press time and exchanged hands around $75. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Crypto exchange operators in South Africa have until November 30 this year to apply for a license.</li><li>This forms part of a plan by the country’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority designed to standardize the local industry and mitigate crypto-asset risks.</li><li>The FSCA already received 20 applications since the policy was announced and promised enforcement action against operators without a license after the November deadline.</li></ul>



<p>South Africa&#8217;s top watchdog is introducing a licensing regime that requires crypto operators and digital asset exchanges to apply for a license before November or risk enforcement action. </p>



<p>Indeed, the country’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) set a deadline of November 30 for crypto exchanges to submit applications. 20 crypto operators have registered for a crypto license with the FSCA, per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/south-africa-to-require-crypto-exchanges-licensing-by-year-end?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/south-africa-to-require-crypto-exchanges-licensing-by-year-end?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>. </p>



<h2>Africa&#8217;s First Licensing Regime For Crypto Operators</h2>



<p>This new policy is the regulator&#8217;s response to previous scam incidents like the 2021 Africrypt Bitcoin heist and risks tied to crypto assets. </p>



<p>The Cajee brothers are wanted in South Africa after disappearing with 70,000 Bitcoin from the Africrypt crypto exchange. Another local crypto startup, Mirror Trading Internation, and its CEO Cornelius Johannes Steynberg <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-penalizes-bitcoin-operator/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-penalizes-bitcoin-operator/" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a $3.4 billion fine</a> from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the regulator&#8217;s &#8220;largest ever fraud scheme case involving bitcoin&#8221;.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework. Time will tell the effectiveness of our measures, and we will continue to work together with the industry to refine and make changes where and if necessary.</p></blockquote>



<p>The FSCA&#8217;s policy is Africa&#8217;s first regulatory framework for licensing crypto operators and exchanges, further highlighting South Africa&#8217;s position as a leading area in the continent&#8217;s virtual currency ecosystem. </p>



<p>In other regions like Europe and the Middle East, policymakers are introducing laws like the EU&#8217;s MiCA and Dubai&#8217;s VARA handbook for DASP registration as more crypto businesses look outside the U.S. amid a crackdown by regulators like the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>. </p>

<ul><li>Cameron Winklevoss has sent an open letter to the CEO of the Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert.&nbsp;</li><li>The Gemini co-founder accused Silbert of committing fraud by concealing key info related to Genesis’ financial health.&nbsp;</li><li>Winklevoss issued an ultimatum to Silbert, which laid out a plan to restructure DCG’s outstanding debts.&nbsp;</li><li>The Gemini chief stated that failing to agree with the proposed restructuring plan would lead to the filing of a lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Crypto entrepreneur Cameron Winklevoss has accused Digital Currency Group’s founder Barry Silbert of committing fraud in a scathing open letter. The Gemini co-founder did not hold back in his latest open letter to Silbert, which accused the latter and DCG of fostering a culture of lies and deceit and misleading the crypto conglomerate’s shareholders and creditors. The latest development came over six months after Winklevoss penned the first open letter to Barry Silbert.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Cameron Winklevoss: DCG Engaged In Fraudulent Behavior </strong></h2>



<p>Cameron Winklevoss took to <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1676024844641550337" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share the open letter to Barry Silbert with more than 700,000 of his followers. Winklevoss stated that the letter was on behalf of the 232,000 Gemini Earn users who have been stranded since DCG-owned <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-extends-genesis-mediation-period/">Genesis</a> suspended withdrawals last year. Silbert’s crypto giant owes a whopping $1.2 billion to the Earn users. The Gemini co-founder reminded Silbert that his company owed another $2.1 billion to other creditors. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It takes a special kind of person to owe $3.3 billion dollars to hundreds of thousands of people and believe, or at least pretend to believe, that they are some kind of victim. Not even Sam Bankman-Fried was capable of such delusion.” </p><cite>Cameron Winklevoss to Barry Silbert</cite></blockquote>



<p>Winklevoss accused the Digital Currency Group of engaging in fraudulent behavior and cited the false and misleading statements that Silbert and his aides had put out to conceal the insolvency and financial health of Genesis. According to the proposed restructuring plan laid out by Cameron Winklevoss, the outstanding $630 million debt owed by DCG to Genesis would be divided into two parts: a forbearance payment of $275 million that would be due on or before July 21, 2023.</p>

<p>The forbearance payment would be followed by the Tranche 1 payment of $355 million, which would come due in 2 years from the date of the Plan Support Agreement (PSA). Next would be the Tranche 2 payment of $835 million, which would be due in 5 years from the effective date of the PSA. This tranche includes a discount of $25 million. According to Winklevoss, Silbert’s failure to comply with the restructuring plan would lead to a lawsuit against DCG and him personally.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Revolut will stop offering ADA, MATIC, and SOL for users in the United States starting September 18, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The British neobank’s announcement came after its service provider Bakkt delisted the tokens.</li><li>The neobank clarified that there were no plans to delist the tokens in other markets.&nbsp;</li><li>ADA, MATIC, and SOL were listed as unregistered securities in the SEC’s recent lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.</li></ul>



<p>London-based Revolut has announced that it will delist three mainstream crypto tokens from the American version of its platform. The British neobank will stop offering Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) to customers based in the United States starting September 18, 2023. The crypto tokens boast a combined market capitalization of more than $24 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Delisting Will Be Limited To Revolut’s American Users</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/revolut-to-delist-solana-cardano-polygon-tokens-for-us-users" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Revolut’s customers will be able to sell off ADA, SOL, and MATIC from their accounts till September 18, 2023, following which the cryptocurrencies will automatically be converted to USD deposits. The British neobank’s latest move came after its service provider Bakkt Holdings’ delisted the crypto tokens last month due to increasing regulatory uncertainty in the United States.  The firm told its customers that the delisting of SOL, ADA, and MATIC would be limited to the United States with other markets remaining unaffected. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our US crypto services provider has decided to delist these tokens due to the changing laws and regulations around cryptocurrency in the US. Because of this, we’ll no longer be able to process your buy and sell orders for these tokens.”</p><cite>Revolut</cite></blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, MATIC and ADA surged following the news of their imminent delisting from Revolut. Meanwhile, SOL saw a slight decrease in its price. The three cryptocurrencies were previously delisted by the social trading platform eToro and California-based brokerage <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/">Robinhood</a> as well. The tokens were also listed as unregistered securities in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. </p>
