			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Bank of Korea shortlisted three regions for potential CBDC testing next year, and the country&rsquo;s capital ​​Seoul was not on the list.</p>
Jeju, Busan, and Incheon Make the Cut
<p>On July 31, 2023, a local South Korean media outlet shared updates regarding preparations for the launch of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) in South Korea. The government has been working on the South Korean digital won since at least 2020 and has finally scheduled its pilot for the next year.</p>
<p>According to the report, the Bank of Korea has chosen Jeju, Busan, and Incheon as candidates for the &ldquo;private target CBDC test bed&rdquo; in collaboration with commercial banks. In other words, one of these three regions will eventually be selected to test the public distribution process and the use of the CBDC as a means of payment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, Jeju has the highest chances of becoming the CBDC pilot site, as one of the bank officials explained:</p>

<p>"In the case of Busan, the number of eligible citizens is so large that the Bank of Korea is burdened in many ways, so the opinion was greatly inclined to Jeju, which has the next largest population." </p>

<p>It was also mentioned that the CBDC testing will be similar to the issuance and distribution structure of the current local currencies. South Korea introduced local currencies as alternative currencies issued by local governments to revitalize the local economies during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>All of the three suggested regions for the CBDC pilot are currently issuing and distributing their own local currencies (&ldquo;Tamranjeon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dongbaekjeon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Incheon e-Eum&rdquo;). This might be the reason why the Bank of Korea narrowed down these regions and bypassed Seoul.</p>

<p>A commercial bank official said, "The CBDC electronic wallet (app) will allow not only local residents but also many unspecified civilians such as tourists to open. We are in contact with distribution companies such as large supermarkets."</p>

Obstacles for the South Korean CBDC Launch
<p>The report also revealed that unlike existing local currencies, the CBDC system has a lot of technical barriers to overcome. The Bank of Korea tested the payment performance of the CBDC system for about six months last year, and it was found to be inferior to major domestic micropayment operators in terms of processing speed.</p>

<p>An official from the IT industry said, "As the Bank of Korea is planning a large-scale retail payment system project soon, it is in need of an exceptionally large number of IT personnel. A large number of related personnel, including large companies, are on the move,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>Besides, one of the biggest problems the South Korean digital market has been facing lately is a surge in criminal activities. To combat that, the government announced the launch of a multi-agency investigation unit earlier this month.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Tether issued its 2023 Second Quarter attestation report, revealing a net profit of $850M and over $1B of operational profits.&nbsp;</p>
Tether Excess Reserves Reach $3.3B Despite a Dip in the Quarterly Net Profit
<p>On Monday, July 31, the top stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings Limited issued its new quarterly attestation report. The assurance opinion for Q2 of 2023 was completed by BDO, a global independent accounting firm. The attestation re-affirms the accuracy of Tether&rsquo;s Consolidated Reserves Report (CRR), providing a detailed breakdown of the Group's assets as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>According to the report, a surplus of $850 million in net profit brought the company&rsquo;s total excess reserves to the all-time-high of $3.3 billion at the end of Q2. However, the increase itself is almost twice lower compared to the previous quarter&rsquo;s net profit which was reported to be around $1.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tether reminded that its excess reserves are the company&rsquo;s own profits and not distributed to shareholders. These reserves are kept in addition to the 100% reserves that &ldquo;Tether maintains to back all the outstanding tokens&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that during the period of April 2023 to June 2023, Tether&rsquo;s operational profits exceeded $1B, showing once again a 30% growth. Meanwhile, the company's share buyback amounted to 115M USD, the sum aimed at strengthening the shareholder group. As for Tether&rsquo;s reserves, they continue to be extremely liquid, with around 85% of investments held in cash or cash equivalents.</p>
<p>Both Tether&rsquo;s CRR and the BDO attestation confirm that Tether&rsquo;s consolidated assets once more surpass its consolidated liabilities. The Management of the Company reported that as of June 30, 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
&ldquo;The Group&rsquo;s consolidated total assets amount to at least US$ 86,499,251,218.
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
The Group&rsquo;s consolidated total liabilities amount to US$ 83,200,775,340 of which US$ 83,178,020,411 relate to digital tokens issued.
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
The Group&rsquo;s consolidated assets exceed its consolidated liabilities.&rdquo;
</li>
</ul>
USDT Market Cap Approaches $84B Mark, Its New ATH
<p>Tether&rsquo;s USDT remains to be the top stablecoin on the crypto market. According to CoinMarketCap, USDT is now the third largest coin by market capitalization, following Bitcoin and Ethereum. </p>
<p>This month, USDT&rsquo;s market cap reached the new high of $84 billion which the coin last approached in May of 2022. It is a large increase since the beginning of the year when the coin&rsquo;s market cap number stood at only $66 billion.</p>

<p>Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, commented on the attestation report, &ldquo;Transparency is not just a buzzword for us; it is the cornerstone of our philosophy&hellip; With a firm focus on transparency, we aim to shape a future where every participant in the global financial ecosystem can confidently navigate a realm built on trust and innovation. That&rsquo;s why in this quarter, Tether&rsquo;s USD₮ token in circulation surpassed its previous all-time high."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Solana (SOL) is among the minor gainers of all large-cap cryptocurrencies, and experts say there could be more coming in the next few days. Similarly, investors position themselves for profit on Uwerx as its presale becomes the major highlight of the market. The project is in the 5th Stage of its presale and has raised close to $2 million. The opportunities are time bound, and only those who join early can benefit from the project&lsquo;s success. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt; BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Solana (SOL) Sees Minor Gains
<p>The market hasn&rsquo;t been favorable to Solana (SOL) over the past years, and the cryptocurrency is way below its all-time high of $260 in 2021. However, it&rsquo;s understandable that the bear market has had its toll on many other altcoins. Solana (SOL) is looking to restore its value, and the cryptocurrency has been nearly 4% higher in the last 24 hours. The project has been bearish since the 8th of May this year, and the recent pumps could signify a change in direction moving forward. </p>
<p>In addition, Solana (SOL) is still one of the leading blockchain systems offering the best environment and conditions for projects to build and thrive. While Solana (SOL) sees some minor gains, hinging toward price recovery, Uwerx is a project that started on a promising note, with the best performance so far in its ongoing presale. </p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale Ends Today!
<p>The freelance industry grew three times faster than many other industries, and it is leading in the world of work. In addition, recent research reveals that most companies and businesses want to incorporate freelance workers into their workforce.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana (SOL) is among the minor gainers of all large-cap cryptocurrencies, and experts say there could be more coming in the next few days.

Solana (SOL) Sees Minor Gains
<p>The market hasn&rsquo;t been favorable to Solana (SOL) over the past years, and the cryptocurrency is way below its all-time high of $260 in 2021. However, it&rsquo;s understandable that the bear market has had its toll on many other altcoins. Solana (SOL) is looking to restore its value, and the cryptocurrency has been nearly 4% higher in the last 24 hours. The project has been bearish since the 8th of May this year, and the recent pumps could signify a change in direction moving forward. </p>
<p>In addition, Solana (SOL) is still one of the leading blockchain systems offering the best environment and conditions for projects to build and thrive. While Solana (SOL) sees some minor gains, hinging toward price recovery, Uwerx is a project that started on a promising note, with the best performance so far in its ongoing presale. </p>

Polygon (MATIC) Price Prediction
<p class="s6">Many traders and investors are seeing Polygon (MATIC) due to its most recent price movements but are still confused about whether it's the right time to hold or sell their assets. As of July 28, 2023, Polygon traded at a value of $0.707502.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, during the past week, the low point for the MATIC cryptocurrency was at $0.700706, while the high point was at $0.778746. This indicates that the crypto is holding onto the $0.70 support point with ease.</p>

<p class="s10">Pomerdoge (POMD) Bullish Trend To Continue in August</p>

<p class="s6">Likewise, with its engaging gameplay, it provides the opportunity for players to get access to returns for their time spent playing.</p>
<p class="s6">In addition, it is on the brink of its much-awaited launch, expected to occur in September of 2023. Subsequently, it passed audits by SOLIDProof and Cyberscope, and early investors can get exclusive advantages.</p>
<p class="s6">Uniquely, one of these advantages is access to a unique collection of 7,777 NFTs. Each possesses its own distinctive value and in-game utility.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, at the current stage of its presale, Pomerdoge (POMD) trades at just $0.007, and analysts predict that it can spike by 4.000% by the end of the year when it launches. Investors do not want to miss out on the opportunity to get into this potential blue-chip token.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The presale round of Tradecurve (TCRV) has taken the crypto world by storm with its eye-popping growth projection. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) and TRON (TRX) have struggled to stop their investors from agitating. Tradecurve has become an instant hit after entering the market. It has raised around $180k during its presale so far.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Stellar (XLM) Settles With Mediocre Gains
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) has been one of the best performers in 2023. But the recent weeks have been mediocre for Stellar. The market value of Stellar (XLM) tokens has dropped by 12% in the past week. However, Stellar has risen by 2% on the monthly chart. However, the current trading price of Stellar is 90% down from its peak of $0.94.</p>
<p class="s5">Experts have cited Stellar&rsquo;s recent partnerships as the main reason behind the increase in the network&rsquo;s price. Stellar recently hit the headlines after Brazil&rsquo;s central bank selected it for the development of its digital currency,</p>
<p class="s5">Digital Real. Besides, Stellar is now connected to Polkadot through the Pendulum parachain, which has added to the bullish momentum of XLM. Currently, Stellar is trading at $0.0943.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
TRON&rsquo;s (TRX) Development Activity Plunges
<p class="s5">Analysts have been closely observing the price trajectory of TRX since the US SEC filed a lawsuit against TRON founder, Justin Sun. Notably, TRON (TRX) lost 6% of its market value in March. Hence, any event having ramifications on TRON is of significance for investors, who will then decide to stay with the network.</p>
<p class="s5">Besides a lawsuit against its founder, TRON has also suffered from a 36% plunge in the development activity on the network. These bearish events forced TRON to unveil its new staking mechanism called Stake 2.0.</p>
<p class="s5">However, TRON has faced criticism after unveiling the new staking mechanism, as some of its community members have raised questions about the preparedness of the network for this update. A TRON token is currently available to purchase at $0.0653.</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Prepares a Solid Foundation For Mega Launch
<p class="s5">The overall crypto market is expanding its ecosystem rapidly. Its user penetration is expected to be 8.8% in 2023, and 12.5% by 2027, and the number of crypto traders can clock over 994 million in the next five years. Tapping this huge target market, Tradecurve (TCRV) is pegged to become one of the top three trading exchanges in the world.</p>
<p class="s5">Existing trading platforms are either dealing with only cryptocurrencies, or exclusively facilitating the trade of conventional derivatives. But Tradecurve is a revolutionary platform thatallows the trading of cryptocurrencies, stocks, Forex, commodities, ETFs, bonds, and more, on from a single account. </p>
<p class="s5">It has also rolled out an educational academy, where investors can learn new techniques and strategies to polish their skills.</p>
<p class="s5">Its presale phase is currently advancing through stage 1, and the price of TCRV tokens is $0.018. It is forecasted to jump by 50x during the presale phase, and 100x after getting listed on Uniswapand multiple CEXs. So, if you are willing to convert your thousand dollars into millions, lock your TCRV now before the tokens get sold out. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Pepe (PEPE) Soar on Bullish Whale Activity 
<p class="s8">Pepe (PEPE) is a cryptocurrency inspired by the internet meme Pepe the Frog. Surprisingly, Pepe experienced a phenomenal rally after its launch on April 16th, achieving a 7000% price pump within just 17 days.</p>
<p class="s8">However, its price sharply dropped to $0.000001153 on May 12th, 2023, and has been on a decline since then. According to CoinMarketCap, Pepe is bullish today trading at $0.00000143, an increase of 12% in the last 24 hours. This is coming after huge whale activity.</p>
<p class="s8">Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, revealed that two whales bought over 1.56 trillion tokens. This is about 1,100 ETH ($2.06 million). Although Pepe's price has dropped, it still maintains a robust market cap of over $500 million. However, being a meme coin with no use case, Pepe would have a tough time reaching $0.01. Besides, Pepe will have to soar more than 600,000x to reach $0.01.</p>
Floki Inu (FLOKI) Drops 8% on the Weekly Chart 
<p class="s8">The Floki Inu (FLOKI) project initially started as a meme-coin based on Elon Musk's dog. However, it has since evolved into a fully-fledged web3 project, spanning DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. The Floki token is now famously referred to as "The People's Crypto." Meanwhile, Floki Inu is bearish on the weekly timeframe, trading at $0.00002243. This is an 8.01% price decline in the past 7 days.</p>
<p class="s8">Floki Inu is 93.46% away from its all-time high of $0.0003437. Similarly, Floki Inu's trading volume has been on a steep decline. It has dropped by about &nbsp;24.10% in the last 24 hours, a sign of low market activity and support from investors. Looking forward, Floki Inu has a bleak chance of hitting 0.01$ in 2023.</p>
Analysts: Pomerdoge (POMD) To Skyrocket 4,000%
<p class="s8">Unlike Pepe and Floki Inu, Pomerdoge has a great utility that would increase its price in 2023. Currently, the token's price stands at a mere $0.007. Despite this, analysts express a bullish outlook on the project, projecting an impressive 4,000% ROI for potential investors.</p>
<p class="s8">Pomerdoge aims to capitalize on the potential of the blockchain gaming market as a P2E cryptocurrency game. As per MarketsandMarkets, the global blockchain gaming market will hit $65.7 billion by 2027.</p>
<p class="s8">Pomerdoge's vision is to foster global connections among players by offering an engaging and competitive gaming experience. The SolidProof and Cyberscope have already audited the project, ensuring user security. &nbsp;At the heart of the Pomerdoge ecosystem lies $POMD, the Pomerdoge token.</p>
<p class="s8">This in-game currency grants users access to a variety of benefits, including NFTs, rewards, and exclusive items from the Pomerdoge marketplace.</p>

<p class="s8">However, its price sharply dropped to $0.000001153 on May 12th, 2023, and has been on a decline since then. According to CoinMarketCap, Pepe is bullish today trading at $0.00000143, an increase of 12% in the last 24 hours. This is coming after huge whale activity.</p>
<p class="s8">Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, revealed that two whales bought over 1.56 trillion tokens. This is about 1,100 ETH ($2.06 million). Although Pepe's price has dropped, it still maintains a robust market cap of over $500 million. However, being a meme coin with no use case, Pepe would have a tough time reaching $0.01. Besides, Pepe will have to soar more than 600,000x to reach $0.01.</p>
Floki Inu (FLOKI) Drops 8% on the Weekly Chart 
<p class="s8">The Floki Inu (FLOKI) project initially started as a meme-coin based on Elon Musk's dog. However, it has since evolved into a fully-fledged web3 project, spanning DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. The Floki token is now famously referred to as "The People's Crypto." Meanwhile, Floki Inu is bearish on the weekly timeframe, trading at $0.00002243. This is an 8.01% price decline in the past 7 days.</p>
<p class="s8">Floki Inu is 93.46% away from its all-time high of $0.0003437. Similarly, Floki Inu's trading volume has been on a steep decline. It has dropped by about &nbsp;24.10% in the last 24 hours, a sign of low market activity and support from investors. Looking forward, Floki Inu has a bleak chance of hitting 0.01$ in 2023.</p>
Analysts: Pomerdoge (POMD) To Skyrocket 4,000%
<p class="s8">Unlike Pepe and Floki Inu, Pomerdoge has a great utility that would increase its price in 2023. Currently, the token's price stands at a mere $0.007. Despite this, analysts express a bullish outlook on the project, projecting an impressive 4,000% ROI for potential investors.</p>
<p class="s8">Pomerdoge aims to capitalize on the potential of the blockchain gaming market as a P2E cryptocurrency game. As per MarketsandMarkets, the global blockchain gaming market will hit $65.7 billion by 2027.</p>
<p class="s8">Pomerdoge's vision is to foster global connections among players by offering an engaging and competitive gaming experience. The SolidProof and Cyberscope have already audited the project, ensuring user security. &nbsp;At the heart of the Pomerdoge ecosystem lies $POMD, the Pomerdoge token.</p>
<p class="s8">This in-game currency grants users access to a variety of benefits, including NFTs, rewards, and exclusive items from the Pomerdoge marketplace.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The IoTeX blockchain governance community voted 94% in favor staking 54 million IOTX tokens to push forward IIP-22 to simplify its domain names (INS), similar to Ethereum&rsquo;s ENS. The benefits of INS include human-readable names, increased security, improved accessibility, and resource identifiers.</p>
<p>As stated by IoTeX in their blog announcing the IIP-22 voting period, &ldquo;Crypto addresses are frustratingly long, garbled strings like &ldquo;lswli4yuofd8a0s&rdquo; &ndash; a clunky mechanism that often leaves room for error when inputting. And as cryptocurrencies become mainstream, there will be a substantial market for Web3 addresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similarly to the ENS, INS allows users to register and manage human-readable domain names for their IoTeX addresses, smart contracts, decentralized websites, and other IoTeX-based resources.</p>
<p>IoTeX&rsquo;s INS promotes mass adoption by discovering decentralized services and applications more manageable by providing human-readable domain names, making it easier to search and navigate the blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The INS also provides a unified namespace across multiple dApps and blockchain platforms, enabling using the same INS domain name for various services, eliminating the need to remember different addresses for different applications.</p>
<p>Regarding decentralization and security, INS operates on the IoTeX blockchain, leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. That ensures that domain ownership and control are in the hands of the users themselves, reducing the risk of censorship or manipulation. And it can be integrated into popular wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications, allowing seamless use of domain names across various platforms and services.</p>
<p>Users are empowered with INS as it gives them ownership and control over their domain names and associated cryptocurrency addresses. Users can update or transfer their domains as needed, providing a sense of empowerment and autonomy.</p>
<p>IoTeX&rsquo;s name service fosters a community-driven ecosystem where developers, organizations, and individuals can collaborate, build upon, and innovate, driving creativity and the development of new dApps and services.</p>
<p>INS is yet another adaptation to simplify onboarding the masses to Web3 by IoTeX, leader of the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), the most significant trend in crypto that by 2028 will grow to over $3.5 trillion.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Uwerx, the new rising star in the freelancing space, has surpassed Pepe (PEPE), as it progresses successfully to reach its hard cap presale. The project is making waves in an industry set to be worth $455 billion by the end of the year. </p>
<p class="s6">This milestone shows the growing hype and potential of Uwerx, placing it as a formidable player in the crypto market. This article will explore Uwerx's impressive achievements and the factors that have led to its progress.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Pepe (PEPE) Falls Behind
<p class="s6">Pepe (PEPE), adapted from the iconic movie character Pepe The Frog, stands as one of the leading memecoin in the crypto space. The coin became popular by giving extraordinary 5000%+ returns since inception. </p>
<p class="s6">A significant purchase has sparked interest in the crypto space. A tech entrepreneur and controversial musician, Jeffrey Huang, popularly known as Machi Big Brother, made the front page by buying a staggering 6 billion PEPE tokens for just $12,000. Industry observers are watching closely with many questions trying to figure out the moves of this prominent musician in the crypto ecosystem. </p>
How Does This Affect PEPE?
<p class="s6">Pepe (PEPE) has had a very optimistic look, trading at $0.000001369, with a significant daily increase of over 45%. However, it is paramount to note that Pepe (PEPE) still lags behind Uwerx's WERX token, which is priced at $0.041 in the final/fifth funding presale round. The comparison shows the different market positions and valuations of these two coins. </p>
<p class="s6">Despite having a bullish trend, experts still predict a potential fall of more than 5% for Pepe (PEPE). While making investment decisions, it is important to be very cautious and consider market facts to avoid huge losses. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Is Secure, And Has Long-Term Prospects
<p class="s6">The crypto market has seen many crypto projects that have risen and fallen rapidly, creating a significant hole in the pockets of investors. As a result, investors have become more strict and scrutinize tokens more thoroughly before investing. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx stands out because it has undergone thorough vetting and auditing by SolidProof and InterFi Network. These reputable entities have ensured transparency and security within the project and have given investors confidence and peace of mind.</p>
<p class="s6">The project&rsquo;s team has taken proactive measures to protect investors from potential losses and ensure the project's integrity. They have locked the team's tokens for nine months, eliminating the possibility of rug pulls and demonstrating the team's commitment to long-term success. </p>
<p class="s6">In addition, when the project lists on centralized exchanges, the development team will renounce smart contract ownership, further safeguarding investors' interests. The team's tokens were locked on Wednesday, 7 June, and their token allocation was cut to 7% before getting locked, making room for more investors and distributing the project's benefits widely. </p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, adding to its security measures, the platform provides the Uwerx Vault as a security and staking option for users. By using the Vault can earn rewards, creating an incentive for long-term holding.</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx Vault is not the only offer that the project is giving. An amazing 15% purchase bonus is up for the take. This offer further incentivizes investors to maximize their returns and become a part of the thriving Uwerx community.</p>
Uwerx Sets Pace For Community Governance
<p class="s6">To ensure accuracy and user wallet verification, 98.2% of the community voted for a Test Airdrop initiative. The Test Airdrop proposal serves as a means to minimize the risk of mistakes. This proactive move emphasizes Uwerx's dedication to maintaining a secure and reliable platform for its users. </p>
<p class="s6">With the project in its fifth funding presale round, enthusiasts have shown significant support leading to remarkable growth and increased popularity. The Uwerx community has about 8,500 sign-ups, 2,200 Telegram members, and 1,800 Twitter followers and continues to grow rapidly. </p>
<p class="s6">For the fifth funding stage, the project has a substantial token allocation of seventy-two million and five hundred thousand tokens out of a total supply of seven hundred and fifty million tokens. The WERX token is priced at $0.0564. The rise of WERX has propelled it to eclipse popular coins like PEPE and SHIB, and it is anticipated to soon surpass DOGE. The hard cap presale is on 31 July, so investing early will be very beneficial. </p>
<p class="s6">By focusing on the freelancing ecosystem, Uwerx is well-suited to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities in the sector. Velocity Global reported that by the end of 2023, the freelancing economy is projected to be worth $455 billion. Utilizing an attractive position, Uwerx charges a low transaction fee of 1%, while other platforms charge high fees ranging from 10% to 20%. </p>
<p class="s6">The Alpha Version of the platform features essential pages such as Sign-Up, Login, and Forgot Password, as well as Freelancer or Client Initiation, My Activity, and Initial Steps of Finding Talent and Job Creation. Additionally, new pages like Freelancer Profile Creation, Settings, Application Boosting, and Milestones were added based on valuable user feedback. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx welcomes further input from users through feedback@uwerx.network. The developers utilize an agile methodology that ensures rapid deployment and accelerated development through user feedback. </p>
<p class="s6">Excitingly, the development of the Beta version of the platform has started. As Uwerx increases its features and refines its offering, it is poised to become a leading player in the freelancing ecosystem. </p>
<p class="s6">The project will soon eclipse Pepe (PEPE), solidifying itself as a promising contender in the freelancing and crypto space. From its innovative Alpha platform to a thriving and growing community, Uwerx is poised for great success.</p>

<p class="s6">Uwerx stands out because it has undergone thorough vetting and auditing by SolidProof and InterFi Network. These reputable entities have ensured transparency and security within the project and have given investors confidence and peace of mind.</p>
<p class="s6">The project&rsquo;s team has taken proactive measures to protect investors from potential losses and ensure the project's integrity. They have locked the team's tokens for nine months, eliminating the possibility of rug pulls and demonstrating the team's commitment to long-term success. </p>
<p class="s6">In addition, when the project lists on centralized exchanges, the development team will renounce smart contract ownership, further safeguarding investors' interests. The team's tokens were locked on Wednesday, 7 June, and their token allocation was cut to 7% before getting locked, making room for more investors and distributing the project's benefits widely. </p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, adding to its security measures, the platform provides the Uwerx Vault as a security and staking option for users. By using the Vault can earn rewards, creating an incentive for long-term holding.</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx Vault is not the only offer that the project is giving. An amazing 15% purchase bonus is up for the take. This offer further incentivizes investors to maximize their returns and become a part of the thriving Uwerx community.</p>
Uwerx Sets Pace For Community Governance
<p class="s6">To ensure accuracy and user wallet verification, 98.2% of the community voted for a Test Airdrop initiative. The Test Airdrop proposal serves as a means to minimize the risk of mistakes. This proactive move emphasizes Uwerx's dedication to maintaining a secure and reliable platform for its users. </p>
<p class="s6">With the project in its fifth funding presale round, enthusiasts have shown significant support leading to remarkable growth and increased popularity. The Uwerx community has about 8,500 sign-ups, 2,200 Telegram members, and 1,800 Twitter followers and continues to grow rapidly. </p>
<p class="s6">For the fifth funding stage, the project has a substantial token allocation of seventy-two million and five hundred thousand tokens out of a total supply of seven hundred and fifty million tokens. The WERX token is priced at $0.0564. The rise of WERX has propelled it to eclipse popular coins like PEPE and SHIB, and it is anticipated to soon surpass DOGE. The hard cap presale is on 31 July, so investing early will be very beneficial. </p>
<p class="s6">By focusing on the freelancing ecosystem, Uwerx is well-suited to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities in the sector. Velocity Global reported that by the end of 2023, the freelancing economy is projected to be worth $455 billion. Utilizing an attractive position, Uwerx charges a low transaction fee of 1%, while other platforms charge high fees ranging from 10% to 20%. </p>
<p class="s6">The Alpha Version of the platform features essential pages such as Sign-Up, Login, and Forgot Password, as well as Freelancer or Client Initiation, My Activity, and Initial Steps of Finding Talent and Job Creation. Additionally, new pages like Freelancer Profile Creation, Settings, Application Boosting, and Milestones were added based on valuable user feedback. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx welcomes further input from users through feedback@uwerx.network. The developers utilize an agile methodology that ensures rapid deployment and accelerated development through user feedback. </p>
<p class="s6">Excitingly, the development of the Beta version of the platform has started. As Uwerx increases its features and refines its offering, it is poised to become a leading player in the freelancing ecosystem. </p>
<p class="s6">The project will soon eclipse Pepe (PEPE), solidifying itself as a promising contender in the freelancing and crypto space. From its innovative Alpha platform to a thriving and growing community, Uwerx is poised for great success.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Japan&rsquo;s Blockchain Association (JBA) reportedly urged the government to revise tax rules imposed on virtual assets. </p>
<p>The JBA has called on the Japanese government to reform its crypto tax rules. The association argues the tax system in its current form hinders the growth of Web3 in Japan.</p>
Revised Tax Rules Will Foster Web3 Growth
<p>According to reports by local Japanese news website, Coinpost, the JBA requested that government reconsider its current tax system for virtual currencies as it hinders the growth of Web3 in the country. The organisation says its proposed revisions would allow more domestic companies to enter the burgeoning sector. The JBA also called for developing a crypto-friendly environment where citizens can own and use crypto assets.</p>
<p>The JBA, led by co-founder and CEO of Bitflyer, Yuza Kano, suggest the following three reforms:</p>
Eliminating Year-End Unrealised Gain Tax on Third-Party Issued Tokens
<p>Japan&rsquo;s National Tax Agency (NTA) amended rules on corporate tax rules which provide a tax exemption to companies issuing cryptocurrencies. Under its previous system, companies that issue cryptocurrencies must pay taxes on unrealised gains at the end of a tax period.</p>
<p>The rules, however, did not change as they pertain to third-party token issuers. The JBA argues unrealised profit tax on third-party issuers is a barrier for domestic companies to enter the Web3 space.</p>
Changing the Taxation Method for Individual Crypto Asset Transactions to Separate Self-Assessment taxation, Applying a Uniform 20% Rate
<p>The JBA&rsquo;s suggestions further state that losses should be carried forward and deducted in the three years after the year in which they occurred, thereby reducing tax.</p>
Eliminating Income Tax on Profits for Every Crypto Asset Transaction/Exchange
<p>The association opines that fostering an environment in which citizens want to invest will, in turn, increase the amount of tax the government can collect.</p>

<p>Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange, has been awarded an Operational Minimum Viable Product (MVP) license from Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). Binance FZE is the first cryptocurrency exchange in the world to receive such a license.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">#Binance FZE, our Dubai based subsidiary, is the world's first exchange to receive the Operational Minimum Viable Product licence in Dubai.Eligible users can now access regulated virtual asset services, such as fiat on and off ramp services via Binance FZE.More here 👇</p>
&mdash; Binance (@binance) July 31, 2023
<p>

</p>
Binance Granted Permission to Offer Broker-Dealer Services in Dubai
<p>In a blog post, Binance announced the news today, saying that the license allows it to offer services in Dubai approved by VARA, including exchange and broker-dealer services. Binance said the services are currently limited to institutional and qualified retail investors.</p>
<p>The exchange secured a provisional MVP license in March 2022 and a preparatory MVP license in September 2022. The exchange&rsquo;s progression from a Provisional License to an Operational License allows eligible users in the country &ldquo;to access authorized services, including the ability to safely convert virtual assets to fiat under VARA-designated standards compliant with the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Head of Regional Markets at Binance, Richard Teng, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are honored to be the first exchange to be granted an operational Minimum Viable Product License by VARA &mdash; a result of over a year of due diligence, collaboration, and consistent demonstration of responsible intent &ndash; that now allows us to be able to leverage the potential of a progressive regulatory framework, enabling innovation while furthering user protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Operating within this regulated ecosystem, we are committed to ensuring secure and seamless customer migration, with robust Know-Your-Customer and Customer-Due-Diligence as part of the rigorous onboarding remediation as stipulated by VARA. Our priority is to be able to operate this first fully regulated exchange in, and from Dubai, in a FATF-compliant ecosystem, setting the stage for global scalability with uncompromised user assurance.&rdquo;</p>

Binance Looks to UAE for Future Prospects
<p>Last month, the exchange said it was considering a move to Dubai as it continues its struggles with the US SEC. Alex Chehade, Binance Dubai&rsquo;s General Manager, said that the exchange believes the UAE is a prime destination for crypto businesses and applauds the region&rsquo;s pro-crypto stance and policies.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Who would have thought it? Crypto has now suffered harsh crackdowns from both the major world superpowers and is still undergoing increased adoption.</p>
An adapting Chinese crypto strategy
<p>First it was China. A huge and sprawling country with a very centralised government overseen by its paramount leader Xi Jinping who controls both the Chinese Communist Party and the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army, and just about everything else.</p>
<p>China has been at the forefront internationally of those countries that are looking to implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Such a move, allied to China&rsquo;s social scoring system would likely give Jinping and his central bank unrivalled power and control over Chinese citizens. Therefore, private digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are complete anathema to such a plan.</p>
<p>There followed a complete ban on trading of cryptocurrencies and a ban on crypto mining was imposed across China. However, China has implemented such bans before, and despite causing an initial large drop in the Bitcoin hash rate, as many of the Chinese Bitcoin miners came off line, much of the hash rate has since returned as the miners set up shop again in other more welcoming countries.</p>
<p>Further to Chinese embarrassment, the hash rate has increased again in China itself, leading it to become the 3rd largest contributor to the Bitcoin hash rate worldwide.</p>
<p>On top of this, the Chinese government appears to have had a change of heart as regards crypto, perhaps realising that this technology could have a much greater impact on the world as it continues to mature.</p>
<p>Still not happy with allowing crypto to have its head within the mainland borders, China looks to have nominated Hong Kong as its offshore sandbox, giving it the luxury of watching developments as Hong Kong strives to become a fully regulated crypto hub and attracts crypto companies that might have gone instead to competing Asian crypto hubs such as Dubai and Singapore.</p>
US fast becoming the most repressive regime for crypto
<p>Meanwhile in the West, the United States, once the home of business and the entrepreneurial heartland of the globe, is very much following in the footsteps of China, without even the testing ground of an offshore territory such as Hong Kong.</p>
<p>It might appear that Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, the regulatory watchdog of the US for securities, has been tasked by the government with systematically destroying the crypto industry in the United States.</p>
<p>Given that the US has managed to achieve complete financial hegemony over the rest of the world by the use of the dollar as the global reserve currency, private digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are probably being seen as a threat to this domination.</p>
<p>However, the US should be the first country to realise that no individual, regulatory body, or government, can do more than impede the progress of a new technology for any length of time. Technology cannot be repressed for long, and if it is truly innovative and ground-breaking, as is the case with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, it will always win out.</p>
<p>Therefore, the SEC&rsquo;s attacks on crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which have done their level best to follow the misty and obscure road of compliance, would appear to be the height of folly.</p>
<p>The US might be attempting to go the route of much greater control and centralisation, but it still happens to be the land of the free, even though the sands of time might be running down for that particular ideal, so it is not difficult for business leaders to see what is really happening as the regulatory agencies go far beyond their remit in order to attack and suppress the crypto industry in the US.</p>
Crypto adoption marches on
<p>Be that as it may, crypto marches onwards and upwards.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who would have thought it? Crypto has now suffered harsh crackdowns from both the major world superpowers and is still undergoing increased adoption.</p>
An adapting Chinese crypto strategy
<p>First it was China. A huge and sprawling country with a very centralised government overseen by its paramount leader Xi Jinping who controls both the Chinese Communist Party and the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army, and just about everything else.</p>
<p>China has been at the forefront internationally of those countries that are looking to implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Such a move, allied to China&rsquo;s social scoring system would likely give Jinping and his central bank unrivalled power and control over Chinese citizens. Therefore, private digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are complete anathema to such a plan.</p>
<p>There followed a complete ban on trading of cryptocurrencies and a ban on crypto mining was imposed across China. However, China has implemented such bans before, and despite causing an initial large drop in the Bitcoin hash rate, as many of the Chinese Bitcoin miners came off line, much of the hash rate has since returned as the miners set up shop again in other more welcoming countries.</p>
<p>Further to Chinese embarrassment, the hash rate has increased again in China itself, leading it to become the 3rd largest contributor to the Bitcoin hash rate worldwide.</p>
<p>On top of this, the Chinese government appears to have had a change of heart as regards crypto, perhaps realising that this technology could have a much greater impact on the world as it continues to mature.</p>
<p>Still not happy with allowing crypto to have its head within the mainland borders, China looks to have nominated Hong Kong as its offshore sandbox, giving it the luxury of watching developments as Hong Kong strives to become a fully regulated crypto hub and attracts crypto companies that might have gone instead to competing Asian crypto hubs such as Dubai and Singapore.</p>
US fast becoming the most repressive regime for crypto
<p>Meanwhile in the West, the United States, once the home of business and the entrepreneurial heartland of the globe, is very much following in the footsteps of China, without even the testing ground of an offshore territory such as Hong Kong.</p>
<p>It might appear that Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, the regulatory watchdog of the US for securities, has been tasked by the government with systematically destroying the crypto industry in the United States.</p>
<p>Given that the US has managed to achieve complete financial hegemony over the rest of the world by the use of the dollar as the global reserve currency, private digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are probably being seen as a threat to this domination.</p>
<p>However, the US should be the first country to realise that no individual, regulatory body, or government, can do more than impede the progress of a new technology for any length of time. Technology cannot be repressed for long, and if it is truly innovative and ground-breaking, as is the case with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, it will always win out.</p>
<p>Therefore, the SEC&rsquo;s attacks on crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which have done their level best to follow the misty and obscure road of compliance, would appear to be the height of folly.</p>
<p>The US might be attempting to go the route of much greater control and centralisation, but it still happens to be the land of the free, even though the sands of time might be running down for that particular ideal, so it is not difficult for business leaders to see what is really happening as the regulatory agencies go far beyond their remit in order to attack and suppress the crypto industry in the US.</p>
Crypto adoption marches on
<p>Be that as it may, crypto marches onwards and upwards. Wallet holders of Bitcoin increased by 40% even during the bear market, and if the US succeeds in driving crypto companies from its shores, jurisdictions in Europe (UK, and France) and Asia (Dubai, Hong Kong, and Singapore) among others, are waiting to take up the slack.</p>
<p>The battle is also not over in the US. The entrance of the largest asset management company in the world (Blackrock) into the Spot Bitcoin EFT space, will now make the battle for crypto even more interesting going forward.</p>
<p>Fast-depreciating fiat currencies are an unpalatable fact for all citizens of the world. A store of value (Bitcoin), and a potential solution to debasing fiat currencies (crypto) are becoming widely adopted. Will central bank-influenced governments be able to stop them?</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ozzy entrepreneur takes his crypto exchange to incredible heights despite huge scam.</p>
Impressive figures
<p>In the often crazy world of cryptocurrency, few stories are as intriguing as that of Russell Ty Wilson, the Australian crypto magnate who, from a modest office adjacent to a pilates studio and massage therapist, amassed a fortune. Over the past two years, Wilson, 42, has garnered a staggering $538 million from dividends through his CoinSpot Bitcoin exchange, as revealed by company documents.</p>
<p>According to the British-based Mail Online, CoinSpot's financial performance has been nothing short of impressive. In 2022, the company reported profits of $292 million from a revenue of $503 million. This came on the heels of an even more prosperous year in 2021, where profits touched $334 million. Such robust returns enabled the company to distribute dividends totaling $699 million over these two years.</p>
<p>However, things weren&rsquo;t always plain sailing. In 2018, CoinSpot suffered from an exploit that resulted in a loss of $37 million. Yet, the company's resilience shone through, and it continued to thrive.</p>
Unassuming and understated
<p>Wilson's business acumen is evident in his majority ownership of CoinSpot. Holding 77% of the company through Casey Block Services, he's likely to secure a coveted spot on Australia's Rich List. But what's truly fascinating is the juxtaposition of CoinSpot's immense success and its unassuming headquarters in Windsor, Melbourne, nestled between a pilates studio and a massage therapist.</p>
<p>Away from the glitz of Melbourne's central business district, Wilson's personal life is equally understated. Residing in a four-bedroom house in Berwick, which he purchased in 2014 for $586,500, Wilson seems to prefer a life away from the limelight. This preference for privacy extends to his business dealings as well. When CoinSpot inked a sponsorship deal with the AFL club Western Bulldogs, it was an executive, not Wilson, who made the announcement.</p>
Wilson tracks down the thieves
<p>CoinSpot's success story isn't just about numbers. It's also about resilience and innovation. In 2018, the company was targeted by a scam orchestrated by James Parker, who exploited a system glitch to syphon off $37 million. Undeterred, Wilson personally tracked down the culprits when local authorities were hesitant to intervene. This episode, while a setback, showcased Wilson's determination and commitment to his venture.</p>
<p>Today, CoinSpot stands tall as one of Australia's leading crypto platforms, boasting over 2.5 million customers and trading in 400 different cryptocurrencies. The fact that the exchange has continued to grow, especially during the pandemic-induced lockdowns, would point to its team getting things right in the face of a harsh bear market and more difficult times from a regulatory perspective.</p>
<p>However, owner Wilson remains an enigma. The former IT consultant, despite his immense wealth and the success of CoinSpot, shies away from public appearances. The only known photograph of him is from a company blog post from 2016.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Controversial Arkham Intel Exchange&rsquo;s first bounty has unearthed evidence of undisclosed wallets containing $160 million worth of digital assets tied to Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terra had previously claimed that it had exhausted all of its reserves in an attempt to defend the UST stablecoin peg.&nbsp;</p>
Undisclosed Terra Wallets?&nbsp;
<p>Two anonymous on-chain investigators have earned Arkham Intel&rsquo;s inaugural bounty after providing considerable evidence of undisclosed wallets holding more than $160 million worth of digital assets tied to Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon. This effort allowed the investigators, including one who describes himself as a &ldquo;glorified accountant,&rdquo; to win the bounty of ARKM tokens worth around $5000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wallets in question contain over 5200 BTC. This figure contradicts Luna Foundation Guard&rsquo;s previous claims of being in possession of only 313 BTC. The foundation had, back in May 2022, stated on Twitter,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As of now, the Foundation&rsquo;s remaining reserves consist of the following assets: &middot; 313 $BTC &middot; 39,914 $BNB &middot; 1,973,554 $AVAX &middot; 1,847,079,725 $UST &middot; 222,713,007 $LUNA (of which 221,021,746 is currently staked with validators).&rdquo;</p>

<p>The revelations made by Arkham&rsquo;s bounty hunters could have significant repercussions for Do Kwon. The Luna Foundation Guard&rsquo;s primary mission was to maintain the dollar peg of its algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). The foundation relied on its reserves of Bitcoin to maintain this peg by purchasing UST from the markets as a final line of defense against UST de-pegging. However, despite its efforts, both UST and LUNA collapsed in May 2022, wiping around $40 billion in value from the markets.&nbsp;</p>
More Insights Expected&nbsp;
<p>Arkham Intel expects more insights related to the wallets in question to emerge over the next few months. However, the issuer of the bounty, in this case, Arkham, maintains exclusive rights to the information unearthed for a period of 90 days. The Terra collapse is often described as one of the most crippling events in the crypto space, triggering chaos in the markets and wiping billions in investor wealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terra founder Do Kwon had been on the run since the collapse but was recently apprehended in Montenegro on charges of traveling using forged documents. The arrest came after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Do Kwon and Terraform Labs of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar fraud.&nbsp;</p>
Arkham Intel Exchange And Privacy Concerns&nbsp;
<p>The Arkham Intel Exchange is hugely controversial, acting as a marketplace facilitating the trading of on-chain data. Despite the bounty, the platform has sparked considerable debate in crypto circles. Critics have flagged concerns about the potential misuse of private information by bad actors and have suggested that the platform could also facilitate the inadvertent creation of a surveillance marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, platform supporters have countered this argument, arguing that such a platform is necessary for unmasking bad actors in the crypto space and giving whistleblowers a secure avenue to disclose crucial information. Arkham Intel CEO Miguel Morel has called for a nuanced approach to the subject, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need to think [...] very carefully about what sort of information should be allowed on versus not.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The platform, launched on the 10th of July, has been described by critics as a glorified snitching service, with concerns that it could dox innocent users. Platform users can place bounties for information related to specific blockchain transactions, which would then be made available after a period of 90 days.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has revealed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked Coinbase to halt all cryptocurrency trading, except that of Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Armstrong, the SEC had requested this prior to suing the exchange for failing to register as a broker.</p>
Delist Every Asset Apart From Bitcoin&nbsp;
<p>The Coinbase CEO made the revelation in a detailed interview, stating that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made the request before suing the exchange. Armstrong added that the regulator approached the exchange, stating that they viewed every other asset apart from Bitcoin as a security and asking Coinbase to delist assets it viewed as securities. When Coinbase asked how the SEC came to that conclusion, the regulator declined to explain its interpretation of the law. Armstrong stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They came back to us, and they said&hellip; we believe every asset other than Bitcoin is a security. And, we said, well, how are you coming to that conclusion, because that&rsquo;s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we&rsquo;re not going to explain it to you; you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Coinbase, it viewed 13 assets as securities. The assets in question are Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), FIL, SAND, AXS, ICP, NEAR, CHZ, DASH, VGX, and NEXO. The agency also accused Coinbase of failing to register with it as a broker, clearing agency, or national securities exchange. This, according to the SEC, meant that Coinbase was dodging the disclosure regime established by the United States Congress for the US securities markets.&nbsp;</p>
Not Much Choice At That Point&nbsp;
<p>Armstrong added that the exchange did not have much choice at the time. He added that if Coinbase had followed the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s instructions, it would set a wrong precedent and send out the wrong message. Coinbase accepting the SEC&rsquo;s instructions would have meant that most businesses and entities in the crypto space would have been deemed to be operating outside the law unless they had registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Armstrong added that delisting every asset apart from Bitcoin would have effectively ended the crypto industry in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We really didn&rsquo;t [did not] have a choice at that point; delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way, is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US. It kind of made it an easy choice&hellip; let&rsquo;s [let us] go to court and find out what the court says.&rdquo;</p>

Ripple-SEC Case Provides Some Regulatory Clarity&nbsp;
<p>The crypto industry in the United States has been asking the Securities and Exchange Commission for better regulatory clarity. While the SEC has not been forthcoming, the recent SEC-Ripple case ruling brought some much-needed clarity on the subject of security and non-security. In the Ripple-SEC case, the judge ruled that XRP is not a security. The asset&rsquo;s sale on exchanges, distribution to developers, sales by employees, and distribution to charities were all off the radar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the judge ruled that institutional sales of the XRP token were in violation of federal securities laws. After Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory, many experts and industry watchers believe the ruling would benefit the Coinbase lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
SEC And Coinbase: The Case So Far&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Coinbase in June, alleging that the exchange allowed investors and traders to purchase, sell, and trade crypto asset securities. The filing stated that Coinbase merged three functions typically separated in traditional markets: clearing agencies, brokers, and exchanges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission filed its lawsuit against Coinbase in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged that the exchange violated several registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the securities offering registration provisions included in the Securities Act of 1933. At the time, Gurbir S. Grewal, the director of the SEC&rsquo;s enforcement division, had stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You simply can&rsquo;t ignore the rules because you don&rsquo;t like them or because you&rsquo;d prefer different ones: the consequences for the investing public are far too great.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), dubbed EIP-6968, has been proposed by Ethereum developers to facilitate decentralized application (dApp) creators to earn a share of transaction fees generated on Layer 2 (L2).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On the outset, EIP-6968 aims to introduce a new type of token, the "Contract Secured Revenue" (CSR), which would allow developers to claim a percentage of transaction fees generated when users interact with their smart contracts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Kevin Owocki, one of the co-authors of the proposal, envisages this development as an opportunity for projects to band together, form an L2 around shared ideas, and share sequencer fee revenue based on who drives the most usage.</p>
Mechanism and Scaling
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Layer 2 solutions play a crucial role in enhancing the scalability of the Ethereum network. By conducting transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1 or L1), they mitigate network congestion and reduce transaction costs, whhich can skyrocket during peak periods. Layer 2 solutions use various methods like state channels, sidechains, and rollups, enabling faster and more efficient transaction processing. They significantly boost the tranbsaction throughput, thereby facilitating a smoother, more scalable experience for users and developers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In terms of the relation between L2s and the EIP-6968 proposal, the former allows smart contract developers to tap into potentially lucrative revenue streams. By introducing the concept of "Contract Secured Revenue" (CSR), Layer 2 can incentivize developers to create and deploy their dApps on these networks, fostering innovation and community growth. It creates a positive feedback loop - the more a developer's smart contracts are used, the more transaction fees they can potentially earn. This not only motivates developers but also accelerates the overall development and scaling of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
Adoption and Potential Impact
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The revenue generated from CSR could be utilized for multiple purposes, such as funding dApp development, public goods, or incentivizing developers to join a network. While Owocki initially proposed EIP-6968 in May, it has garnered increased attention following his presentation at the recent EthCC conference in Paris.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">EIP-6968 promises to revolutionize the fiercely competitive Ethereum scaling sector by introducing a novel type of incentive for developers. The proposal posits using protocol rewards of L1 to fund smart contract development, a significant change from what is the current state of market mechanisms in place.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">EIP-6968, viewed as a step ahead from app-chains, is designed to enable "ecosystem-chains" that host multiple decentralized applications. It is essentially a modified version of EIP-1559, which implemented Ethereum&rsquo;s burn mechanism back in August 2021.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The proposed upgrade could be adopted by any network that uses EIP-1559. Owocki expressed optimism about the potential traction within the L2 ecosystem, predicting a beneficial cycle where smart contract developers receive revenue for the value they contribute to L2s.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">An exploit in the Curve Finance platform has put more than $100 million in cryptocurrency at risk, intensifying security concerns in Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Central to this exploit is a "re-entrancy" bug in Vyper, the programming language instrumental to Curve's system. This vulnerability has provided hackers with an avenue to drain several stablecoin pools on the platform, unsettling the pricing and liquidity of numerous DeFi services.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While it's uncertain how much has been drained due to the attack, BlockSec, a blockchain auditing firm, projects the total losses to be above $42 million.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Curve hosts 232 different pools. Despite this number, only those using Vyper versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0 have been identified as at risk, according to Mimaklas, a member of the Curve team. Mimaklas added:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"all affected pools have been drained or white hacked, and the team is assessing the situation with affected teams."</p>

Echoes of Past DeFi Attacks
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This incident isn't a one-off in the DeFi landscape. The space has been plagued by a series of attacks in recent times. Just last year, the Ronin Network lost a staggering $622 million to hackers due to a breach in the Ethereum sidechain. BadgerDAO also fell prey to an $80 million heist, sparking widespread concerns over the security practices in the DeFi sector.</p>
Fallout: Impact on CRV Token and DeFi Sector
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The exploit has sent ripples across the trading markets fo Curve DAO&rsquo;s native CRV token. The token's value tumbled by 17%, standing at $0.61 at press time. This price plummet could instigate a forced liquidation on Curve&rsquo;s founder's $70 million borrowing position on Aave, further complicating the situation.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These recurring incursions underscore the urgent need for robust security measures and rigorous audit practices within the DeFi ecosystem. As the DeFi sphere continues to expand, tackling these challenges head-on becomes increasingly crucial to protect participants' assets and uphold confidence in the system's resilience.</p>
