<p>The last year of 2022 witnessed one of the harshest crypto winters in history with the BTC price tanking by nearly 60%. Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck Investments believe that the Bitcoin correction is still not done with.</p>
<p>VanEck expects the BTC price to fall in the range of $10K-$12K in the first quarter of 2023. The investment giant also expects a few minor bankruptcies to take place in line which would mark the low point in the crypto winter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-whale-activity-on-a-major-decline-further-btc-fall-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin whale activity</a> has been on a major decline as reported last week. Thus, there are not many catalysts for the BTC price to rally going ahead. Along with VanEck&#8217;s prediction, on-chain data also shows weakness in the BTC price as of the current date. On-chain data provider Santiment <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1610076087123611651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>:</p>

<h3>Bitcoin Can Recover In the Second Half of 2023</h3>
<p>In its recent prediction, VanEck <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/digital-assets/matthew-sigel-11-crypto-predictions-for-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the Bitcoin price can recover by the second half of 2023 and its price will rise to $30,000. This is nearly 80% from its current price and could be over 100% gains if its falls to $12K.</p>
<p>In the second half of this year, VanEck expects the global macros to improve with lower inflation, easing energy concerns, and a possible truce in Ukraine. Thus, a turnaround in the M2 supply will power the new bull run.</p>
<p>VanEck predicts that Brazil will emerge as one of the most crypto-friendly nations in the world. It also expects financial institutions to tokenize over $10 billion in off-chain assets.</p>

It all started with the first collapse of Terra&#8217;s (LUNA) ecosystem in May 2022 which eroded $40 billion of investors&#8217; wealth in a week&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>The contagion spread led to an immediate collapse of the world&#8217;s largest crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Now, 3AC founder Zhu Su has come out openly blaming Digital Currency Group (DCG) &#8211; the parent firm of Grayscale Investments and Genesis Trading &#8211; behind the collapse of Terra.</p>
<p>In his latest Twitter thread, Zhu Su alleges that DCG along with FTX conspired for the fall of LUNa and STETH. As 3AC went bankrupt after the Terra collapse, DCG and FTX took substantial losses. The losses extended beyond 3AC with the bankruptcies of Babel and other firms that were involved in GBTC.</p>
<p>The 3AC founder adds that DCG could have worked along with them in the restructuring process. &#8220;Instead they fabricated a left pocket right pocket callable promissory note that magically filled the hole. This is like a kid losing at poker and saying &#8220;I am fine, my dad will pay you, let me keep playing&#8221;,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<h3>A Light on DCG&#8217;s Genesis Troubles</h3>
<p>As we know, the collapse of FTX has led to a major liquidity crisis for DCG&#8217;s crypto lending subsidiary Genesis Global. But Zhu Su believes that Genesis was already in trouble during the Terra collapse.</p>
<p>He alleges that DCG and FTX took the fall of 3AC as an opportunity to &#8220;misdirect&#8221; the crypto community for months and used several methods to attack them. This is how Genesis filled the holder by taking deposits for six months following the Terra collapse, and hoping that the markets will go up. Zhu Su calls it a criminal fraud <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1610093558111010816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Dcg value is 0, criminal fraud, ftx creditors also have case for fraudulent conveyance on Alameda returns of capital to Genesis 8). Most OGs are well aware of how close Barry and SBF were since beginning (SBF is on board of genesis, they gave him his first ftt backed loan)&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Zhu Su expects that Genesis is most likely to slip into bankruptcy in the coming days. The creditors are waiting that that Barry Silbert helps them cash out in an easy way instead of taking the DoJ route.</p>
<p>Zhu Su is not the first to put such blame on DCG. Last month, Terra founder Do Kwon also made <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-do-kwon-sbf-genesis-terra-luna-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar claims</a>.</p>

However, this growth could be the response of oversold coin value and investors accumulating cheaper rates. Thus, considering the overall trend is bearish, the current recovery is more likely a temporary relief rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above $12 may encourage SOL to 33% rise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-day EMA slope near $12 increases the resistance power of this level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $538.5 Million, indicating a 163% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/c/cB3UsLEO.png" alt="Solana Coin" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 end was one the most dreadful period for Solana holders as it lost immense market value due to the FUD concerned with the <a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/what-is-ftx-solana-connection-will-sol-recover-in-2023/">FTX crypto crash</a>. During the downfall, the coin price plunged to a new lower support of $9.45, registering around</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 95.71% loss from the all-time high of $260.06.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, on December 29th, the daily candle showed a long lower price rejection, indicating the intense demand pressure from below. Thus, with sustained buying, the coin price rose 24.8% and reached a high of $12.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/solana-price-make-ethereum-like-comeback-from-mega-drop/">Can Solana Price Make Ethereum Like Comeback From Mega Drop?</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the coin price currently trades at $11.15, and the high price rejection candle attached indicates the sellers have not thrown the towel yet. Furthermore, if the daily candle closes below $12, the sellers will continue to hand the upper hand, and prices may struggle to surpass the overhead resistance.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, concerning the overall negative market sentiment, the current recovery is still to be considered a temporary rally before it shows suitability for upcoming trading days. Furthermore, a bullish breakout from $12 may prolong the price rally to 33% higher to hit $15.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> The rising <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> shot straight up from the oversold zone, indicating the Solana coin price is trying to stabilize the prior excessive selling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the large gap between the EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) accentuates the overall downtrend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Coin Intraday Price Level</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $11.37</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>

The issue was first raised by Gemini&#8217;s co-founder <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cameron-winklevoss/">Cameron Winklevoss</a> in an open letter that he posted on the micro-blogging site Twitter on January 2.</p>
<h2>Cameron&#8217;s Open Letter To Silbert</h2>
<p>This comes after Cameron tweeted against the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dcg/">DCG</a> head via a Twitter post earlier today, highlighting the delay in halting <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis/">Genesis</a> withdrawals. He addressed the issue of the 340,000 Earn customers who are waiting for withdrawals to resume with digital assets piling up to more than $900 million.</p>

<h2>Barry Silbert&#8217;s Remark</h2>
<p>On the other hand, Silbert&#8217;s tweet mostly focused on rejecting any missing payments and assuring followers that DCG had never missed an interest payment and was current on all existing loans; with the next payment due in May 2023. The DCG CEO also stated that the next payment would be due in May 2023.</p>

<p>In addition to this, he pointed out that the efforts his company undertook to provide a concrete resolution for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> users on the 29th of December, went unnoticed and have still not been acknowledged by Genesis&#8217; team.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-133892" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02231032/chrome_u52vhZstVO.png" alt="" width="550" height="399" /></p>
<h2>Winklevoss&#8217;s Jan 8 Ultimatum</h2>
<p>In light of the fact that a large number of customers placed faith in Genesis, Winklevoss noted that Silbert&#8217;s actions were inexcusable and reprehensible. The co-founder of Gemini <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> has further contested Silbert to make a public commitment by addressing the matter within January 8th.</p>
<p>On November 16, 2022, shortly after the downfall of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-collapse/">FTX empire</a>, Genesis made a significant decision regarding withdrawals. It was announced by the lending division of the leading institutional digital asset manager that it would <a href="https://coingape.com/genesis-suspends-customer-withdrawals-ftx-collapse/">temporarily halt redemptions</a> as well as the initiation of new loans. While few started speculating on Genesis&#8217; insolvency, the crypto firm dismissed such allegations later on.</p>

The core concept of the price action following the converging trendlines despite an established downtrend is the inability of sellers to bolster deeper downfall. Thus, the ongoing downfall falling to achieve a significant fall after each upside pullback indicate losing bearish momentum. Therefore, this technical setup allows buyers to wrest for trend control and ignite a fresh recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower price rejection in the last few days of the daily candle indicates the intense buying pressure from below.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullish divergence in the daily MACD indicator encourages an upcoming price rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $813.7 Million, indicating a 17.5% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/k/kHcbbPdu.png" alt="Shiba Inu Price Prediction 2023" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing uncertainty, the Shiba Inu coin price showed numerous short-body candles and hovered above the pattern’s support trendline. This <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> has recently rebounded from the pattern’s lower trendline and rallied to its current price of $0.0000082 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the SHIB price is up 1% and gradually approaching the overhead trendline. A potential bullish breakout from the resistance trendline will trigger a directional rally and provide an entry opportunity for interest traders. </span></p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-shib-burn-jumps-13198-24hrs-shibarium/">Shiba Inu Coin: SHIB Burn Jumps 13,198% In 24Hrs, Is It Shibarium Related?</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If market sentiment favors, the ideal target for this wedge pattern is the highest peak of the downfall. Thus, the potential target for the Shiba Inu coin by completing this pattern is 26.5% higher to $0.0000105.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if the coin price reverted from the resistance trendline, the ongoing downfall will prolong for a few more trading sessions. Moreover, this possible bull run may face some in-between resistance at $0.0000087 and $0.0000096 before hitting the mentioned target.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a bearish breakdown from the pattern resistance trendline will invalidate the bullish theory.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Moving Average Convergence/Divergence Indicator:</strong> Despite the falling price, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line rising higher indicate growth in bullish momentum. If these slopes above the breach above the midline, the buyers will get an additional confirmation for price recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the downsloping(20, 50, 100, and 200) EMA assists sellers in maintaining a steady downfall.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.0000087 and $0.000096</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels: $0.0000075 and $0.0000066</span></li>

During that time, the majority of businesses were wiped out, and only the most formidable organizations survived.</p>
<h2>WEF&#8217;s Stance On Crypto</h2>
<p>According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), the &#8220;<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-winter-2/#:~:text=Crypto%20Winter%20refers%20to%20a,perceived%20as%20risky%20to%20trade.">crypto winter</a>&#8221; of 2022 might be the turning point for the industry at large. Due to the numerous fallouts encountered by top crypto businesses last year, the WEF warned that the future of cryptocurrencies will be driven by the regulatory frameworks issued by a nation&#8217;s government.</p>
<blockquote><p>Policymakers who have been sounding an alarm about crypto’s excessive risks, while failing to create sensible regulations, have been vindicated by not one, but multiple large-scale failures.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the blog post, the World Economic Forum (WEF) observed that jurisdictions that take steps to regulate the developing industry are likely to define the future. However, the WEF also noted that unscrupulous actors can or will still exploit the industry while it grows.</p>
<h2>Crypto&#8217;s Growing Usecases</h2>
<p>The independent international organization emphasized that experimentation in the financial services industry is something to take note of while stating that the underlying technology of cryptography and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> has wider applications. The forum further singled out organizations such as the banking giant JPMorgan, who are rapidly embracing the usage of blockchain technology, in this passage.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="What’s Making Solana (SOL) Price Rally 12% In A Day?" href="https://coingape.com/solana-sol-price-jump-12-24-hrs/" rel="bookmark">What’s Making Solana (SOL) Price Rally 12% In A Day?</a></em></p>
<p>The World Economic Forum did note, though, that unscrupulous actors may potentially co-opt the rising technology for nefarious ends, as is the case in any financial industry. Moreover, the forum emphasized on the fact that banning the industry might not be the best course of action, comparing it to vices associated with the wider internet, despite the fact that the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> has seen financial losses.</p>
<blockquote><p>We didn&#8217;t ban the internet or email. The more enduring approach with all breakthrough technologies is to net out their harmful effects by placing technologies in the hands of responsible actors and encouraging their responsible use.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the potential for these technologies to inflict significant damage in the wrong hands, the Geneva-based forum stated that the modern economic toolset will continue to use <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> and blockchains as essential components in the foreseeable future.</p>

He addressed the issue of 340,000 Earn users who are awaiting resumption of withdrawals. The users put together entrusted more than $900 million of assets, he said. Overall, Winklevoss indicated that Barry Silbert needs to immediately meet the Gemini management to reach a resolution.</p>

<h2>To Put An End To The Crisis</h2>
<p>Digital Currency Group (DCG) owes Genesis $1.675 billion, which in turn is owed by Genesis to Earn users and other creditors, Winklevoss added. It is now time for you to take responsibility for this and do the right thing, he said. He also accused Silbert of trying to protect DCG from the problems at <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis/">Genesis</a>. Winklevoss mentioned in the letter that the Gemini Earn users are tired and in dire situation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For the past six weeks, we have done everything we can to engage with you in a good faith and collaborative manner in order to reach a consensual resolution for you to pay back the $900 million that you owe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>On November 16, 2022, just after the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a>, Genesis took a key decision on withdrawals. The lending division of the cryptocurrency investment bank said it <a href="https://coingape.com/genesis-suspends-customer-withdrawals-ftx-collapse/">temporarily stopped redemptions</a> and initiating new loans. Following this, it was speculated that Genesis would follow FTX in announcing bankruptcy. However, <a href="https://coingape.com/genesis-says-it-has-no-immediate-plans-to-declare-bankruptcy/">Genesis denied rumors</a> that it was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In this context, the Gemini cofounder asked Silbert to work together for a solution by January 8, 2023. He added that it was becoming clear that Silbert had been engaging in bad faith tactics with regard to resuming the withdrawals.</p>

However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/solana-sol/">Solana (SOL) price</a> has surged back beyond the $11 mark in only a few days entering into 2023.</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL) Price Jump</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> increased by 12% over the previous twenty-four hours as almost $500 million flowed into SOL&#8217;s market capitalization, thus bringing its total value back up to $4 billion at the time of writing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133868" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02191531/chrome_dN4Cfpk8GW.png" alt="" width="918" height="427" /></p>
<p>This comes after the positive support from Ethereum&#8217;s founder, <a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-is-vitalik-buterin-discover-eth-founders-home-net-worth-and-family/">Vitalik Buterin</a>. Buterin tweeted the previous week that &#8220;smart people&#8221; have told him there is an &#8220;earnest smart developer community in Solana,&#8221; and that the network has a promising future now that &#8220;awful opportunistic money people have been washed out. &#8221;</p>
<p>Buterin went on to say that he had high expectations that the Solana community will &#8220;have its fair shot to prosper.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the technical analysis of Solana&#8217;s two-hour indicators on <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/technicals/">TradingView</a> is predominantly optimistic after having been bearish for days. The analysis indicates a &#8220;buy&#8221;signal by the summary gauge at 13, while a &#8220;strong buy&#8221; is indicated by the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">moving averages</a> at 12. Oscillators in other places are advocating a neutral position at 8.</p>

<h2>The BONK Memecoin</h2>
<p>Adding more fuel to the positive sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency, the community is suspecting a major development from a new <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> on the Solana network. The token which goes by the ticker symbol BONK has already surged 135% in price and trading volume has zoomed past that of other major <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the token has seen wide acceptance as a viable payment method on the different marketplaces hosted by the Solana network. Moreover, Solana Foundation&#8217;s Head of Strategy &amp; Communications Austin Federa recently showed his support for the dog-themed crypto project in a recent tweet.</p>

<p>As things stand, the Solana (SOL) price is currently being traded at $11.13.

Moreover, the coin price uses this level as the base support for forming a double bottom pattern. A possible breakout from the patterns resistance trendline will provide a long entry opportunity for traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double bottom pattern breakout may encourage BTC price for an 8.17% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish reversal from $17000 will weaken the bullish momentum</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $22.3 Billion, indicating a 14.2% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/Mx3Eh3wo.png" alt="Bitcoin price prediction 2023" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price is currently stuck in a temporary range-bound movement and continues to wobble between two definite levels of  $17000-$16350. This consolidation phase has lasted for more than two weeks now and created a sense of uncertainty in the crypto market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, on December 30th, the coin price rebounded from the $16350 support and triggered a new bull cycle within the narrow range. As a result, the price has surged 2.35% from this support and currently exchanging hands at $16726.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the daily chart showcased this consolidation phase as a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double-bottom pattern</a>. In theory, this bullish reversal pattern showcases two bounces back from a horizontal level, indicating the price sustainability above support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with sustained buying, the Bitcoin price will continue to rise and rechallenge the $17000 neckline resistance. A daily candle closing this barrier will release the trapped momentum and signal the end of ongoing consolidation. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, a  post-breakout rally may rise to $17300, followed by $18375.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the buyers fail to surpass the $17000 barrier and revert back, the current consolidation phase will be prolonged for new trading days.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> for the two rebounds mentioned above, the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> has moved upward. Thus, This bullish divergence indicates the buying pressure is rising within the range, and a high probability lies for a bullish breakout from the $17000 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the downsloping 20-day EMA is wavering near the local support of $16750, assisting sellers in stalling or undermining the possible bullish recovery. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $16718</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $16750 and $17000</span></li>

The price rally seems to continue amid the latest developments, proposals, and an increase in the LUNC burn rate by the Terra Classic community.</p>
<p>Despite crypto exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-suspends-terra-classic-lunc-burn-lunc-price-falls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance temporarily suspending</a> its monthly LUNC burn mechanism, the Terra Classic community looks to burn massive LUNC tokens to reduce the total <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/circulating-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulating supply</a> in 2023.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community Plans Revival in 2023</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic community has increased the burn rate to decrease the overall supply of LUNC tokens and revive the system. With the start of the year, the community has already burned nearly 145 million LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>Allnodes, a top Terra Classic validator, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Allnodes/status/1609484806722654209" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">burned</a> 123,755,691 LUNC tokens on January 1. Moreover, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/TerraCasino_io/status/1609677257643106304" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Terra Casino burned</a> 18,009,329 LUNC tokens in the last 24 hours. Until now, almost 37 billion LUNC tokens have been burned by the Terra Classic community, with Binance contributing over 20 billion LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>Moreover, the community has recently <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-community-passes-crucial-proposal-is-lunc-price-0-0005-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed Proposal 11111</a> “Repeal Proposal 10983,” which brings back 10% remint from the 0.2% burn tax and adds to the community pool, instead of 50% remint. As a result, Binance continues to commit to LUNC community, but will burn 50% of LUNC spot and margin trading fees instead of 100%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the community has also <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-core-developer-edward-kim-proposal-up-for-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved Proposal 11168</a> by Terra Classic core developers Edward Kim and Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson. Almost 95% have voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; to the proposal to build a “Joint L1 Task Force” developers team and provide 908,000,000<span class="Read_small__37DWT"> LUNC tokens worth $141.75k for L1 developments.</span></p>
<p>Zaradar in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ZaradarBH/status/1609880275206512642" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on January 2 even announced Github account and recent developments as part of Proposal 11168. Zaradar also noted that he hasn&#8217;t worked in such a great team yet.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price Rally Continues</h2>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) price continues to rally amid the positive sentiment. The LUNC price has increased nearly 5% in the last 24 hours, with the current price trading at $0.00015.</p>
<p>The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001472 and $0.0001555, respectively. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a> has fallen below $1 billion, but an increase in trading volume indicates a further rise in LUNC price.</p>

<p>As the frost set in, VC firms shut their wallets. Global funding for VC-backed crypto businesses decreased from 8.8 billion USD in the first quarter of 2022 to 6.2 billion USD in the second quarter to approximately 3.4 billion USD in the third quarter, according to statistics.</p>
<p>Only about 2.4 million USD has been raised by crypto startups in the fourth quarter in 2022. Some businesses did nonetheless succeed in raising enormous rounds despite the continuous downturn, albeit virtually exclusively in the first part of the year.</p>
<h2><strong>Here is the list of the biggest crypto fundings of 2022:</strong></h2>
<h3>450 million USD crypto funding for Yuga Labs</h3>
<p>A 450 million USD financing, in crypto, headed by Andreessen Horowitz was launched by the organisation that runs the well-known Bored Ape Yacht Club in March. Although the company was valued at 4 billion USD during the round. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFT market</a> has since collapsed, and Yuga Labs is apparently the subject of an <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC probe</a> for selling unregistered securities.</p>

<h3>450 million USD for ConsenSys</h3>
<p>ConsenSys, a company headed by Joe Lubin, a co-founder of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, creates software aimed at the Ethereum ecosystem. Examples are: the MetaMask <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi wallet</a>, which sees over 30 million monthly active users. ConsenSys raised a 450 million USD in March, with ParaFi Capital as the lead investor and valued the firm at 7 billion USD. Since then, the business has drawn criticism for privacy issues with its software suite, however, Lubin said that the company is resolving these issues.</p>
<h3>450 million USD for Polygon</h3>
<p>Built on top of Ethereum, Polygon is a Layer-2 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain platform</a> that aims to extend the ecosystem for applications ranging from gaming to DeFi. The business announced in February a 450 million USD fundraising headed by Sequoia Capital, with participation from Tiger Global and SoftBank. The market cap of Polygon&#8217;s own cryptocurrency, MATIC, was 13 billion USD at the time, but it has subsequently fallen to under 7 billion USD.</p>

<h3>400 million USD for Circle</h3>
<p>The creator of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether, is Circle. It announced a 400 million USD capital round in April, including contributions from well-known names in traditional finance including BlackRock and Fidelity. The business also intended to go public through a SPAC merger with a 9 billion USD valuation. Later the agreement fell through.</p>
<h3>400 million USD for FTX</h3>
<p>The offshores FTX exchange also raised 400 million USD in January which valued the company at 32 billion USD. Only a few months had passed since FTX&#8217;s infamous &#8220;meme round,&#8221; in which it raised 420 million USD from 69 investors on October 20, 2021. After selling his personal share, Sam Bankman-Fried reportedly collected 300 million USD of that.</p>

<h3>358 million USD for Animoca Brands</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong-based software and venture firm secured a 358 million USD, Series A investment in January. It was led by Liberty City Ventures, at a valuation of 5 billion USD, while the cryptocurrency market was still surging. GameFi, a term for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/play-to-earn-p2e/">&#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; games</a> that has gained popularity thanks to the scandal surrounding Axie Infinity.</p>
<h3>350 million USD for NEAR Protocol</h3>
<p>A blockchain called NEAR offers itself as a rival to Ethereum by providing a platform for programmers to create decentralised applications. It received considerable funding after its October 2020 launch, including a 350 million USD round in April 2022. It was led by Tiger Global and came three months after a 150 million USD round in January. Its crypto market valuation has now dropped to just over 1 billion USD after reaching a record of over 12.5 billion USD in April.</p>

He said Cardano has an upper hand in 2023 owing to the developer activity from a foundational perspective. The influencer cited the blockchain&#8217;s consistency for growth prospects. Cardano has proven itself as a blockchain that has stamina, reliability and consistency, he said. Gambardello added that like all cryptocurrencies, Cardano is going through the test of times in the market.</p>

According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinmarketcap</a>, APE is up 6% to $3.86, Axie Infinity&#8217;s AXS rose 6.74% to $6.40, while The <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sandbox&#8217;s</a></strong> SAND rose 4.8% to around $0.40. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentraland’s</a></strong> MANA posted more modest gains of 4.44% to reach around $0.30.</p>
<h2><b>These Metaverse tokens were among the worst performers in 2022</b></h2>
<p>The announcement came shortly after APE completed its Special Council elections, in which five members were elected to govern the future of the ApeCoin project. ApeCoin is the utility and governance token that powers Otherside, the metaverse project created by Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club.</p>
<p>In its annual New Year&#8217;s letter, video game publisher Square Enix reaffirmed its commitment to<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blockchain</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web3</a></strong> gaming. The recent good news for investors comes after a brutal 2022 for Metaverse tokens; AXS and SAND were among the worst performers in what was a bleak year for crypto overall, losing around 93% of their value.</p>
<h3><b>Price Analysis of Metaverse tokens</b></h3>

<h3><b>Square Enix reaffirms its commitment to blockchain technology</b></h3>
<p>The price increase comes as a major gaming company, Yosuke Matsuda, doubles down on metaverse investment. Square Enix publisher Square Enix&#8217;s president recently reaffirmed his company&#8217;s commitment to the space.</p>
<p>Matsuda stated that blockchain technology was one of the &#8220;top three&#8221; investment areas for the company in the medium term. However, the area on which the company was &#8220;most focused&#8221; in the company&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s letter. The year 2022 was &#8220;a year of great volatility in the blockchain-related space,&#8221; according to Matsuda. However, he predicted that in 2023, blockchain games would &#8220;transition to a new stage of growth.&#8221;</p>

Settle down. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> market is predicted to revive in 2023, with the worst of the<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/"> bear market</a> ending in the first quarter.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Here are some trends to look out for in 2023</h3>
<h3>1. Much Anticipated Recovery</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">2023 might show some signs of relief from the grim, devastating crises of the past year. While the likelihood of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/">bull market</a> is out of the question right now, many believe that the crypto market will recover this year (after the 2nd quarter).</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Many analysts believe that the bottom will come in the first quarter of 2023, with bitcoin probably hitting a low of $10,000 or even less. As a result, most altcoins might drop by 60–80%. But again, predictions are just predictions. What we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">2. Regulations Are Coming</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">It doesn&#8217;t really matter whether you&#8217;re in favour of or against the government stepping in and regulating crypto assets and the market; it is happening. The degree of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-regulation/">crypto regulation</a> and whether the government is equipped to regulate the crypto market will be topics of discussions and debates in 2023.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The majority of these regulations are likely to be excellent, but a couple are likely to be disastrous. Moreover, despite efforts to develop global crypto standards, it is very likely that crypto policies would differ from country to region.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">3. DeFi Will Go Mainstream</h3>
<p style="color: #252525"><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi</a> has proven its resilience during the collapse of the centralised <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/"> FTX.</a> Several factors are in favour of DeFi protocols, such as improved front ends, increased liquidity, and regulatory clarity, which will enhance people&#8217;s trust in DeFi.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">DeFi can go mainstream and become the centre of attention this year.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">4. Crypto Adoption Will Rise</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Around 4% of the global population use crypto products or services in some manner. There&#8217;s a long way to go. And 2023 will prove to be a year where regular people as well as institutions start using crypto for various purposes.</p>

However, David Schwartz, Ripple CTO cited reasons why the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> is not on a way to appreciation.</p>
<h2>Ripple CTO cites Google</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-craig-wright-calls-xrp-useless-pump-dump-scheme-ripple-cto-hits-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple CTO</a> gave out the example of Google back in 2000. He compared how people back then didn’t believe that a<a href="https://coingape.com/google-year-in-search-2022-what-is-nft-metaverse-check-top-10-most-searched-what-is-topics-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> search engine</a> would be the next big thing and will make billions of dollars ahead. Meanwhile, on convincing, some people who might have joined Google back then would have made millions by now. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here</strong></a></p>
<p>He mentioned that some search engines like Ask Jeeves, Altavista and Lycos were also at the right place at the right time but couldn’t make the most of it. Ripple CTO believes that crypto is at that stage where the market is still figuring out if it is going to be the next big thing.</p>
<p>This is why prices tend to move together as people become more or less accrued that digital assets will be the next big thing. However, with time the crypto market will mature and would figure out which digital asset will be successful.</p>
<h2>XRP trading vol spikes 212%</h2>
<p>XRP price has dropped by 91% from its all time high (ATH). However, the XRP price is up by 2% over the past 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $0.345, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume is up by 212% to stand at $1.013 billion.</p>
<p>WhaleAlert reported that crypto whales have moved more than 210 million XRP in the last 24 hours. The single<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1609650797876322304" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> largest recorded transaction</a> has been of moving 148.7 million XRP (approx worth $50.3 million).</p>

In theory, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">bullish reversal pattern</a> indicates a gradual switch in price trends and provides a long entry opportunity for interested buyers. The neckline resistance of this pattern is at the $ 80.5 mark, whose breakout will intensify the underlying bullish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cup and handle pattern sets the LTC price to rechallenge the $80.6 barrier</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-weekly EMA wavering around the $65 mark offered additional support for buyers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Litecoin coin is $1.29 Million, marking a 52.4% hike.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/PqS36igm.png" alt="Litecoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last seven months, the Litecoin price has shown sustainability above the $40 support. This high accumulation support zone bolstered buyers for a U-shaped recovery and pushed it to its current price of $75.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the LTC price currently forms the hand portion of the cup and handle pattern, which is a minor correction in ongoing recovery. If the buyer continues its upward rally after the correction phase, it would indicate the price is suitability a higher level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with sustained buying, the Litecoin price should sustain a $73.2 breakout and rise 15% high to challenge the $80.5 neckline resistance. Thus, a weekly candle closing above the neckline will accelerate the bullish momentum for further price growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal conditions, the cup and handle pattern provides a potential target of the same distance between the neckline and bottom support, shot from the breakout point. Thus, the $80.5 breakout should drive the prices to the $110 mark.</span></p>
<h2><b>Technical indicator</b></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While the price action seems sideway, the weekly-<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> shows an evident growth, indicating the rising buying pressure. This bullish divergence increases the possibility of a potential upswing.</span></p>
<p><b>EMAs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  the overhead EMAs(50, 100, and 200) create additional resistance against a potential bullish rally. Moreover, the 100-and-200-weekly EMAs nearing a bearish crossover will increase the selling pressure in the market.</span></p>
