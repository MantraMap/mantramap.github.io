<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yuga Labs has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://decrypt.co/117519/bored-ape-creator-yuga-labs-nabs-new-ceo-from-gaming-giant-activision-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">appointed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the outgoing President and COO of </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Activision Blizzard</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Daniel Alegre, as its new CEO. Alegre&#8217;s new position at Yuga Labs was announced less than 72 hours after he departed his role at the video game-holding and publishing company. His exit from Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) comes amid stalled developments regarding </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Microsoft&#8217;s</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (NASDAQ: MSFT) impending takeover of the Santa Monica-based company. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the new CEO of Yuga Labs, Alegre expects to oversee several creative developments regarding the company&#8217;s intellectual property. These include the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks non-fungible tokens (</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">NFTs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">), as well as the Otherside metaverse platform. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Commenting on Alegre&#8217;s latest executive appointment, Yuga Labs&#8217; co-founder Wylie Aronow <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221219005232/en/Yuga-Labs-Appoints-Activision-Blizzard-President-and-COO-Daniel-Alegre-as-New-CEO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Daniel has held one of the highest level roles at one of the largest gaming companies in the world. He brings valuable experience across entertainment, e-commerce, and global strategic partnerships, all of which are critical aspects of an immersive Web3 world built by creators and for creators.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alegre previously helmed Activision Blizzard since early 2020, and his antecedents include input in developing some well-known Activision gaming brands. These include Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush. Furthermore, the former Activision President also spent 16 years in numerous leadership roles at Google. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alegre Commends Yuga Labs Antecedents, Plans on Consolidating Company Strides</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Also weighing in on his Yuga Labs appointment, Alegre commended the blockchain technology company for its strides in the Web3 space. According to the incoming CEO, Yuga Labs has earned its name through storytelling and community-building. In addition, he described his move to the Bored Ape Yacht Club creator as a &#8220;massive opportunity to define the metaverse in a way that empowers creators and provides users with true ownership of their identity and digital assets.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Yuga Labs, Alegre will assume the CEO role in the first half of next year, with his predecessor Nicole Muniz remaining as a partner and strategic adviser. The company also stated that Alegre&#8217;s primary focus at the helm would be further developing the Otherside initiative. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yuga Labs presently describes Otherside as a gamified metaverse that seeks to be interoperable. The project represents one of the biggest in the NFT community this year, with approximately $1.1 billion in total mint and trading volume. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While in charge of Yuga Labs, Alegre would also reportedly use Mutant Ape Yacht Club #3850 as his new profile picture. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before announcing Alegre&#8217;s appointment, Yuga Labs&#8217; current CEO Muniz intimated last month of the company&#8217;s plans to hire the best expertise. According to Muniz, these experienced hands would be instrumental in developing the next phase of the internet. In September, Yuga Labs onboarded mobile gaming exec Spencer Tucker as its new chief gaming officer. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alegre to Become New CEO Shortly after FTC Lawsuit against Microsoft Acquisition Deal</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alegre&#8217;s move to Yuga Labs comes less than two weeks after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">lawsuit to block</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Activision. According to the Commission, the tech giant&#8217;s $69 billion takeover of the popular video game publisher could spell bad news for competitors. The reason is that Microsoft would allegedly have an unfair advantage over its contemporaries regarding the rights to Activision&#8217;s intellectual property. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/voyager-digital-binance-us-bid/">Voyager Digital Accepts Bid from Binance.US to Acquire Its Assets</a></p>
<p>Bankrupt crypto lender, Voyager Digital, has announced an agreement with crypto exchange Binance.US that will see the latter acquire its assets. The agreement was shared moments earlier, via a <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/voyager-announces-agreement-for-binance-us-to-acquire-its-assets-891555229.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> with the deal reportedly worth $1.022 billion.</p>
<p>According to Voyager Digital, it found Binance.US to have offered the &#8220;highest and best bid for its assets.&#8221; This was after carefully reviewing all bids and determining which best aligns with its core aim of returning value to customers and other creditors as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Per the press release, the $1.022 billion deal represents the estimated market value of Voyager&#8217;s crypto portfolio as of the present. However, there is also a clause of an additional consideration of up to $20 million worth of incremental value. The deal is expected to be completed, no later than April 18, 2023.</p>
<h2>Voyager Digital Aims to Refund Customers</h2>
<p>This sale agreement will undoubtedly help Voyager in its bid to return value to its customers, albeit by all means necessary. But even the refund will be in accordance with &#8220;court-approved disbursements&#8221; and &#8220;platform capabilities&#8221;.</p>
<p>To show its commitment to the deal, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> is set to make a $10 million deposit. The exchange also promises to help Voyager cover some other expenses up to a maximum of $15 million.</p>
<p>For now, however, the sale of Voyager&#8217;s assets is still dependent on the outcome of a January 5 hearing, creditor&#8217;s vote, and some other traditional conditions. By January 5, 2023, the lender will be seeking asset purchase approval from the presiding bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Voyager&#8217;s troubles began on July 5 after being exposed to the now-defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). The lender <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/voyager-digital-shares-suspends-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paused</a> withdrawals at some point, before finally filing for bankruptcy amid its liquidity issues.</p>
<p>Coinspeaker previously <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/court-deal-crypto-voyager-ftx-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in October that troubled cryptocurrency exchange FTX US submitted a revised bid for Voyager&#8217;s assets. The exchange lined up a massive $1.4 billion bid at the time. However, things have since gone sideways, with FTX itself eventually filing for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In all, Voyager has been focused on returning maximum value to customers since it began its restructuring process. As of publication, no official details have been shared about reimbursements or customers regaining access to crypto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/grayscale-refund-sec-etf-bid/">Grayscale to Refund 20% of Investor’s Capital if SEC Denies Its ETF Bid</a></p>
<p>Grayscale Investments, one of the biggest asset management firms in the digital currency ecosystem is mulling plans to repay its investors should its ETF plans fail.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-grayscales-bitcoin-etf-dreams-fail-firm-may-try-a-tender-offer-ceo-says-11671428078?mod=latest_headlines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the move will be activated if the company, a subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group (DCG) is unsuccessful in its broader bid to push the United States <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) to approve the conversion of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product to a full-fledged <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin-exchange-traded-fund-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund</a> (ETF).</p>
<p>Per the WSJ’s report, the refund will feature options that will include a tender for up to 20% of the outstanding shares of the GBTC product. At the moment, this trust is worth as much as $10.7 billion according to figures quoted by the company’s CEO, Michael Sonnenshein.</p>
<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is currently down by 49% of its Net Asset Value (NAV), indicating how much of a beating the shares have received over the past few months. Grayscale, alongside some key asset managers, is one of the primary purveyors of the Bitcoin Exchange Fund revolution in the United States.</p>
<p>On a number of occasions, the SEC has frustrated Grayscale’s attempts to get a Bitcoin ETF product approved and after waiting for months, the regulator denied its request to transform the GBTC product to an ETF, citing a lack of regulatory oversight and inappropriate market maturity.</p>
<p>Grayscale did not settle for the feedback from the SEC and hours after, the company filed a lawsuit against the commission. It even went further to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/grayscale-obama-lawyer-spot-etf-verdict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire</a> Donald B. Verrilli Jr as part of its legal team. Donald was a top solicitor during the Obama Administration and riding on his experience and knowledge of the law, Grayscale was optimistic he can solidify its team to get to win the SEC in court.</p>
<p>“It’s paramount that Grayscale has the strongest legal minds working on our application to convert GBTC to an ETF, and we are thrilled that Verrilli will join our outstanding legal team,” a Grayscale spokesperson said at the time.</p>
<p>While little is known about its fight with the SEC, Grayscale is already preparing for future moves should it lose the battle.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Troubles Goes Beyond ETF Push</h2>
<p>With the digital currency ecosystem experiencing the liquidity turmoil it has been recording since the start of the year, Grayscale and its parent company are duly sharing a good brunt of the pressure.</p>
<p>Genesis Trading, another subsidiary of DCG is said to be owing over $900 million to Gemini clients, a financial turmoil that is placing the company on the brink of bankruptcy. The Genesis strain was induced by the collapse of the FTX Derivatives Exchange, and the platform has revealed that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/genesis-likely-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bankruptcy may become inevitable</a> if it is unable to get a cash injection to bolster its reserves.</p>
<p>With Grayscale and DCG being pressed hard this way, GBTC&#8217;s transition to Bitcoin ETF may not be their immediate worry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/defi-ecosystem-hashkey-report/">HashKey Report: DeFi Ecosystem on Rapid Pace for Break Out</a></p>
<p>The digital currency industry and the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentralized Finance</a> (DeFi) ecosystem have been embroiled in a hash crypto winter for the better part of 2022. Despite these tough economic and market conditions, a recent report from Hashkey Capital, a renowned crypto fund with roots in Asia has shown that DeFi has exhibited more potential for an imminent growth breakout.</p>
<p>According to the report, the DeFi ecosystem remained a darling of Venture Capital (VC) investors throughout the year. This investor injected as much as $14 billion into a total of 725 crypto projects, including numerous DeFi protocols in the first half of the year alone. This first half is assumably the period that the industry was rocked with the impacts of Terra (LUNA) and its associated algorithmic stablecoin (UST) collapses. This plunge <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/three-arrows-capital-plunges-into-liquidation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fueled bankruptcies</a> in Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Voyager Digital amongst others.</p>
<p>Besides the capital influx, the DeFi ecosystem also saw many new users make their way into the industry. The HashKey Capital data shows that DeFi user growth Quarter-Over-Quarter grew by 44%. In the third quarter that ended October 31, the total number of active DeFi wallets surpassed 5 million users overall.</p>
<p>Some of the growth metrics published by HashKey showed that the DeFi world has maintained a very close correlation with the mainstream traditional financial ecosystem. At the time when the performance in the DeFi world was at its peak, the industry has a market valuation that would have been equal in size to the 20th largest bank in the United States.</p>
<p>There are currently tens of blockchain protocols where DeFi activities take place but of them all, Ethereum dominates. As many as 58% of all activities in the DeFi ecosystem take place on Ethereum, with BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Solana also taking a significant share <a href="https://defillama.com/">according</a> to data from DeFiLlama.</p>
<h2>DeFi Ecosystem Growth Echoes Institutional Embrace</h2>
<p>As the DeFi ecosystem tends toward maturity, the combined activities in this unique offshoot of blockchain technology rake in as much as $8.2 billion in fees. These milestones are impressive, but what lends credence to the forecast for a brighter future is the fact that more institutional players are getting involved in the DeFi world.</p>
<p>Besides hedge funds and their investments, mainstream financial services providers including Huntingdon Valley Bank, a Pennsylvania Chartered Bank, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: JPM) and Societe Generale SA (EPA: GLE) have been making concerted efforts to adopt specific DeFi products. These products range from both collateralized and uncollateralized loans amongst others.</p>
<p>“Many centralized financial systems failed this year, the market realized that DeFi, which is entirely on-chain based and extremely transparent, might be the answer to the innovation dilemma of non-compliant financials,” says Jupiter Zheng, Research Director at HashKey Capital.</p>
<p>A major selling point for DeFi is that it is still very new and evolving with a lot of innovators willing to contribute to its evolution. The general forecast consensus is that in the next decade, DeFi will serve as a major entry point for the next 1 billion users making their way into the broader digital currency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Treasury yields in the United States went on a bounce on Monday as investors started assessing the positivity around the latest interest rate hike on the broader stock market. As <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fed-interest-rate-highest-15-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by Coinspeaker, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 50 basis points to its highest level in 15 years.</p>
<p>Besides the heightened interest rate, the 50 basis points increment is a slowdown in the Fed’s targeted fight against inflation in America. Prior to this, the Feds raised the interest rates by 75 basis points on at least 4 occasions as the inflation in the country took a new momentum in the year.</p>
<p>The Treasury yields went on a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/treasury-yields-up-investors-assess-monetary-policy-economic-outlook.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bounce</a> today as investors places the Fed’s approach into perspective. While the yield on the 10-year Treasury Note is up by 3 basis points at 3.5167%, that on the 30-year Treasury Bond added around 4 basis points to 3.5750%.</p>
<p>The growth is assumed to be setting the pace for the stock market this week, as the top market indices look to recoup some losses printed earlier. The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500 Index</a> (INDEXSP: .INX) is down 1.11% to 3,852.36, and the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-nasdaq-composite-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq Composite</a> (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) shed off more than 105 points at a rate of 0.97% to 10,705.41, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-index-djia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> (INDEXDJX: .DJI) closed Friday’s session at 32,920.46, down 0.85%.</p>
<p>In the ongoing <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinspeaker-advent-dow-jones-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinspeaker Advent Calendar Series</a>, the forecast for each of the major indices for the coming year has been published. This forecast shows that despite the massive losses experienced thus far this year, investors may still find a glimmer of hope in betting on the funds tracking this index, especially in the long term.</p>
<h2>Hawkish Impacts on Stock Market Growth</h2>
<p>Investors have no clue how far the Fed will go into normalizing the major concern in the economy &#8211; inflation. According to the Federal Reserve Chairman <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jerome-powell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerome Powell</a>, the Central Bank’s efforts to curb inflation are far from over. While the latest inflation reading for November came in at 7.1%, Powell noted that policymakers will “have to stay at it.”</p>
<p>The push to go all out to fight inflation is poised to continually set investors on the edge and many will shun risk assets for the foreseeable future. These dampened sentiments were reflected in the 2023 forecast for some of the major stocks trading on either the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The ripple effect of the bearish sentiment in the US stock market has also contributed to the encompassing slump in the digital currency ecosystem. With Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping</a> by 1.34% over the past week to $16,760.78, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>’s 5.5% drop to $1,185.92, the impacts of the Fed’s hawkish approach to the market will notably be an encompassing one.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitmex-sued-3-4m-former-ceo/">BitMEX Sued for $3.4 Million by Former CEO in Breach of Contract</a></p>
<p>Alexander Hoeptner, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, ousted recently has decided to sue the exchange for $3.4 million for breach of contract and wrongful termination.</p>
<p>Hoeptner joined the Seychelles-based BitMEX crypto exchange earlier last year on January 21. Back then, some top officials of HDR Global Trading Limited, the operator of BitMEX, were facing a lawsuit for facilitating unregistered trading.</p>
<p>Hoeptner has filed a lawsuit in Singapore High Court alleging that BitMEX conducted a &#8220;baseless&#8221; internal investigation against him to avoid paying out millions of dollars in salary and bonuses. The investigation basically focused on his relocation from Hong Kong to Singapore, and further to Germany. Later they accused Hoeptner of the misappropriate use of company funds and used it as the basis for ousting him from the company.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, lawyers representing Hoeptner called BitMEX&#8217;s accusations “entirely without basis”. Thus, they have demanded $3.4 million from BitMEX along with damages. This figure also comprises a $2.4 million “second-anniversary bonus,” wages, and housing and education allowances.</p>
<p>Höptner’s legal representatives &#8211; Kelvin Chia Partnership &#8211; filed the claim in the Singapore High Court. In an emailed statement to The Block, Hoeptner <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/196130/ousted-bitmex-ceo-alexander-hoptner-sues-exchange" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I always acted in the best interests of the company during my tenure. I put my personal and family lives on hold in order to be on the ground in Singapore and Hong Kong. I’m disappointed that it has gotten to the point that legal proceedings are necessary, but I’ve been left with no choice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A BitMEX spokesperson has denied commenting since the matter is pending before the Singapore Court. However, the exchange noted that they would be defending the claims &#8220;vigorously&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Claims of Cost Cutting</h2>
<p>In the period between July and September, former BitMEX CEO Alexander Hoeptner was informed that co-founders Reed and Hayes were looking into the money he had spent during re-locating. On October 20, BitMEX wrote a termination letter to Hoeptner.</p>
<p>In the letter, BitMEX noted that Hoeptner misused his position “to dishonestly misappropriate some $230,000 of the Group’s funds to fund his personal and unauthorized relocation from Hong Kong to Germany&#8221;. Due to these allegations, BitMEX said that Hoeptner is no longer eligible for any further payments.</p>
<p>Two months ago, Reed also informed Hopetner that the issue of his expenses arose as the company was looking for an “extensive cost-cutting and restructuring program which involved numerous lay-offs,” the claim notes.</p>
<p>“I was hired to scale the company, and in partnership with the board, we did. We had made a lot of progress which made my wrongful termination a massive surprise. The founders always saw me and my team as caretakers in my opinion. They expected us to manage the company until they found some way to return,” noted Hoeptner.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-quit-twitter-ceo-poll/">Elon Musk to Quit as Twitter CEO as His New Poll Supports This Move</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> Chief Executive Officer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> has revealed that he may quit his role in the social media company if his following on the platform demands so. Elon Musk posted a poll on Twitter on Sunday asking his more than 122.1 million followers whether he should step down as the platform’s CEO or not. According to him, he will abide by the decision of the majority.</p>
<p>The poll has finished and exactly 17,502,391 votes have been cast with as much as 57.5% of the voters supporting the move for Elon Musk to step down.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Elon Musk completed the purchase of Twitter in late October, and for those that were part of building the Twitter culture, a whole new change has been stirred since then. Upon assumption of office, Elon Musk sacked all the C-Suite executives including Parag Agrawal. The sack did not end there as the billionaire investor who also doubles as the CEO of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) and SpaceX also cut the size of the company’s global workforce by 50%.</p>
<p>The changes in Twitter have gotten tongues wagging as to whether Elon Musk is well-suited for leading the social media company. Elon got the public’s support when he came off with the narrative that he is going to turn the social media platform into one that is known for free speech.</p>
<p>In his move to achieve this, Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-donald-trump-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinstated</a> the account of many controversial figures including former President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>, Ye, also known as Kanye West. This reinstated is as wobbly as the suspension of accounts that seem to promote other social media platforms like Truth Social, Mastodon, and Facebook amongst others.</p>
<h2>Poll by Elon Musk: Enormous Work Ahead for New Twitter Boss</h2>
<p>Elon Musk has been known as a man of his word especially when it comes to polls pushed out by his official account. The reinstatement of President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> came following the approval from a poll he published and going by his records, he may actually resign if the poll ends with the majority calling for his exit.</p>
<p>Enormous work lies ahead of the new CEO as he will have to work to reinstate the trust in the minds of advertisers, most of whom have already pulled their funding. While Elon Musk has successfully cut down the company’s cost of operations, the fact that revenue generation is currently being impaired by the withholding of ad spending by its biggest clients spells financial doom for the company if the situation persists.</p>
<p>Should Musk step down as CEO, it remains unclear how much of an influence he will have on the company’s most active decision moving forward. While his desire to exit the CEO role through a poll has been applauded by many, the <a href="https://twitter.com/myspacetom/status/1604658018213195777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns</a> about who the new successor will be are becoming a good subject of discussion on Twitter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/argentina-world-cup-arg-token/">Argentina Is Crowned World Cup Winner but ARG Token Dips 50%</a></p>
<p>The Argentina Football Association Fan Token (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/argentine-football-association-fan-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARG</a>) has dropped approximately 50 percent in the past 24 hours to trade at about $2.81 on Monday. The sharp decline coincided with the end of Qatar WorldCup 2022, which saw Argentina crowned as the football champion. Nonetheless, the ARG fan token has gained approximately 111.1 percent in the past year, whereas most digital assets are counting huge losses.</p>
<p>The resilience in fan tokens has significantly been bolstered by the just concluded Qatar 2022 World Cup. Furthermore, the football stage provides viewership to billions of fans worldwide. As such, trading volume on fan tokens and the leading infrastructure provider Chiliz (CHZ) significantly spiked in the past two months.</p>
<p>With the World Cup completed, trading volume on fan tokens and CHZ is expected to shrink in the coming months significantly. Consequently, market strategists think fan tokens may continue to fall during the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<h2>Future of Fan Tokens after Argentina Narrowly Escaped France</h2>
<p>The future of fan tokens is immense, considering FIFA has membership in 211 national associations. With global football leagues looking at blockchain tech and the cryptocurrency market to monetize their global fan base, Chiliz and the likes anticipate growing exponentially in the years ahead. Moreover, it is already a billion-dollar industry with financial backing from crucial crypto funds.</p>
<p>The ARG token decline is likely due to yesterday&#8217;s win, which many global enthusiasts think France should have won. Furthermore, the Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token (PSG) has not declined as much as ARG in the past 24 hours. Notably, PSG token &#8211; the football club that the French star Kylian Mbappé plays for &#8211; has dropped approximately 9.2 percent in the past 24 hours.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ARGENTINA ARE WORLD CHAMPIONS!! 🇦🇷<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFAWorldCup?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FIFAWorldCup</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Qatar2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Qatar2022</a></p>
<p>&mdash; FIFA World Cup (@FIFAWorldCup) <a href="https://twitter.com/FIFAWorldCup/status/1604535989480955908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite a historic World Cup win, Argentina is ranked fourth by FIFA, after Brazil, Belgium, and France. As such, more countries are likely to adopt the tokenization industry like Argentina, to involve global fans at a personal level. Furthermore, the ARG token ecosystem has plans to venture into the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> and metaverse industry.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/pl/waluty/argentine-football-association-fan-token" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a> provided by Coingecko, Argentina Fan Token $ARG has a market capitalization of approximately $9,882,374, with a total supply of 20,000,000.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the future of fan tokens remains under worldwide crypto regulations scrutiny. More so now, after the FTX and FTT collapse, that has left most with questions about crypto tokens.</p>
<p>Notably, countries are working together to regulate the cryptocurrency market, significantly threatening the traditional banking industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto traders will continue speculating on fan tokens before adopting a mainstream utility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-block-social-media-accounts/">Twitter to Block Links to Other Social Media Accounts</a></p>
<p>On Sunday, December 18, social media giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> announced that it would block accounts &#8220;created solely&#8221; to promote other social media platforms. A thread from Twitter support read that the company  “will remove accounts created solely for the purpose of promoting other social platforms and content that contains links or usernames”. This involved accounts promoting Facebook, Instagram, Truth Social, Mastodon, Nostr, Tribel, and Post.</p>
<h2>New Social Media Policy Introduced by Twitter</h2>
<p>The announcement signaled a shift towards a more closed environment and received a lot of flak from users worldwide. Besides, the decision also led to a suspension of a prominent account forcing Musk to intervene. The billionaire said that he would adjust the policy, just hours after its release. Interestingly, the Twitter support team has <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1604531265419591681" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">removed</a> the official announcement thread from the handle.</p>
<p>Since his takeover of Twitter, Elon Musk has faced strong criticism for introducing some sweeping changes on the platform. Initially, he fired half of the Twitter staff and lifted restrictions on some of the previously barred accounts.</p>
<p>Also, since the Twitter acquisition, a majority of Musk&#8217;s time has gone to restructuring the platform. Some of his followers have asked him to refocus on Tesla, whose share price has been plummeting recently.</p>
<p>Last week, Elon Musk also engaged in a rift with journalists. The platform banned a number of accounts belonging to journalists from major publications like the Washington Post and CNN. Musk alleged that these journalists were doxxing his location.  However, this move from Twitter and Musk faced condemnation from the likes of the American Civil Liberties Union. The United Nations has also referred to it as &#8220;dangerous precedent&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk Offers to Step Down</h2>
<p>On Sunday, Elon Musk conducted a Twitter poll asking whether he should step down as the CEO of Twitter. He also said that he would abide by the results of the poll.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The poll has some three hours left and has already garnered 14.8 million votes. However, as of press time, 57% of the people have voted &#8220;YES&#8221;. On the question of finding a new CEO, Musk added that &#8220;the question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive&#8221;.</p>
<p>After the recent incident over policy changes, Elon Musk has decided to get his act right. &#8220;Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won’t happen again,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604616863673208832" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> he.</p>

<p>The Yuga Labs lawsuit against a defendant for &#8216;appropriating&#8217; and benefitting from Bored Ape non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>) has advanced. According to a recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.855658/gov.uscourts.cacd.855658.62.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing</a>, the prominent NFT developer saw a US District Court of Central California rule in its favor against artist Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen. The court denied a motion by the defendants to dismiss Opposition from the famous blockchain technology company. However, the court also granted Ripps and his NFT business partner Cahen the possibility of re-filing a future motion against Yuga Labs&#8217; appropriation claims.</p>
<p>Yuga Labs has accused the duo of benefiting from Bored Ape NFTs at Yuga&#8217;s expense. The Miami-based company first <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/154206/yuga-labs-sues-artist-in-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-case" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> the lawsuit in June against the California-based Ryder Ripps and several associates. According to Yuga Labs at the time, the NFT artist and NFT marketplace Not Larva Labs founder Jeremy Cahen copied and sold NFT collections, subsequently devaluing Bored Ape products.</p>
<p>Presently weighing in on the California court&#8217;s latest ruling, a Yuga Labs spokesperson stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our lawsuit to hold Ripps and Cahen accountable for their obvious and blatant theft of Yuga Labs&#8217; trademarks rightfully moves forward with this ruling.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the spokesperson expressed Yuga Labs&#8217; intent to prove how the copycat NFTs adversely impact its &#8216;originals.&#8217; In the Yuga Labs&#8217; spokesperson&#8217;s own words, &#8220;We will continue to prove these facts as the case progresses.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Ripps, Others Brand Bored Ape Creator Lawsuit as Attack on Freedom of Speech</h2>
<p>In October, the defendants initially filed the motion against Yuga Labs to dismiss the opposition. Branding the lawsuit by the Bored Ape creator as an attack on his freedom of speech, Ripps also filed an anti-strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) motion at the time. In addition, the aggrieved co-defendant previously expressed a willingness to only settle out of court for a payout of no less than $100 billion. Also, disputing Yuga Labs&#8217; claims of copycat NFTs, Ripps noted that &#8220;RR/BAYC is an expressive conceptual artwork illuminating truths about YugaLabs and establishing that you can not copy an NFT. Nothing about this ruling can or will change those objective facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The California-based conceptual artist also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I do see it possible that [Yuga Labs] will wake up one day and realize the gravity of their troll and their incessant lies and their disrespect towards other people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in July, the co-defendant expressed faith in his chances of winning the case against Yuga Labs. In addition, Ripps also suggested that the proceeds from a Yuga Labs payout, either by court mandate or out of court, would be used to settle numerous financial obligations. According to him, these include hefty lawyers&#8217; fees and community members supporting Ripps NFTs. However, Ripps also added that Yuga Labs does not currently consider the far-reaching ramifications of its lawsuit and accusations.</p>
<p>In June, amid the lawsuit filing, the Bored Ape creator <a href="https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1540509851641692160" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">took to Twitter</a> to appreciate its community for their support.</p>
