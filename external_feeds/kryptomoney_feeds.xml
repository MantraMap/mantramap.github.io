<p>The founders of <a href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1611018579532742657">Three Arrows Capital,</a> a failing cryptocurrency hedge fund, were recently served with a subpoena by the Southern District of New York United States Bankruptcy Court. The founders, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu are the targets of the subpoena, which was delivered by liquidators via the well-known social media site Twitter.<br /><br />They have been ordered to allow an inspection of the premises at a specified date and time and to produce all papers in their possession (regardless of whether they are held by them directly or by a third party).</p>
<p>In July, Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy, leaving many investors with no money.<br /><br />The collapse of Three Arrows Capital continues to have an impact on the markets for digital assets. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/genesis-ceo-asks-for-more-time-to-address-lending-issues/">Genesis</a> Global Trading&#8217;s parent company, Digital Currency Group, sued them for $1.2 billion after its subsidiary&#8217;s lending division was compelled to halt new loan originations and redemptions in November. <br /><br />Even though the controversial founders are still active on Twitter, nobody knows where they are. The founders of 3AC were not willing to help, according to a spokeswoman for Teneo Consulting Group, which is in charge of overseeing the bankruptcy processes for 3AC.</p>

<ul>
<li>ETC was trading at $18.66 at the time of publication</li>
<li>ETC trading volume has increased significantly</li>
<li>The ETC collaboration says it is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Ethercluster to Rivet</li>
</ul>
<p>As its price increased from its low of $15.64 on December 3, ETC, the native asset of the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/etc-price-analysis-ethereum-classic-primed-for-60-rally-in-september-top-mining-pool-announces-support/">Ethereum Classic</a> chain, unexpectedly printed a gigantic green daily candlestick. The daily high of $19.96 was reached on January 4 thanks to the kick, which appeared to break a barrier. ETC was trading at $18.66 at the time of publication, up 21% over the previous 24 hours. Likewise, the Ethereum spinoff has increased by 27% over the previous week. Ethereum Classic, according to blockchain analytics company Sentiment, is experiencing a decent bounce of its own. The statement continued,<em> &#8220;Not only is volume large, but it is also heavily shorted by traders on exchanges.&#8221;</em> Data from <em><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/">CoinMarketCap</a></em> shows that in the past day, ETC trading volume has increased significantly. In other news, the ETC collaboration says it is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Ethercluster to Rivet. The Ethercluster RPC endpoints will be discontinued on July 1, 2023, a notice in a blog post reads.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $30.00, $25.00, $20.00<br />Support Levels: $17.00, $15.00, $13.00</p>
<h4>ETC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63815 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETC/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The bias is turning positive over long and medium terms, and if the breached daily moving average (MA 50) at $18.00 holds as support, a rally toward $25.00 is anticipated. On the other hand, a break and closing below the daily moving average (MA 200) at $25.00 would refocus attention on the $20.00 level. This week, the pair has recovered and might go higher.<br /><br />On the other hand, given the strength of the USD, we might expect further losses below $25.00, with targets not below $20.00. Technically speaking, a breakout south may occur throughout the course of the upcoming trading days. In this case, the $15.00 level can provide support for the ETC/USD pair.</p>
<h4>ETC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63816 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>From a technical perspective, the recent breakout toward $20.00 is anticipated to continue during the upcoming trading sessions. In this instance, in the event of a continuous retracement, the horizontal support level of $18.00 might offer support to the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/etc-price-analysis-buyers-push-ethereum-classic-higher-by-14-as-date-for-eths-proof-of-stake-transition-is-unveiled/">ETC/USD pair</a>. The relative strength index (RSI) remains overbought.<br /><br />The initial level of support for the pair is predicted to be $17.00; however, a further breach lower might result in a fall-through that would take it to the next support level of $15.00. The pair is anticipated to encounter its first level of resistance around $20.00, with a subsequent spike pushing it to $25.00.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cryptocurrencies rebounded strongly on Wednesday, with altcoins leading the market-wide rally. Since its release on December 25, the Shiba Inu-themed coin BONK has returned 3700% to investors, with a 215% increase just in the last day. <br /><br />Airdropping the token to Solana NFT (non-fungible token) communities and creators quickly generated interest in it and increased trading volumes. Data from Coinmarketcap shows that in the past day, BONK&#8217;s trade volume has increased by around 1900%.<br /><br />In the meantime, the demand for SOL tokens has probably been influenced by the viral buzz. The Solana network&#8217;s native coin SOL has gained 16% over the past day, recouping losses from a sharp dip last week. <br /><br />Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as Ethereum Classic, NEAR, and Lido DAO led the way higher, all up over 20% over the past 24 hours. While alternative cryptocurrencies saw prices spike higher on Wednesday, a few altcoin tokens stood out. One such is XYO is up 43% in the last 24 hours and has delivered gains of 170% to traders since the past week. <br /><br />The rally in altcoins, which typically outperform bitcoin in a rising market, suggests an increased appetite for risk among traders.<br /><br />Onchain analytics firm, Santiment notes that Altcoin has heated up with Ethereum trading at a 3-week high as whales’ interest return, ‘’As altcoins have heated up, Ethereum quietly rebounded back above $1,260 for the 1st time in 3 weeks. Though not quite at the level of the big whale dip buys on December 16th (ETH&#8217;s local price bottom), whales are showing increased interest again’’.<br /><br />The rise in most altcoins according to Santiment might have been buoyed by a ‘’short squeeze’’, as most traders aggressively shorted altcoins.<br /><br />Santiment tweeted earlier in the week,’’ Traders are aggressively shorting altcoins today, and some assets could be primed for short liquidations. Based on extreme bets being placed on prices going down, DGB, HBAR, HT, KAVA, KSM, SOL, &amp; ZEC would be candidates for small breakouts if altcoins get any momentum&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Bullish January?</h2>
<p>Likewise, Traders are putting out bullish trades before the next FED meeting fear starts kicking in towards the end of January. The Fed&#8217;s next meeting comes up on Jan 31-February 1. Market speculators might take bullish trades for several reasons at the beginning of January 2023. <br /><br />According to the onchain analytics firm, The market has been stuck in a range for 51 days. However, a breakout looks likely with the US stock market positioned to move upward. <br /><br />Additionally, the VIX chart indicates volatility may start picking up again soon. Furthermore, the DXY chart looks like it&#8217;s ready to take another leg down.<br /><br />If the US stock market benefits from a relief rally at the beginning of January, it might boost crypto traders&#8217; sentiment. Moreover, we might see a slight rally while the BTC Dominance chart pulls back, allowing large-cap altcoins to breathe.<br /><br />However, despite the rally on Wednesday, the mood in the crypto market remained cautious. The Crypto Fear and Greed index, a gauge of market sentiment based on several metrics, was at 29 and reflecting &#8221; fear&#8221;.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom&#8217;s National Crime Agency (NCA) is <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/crypto-crime-uk-nca-job-anti-money-laundering-national-crime-agency-digital-fraud-20230104">developing</a> a unit that will be in charge of dealing with crypto-crime issues. This group of officials will largely look into dubious financial activities.<br /><br />According to a job posting on the government&#8217;s website, a crypto cell should be established that <em>“will be dedicated to a proactive cryptocurrency remit with the right tools and capabilities to target UK-based subjects.”</em><br /><br />The formation of a <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cryptocurrency-crimes-costed-south-korea-2-28b-since-july-2017/">crypto crime</a> unit follows the loss of $3 billion in cryptocurrency in the UK due to hacks and frauds. It is not surprising that the $3 billion in hacking losses had a big effect on the UK financial sector.<br /><br />After conducting an investigation, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) discovered that this industry has been a significant contributor to financial scams. Between March 2021 and April 2022, the majority of these scams took place. Within the aforementioned time frame, 432 scams were examined and reported.<br /><br />Numerous financial frauds of all sorts have thrived in the cryptocurrency business. Large-scale unlawful transactions and money laundering have both been made possible by the sector. Recently, the UK has seen an upsurge in these crimes.<br /><br />It will be necessary for the team of authorities chosen for the job of cryptocurrency investigator to offer strategic and tactical guidance on how to circumvent such fraudulent actions. The officials should have a lot of expertise in conducting forensic blockchain investigations into large-scale, intentional wrongdoing.<br /><br />According to reports, only a small portion of the virtual asset teams are responsible for the project&#8217;s inquiry. Additionally, the unit of the National Crime Agency will initially consist of five officers.<br /><br />The UK government has made progress toward approving the sector by 2022, and then-chancellor Rishi Sunak had also made note of his aspirations to establish the UK as a <em>&#8220;crypto hub.&#8221;</em> Officials in the UK are nonetheless concerned about how the area has turned into a<em> &#8220;new front line&#8221;</em> for criminals.<br /><br />Later in 2022, lawmakers approved a bill giving the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) new authority to properly oversee the sector.<br /><br />According to Chris Lewis-Evans, a manager at the NCA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cryptocurrency and virtual assets are widely viewed as specialist areas of knowledge, and [the new roles are] key to supporting NCA investigations in which these are used to enable serious criminality.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the prolonged downturn in this industry, many nations have had to review their regulatory frameworks. The value of some of the biggest market movers, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has also fallen, prompting regulatory agencies to place a higher priority on protecting consumers from severe volatility.<br /><br />The collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-s-sbf-bows-out-following-liquidity-crunch/">FTX</a> in November was another significant event that caused upheaval inside the sector. Recent developments have made it more important than ever for countries to establish suitable regulatory frameworks for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

</ul>
<p>Expectations remain for a comeback of bulls in the crypto market come 2023, although such indications seem not yet certain. The crypto market is seeing slight selling pressure at press time, with <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-influencer-reveals-why-he-moved-from-solana-to-hedera-hbar-internet-computericp-and-algorand/">Hedera’s HBAR</a> token down 1.59% in the last 24 hours to $0.038. Pangolin, a multichain decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche and Songbird Networks, has announced it will launch on Hedera. Pangolin is one of the most popular DEXs on the Avalanche blockchain, with over $16 billion in total trading volume. This year, Pangolin launched on the Songbird Network and announced plans for NEAR, Flare, and now Hedera. In other news, the Hashgraph Innovation Program, a joint initiative between the Swiss Hashgraph Association and the Swiss Digital Assets Institute (SDAI), has gotten off to a successful start. The Swiss Hashgraph Association, which is based in the Greater Zurich Area, is supporting a total of 35 projects that aim to develop innovative applications on the Hedera network. The blockchain funding program is being operated together with the Swiss Digital Assets Institute.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.0553, $0.0500, $0.0456<br />Support Levels: $0.0377, $0.0300, $0.0250</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="773" class="alignnone wp-image-63799 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-300x156.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-1024x532.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-768x399.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-750x390.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-1140x592.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">HBAR/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hbar-price-analysis-whats-next-for-hbar-price-top-investment-company-joins-hedera-governing-council/">HBAR/USD</a> opened lower at $0.0380 and rose to $0.0391 on Wednesday. As buyers appeared focused on levels above $0.0390, the pair continued to range. A decisive decline below $0.0380 must be produced to analyze the bearish situation. The pair may continue to tumble, with pessimistic traders eyeing the area below $0.0300 as a likely target.<br /><br />Growth from the December 31st low of $0.0355 is viewed as a likely rebound phase within a longer-term consolidation trend. More gains are predicted as long as the $0.0300 support level holds. A robust breakout of $0.0456, on the other hand, would signal the end of the continuation of the bounce from the $0.0355 low, bringing the upside back into focus.</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63798 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The HBAR/USD is still trading in a range from its recent low of $0.0355, with an intraday tilt to the downside. If the last support level of $0.0377 holds, the price is likely to rise further. A significant return above $0.0456, on the other hand, will recoup all profits made in December.<br /><br />The next target will be a mid-term level of $0.0440 as the 4-hour relative strength index hits the neutral zone. A break of revised support at $0.0377, on the other hand, might reverse the expected uptrend and expand the range from $0.0388 with a fresh decline phase below the level at $0.0355.</p>

<p>A fantastic achievement, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-blockchain-data-size-hits-new-300-gigabytes-milestone/">Bitcoin blockchain</a> has now been operational for 14 years. The genesis block was mined on January 3, 2009, amid the height of the financial crisis, and today is the anniversary of that event. The controversial <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/mysterious-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-is-the-worlds-44th-most-powerful-person-in-finance/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, whose true identity is still unknown, started the Bitcoin genesis block.<br /><br />The genesis block, the very first one on the Bitcoin blockchain, was one of the most innovative ideas of this century and signaled the start of a new era in decentralized digital money.<br /><br />Cryptographers hypothesized that the 50 Bitcoins in the genesis block would be viewed as a reward for maintaining nodes on the network, thus they were not spent. The London Times&#8217;s <em>&#8220;Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks&#8221;</em> headline is also included in the document. <br /><br />Given that banks were being bailed out as a result of reckless banking activities, this was seen to be a statement on the state of money in general at the time.<br /><br />It has been hypothesized that Satoshi used this header to express opposition to the way major banks handled business before the advent of cryptocurrencies and how Bitcoin could render those same banks obsolete by offering <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-blockchain-the-backbone-of-decentralized-finance/">decentralized</a> methods for handling financial transactions.<br /><br />With 770,111 total blocks from its humble beginnings 10 years ago, the Bitcoin network itself has undergone a significant transformation. In terms of trading digital currencies, Bitcoin continues to lead the way.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, disgraced former FTX CEO <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-charged-with-eight-criminal-offenses/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> pleaded not guilty to fraud charges in a federal court in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud-charges-in-new-york.html">New York</a>.<br /><br />After his crypto exchange enterprise imploded last year, Bankman-Fried faces various allegations, including wire fraud and campaign finance law crimes. Bankman-Fried is accused of, among other things, misusing FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto trading firm and make political donations.<br /><br />Requests for comment from a Bankman-Fried spokeswoman were not immediately entertained. Last month, the former CEO of FTX was detained in the Bahamas. Later, after his parents co-signed a $250 million bail bond, he was extradited to the United States and granted release. Tuesday, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorney asked the court to withhold the names of the two additional co-signers of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bond because doing so might expose them to threats and harassment.<br /><br />Following the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-s-sbf-bows-out-following-liquidity-crunch/">collapse</a> of the crypto behemoth due to a run on its native utility coin, FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November. FTX, once valued at $32 billion, might still owe its top 50 creditors $3.1 billion.<br /><br />Many of Bankman Fried&#8217;s top lieutenants have already admitted guilt and are helping with the investigation into FTX-related criminal charges. <br /><br />According to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York, Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Alameda Research trading company, and Gary Wang, the other co-founder of FTX, pleaded guilty to the charges.<br /><br />The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have filed further civil complaints against Bankman-Fried.</p>

The increase comes after Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted in the past week that <em>&#8220;smart people&#8221;</em> told him there is an <em>&#8220;earnest smart developer community in Solana&#8221;</em> and that the chain has a <em>&#8220;bright future.&#8221;</em> Buterin also expressed his desire that the Solana community <em>&#8220;gets a fair chance to thrive.&#8221;</em> However, Solana&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s pump hasn&#8217;t stopped the battering the would-be <em>&#8220;Ethereum killer&#8221;</em> has taken in recent months. The SOL token is down nearly 20% since the previous month and has shed over 95% of its value since reaching a peak of nearly $260 in November 2021. Solana ranks as the 16th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $4.18 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $26.00, $20.00, $12.00<br />Support Levels: $8.00, $6.00, $4.00</p>

<p>SOL rises today following a 24-hour bounce at $9.81 and a three-day positive streak. On the daily timeframe, the fall to lows of $7.96 on Dec 29 paved the way for a positive structure. The RSI is rising towards a neutral level of 50. If the bulls maintain control, the price is poised to breach the $12.10 barrier before reaching the MA 50 at $13.88.<br /><br />After clearing this significant barrier, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/sol-price-analysis-solana-posts-3-gain-in-recent-hours-chipotle-mexican-grill-announces-solana-giveaway/">SOL/USD</a> pair may target the $20.00 level before advancing to the $26.00 level and the $38.78 all-time high set in November. Otherwise, a drop below the $9.81 low might push the bears toward the $5.0 critical level, where the bulls might re-attempt its upward trend.</p>

<p>SOL&#8217;s price movement has so far rallied off lows of $7.96 and past the moving average (MA 50) at $10.40, but investors will need more before committing again. Buyers face early resistance from the $12.10 handle, which coincides with the MA 200, after breaking through the $11.50 handle. If this significant boundary is crossed, the SOL/USD pair may aim for the $20.00 level before resuming its descent toward the $8.00 level.<br /><br />If buyers win more ground, the bulls may revisit the $35.50 resistance zone. If sellers re-emerge and drive the price down, the MA 50 around $15.00 could provide early limits ahead of the $8.00 low. To summarize, SOL/USD looks to be neutrally biased between $8.00 and $12.00.</p>

<p>Santiment, an on-chain analytics firm, predicts that something big might be brewing for the XRP price. The year 2022 was a rough one for cryptocurrencies, in which most digital assets including XRP underperformed.</p>
<p>With 2023 upon us, some crypto enthusiasts are looking out for XRP price action.</p>
<h2>Here Are Five Positive Catalysts</h2>
<p>According to a Santiment community post, for the last six months, the price of XRP has generally fluctuated between $0.28 and $0.54. It has also been declining since 2021, however, this is part of a bigger ascending trend that might potentially complete a triangle formation.</p>
<p>The price is currently at the bottom of this triangle, which some investors may perceive as a favorable chance with both low risk and great gain.<br /><br />Second, the group of XRP holders who own between 1 million and 10 million XRP has added to their holdings by 25% over the last six months, bringing the total to 4.09 billion XRP. At market bottoms, this degree of accumulation is common. <br /><br />Furthermore, with the exception of the FUD event in December 2020, this group of holders normally has a substantial influence on the price of XRP.<br /><br />Third, Binance&#8217;s funding rate for XRP is currently slightly negative, indicating a bearish sentiment among traders. However, it is vital to highlight that ordinary traders on Binance may not be able to precisely predict an asset&#8217;s short-term price changes.<br /><br />Fourth, short-term traders are currently facing average losses of -7%, according to the MVRV 30-day for XRP, which evaluates their profit or loss. As a result, they may be hesitant to sell their coins at a loss, thus causing the price of XRP to rise.<br /><br />Last, if the MVRV Long/Short difference (the difference between the average profit or loss of long-term holders and short-term holdings) is heading upward while the price remains largely sideways, it could signal that long-term holders are getting more confident and increasing their positions. <br /><br />Long-term holders are frequently perceived as &#8220;steady&#8221; investors who are less inclined to sell their investments based on short-term price swings, which could contribute to an increase in price in the future. This has been the case with XRP in recent months.<br /><br />After evaluating XRP using numerous metrics and technical analyses, Santiment analysts conclude that investing in XRP is similar to playing roulette. The price has been pretty stagnant for the past six months, and most retail traders on Binance seem bearish on XRP.<br /><br />Long-term investors are optimistic, while short-term traders may be afraid to sell, so who knows what will happen? Maybe XRP will be the next big thing, or maybe it will fail miserably.</p>
