<p>This week, the crypto community can&rsquo;t stop talking about Big Eyes (BIG), Orbeon Protocol, and Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin is the long-reigning king of meme coins, and the other two projects are in their presale phase and have massive upside potential. Experts predict that Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) will rise by 60x in the weeks ahead. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare these three projects so that you can make the best decision for your portfolio. </p>

<p>Big Eyes Coin (BIG) </p>
<p>Cuteness as a currency? This &ldquo;cute&rdquo; project highlights cats with big eyes representing their namesake. Big Eyes offers an exciting meme coin platform supporting ocean-saving initiatives by holding 5% of the total supply for donations. Big Eyes Coin is currently in stage 6 of its presale and can be purchased with ETH, BNB, or USDT, which provides flexibility for buyers. </p>
<p>CoinSniper has verified the team, but it's difficult to find links to the team&rsquo;s LinkedIn pages. While Dogecoin (Doge) leans into being a dog meme, Big Eyes looks to capitalize on the internet&rsquo;s love of cats. The meme coin space often sees its market capitalization flowing between different meme projects, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how much of the market Big Eyes can capture. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol is changing the crowdfunding and venture capital industry by implementing NFTs representing shares of promising companies. Users can invest in these companies by buying and trading fractionalized versions of these NFTs, with a minimum investment of only $1. With this model, everyday investors can become Venture Capitalists.</p>
<p>If a round of fundraising falls short, investors often need more time to be able to do so. OrbeonProtocol's "Fill or Kill" mechanism guarantees that investors will get their NFTs back in this case. The mechanism is part of Orbeon Protocol's smart contract and can't be changed, ignored, or tampered with. This means that users can avoid losing their investment if a round doesn't reach its goal. </p>
<p>ORBN fuels the Orbeon Ecosystem, which includes a wallet, exchange, swap, and metaverse. Those who hold ORBN tokens enjoy governance rights, access to funding rounds for new projects being developed within the ecosystem, and discounted trading fees. </p>
<p>There is a total supply of 888 million ORBN tokens; only 40% are publicly available. The current price per token is $0.014 &ndash; but that&rsquo;s expected to change soon as market experts anticipate an increase of 6000% by the end of the pre-sale period.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol relies on substance, while Dogecoin and Big Eyes benefit primarily from hype. Both approaches can net a good return for investors, but knowing what you&rsquo;re dealing with is important before you jump into a new meme coin.</p>

<p>Dogecoin (DOGE)</p>
<p>Dogecoin was the first dog coin and the first meme coin. Dogecoin started with humble beginnings as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. The two wanted to make light of the wild speculation in the crypto space. </p>
<p>The joke worked a little too well, and now Dogecoin has a larger market cap than most corporations can ever dream of, reaching $85 billion in the spring of 2021. It was one of the coins that helped to bring mainstream attention to the crypto space, which led to some buyers leaving Dogecoin for more &ldquo;mature&rdquo; cryptocurrencies like Cardano. </p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is attempting to emulate DOGE while also trying to take a portion of its market cap, while Orbeon is offering real use cases in the venture capital and crowdfunding space. </p>
