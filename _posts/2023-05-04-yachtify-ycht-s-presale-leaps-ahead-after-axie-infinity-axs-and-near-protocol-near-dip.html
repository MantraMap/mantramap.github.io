<p class="s6">Across the Web3 space, projects are consistently battling to reach the top spot in regard to market capitalization and to truly provide investors and traders with a lot of value, both in regard to their native cryptocurrency as well as the overall project's offering.</p>
<p class="s6">With the recent decrease in the value of Axie Infinity (AXS) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), investors and traders have begun eyeing the presale of Yachtify, the first platform where anyone can buy, sell, rent or own a timeshare in anything from a Jetski to a Sunseeker Yacht. Let&rsquo;s dive in to see what makes this project truly stand out.</p>
<p class="s8">Axie Infinity (AXS) Dips By 20.6% Despite Updates</p>
<p class="s6">The Axie Infinity (AXS) Twitter page made waves in April when they announced the player experience updates as well as the AXS and Seasonal Achievement Rewards.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, on May 3, 2023, Axie Infinity (AXS) announced the Extreme Home Makeover: Lunacian Edition and gained a lot of momentum.</p>
<p class="s6">However, despite the developments and momentum, the value of the Axie Infinity (AXS) cryptocurrency has been in decline. As of May 3, 2023, Axie Infinity (AXS) traded at $7.64. Within the last 30 days, Axie Infinity (AXS) decreased by 10.4%, and in the last two weeks, the overall decrease of the cryptocurrency was by 20.6%.</p>

<p class="s8">NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Decreases by 23.2% Despite New Partnership</p>
<p class="s6">PipeFlare made an announcement that they joined forces with NEAR Protocol (NEAR) in order to make onboarding an easier procedure. This means that the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) ecosystem has experienced a high level of growth.</p>
<p class="s6">This, however, did not translate to an increased value of the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) cryptocurrency. On May 3, 2023, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) traded at $1.80. Within the last 30 days, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) saw a decrease of 6.3%, and in the last two weeks, the decrease was by 23.2%.</p>
<p class="s8">Yachtify (YCHT) To Change The Way Investors Earn Revenue</p>
<p class="s6">Yachtify will be a marketplace in which every investor will gain the opportunity to earn passive income through making investments in and having ownership over fractions of boats.</p>
<p class="s6">Specifically, when the boat that they have ownership over gets lent out, they can earn a portion of the rental based on their overall share of the boat.</p>
<p class="s6">So if an investor had fractional ownership of 30% of a specific boat, they would then earn 30% of the income generated from renting it, aside from the trading fees.</p>
<p class="s6">The YCHT cryptocurrency is currently undergoing stage one of its presale, where its value is at just $0.10.</p>
<p class="s6">Experienced investors know that significant gains can be made when they get into the early stages of a project that can become a dominant force in the Web3 space. The Yachtify network has been audited by InterFi network, and the liquidity will be locked for life, which means that it will be completely safe for investors. </p>
