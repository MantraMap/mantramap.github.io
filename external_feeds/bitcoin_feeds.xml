The executive cited his contacts at Blackrock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, and investment management firm Invesco. Both companies have filed to launch a bitcoin ETF with the SEC.</strong></p>
<h2>Novogratz Discusses Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval, Says Ripple Ruling Is &#x2018;a Big Deal&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, Mike Novogratz, revealed during his company&#x2019;s Q2 earnings call on Tuesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) within four to six months.</p>
<p>Commenting on the likelihood of the SEC greenlighting spot bitcoin ETF filings by Blackrock and Invesco, Novogratz shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both our contacts, from the Invesco side and from the Blackrock side, get you to think that this is a question of when, not if, that the outside window is probably six months.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Galaxy Digital executive added that it may take &#x201C;four to six months if you had to put a &#x2018;pin the tail on the donkey&#x2019; on it that the SEC is going to approve a bitcoin ETF.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In June, Blackrock <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filed</a> to launch a spot bitcoin trust ETF. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink explained that the asset manager is seeking to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-seeks-to-democratize-crypto-ceo-says-bitcoin-can-hedge-against-inflation-currency-devaluation/">democratize crypto</a>. He believes that crypto will &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-says-crypto-will-transcend-any-one-currency-sees-broad-based-global-interest/">transcend any one currency</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Novogratz further said on Tuesday&#x2019;s earnings call: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s significant that Larry Fink who runs the largest asset manager in the world &#x2014; Blackrock runs $7 trillion &#x2014; is out, having been orange pilled, talking very positive about bitcoin and the crypto universe, bitcoin as the first global money. That&#x2019;s a huge change of heart from where he was, five, six years ago, where the institutional world was.&#x201D; Novogratz opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once we get this ETF &#x2026; it just makes it very easy for people to make large allocations into the space.</p></blockquote>
<p>Invesco and Galaxy Digital partnered last September to offer investors exposure to a range of products in the digital asset ecosystem. According to Bloomberg analysts specializing in ETFs, the likelihood of the SEC approving a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etf-analysts-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-at-65-amid-pressure-from-blackrock/">surged to 65%</a>.</p>

<p>Novogratz also explained the significance of the Ripple ruling, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s a big deal, mostly because the SEC and Gary Gensler have been saying over and over: &#x2018;Hey, the rules are clear. Just come in and register.&#x2019;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the Galaxy Digital boss pointed out that District Judge Analisa Torres &#x201C;made it really clear, the rules aren&#x2019;t clear,&#x201D; emphasizing that &#x201C;They&#x2019;re nothing close to clear.&#x201D; Novogratz added that in his opinion, the Ripple decision &#x201C;pressures the Democrats to finally come to the table with the Republicans and try to put forward some legislation to give us clarity.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">informed</a> Judge Torres that it intends to file an appeal to her ruling in the SEC v. Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. The securities regulator also seeks a stay of court proceedings.</p>

The securities regulator is appealing &#x201C;programmatic and individual sales issues,&#x201D; he clarified, adding that &#x201C;If the SEC wins the appeal on sales, then Ripple couldn&#x2019;t use exchanges to facilitate sales.&#x201D; </strong></p>
<h2>SEC Not Disputing Whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Is a Security</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has informed District Judge Analisa Torres that it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">intends to appeal</a> her ruling in the Ripple case. However, the securities regulator is not appealing the non-security status of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, Jeremy Hogan, partner at law firm Hogan & Hogan, explained on Twitter Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The SEC continues making questionable decisions, requesting an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">interlocutory appeal</a>,&#x201D; Hogan tweeted, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Note that it is NOT appealing whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> itself is a security &#x2014; just its losses on the programmatic and individual sales issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>In another tweet, he clarified that challenging programmatic sales and challenging the non-security status of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> are &#x201C;two separate issues.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While reiterating Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling that &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is not a security,&#x201D; Hogan explained: &#x201C;If the SEC wins the appeal on sales, then Ripple couldn&#x2019;t use exchanges to facilitate sales.&#x201D; The lawyer added that the big question is whether crypto exchanges would keep <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> listed. &#x201C;I think yes, as long as they can verify the sales are not being made by Ripple,&#x201D; he stated.</p>

<p>Following Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling on the Ripple case last month, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-disappointed-with-xrp-ruling-on-retail-investors-chair-gensler-hints-at-more-crypto-industry-enforcement/">said</a> the securities regulator is &#x201C;disappointed&#x201D; with what the judge said about retail investors. Nonetheless, he affirmed that the SEC will continue its enforcement actions against cryptocurrency companies that fail to comply with regulations. The SEC chief believes that crypto is &#x201C;a highly speculative asset class&#x201D; and a field that is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-says-crypto-is-a-highly-speculative-field-rife-with-fraud/">rife with fraud</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In a filing for its lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon, the SEC claimed that some decisions in the Ripple court ruling on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> were &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-says-xrp-ruling-in-ripple-case-wrongly-decided-signals-appeal/">wrongly decided</a>.&#x201D; Moreover, District Judge Jed S. Rakoff <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-district-judge-rejects-approach-in-sec-v-ripple-ruling-on-xrp/">disagreed</a> with the approach taken by Judge Torres in the SEC v. Ripple case concerning <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the SEC planning to appeal the ruling in the Ripple case over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

<p>This latest development follows the recent discovery of Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm chips being used in a commercial setting, a milestone in the industry. TSMC&#x2019;s 2nm chips, boasting processing speeds 10% to 15% faster than their 3nm counterparts, could significantly transform industries like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/study-generative-ai-could-add-trillions-to-global-economy/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-adjusts-mining-difficulty-rises-0-12-to-52-39-trillion/">bitcoin (BTC) mining</a>.</p>
<p>Nikkei <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-to-make-cutting-edge-2-nm-chips-at-new-plant-in-southern-Taiwan">reports</a> that the Kaohsiung plant, currently under construction, will be the second hub for these advanced semiconductors, following Hsinchu county. The decision comes after a board meeting on Tuesday, where the company allocated roughly $6 billion for capital investments in Taiwan, with a portion going toward the Kaohsiung facility.</p>
<p>The company&#x2019;s plans reflect a shift in focus, as it originally intended to produce older legacy semiconductors in Kaohsiung. However, a change in plans was considered following the flagging demand for computer chips, which started after the pandemic. The new venture towards 2nm chips aligns with the global trend of advancing chip technology, aiming to meet the demands of fields like AI and cloud computing.</p>
<p>Nikkei staff reporter Hideaki Ryugen disclosed that Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai expressed support for TSMC&#x2019;s new initiative, committing to adjustments to water and electricity supply to ensure smooth construction. Ryugen further noted that TSMC is also seeking a site for a new plant in Taichung, which could become its third 2nm chip hub in Taiwan.</p>

<p>In the context of the broader industry, TSMC&#x2019;s advancement towards 2nm chips echoes the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/samsungs-3nm-gaa-chip-discovered-in-microbts-next-gen-bitcoin-mining-rig/">recent discovery</a> of Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm Gate-All-Around (GAA) semiconductor in Microbt&#x2019;s Whatsminer M56S++ bitcoin mining rig. This marked the first known application of the 3nm technology, discovered by Techinsights. Samsung&#x2019;s breakthrough has long been speculated, and its commercialization can aid in the production of even more advanced chips.</p>
<p>The discovery of Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm chip in the bitcoin mining machine is a crucial development, enhancing performance and energy efficiency. The Whatsminer M56S++ bitcoin mining rig produces an estimated 230 to 254 terahash per second (TH/s), and the utilization of Samsung&#x2019;s technology could be a harbinger of things to come in the industry. For instance, Microbt&#x2019;s rival, Bitmain, is believed to utilize chips supplied by TSMC, the same company venturing into 2nm technology.</p>

Furthermore, the survey details that the BMC accounts for 43.4% of the global mining network.</strong></p>
<h2>Insights From the Bitcoin Mining Council&#x2019;s Latest Survey</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin Mining Council, a collaborative global forum of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> mining companies and associated businesses, <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/bitcoin-mining-council-survey-confirms-year-on-year-improvements-in-sustainable-power-and-technological-efficiency-in-h1-2023/">announced</a> the findings of its recent survey on August 9, 2023. Focused on electricity consumption, technological efficiency, and sustainable power mix, the survey reveals that BMC&#x2019;s membership hashrate has increased from 24 exahash per second (EH/s) in Q1 2022 to 158 EH/s in Q2 2023.</p>
<p>The survey&#x2019;s results highlight a significant shift toward sustainable energy within the bitcoin mining industry. Members of the BMC are utilizing electricity with a 63.1% sustainable power mix, reflecting a positive trend in environmental consciousness.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Based on this data, the global bitcoin mining industry&#x2019;s sustainable electricity mix has improved marginally to 59.9% and remains one of the most sustainable industries globally,&#x201D; the report stated.</p>

<p>Additionally, a year-on-year comparison reveals that the technological efficiency of the global Bitcoin network rose by 24%, growing from 21.1 EH/s per gigawatt (GW) in the first half of 2022 to 26.1 EH/s per GW in the corresponding period of 2023.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Entering 2023, the Bitcoin network has never been stronger or more secure,&#x201D; Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer of Bitfarms stated. &#x201C;Despite the macro headwinds in the second half of 2022, the industry has continued to deploy new miners, increasing hash rate and improving energy efficiency and network security.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Gagnon added:</p>
<blockquote><p>In H1 2023, we also saw a significant increase in curtailment, with BMC members reporting 2.5 GW worth of Bitcoin mining operations participating in curtailment programs and 815 GWh of energy released back to local grids during times of peak demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gagnon added that most of this curtailment is identified in the United States and Canada, where the available interruptible load equals roughly 25% of all installed utility battery storage across these two nations. Through such initiatives, Bitcoin mining manifests itself in various regions as an essential tool for grid stabilization and as the &#x201C;buyer of last resort,&#x201D; Gagnon said.</p>

This monthly surge aligns with June&#8217;s 0.2% escalation, where food costs and automobile insurance similarly contributed to the inflationary computation.</strong></p>
<h2>3.2% Inflation in July: U.S. Economy Faces Growing Pressure Amid Rising Costs</h2>
<p>The U.S. economy is experiencing pressure as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) demonstrates a hastened year-over-year increment for July, per <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf">data</a> unveiled on Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI climbed 3.2% from the previous year, marginally accelerating from June&#8217;s 3% annual growth. Prices also advanced by 0.2% in July compared to the preceding month, echoing June&#8217;s 0.2% monthly enhancement. This moderate inflation hike has economists, policymakers, and consumers on guard.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: July CPI inflation data shows US inflation rate RISES to 3.2%, below expectations of 3.3%.</p>
<p>Core CPI inflation is now at 4.7%, below expectations of 4.8%.</p>
<p>This is the first monthly increase in CPI inflation since July 2022.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>July&#8217;s inflation statistics have rekindled discussions regarding the viability of the current economic resurgence. With a 3.2% surge in CPI, analysts are meticulously observing indications of a greater upward trajectory in the approaching months. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s outlook on fiscal policies and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-governor-hints-at-more-interest-rate-hikes/">interest rates</a> may be swayed by these figures, prompting potential shifts that could affect borrowing expenses and investment tactics.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve beaten inflation but prices keep going up.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sven Henrich (@NorthmanTrader) <a href="https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1689617966533398528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Upon publication of the news, economist and gold proponent Peter Schiff offered his perspective. “Don&#8217;t believe the financial media&#8217;s spin that July&#8217;s 3.2% YoY CPI rise, with YoY core at 4.7%, means the Fed is winning its war against inflation,” Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1689619258622304261?s=20">stated</a>. “Core is bottoming, and the headline number is about to rise sharply led higher by surging oil prices. The Fed has already lost.”</p>
<p>Economist and president of the Brownstone Institute, Jeffrey Tucker, shared his viewpoint <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffreyatucker/status/1689616938974978048?s=20">proclaiming</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>CPI same in July as it was in June, namely 50% higher than target, which will no doubt be reported as continued cooling and easing. Look, this was supposed to be continuing to fall to the target. This wicked tax has been eating through the dollar&#8217;s value for 31 months!</p></blockquote>
<p>The market&#8217;s response to the CPI figures was divided, mirroring the ambiguity encompassing the greater economic landscape. While certain investors perceive the inflation acceleration as evidence of strong economic growth, others are concerned about potential overheating and ensuing policy tightening requirements. On a month-to-month basis, the 0.2% price augmentation remained consistent with June.</p>

<p>This stability could be construed as an indication that inflation is not skyrocketing uncontrollably but is adhering to an anticipated pattern. Such a perspective may bolster those advocating for a cautious strategy regarding policy intercession.</p>
<p>All four benchmark stock indexes dropped on the news, and the <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">crypto economy</a> hardly stirred, with bitcoin, ethereum, and other prices remaining unchanged. Gold and silver spot prices, conversely, exhibited distinct reactions — both precious metals markets <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">experienced</a> gains following the publication of the CPI report.</p>

As consumer prices rose to a reading of 3.2% in July, traders so far seem unsure on how to process this data. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> fell by nearly 5% today.</strong></p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) was back in the red during today&#x2019;s session, as bulls retreated following a recent three-day win streak.</p>
<p>After moving to a peak of $7.86 on Wednesday, LINK/USD slipped to a floor of $7.57 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Thursday&#x2019;s decline sees chainlink slip away from a move towards a long-term ceiling at the $8.00 level.</p>

<p>One reason for the drop off appears to be due to a collision with a ceiling of 58.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is at a reading of 57.27, with the next visible floor at the 52.00 mark.</p>
<p>Should bears hit this target, LINK will likely be trading at $7.00.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>Another notable token to fall today was <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, which fell by as much as 5% during today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>After peaking at $0.6623 during yesterday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD plunged to a bottom at the $0.6253 level.</p>
<p>Overall, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, has been on the decline since its peak of $0.9479 on July 13, which was a 20-month high.</p>

<p>The latest drop coincided with the RSI failing to break out of a key resistance zone at the 46.00 region.</p>
<p>In the event momentum remains bearish throughout the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> could be moving towards $0.5000.</p>

Citing inconsistencies in onchain data, Cryptoquant has questioned the authenticity of the identified wallet&#x2019;s connection to Tether. This challenge adds a new twist to the ongoing discussions about Tether&#x2019;s reported bitcoin holdings.</strong></p>
<h2>Alleged Tether Bitcoin Wallet Under Scrutiny: Cryptoquant Finds Inconsistencies in Onchain Data</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-suggest-11th-largest-bitcoin-wallet-belongs-to-stablecoin-giant-tether/">claim began</a> when a research analyst from 21.co suggested a specific bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) address (the 11th largest) as Tether&#x2019;s official <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet. Crypto journalist Yogita Khatri further <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/243310/tether-bitcoin-11th-largest-holder?utm_source=telegram2&utm_medium=social">reported</a> that a source had confirmed Tether&#x2019;s ownership. This claim was later <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1689515834497191937?s=20">challenged</a> by Cryptoquant, which analyzed the onchain data and found discrepancies.</p>
<p>According to Cryptoquant, the so-called Tether bitcoin holding <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qjasf9z3h7w3jspkhtgatgpyvvzgpa2wwd2lr0eh5tx44reyn2k7sfc27a4">wallet</a> did not match the description in Tether&#x2019;s quarterly report. While the wallet started accumulating <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, no holdings were reported in last year&#x2019;s Q4 report. Cryptoquant <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1689515842441248768?s=20">highlighted</a> that this could not be the only <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet Tether possesses, casting doubt on the connection.</p>

<p>Cryptoquant&#x2019;s analysis further reveals a blind spot in onchain data when monitoring <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> &#x2018;whale&#x2019; behavior. The term &#x2018;whales&#x2019; often refers to entities holding significant amounts of bitcoin. However, the firm emphasizes that it&#x2019;s possible to miss individual characteristics or mislabel wallets on exchanges, leading to misinterpretation of the data.</p>
<p>The skepticism from Cryptoquant stems from the complex nature of defining and identifying wallet ownership. A significant movement of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from May to July was observed, but it appeared to be a movement associated with Robinhood. This exemplifies the difficulty in precisely determining wallet ownership, and Cryptoquant&#x2019;s warning against hasty conclusions.</p>
<p>Tether&#x2019;s Bitcoin reserves have been a topic of intense scrutiny in the crypto community, and Cryptoquant&#x2019;s challenge adds more uncertainty to the ongoing debate.</p>

The consumer price index rose to an annual rate of 3.2% last month, with core inflation falling to 4.7%. Ethereum also slipped into the red.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) gave up recent gains on Thursday, as markets reacted to the latest U.S. inflation report.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $29,376.80 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, following a peak at $30,093.44 the day prior.</p>
<p>The decline sees bitcoin retreat from its highest level since July 20, when the price peaked at a level of $30,421.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the drop appears to be the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) falling below a recent ceiling of 51.00</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at a reading of 50.51, with a floor of 41.00 the next visible target.</p>
<p>In the event that price strength reaches this level, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will fall below the $29,000 mark.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also in the red during today&#x2019;s session, as price fell lower for a second consecutive day.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,869.74 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,845.49 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Price slightly rebounded following the latest U.S. consumer price index, which marginally rose in July.</p>

<p>The recent volatility in ethereum comes as the RSI was unable to break out of a ceiling at the 51.00 mark.</p>
<p>As of writing, ethereum&#x2019;s price strength is sitting at 49.12, with price at $1,856.44.</p>

All donations are converted into fiat currency within 24 hours after the donation has been made. Benjamin William said his organization has enabled the crypto option for &#x201C;donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Tax Deductions</h2>
<p>The Singapore Red Cross has said well-wishers can now donate via cryptocurrency but donors will not receive tax deductions, a report has said. According to the charitable organization, all donations are converted into fiat currency less than 24 hours after the donation has been received.</p>
<p>As per a Straitstimes <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-red-cross-accepts-cryptocurrencies-as-donations">report</a>, the Singapore Red Cross has partnered with the crypto payment gateway Triple A. Commenting on Singapore Red Cross&#x2019; decision to start accepting crypto donations, Benjamin William, the organization&#x2019;s CEO, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>By accepting digital currencies, we open our doors to a new segment of donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>By accepting donations in the form of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, and the stablecoins <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC, the Singapore Red Cross joins other local charitable organizations such as The Food Bank Singapore, which already accepts cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>According to the report, other crypto-accepting Singaporean charitable organizations such as Daughters of Tomorrow and Cycling Without Age are using the platform Digital Philanthropy.</p>

The Public Information Access Agency (AAIP), the data comptroller in the country, sent a letter to the Worldcoin Foundation requesting information about how the personal data of Wordcoin users is treated.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentina to Probe Worldcoin Data Treatment</h2>
<p>The government of Argentina has <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/noticias/la-aaip-investiga-el-tratamiento-de-datos-personales-de-worldcoin-en-argentina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it started a probe into Worldcoin, the biometric ID and wallet project, and its data procedures. The Public Information Access Agency (AAIP), the data comptroller organization in the country, sent a <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/2023/08/fundacion_worldcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> on August 7 to the Worldcoin Foundation requesting data to verify that the company is taking all the measures available to protect the privacy of the citizens participating in the project.</p>
<p>The formal probe follows a legal <a href="https://www.ciberseguridadlatam.com/2023/08/06/argentina-denuncia-contra-worldcoin-por-posible-violacion-a-la-normativa-de-proteccion-de-datos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaint</a> presented by Daniel Monastersky, partner at Data Governance Latam, based on possible violations of the Personal Data Protection Act and the lack of compliance in dealing with the biometric data collected.</p>
<p>In a recent press release, the government stated that if issues are found after this probe, they &#8220;will take appropriate steps to address any identified issues and ensure that the company complies with security and privacy standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the AAIP, the Wordcoin Foundation must follow the procedures established in the Personal Data Protection Act, which include registering with the institution, delivering information about its data treatment policies, indicating the reason for requiring data, and informing about the time of conservation of this information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Worldcoin also needs to detail the safety and confidentiality measures it applies to safeguard the personal information of Argentine citizens.</p>

<h2>International Opposition</h2>
<p>While Sam Altman, one of the co-founders of the Worldcoin project, has publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1683380244013809664?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that its goal is to register 2 billion people, the project has gained opposition in several countries of the world due to its intrusive personal data requirements, which include scanning the irises of the users to verify their identities.</p>
<p>Argentina is the latest of several countries currently probing the operations of the Worldcoin Foundation. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-french-privacy-regulator-probes-worldcoins-biometric-data-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bavarias-data-protection-office-launches-probe-into-worldcoins-iris-scanning-data-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bavarian</a> data regulators are also on top of the foundation regarding data treatment practices.</p>
<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s verification operations in Kenya have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-government-says-it-has-suspended-worldcoin-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended</a> since August 2. On August 6, Kenyan police <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-kenyan-police-raid-worldcoins-offices-just-days-after-govt-suspended-the-crypto-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raided</a> Worldcoin offices, confiscating the devices for storing users&#8217; data.</p>
