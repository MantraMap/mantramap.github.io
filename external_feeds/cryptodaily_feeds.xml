			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network, appeared in federal court last week, pleading not guilty to numerous charges, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, and wire fraud.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The court session marks the latest twist in a long and complex narrative that has unfolded within the crypto lending industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">An Array of Charges</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On the day of his arraignment, Mashinsky, 57, turned up to the Manhattan federal court in an understated gray polo shirt and jeans, and without handcuffs. He was arrested following a slew of lawsuits initiated by several federal regulatory agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As reported by Reuters, the charges against Mashinsky and Celsius revolve around allegations that they "misled customers and artificially inflated the value of [Celsius's] propriety crypto token." In total, Mashinsky was charged with seven criminal counts, an indictment that was unsealed on the same day of his court appearance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A High-Profile Case</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This case isn't the first legal challenge Celsius and Mashinsky have faced. Earlier this year, New York state's attorney general also accused Mashinsky of fraud. Notably, Mashinsky's arrest comes at a time of increased scrutiny for the crypto industry, with numerous other platforms facing similar allegations. As Reuters puts it, the industry is undergoing "a reckoning after a slump in crypto prices led to the collapse of several companies."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a public statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams made his stance clear:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Whether it's old-school fraud or some new-school crypto scheme, it doesn't matter one bit. It's all fraud to us."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Accusations and Counterarguments</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Celsius Network, founded by Mashinsky in 2017, promised easy loan access and high interest rates to depositors, with the company lending out tokens to institutional investors with the intention of profiting from the difference. But the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022 after a wave of customer withdrawal requests during a downturn in crypto prices. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC's lawsuit against Mashinsky and Celsius alleges that the firm misled investors about the company's financial health, even as it pursued increasingly risky strategies to deliver high promised returns. Despite the significant loss of funds as customers rushed to withdraw, Mashinsky and Celsius continued to assert that the company was financially stable and had sufficient funds to meet withdrawals, the SEC claimed.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Awaiting What's Next</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the mounting allegations and legal challenges, Mashinsky and his legal team remain defiant. His attorneys, Benjamin Alee and Jonathan Ohring, have signaled their intent to challenge the charges, stating that Mashinsky "looks forward to vigorously defending himself in court against these baseless charges."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As the case proceeds, the world will watch closely, considering the potential implications not just for Mashinsky and Celsius, but also for the broader crypto industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Kain Warwick, founder of the Synthetix derivatives protocol, has introduced Infinex, a new decentralized perpetuals exchange.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The venture sets its sights on challenging the dominance of centralized exchanges such as Binance by prioritizing user experience, marking a notable shift in the DeFi status quo.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Infinex: Reinventing DeFi User Experience</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The inception of Infinex reflects a crucial shift among blockchain developers. Increasingly, these innovators recognize that improving user experience is key to onboarding new users and expanding the DeFi sector. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a significant departure from typical DeFi user interfaces, Infinex eliminates the need to use a crypto wallet to sign transactions. Instead, it adopts a common approach: users create a username and password. Their private keys, still essential for signing transactions, are stored in their browsers. However, according to Warwick, these keys will not be able to withdraw deposited funds, prioritizing user security.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Centralized Exchanges in Infinex&rsquo;s Sights</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Warwick has a clear vision for Infinex: directly compete with centralized exchanges like Binance. To achieve this, the exchange needs to balance several factors. It must ensure a user experience on par with centralized counterparts, maintain a genuinely decentralized framework, and address potential security concerhns of storing private keys in the browser.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Infinex also recognizes the importance of regulatory compliance. The exchange is defsigned to minimize proprietary components, emphasizing its decentralized foundations and reshaping the traditional concept of liability.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Infinex Governance and Operational Design</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to details on the project shared via Mirror.xyz, Infinex won't issue its own token for governance purposes. Instead, it will use Synthetix's SNX token to manage its governance. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Infinex's initial target market comprises existing crypto traders. To kickstart their trading on Infinex, users will need to deposit either USDT or USDC, both dollar-pegged stablecoins.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The exchange is expected to generate revenue from several sources, including trading fees, integration fees from a rewards program, and fees from staking SNX.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the unveiling of Infinex, Warwick brings a fresh perspective to the DeFi sector, placing a premium on user experience. This approach underscores a shift in priorities within the industry and sets a new standard for decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">By focusing on existing crypto traders, Infinex makes a calculated move to attract a significant segment of the market that currently operates on centralized exchanges. The success of this approach will undoubtedly be observed closely by other players in the DeFi sector.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto mining company Hive Blockchain Technologies has unveiled its new brand identity, Hive Digital Technologies, representing a strategic shift towards artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Canadian firm aims to leverage its vast Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) fleet to tap into burgeoning opportunities in AI and cloud computing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">An Evolved Focus</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a statement issued on July 12, Hive Digital revealed that the updated brand better represents the company's current focus. In the burgeoning era of GPU cloud technology, Hive is poised to expand its Nvidia GPU-oriented revenue channels while also contributing to AI advancements that propel the new Web3 ecosystem.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're excited to announce that today we officially changed our name to 𝗛𝗜𝗩𝗘 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀. The name better reflects our evolving focus on cloud compute technology, AI and the Web3 ecosystem.Read the press release: https://t.co/yczuLivGq6 pic.twitter.com/5jijZFqdeI</p>
&mdash; HIVE Digital Technologies (@HIVEDigitalTech) July 12, 2023

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Hive's CEO Aydin Kilic, the company plans to grow its cloud hosting business using its extensive GPU fleet, recognising the growing demand driven by AI and machine learning applications. In addition to crypto mining, Hive will offer rental services of GPU server clusters and introduce a new service, HIVE Cloud. The service targets small and medium-sized businesses, offering them an efficient and cost-effective alternative to major cloud service providers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">From Crypto Mining to AI Cloud Services</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Established in 2017, Hive has been a pioneer in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Despite maintaining a strong presence in Bitcoin mining, the company sees tremendous potential in leveraging its 38,000 Nvidia GPU fleet for large-scale computational tasks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Hive has been using these high-performance GPUs to mine Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. However, since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022, reducing the profitability of mining, the company has been exploring other revenue streams for its GPUs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Hive's rebranding comes as several mining companies pivot from their original blockchain-focused models. Earlier this year, Riot Blockchain, a Bitcoin mining firm, rebranded to Riot Platforms to reflect its diversified business operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Projected Market Impact</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In an official press release, Hive's Executive Chairman, Frank Holmes, expressed optimism for the AI sector's potential, highlighting large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a driving factor. According to Holmes, the high-margin business opportunity with their Nvidia GPU cards could generate over $100,000,000 in annual revenues.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ripple has come out victorious over the SEC, triggering a market surge not seen in a long time. The momentous win sees XRP become the first crypto with regulatory clarity and may be the catalyst to end the ongoing crypto winter. </p>
<p>July 13, 2023, becomes a date that many investors and people interested in the crypto market will remember.</p>
<p>Judge Analise Torres of the Southern District of New York handed a partial win over to Ripple Labs after its three-year-long battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
Crypto Industry Gets a Win Amid Regulatory Crusades
<p>Per the ruling issued by Judge Torres, Ripple&rsquo;s native $XRP token is &ldquo;not necessarily a security on its face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision declared that Ripple&rsquo;s XRP sales on public crypto exchanges were not offers of securities because buyers did not have a reasonable expectation of profit tied to Ripple&rsquo;s efforts, Reuters reports. &nbsp;In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, alleging it violated US securities laws leading many exchanges, such as Coinbase and Kraken, to delist XRP.</p>
<p>Judge Torres&rsquo; ruling sets a precedent for crypto regulation leading to a shift in market momentum.</p>
<p>Shortly after the decision was made public, Bitcoin and altcoins surged to highs after what seemed to be a never-ending market slump after the FTX collapse.</p>
<p>Bitcoin reached a one-year high, up more than 90% for the year and almost 30% in the past month.</p>
<p>XRP, which may now be legally sold on public cryptocurrency exchanges, skyrocketed over 70% over the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP was trading at $0.78 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>2023 has been plagued by a string of regulatory attacks on the industry, mostly from the SEC.</p>
<p>The agency recently sued crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase and labelled several cryptocurrencies as securities and trading platforms, such as Robinhood, to delist the tokens.</p>
<p>The SEC further took issue with recent Bitcoin spot ETF applications.</p>
<p>The crypto market has largely fallen victim to negative press, leading to declining consumer confidence. Ripple&rsquo;s win, however, may garner some positive momentum in the industry.</p>
<p>Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone brokerage in Melbourne, commented in an article published by Reuters:</p>

<p>We'd gone through this long period of just consistently negative news to make the space look pretty grimy.</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, it's been consistently positive news coming though and that means you've got momentum.</p>

<p>The crypto market has largely fallen victim to negative press, leading to declining consumer confidence. Ripple&rsquo;s win, however, may garner some positive momentum in the industry.</p>
<p>Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone brokerage in Melbourne, commented in an article published by Reuters:</p>

<p>We'd gone through this long period of just consistently negative news to make the space look pretty grimy.</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, it's been consistently positive news coming though and that means you've got momentum.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">OKX, with its OKB token, has been one of the dominant crypto exchanges out there. Now, this dominance is in question, thanks to newcomers like Tradecurve.</p>
<p class="s5">Tradecurve is an upcoming hybrid crypto exchange on a path toward becoming a challenger to established platforms. Its innovative features could change the way people access crypto and derivative markets globally.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">The Recent Performance of OKB</p>
<p class="s5">The OKB cryptocurrency runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It is used as a utility token that offers various perks for those that use the exchange. OKX traders can get discounts and access to token offerings or earn interest on their savings.</p>
<p class="s5">As of July 6, 2023, OKB trades at $42.76. During the past week, OKB saw its low point at $42.79, with its high point of value at $45.95.</p>
<p class="s5">Within the past 30 days, however, OKB has been down in value by 4.9%. In the past week, it's been down by 1.2%. Since the past year, however, OKB is still up in value by 242.1%, indicating that this short-term decline might just be temporary.</p>
<p class="s5">Investors and traders that are looking for better returns than those seen with OKB, and are now moving towards Tradecurve.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s9">Tradecurve and Its Price Outlook Compared to OKB</p>
<p class="s5">Tradecurve is a platform that combines the best elements of CEXs and DEXs to bring a truly innovative and open experience. For one, anyone globally can deposit with crypto and use that crypto as collateral when trading any derivative. This way, it opens markets that might have been otherwise restricted.</p>

<p>This is why TRCV has seen a surge in value by 80% during the past month.</p>
<p class="s5">TCRV, the utility token used for governance, getting passive income through staking, and discounts on subscription fees,Users can also engage in algorithmic trading, where they can subscribe to AI-trading bots that will enable them to make quick automated trades based on predefined strategies, where market conditions are analyzed swiftly and efficiently to create the best and most optimized portfolio.</p>
<p class="s5">In addition to all of this, newcomers can get access to a dedicated Trading Academy and negative balance protection, and the exchange will implement a VIP account system. TCRV trades at just $0.018 during Stage 4, and at its next stage, a 40% jump is anticipated.</p>
<p class="s5">The team will also list TCRV on Tier-1 exchanges and on the Uniswap DEX, alongside CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, for better price tracking. In addition, they will foster transparency by implementing Proof of Reserves (PoR).</p>
<p class="s5">With all of these aspects in mind, analysts are predicting that Tradecurve (TCRV) can surge in value by 100x at launch, and it has already captured the attention of a lot of traders, as 12,500 users signed up, and the team has raised $2.8 million so far.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After a significant downturn in the crypto market, it appears that in the first half of 2023, the venture investment market, much like the price of Bitcoin, has found its bottom. But unlike the BTC price, the recovery trend in fundraising has not been observed yet; the raised amount fell by 87% in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022.</p>
<p>A total of $5.1B was raised across 619 funding rounds in the first half of 2023. Improved market sentiment has not had a significant impact on fee growth. Historical data shows that the total fees figure often lags behind the Bitcoin price by several months.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Highlights</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Service, СeFi, and Infrastructure startups received the highest amount of funding.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The largest crypto raise was by Stripe, which closed a $6.5B funding round in March</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Vitalik Buterin, Jack Dorsey, and Sam Altman were prominent investors in the funding rounds.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In the first half of the year, Blockchain Service emerged as the dominant category in the fundraising market, capturing a significant 38% of total investments. Interestingly, there has been a notable decline in venture capital&rsquo;s interest in DeFi, which now accounts for only 9% of the overall funding.&nbsp;</p>
Blockchain service projects are leading the way, largely due to the growing adoption of Web3 technologies. They serve as the main connection between users and blockchain, bridging the gap between web2 and web3 and making the experience of using decentralized networks more convenient. Among blockchain service projects raising money in 2023, Ledger, a crypto wallet developer, and EigenLayer, a liquid staking derivatives restocking platform, are noteworthy.
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VCs continue to prioritize early-stage rounds, with pre-seed and seed rounds accumulating a total of over 1 billion USD in funding.</p>
<p>In contrast, in later stages such as Series A, B, C, and D, the number of successfully closed rounds tends to decline. Meanwhile, the average amount raised per round is significantly higher at later stages of fundraising.</p>
<p>However, with the expansion of the crypto market and the emergence of high-quality projects, we can anticipate a potential shift towards increased funding in post-seed rounds.</p>
Trending Categories in Crypto Fundraising
<p>A detailed analysis of the category reveals that the position of DeFi projects in terms of fundraising is not as weak as it may appear. While DeFi projects are not leading in terms of fundraising, they are in second place in terms of the number of funding rounds.</p>
<p>In contrast, Blockchain Infrastructure projects have the opposite pattern. These projects are second in terms of fundraising per month, but they have one of the smallest numbers of funding rounds. Infrastructure projects often have the largest funding rounds, but they occur quite rarely.</p>
<p></p>
Let's take a look at the most popular categories among the most active investors. The chart below not only displays the most active investors but also allows us to assess the prioritized sectors for each fund. Coinbase Ventures and Circle prioritize investing in DeFi, while Polygon Fund and a16z Crypto prioritize GameFi.
<p>Most of the most active investors primarily invest in blockchain service and DeFi projects. However, for some, GameFi is an important area of focus, as they are quick to adopt and allow them to build an entertainment ecosystem, such as Animoca Brands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notable Funding Rounds of 2023</p>
<p>Currently, most projects are raising small amounts. Nearly half of all rounds with a known raised amount were in the range of $1 million to $5 million.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investors are still hesitant to invest significant amounts in crypto startups, as evidenced by the top 10 largest fundraising rounds of the first half of 2023. The top three projects in terms of fundraising are only partially integrated into web3 and blockchain, relying mostly on web2 technologies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Apart from Stripe, other notable investments in the top funding rounds include a digital exchange eToro, and character.ai, backed by prominent investors such as a16z and Elad Gil. These strategic investments highlight the diverse range of opportunities and the growing interest in innovative platforms and AI-driven technologies within the investment landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Among the key figures in the crypto during the first half of the year were notable individuals such as Vitalik Buterin and Jack Dorsey. These influential figures have actively participated in funding rounds, demonstrating their belief in the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Additionally, seasoned venture capitalists like Tim Draper have also joined the fray, making strategic investments in projects like EtherMail.</p>
The Bottom Line
<p>The first half of 2022 witnessed a weak outcome in raising funds from private investors in cryptocurrency startups. This is evident from the significant drop in raises during Q2, reaching the lowest level of funds raised since the end of 2020. Many investors who were highly active in 2021-2022 have now considerably reduced their investments in Web3.</p>
<p>However, can we expect a trend reversal? The answer is unequivocal: yes. With the emergence of new trends, further market recovery, and better regulation standards, many investors will return to the market, and we should also expect an influx of new investors.</p>
<p>As the year progresses, it will be fascinating to observe how these developments shape the future of the industry and pave the way for new innovations and collaborations.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Profit-Taking After 31803:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 15 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) aimed to retain recent modest gains early in the Asian session as the pair encountered buying pressure around the 31083.40 level during a pullback, representing the 76.4% retracement of the depreciating range from 31525.10 to 29715.87.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trading activity continues to orbit the 31209.91 area, right around the 23.6% retracement of a recent appreciating range from 30189.56 to 31525.10.&nbsp; &nbsp;BTC/USD recently traded as high as the 31803.38 area before ceding some recent gains, its strongest print since June 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;Upside price objectives include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent trading activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 31355, 31042, 30789, 30535, 30222, 30175, 30138, 29108, 28275, 27443, 26413, and 26257 levels. &nbsp;Upside price objectives related to historical buying activity include the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460. &nbsp;Downside price objectives related to recent selling pressure include the 29849 and 29331 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30552.59 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30829.37.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The landscape of crypto exchanges was anything but calm, as revealed by TokenInsight's Q2 2023 Crypto Exchange Report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, kept its cool around the $30,000 mark, the world of crypto exchanges was buzzing like a beehive.&nbsp;</p>
Big four exchanges still dominate
<p>The Q2 2023 Crypto Exchange Report from TokenInsight gives a peek into this hive. The top 10 exchanges saw a trading volume of $8.3 trillion in Q2, which is a 23% slide down the hill from the previous quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this downhill ride, the big four - Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Bitget - held their ground, accounting for a hefty 85% of the total market. Even with a 3% dip in market share, Binance still holds sway with over 50% of the total trading volume.&nbsp;</p>
Binance still commands the market
<p>The report also highlighted shifts in market share. Binance saw a slight decrease in its dominance, but it still held a commanding lead with over half the market share. Meanwhile, exchanges like OKX, Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, and Huobi saw their market shares rise. On the flip side, Upbit and Coinbase saw a slight dip.&nbsp;</p>
Spot trading
<p>In the area of spot trading, the top 10 exchanges had a volume of $1.3 trillion in Q2, which resulted in a 45% decrease from Q1. Binance continued its dominance of the spot market, with a 55.33% market share. Bitget and Bybit made significant strides, increasing their market shares, while Upbit took a hit due to regulatory changes in South Korea.&nbsp;</p>
Derivatives
<p>The derivatives market held up a bit better, with a 14.6% decrease from Q1 and a 50.7% decrease from Q2 2022. Binance kept hold of a large part of the derivatives niche with a 54% market share, followed by OKX with 18%.&nbsp;</p>
Exchange tokens
<p>Lastly, the report gave some insights into the performance of exchange tokens. Bitget's $BGB led the way with a 22.6% price increase in Q2. Bitfinex's $LEO wasn't far behind, with a 15.4% increase. $OKB of OKX also had a good run, with a 7.1% increase.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The transactions per second on the Etheruem blockchain will receive a significant boost now that Starknet&rsquo;s Quantum Leap upgrade has been deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
Ethereum TPS To Scale Up&nbsp;
<p>In a groundbreaking development for the Ethereum blockchain, the scaling barrier has been shattered, according to an announcement by Uri Kolodny, co-founder and CEO of StarkWare. Kolodny expressed his excitement, stating that the implementation of the new upgrade has finally made high transactions per second (TPS) a reality on the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
<p>Starknet, which is a Layer-2 blockchain or &ldquo;rollup&rdquo; to the Ethereum blockchain, was created by the Starkware team to allow Ethereum to scale securely. Originally aiming for a potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, the StarkWare team was pleasantly surprised by the results of the stress test.&nbsp;</p>
Quantum Leap Exceeds Expectations
<p>Kolodny revealed that they had expected a few dozen TPS at this early stage, but the actual figure far surpassed their expectations, reaching a consistent 37 TPS. Moreover, during peak moments, the transfer transactions per second approached the impressive figure of 100.</p>
<p>Kolodny said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We said this upgrade would deliver potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, and only hoped from the stress test to check we&rsquo;re on target. A few dozen TPS at this early point would have left us excited &ndash; but we got more than we bargained for.&rdquo;</p>

Last Week&rsquo;s Testnet Run Big Success
<p>The team had previously deployed the Quantum Leap on the Goerli testnet on July 5, followed by a community vote in which 97.91% of voters agreed to push forward to the mainnet as it demonstrated speeds higher than the team&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anticipating a "time to inclusion" of approximately 15 seconds, the team was amazed to discover that the vast majority of transactions were confirmed in under 10 seconds. This achievement meant that decentralized applications (dApps) could validate on-chain transactions within seconds, significantly enhancing the speed and efficiency of the Ethereum network.</p>
Short-Term And Long-Term Benefits
<p>Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder and president of StarkWare, described the impact of this breakthrough as granting the community a "supercharged power tool." This newfound capability empowers developers to create projects that were previously unattainable, opening doors to innovative and transformative applications.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the more immediate and long-term benefits of this achievement, stating that in the short term, DeFi will benefit from increased speed and smoother user experiences. On-chain gaming will become more seamless, enhancing the overall gameplay and user engagement. Looking ahead, the long-term effects of this development are expected to reshape how we interact with technology and each other, giving rise to new and creative projects.</p>
<p>The achievement of smashing the scaling ceiling represents a significant milestone for the Ethereum blockchain, signaling its readiness to handle increased transaction volumes and support a wide range of decentralized applications. As the network evolves, the potential for further innovation and growth becomes even more promising.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman&rsquo;s Worldcoin has surpassed 2 million sign-ups for its World ID program in half the time it took to reach the first million sign-ups.&nbsp;</p>
Multi-City Tour Rakes In Sign-Ups
<p>Digital identity verification provider, Worldcoin, has achieved a significant milestone in its mission to provide a global identity protocol. The project recently surpassed 2 million sign-ups for its World ID during the beta phase, accomplishing this feat in less than half the time it took to reach the first million.</p>
<p>The company announced the news via a blog on July 13 that it received a record number of signups from different parts of the world like Barcelona, Berlin, Buenos Aires, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo, which it credited to its multi-city tour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the statement also revealed that an impressive average of over 40,000 people joined the World ID system weekly, demonstrating the widespread interest and support for this privacy-preserving digital identity solution.</p>
World ID Thanks Supporters
<p>The Worldcoin community has expressed its gratitude to the builders, integration and composability partners, and the individuals who continuously verify their World IDs.</p>
<p>They wrote,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you to everyone who made this milestone possible, from the builders to the integration and composability partners to the individuals verifying their World ID every day. Achieving 2 million World ID sign-ups is more than just an accomplishment for the Worldcoin community; it&rsquo;s also a significant milestone in the broader global effort to make digitally-verifiable identity more accessible to everyone.&rdquo;</p>

Growing Demand For World ID
<p>For billions of people without the means of digitally verifiable identification, the World IDs promise a globally recognized digital identification system wherein users can store their identity information on their mobile devices, safely secured by employing zk-proofs.</p>
<p>To enroll in the World ID program and obtain a digital identification document, individuals are required to visit a specialized device called an Orb, through which they can scan one of their irises. This process generates a distinct cryptographic representation referred to as an "IrisHash," which serves to authenticate the individual's uniqueness. Notably, participants who successfully upload their sensitive biometric data are compensated for their participation in the form of a proprietary digital currency known as Worldcoin.</p>
<p>To meet the growing demand for verified World IDs, Worldcoin plans to significantly increase the availability of Orbs in the coming months. More information regarding the timing and locations of new Orbs will be shared in due course, ensuring a wider reach for this innovative technology.</p>

Stage 1 is now set to imminently sell out, with under 23% of tokens left before the price increases by 10%.</p><p>The rise is driven by the unique premise of the platform, which offers completely decentralized betting, allowing users to &lsquo;become the house&rsquo; and create their own odds. As well as the presence of the two founders, Adam and Paul Kelbie, who are fast becoming favorites in the blockchain community.</p>Adam Kelbie, CEO of Chancer, said &ldquo;I am delighted with the engagement we&rsquo;re seeing in the ever-growing Chancer community, as well as the raise - but not completely surprised to be honest!

These odds are stacked against bettors from the get-go. Additionally, these bookies often allow people to only bet on sports or mainstream events.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s where Chancer is different. As a decentralized platform, users place bets among themselves, allowing for a fully peer-to-peer betting experience. Users can wager small bets among friends, or participate in viral bets regarding global events such as the World Cup Final, the Oscars, or even the US presidential elections.

As more and more users flock to Chancer, the greater the opportunity to disrupt the betting industry, which was worth more than $63 billion in 2022 and is set to skyrocket to over $150 billion by 2030, CHANCER&rsquo;s price could also benefit from increased adoption and a spreading global reach.</p><p>Chancer is also CertiK audited, which only goes to reinforce the faith in the project, given that the team has been fully KYC&rsquo;d and given the stamp of authenticity many will expect from a development roadmap with such substantial scope.</p><p>Unveiling the Remarkable Success of Chancer's Raise</p><p>With real use cases and a platform that works in favor of those using it, it&rsquo;s easy to see why Chancer has managed to raise $750,000 in such a short period of time.

It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many coins a user has &mdash; so long as he has some CHANCER in his wallet, he's in it to win it.</p><p>Upcoming Developments and Expectations for Chancer</p><p>Chancer is still in its presale, presenting a potentially interesting prospect to those exploring new projects in 2023.</p><p>Chancer's current fundraising objective stands at $15 million. Considering the swift achievement of the initial $750,000, the company anticipates a smooth journey toward reaching its target.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s pronouncement by the SDNY judge that XRP can only be partially classed as a security led to a huge rise in cryptocurrencies.</p>
SEC loses millions of taxpayer dollars
<p>After a 3-year long court battle and millions of US taxpayer dollars spent on fighting the case by the SEC the judge has mainly come down on the side of Ripple, which also spent more than $200 million on legal costs.</p>
<p>As the judgement is digested across the crypto sector, the ramifications of this ruling can potentially be massive for other crypto companies that are in dispute with the SEC, although there is still the possibility that the US securities regulator may decide to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>the crypto market literally exploded</p>

$XRP explodes
<p>Be that as it may, when the news broke on Thursday afternoon the crypto market literally exploded. $XRP, the native token of Ripple, went on a vertical trajectory that took it as far as 97% up on the day. It has since fallen back to resistance at $0.78 which it will now likely turn into support.</p>
<p>Those long on bitcoin used the market surge to propel the king of the cryptos past $31,000, which it looks to have turned into support, potentially giving it the platform to drive up from this level, one that has kept bitcoin from rising higher since April.</p>
<p>Now that this level could be about to be broken and flipped into support, bitcoin could act like a beachball that has been kept under water and finally been released. An upsurge to $37,000 and even potentially $45,000 could be next.</p>
Solana makes hay
<p>Plenty of other cryptocurrencies made hay while the Ripple/$XRP sun shone. Among these, the most notable was Solana ($SOL). Between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning $SOL rose almost 50%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A high of $32 was reached before the lightning fast layer 1 settled back down to around $29.40 at time of going to press. Once past $30 again, the next resistance is at $38.70. Now that things appear so much more positive for tokens that have been deemed securities by the SEC, such as $SOL, the shackles are now well and truly off and true growth can happen.</p>
Altcoins embark on bull market
<p>The Total 3 market cap (all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum) shot up like a rocket on Thursday, driving through the top of a downwards channel it has been following since mid 2022. The price has come back to test the top of this channel, and should it hold above, it&rsquo;s onwards and upwards for the altcoins in what can become the early stages of the next crypto bull market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most oft-cited motivations behind the creation of Ethereum was the desire to introduce programmatic functions that weren&rsquo;t possible on Bitcoin. In simple language, Vitalik Buterin and his fellow co-founders of Ethereum wanted the blockchain to be able to do things other than just send payments, which was Bitcoin&rsquo;s primary and only use-case at the time.</p>
<p>Fast forward eight years, and now Bitcoin is able to do all kinds of things that it couldn&rsquo;t before. Some projects have made Bitcoin compatible with smart contracts, enabling it to be used with the plethora of dApps in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, and even allowing NFTs known as &lsquo;Ordinals&rsquo; to be created on Bitcoin for the first time.</p>
Enter Ordinals - Bitcoin&rsquo;s Own NFTs
<p>The success of Ordinals - which inscribe immutable data, such as texts, images and audio - onto a satoshi (the smallest unit of BTC) has been immense. Upon launch they clogged up the Bitcoin blockchain, causing exchanges such as Binance to temporarily halt withdrawals and bringing the Bitcoin network to a grinding halt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact of Ordinals was also felt off the blockchain. The idea of using the Bitcoin blockchain to create what is essentially an NFT (Ordinals share the same characteristics of immutability and non-fungibility) caused a rift between developers in the Bitcoin space. Bitcoin was supposed to be a payment network, said one faction. While others lauded this newfound ability to have the same kind of functionality, customization options, and value creation that they&rsquo;d seen in the Ethereum ecosystem for years.</p>
<p>While developers continue to debate the merits of Ordinals, users in the crypto space have apparently embraced them with open arms. Bitcoin Ordinals trading volume rose by an astonishing 2,834% leading into Q2 of 2023, climbing to $210.7 million. More than half a million trades were executed by over 150,000 unique traders, according to the latest data by DappRadar.</p>
Overtaking Ethereum
<p>That flurry of activity led to Ordinals overtaking Ethereum NFTs in terms of trade volume. The top two NFT collections with the highest sales are Bitcoin Ordinals, according to data from CryptoSlam. Their combined sales of $27.2 million in the past 24 hours completely dwarf the nearest Ethereum NFT in third place, which recorded just $1.59 million worth of sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some have suggested that Bitcoin is currently in the process of flipping Ethereum when it comes to being the main home of NFTs in the crypto space based on the numbers above. However, the true impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin is much more far-reaching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the author of the Ethereum white-paper, Vitalik Buterin, stated in regard to the Ordinals debate: &ldquo;Ordinals are starting to bring back a culture of actually doing things. It feels like there's real pushback to the laser-eye movement, which is good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laser-eye movement refers to those who view Bitcoin purely as a payment system, and base their hopes of future profits on its adoption as a global payment rail. One of the main gripes many &lsquo;laser-eye&rsquo; loyalists have had with Ordinals is their tendency to take up space on the Bitcoin blockchain that could have been used for payments.&nbsp;</p>
Building an Ecosystem Around Ordinals
<p>But the spirit of innovation fostered by the creation of Ordinals hasn&rsquo;t stopped. Several ventures are under way that aim to refine the Ordinals landscape. One group of developers are trying to introduce a new BTC token standard&nbsp; - BRC-69 - aims to radically reduce the cost of minting and sending Ordinals, moving Ordinals away from the current BRC-20 standard on which they are based.</p>
<p>Others are attempting to build a community mentality around the newfound Bitcoin NFTs, and kickstart an ecosystem of development that can put Bitcoin on a level with Ethereum in regards to its decentralized finance capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A collection of some of the smartest minds in the blockchain space have come together to form The Ordinal Council, a group of builders, developers and executives who share the common goal of building out the Bitcoin ecosystem around Ordinals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ordinal Council is in the process of launching the first Bitcoin DAO to support grassroots talent and builders around Ordinals and BRC-20, and will form a Bitcoin incubator to help develop a raft of innovative use-cases on Bitcoin, such as gaming, metaverse, GameFi and DeFi projects &mdash; few of which have been possible on Bitcoin until now.</p>
<p>The Council is set to unveil the first launchpad on Bitcoin - ToshiPad - in the next few weeks, and is in the process of executing its &lsquo;Yellow Collection&rsquo; PFP drop, which aims to bring more users into what is already a burgeoning BRC-20 ecosystem.</p>
<p>After years of inactivity, all it took was one little satoshi with something inscribed on it to kickstart a maelstrom of innovation and development on Bitcoin, and it&rsquo;s turning the crypto space upside down.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Europe&rsquo;s highly anticipated and long-delayed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is finally set to debut later this year amidst huge anticipation surrounding its imminent arrival.</p>
<p>The launch comes at a time when anticipation in the United States for a spot Bitcoin ETF is building following BlackRock&rsquo;s filing.</p>
A Long Delay
<p>The Bitcoin ETF, filed by the London-based multi-asset investment platform Jacobi Asset Management, was originally set to debut on the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange in July 2022. However, the launch was delayed due to unprecedented market conditions triggered by the spectacular collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May and the collapse of FTX in November. Both events created turmoil in the markets, forcing Jacobi Asset Management to delay the listing. The ETF had received approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) to launch as far back as October 2021.</p>
<p>The delay in launch has only served to heighten market expectations as investors eagerly await an avenue to tap into the Bitcoin market with the security of an ETF structure. Many believe the launch of a European ETF could usher in a new era for Bitcoin in European markets. The spot Bitcoin ETF will allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset.</p>
A Shift In Demand
<p>The multi-asset investment platform explained that it had decided to launch the spot Bitcoin ETF now because of a gradual shift in demand compared to 2022. Additionally, it added that it is still assessing its launch strategy and would be announcing a launch date soon. The Jacobi spot Bitcoin ETF is a centrally cleared, crypto-backed financial instrument, the custody of which is supported by Fidelity Digital Assets.</p>
<p>The ETF marks a significant shift away from exchange-traded notes (ETNs). Europe has typically structured all crypto-backed financial instruments as exchange-traded notes rather than funds. The key difference between exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded funds is that ETN investors own debt security, while ETF shareholders own a part of the fund&rsquo;s underlying assets.</p>
Gensler And SEC Look To Play Spoilsport
<p>While European markets are readying themselves for the region&rsquo;s first spot Bitcoin ETF, the United States is lagging far behind. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far rejected all spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, US markets have registered a surge of interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs following BlackRock&rsquo;s recent filing. BlackRock is arguably one of the biggest asset management firms in the world, and its filing could indicate a shift in sentiment and perception of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In fact, 2023 has seen some of the biggest institutional giants, including Fidelity, file fresh spot Bitcoin ETF applications as the race to become the first US-approved spot Bitcoin ETF gathers steam. The Securities and Exchange Commission had already approved Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021.</p>
<p>US markets were optimistic following the BlackRock filing, the Securities and Exchange Commission under Gary Gensler has decided to toe an all too familiar line by rejecting all ETF filings. According to the SEC, the spot Bitcoin filings were inadequate, hence the rejection. However, BlackRock has refiled its application for its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund. According to the new submission, Nasdaq has entered into a surveillance-share agreement with Coinbase, which addresses one of the main objections raised by the SEC.</p>
<p>Following BlackRock&rsquo;s amendments, other firms such as Fidelity, WisdomTree, and Invesco will also be updating their ETF filings.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Tel Aviv, israel, July 14th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Spacemesh is proud to announce today, that after five years of work, they will at long last be performing network genesis on July the 14th at 08.00 UTC.</p><p>Spacemesh chose the date of July 14th, which commemorates the storming of the Bastille, as the day to launch the People's Coin. The goal is to establish a cryptocurrency that can achieve widespread distribution, particularly among younger generations and underprivileged demographics who are currently unable to participate in the cryptocurrency revolution due to insurmountable barriers to entry</p><p></p>Spacemesh, The People&rsquo;s Coin, is born today.<p>Spacemesh&rsquo;s team of cryptographers, led by Prof. Tal Moran, spent over 5 years building a radically novel way to achieve consensus in the permissionless setting from scratch.</p><ul><li>Instead of the commonly-used PoW or PoStake, Spacemesh uses PoST (Proof of Space-Time)</li><li>Rather than a Chain topology (i.e., a blockchain), Spacemesh uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), a.k.a. a &ldquo;mesh&rdquo;</li><li>Additionally, rather than the winner-takes-all paradigm via Lottery (&ldquo;Competitive Mining&rdquo;) used by all Nakamoto-based consensus protocols, Spacemesh uses lottery-free, non-competitive &ldquo;leaderless&rdquo; voting (&ldquo;Collaborative Mining&rdquo;)</li><li>Lastly, instead of generating a new proof for every challenge, which is energy intensive, Spacemesh miners reuse the original proof continually&mdash;resulting in extremely low energy use and near-zero ongoing costs for operating a miner</li></ul><p>The Spacemesh protocol ensures fairness for smaller home miners by rewarding them based on their storage commitment size during each epoch, which occurs approximately every two weeks. This prevents powerful miners, including adversarial ones, from receiving a disproportionate share of rewards. Spacemesh also has significantly lower barriers to entry compared to other permissionless cryptocurrencies. To become a miner (smesher), all that is required is a PC with available storage space, any GPU with OpenCL support, and a reliable internet connection.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tel Aviv, israel, July 14th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Spacemesh is proud to announce today, that after five years of work, they will at long last be performing network genesis on July the 14th at 08.00 UTC.</p><p>Spacemesh chose the date of July 14th, which commemorates the storming of the Bastille, as the day to launch the People's Coin. The goal is to establish a cryptocurrency that can achieve widespread distribution, particularly among younger generations and underprivileged demographics who are currently unable to participate in the cryptocurrency revolution due to insurmountable barriers to entry</p><p></p>Spacemesh, The People&rsquo;s Coin, is born today.<p>Spacemesh&rsquo;s team of cryptographers, led by Prof. Tal Moran, spent over 5 years building a radically novel way to achieve consensus in the permissionless setting from scratch.</p><ul><li>Instead of the commonly-used PoW or PoStake, Spacemesh uses PoST (Proof of Space-Time)</li><li>Rather than a Chain topology (i.e., a blockchain), Spacemesh uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), a.k.a. a &ldquo;mesh&rdquo;</li><li>Additionally, rather than the winner-takes-all paradigm via Lottery (&ldquo;Competitive Mining&rdquo;) used by all Nakamoto-based consensus protocols, Spacemesh uses lottery-free, non-competitive &ldquo;leaderless&rdquo; voting (&ldquo;Collaborative Mining&rdquo;)</li><li>Lastly, instead of generating a new proof for every challenge, which is energy intensive, Spacemesh miners reuse the original proof continually&mdash;resulting in extremely low energy use and near-zero ongoing costs for operating a miner</li></ul><p>The Spacemesh protocol ensures fairness for smaller home miners by rewarding them based on their storage commitment size during each epoch, which occurs approximately every two weeks. This prevents powerful miners, including adversarial ones, from receiving a disproportionate share of rewards. Spacemesh also has significantly lower barriers to entry compared to other permissionless cryptocurrencies. To become a miner (smesher), all that is required is a PC with available storage space, any GPU with OpenCL support, and a reliable internet connection. Specialized mining equipment is unnecessary, and ongoing power usage is low, resulting in minimal electricity bills. Additionally, there is no need for deposits, bank accounts, or credit cards.</p><p>The combination of low entry barriers, low operational costs, and incentive compatibility, establishes a novel guarantee of fair distribution.</p><p>Once a miner joins the network by committing the minimum required storage, they become an active participant and receive a fair share of rewards during each epoch.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&rsquo;s XRP skyrocketed by ~70% over the past 24 hours after its landmark win over the SEC. As a result of the victory, several exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini have said that they are exploring options to relist XRP.</p>
End of a long battle
<p>The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its legal battle between Ripple Labs and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As per the ruling issued by Judge Analisa Torres on July 13, 2023, Ripple's XRP token is "not necessarily a security on its face."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court separated Ripple's XRP sales into three categories: institutional sales, programmatic sales, and "other distributions," such as employee compensation. While the court ruled in favor of the SEC regarding XRP&rsquo;s institutional sales, Ripple won when it came to programmatic sales and &ldquo;other distributions.&rdquo; This distinction was based on the premise that institutional investors tend to have more behind-the-scenes knowledge about token activity as compared to retail investors.</p>
<p>The ruling brought an end to SEC&rsquo;s 3-year-long crusade against Ripple. Back in 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of the US securities laws. Following the lawsuit, several exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken were forced to delist XRP to avoid facing the regulator&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the SEC has the option to appeal and potentially reverse the court&rsquo;s decisions down the line.</p>
#RelistXRP Frenzy Begins
<p>Following this monumental decision, several exchanges have announced that they will ve relisting XRP. Coinbase tweeted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coinbase will re-enable trading for XRP (XRP) on the XRP network. Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset remain available on @Coinbase &amp; @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. Trading is anticipated to begin later today, if liquidity conditions are met. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our XRP-USD, XRP-USDT and XRP-EUR trading pairs will launch in phases. Support for XRP may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemini:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given today's ruling that the sale of XRP on exchanges is not a security, @Gemini is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bitstamp:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome back $XRP! 🚀 XRP trading is available in the U.S now for our U.S customers. You can once again buy, sell, or trade XRP on Bitstamp USA. 🫡&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Meme coins have a robust reputation for their potential to deliver huge returns on investment over a short period of time. Meme coin lovers are attracted by projects that could experience exponential growth, leading to high returns overnight. However, finding the right projects is not such an easy task, especially as more and more coins appear on the market each day.</p>
<p class="s5">To help you out, we&rsquo;ve done the research on your behalf and we discovered the best altcoins to buy with huge potential for growth in the next period. Here are the 5 crypto picks for 100x returns that currently generate hype and attention within the community: DigiToads (TOADS), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Monacoin (MONA).</p>
<p>DigiToads</p>
<p class="s5">DigiToads is one of the few presales this year that have generated huge buzz in the media. However, TOADS is more than a simple meme coin. In fact, this coin departs from the purely speculative business model and puts forward a robust ecosystem with plenty of opportunities to generate returns both actively and passively.</p>
<p class="s5">DigiToads combines a play-to-earn gaming universe with a stake-to-earn rare feature. These core elements attract gaming enthusiasts, who get to play with digital toads in an immersive world to earn TOADS in gaming competitions, but also long-term investors, who can buy TOADS and use them to purchase and stake trending NFTs in return for regular passive income.</p>
<p class="s5">Perhaps another crucial aspect is the deflationary nature of the TOADS ERC20 coins. This leads to the scarcity effect, unlike other inflationary coins, which means that TOADS holders do not only stand to benefit from value appreciation but also enjoy the potential for long-term passive returns.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s11">FLOKI</p>
<p class="s5">FLOKI started out as a joke coin, but the dev team decided to expand into key areas like decentralized finance, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Despite being relatively new, just like TOADS, FLOKI is expected by experts to deliver significant growth and success in the next year.</p>
<p class="s5">The crypto project differentiates itself from other meme coins. Just like TOADS, it focuses on real-life use cases, which are expected to keep generating demand for the token.</p>
<p class="s11">Shiba Inu</p>
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu has been at the top of the list for quite some time now. Despite some bumps down the road this year, SHIB is still expected to live up to its reputation. The purpose of SHIB is to become one of the main decentralized cryptocurrencies that focus on a fun community of users.</p>
<p class="s11">Dogecoin </p>
<p class="s5">Dogecoin&rsquo;s cultural appeal has remained unaltered thanks to its lighthearted origin. Just like SHIB, a key driver for growth for this meme coin is the internet meme that has created a strong community. Also, DOGE has enjoyed multiple celebrity endorsements, with figures prominent in business, entertainment, and crypto industries offering attention to this meme coin.</p>
<p class="s11">Monacoin</p>
<p class="s5">Monacoin first appeared in Japan and garnered attention after appearing on a Japanese TV network, where land was purchased using MONA. Monacoin is essentially a payment network that facilitates P2P transactions.</p>
<p class="s5">One of the earliest meme coins, Monacoin enjoys a huge appeal, particularly in the Japanese crypto community. In addition to this, while some meme coins lack utility, MONA is used for multiple purposes, including tipping, donations, or as a means of exchange.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s11">Summary</p>
<p class="s5">The rise of meme coins has taken many by surprise. Among the top contenders, DigiToadsstands out for its unique approach that combines play-to-earn gaming and a stake-to-earn mechanism with multiple community contests and awards.</p>
<p class="s5">As the meme coin landscape evolves, investors and traders are becoming more discerning than ever. The meme coin market offers huge potential for excitement, adrenaline, and gains, but it&rsquo;s important to focus on projects like DigiToads with robust growth potential and a solid foundation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Multichain (MULTI) may become only three years old this July, but crypto analysts predict profitable growth for Multichain (MULTI) in the coming years. </p>
<p>This article explores Multichain&rsquo;s (MULTI) unique features while exploring a new token, Uwerx, and learning about its exploding presale. </p>
Multichain (MULTI): The Ultimate Web3 Router
<p>Multichain (MULTI) is predicted to become the main router for Web3 soon. Multichain (MULTI) was launched in 2020 on the 20th of July to provide solutions for various blockchains, especially regarding their communication needs. </p>
<p>With &nbsp;Mulltichain (MULTI), every blockchain has its community, unique services, and development ecosystem. </p>
<p>Multichain (MULTI) is selling at $4.33 and is predicted to reach $7.42 by 2024 if its community grows at the current pace.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): ​The Freelancers&rsquo; Community
<p>Uwerx is set to be launched on the 4th of August, 2023. Over the months, and during its presale, Uwerx has released several mouthwatering updates about the platform and its launching, leaving freelancers and crypto investors eagerly anticipating.</p>
<p>Uwerx is an upcoming freelancing platform that will provide freelancers with a perfect virtual world to work in and provide crypto investors with a stable and profitable investment choice. For freelancers, the Uwerx team has emphasized that Uwerx is to become the freelancer&rsquo;s first choice. With its 1% flat fee, unlike the ludicrous 10% and 20% fees offered by other freelancing platforms, Uwerx is ready to put its money where its mouth&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>A blaring green light for crypto investors about Uwerx is its successful audit approval by both InterFi Network and SolidProof. This audit approval alone shows interested crypto investors that Uwerx is that token! Uwerx will be renouncing its contract ownership once it&rsquo;s launched on the 4th of August, 2023, and this will be done to ensure the prevention of all cryptocurrency-related scams and frauds. </p>
<p>Perhaps these positive updates about the upcoming platform are the secrets behind Uwerx&rsquo;sgrowing numbers. Uwerx is making great steps to ensure that these figures have extra zeroes at their end before Q4 2024. Uwerx has already been listed on CoinSniper and will soon be listed on Uniswap by the 1st of August, 2023. </p>
<p>Also, to ensure that the WERX tokens are protected, Uwerx will implement a 25-year liquidity lock before the end of its presale. Uwerx will also be launching a Test Airdrop for its users before the 31st of July, 2023, the scheduled date for the end of Uwerx&rsquo;s hard cap presale. To further provide Uwerx users with extra security, the Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled. Storing your WERX tokens in the Uwerx Vault works just like staking, and you can store your tokens for different periods and earn rewards depending on Uwerx&rsquo;s variables. </p>
<p>The Uwerx team is working on releasing the Alpha platform in phases. The PDF Version of these pages has now been released: the Signing-Up Page, the Logging-In page, and the job creation process, amongst others. Soon, Uwerx will be transitioning from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform, so users can try out the platform for themselves while sharing their observations with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s (WERX) Presale Shoots Higher
<p>The Uwerx Presale has not stopped soaring since its start. The presale stages 1 to 4 were sold out in record time, showing crypto investors that the demand for Uwerx is truly high. The Uwerxteam has had to make key token modifications due to increased Uwerx demand.</p>
