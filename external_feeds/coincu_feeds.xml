<p>Ellison admitted her wrong in <strong>Manhattan federal court</strong>, according to a transcript of the hearing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">From 2019 through 2022, I was aware that Alameda was provided access to a borrowing facility on FTX.com, the cryptocurrency exchange run by Mr. Bankman-Fried, In practical terms, this arrangement permitted Alameda access to an unlimited line of credit without being required to post collateral, without having negative balances and without being subject to margin calls on FTX.com’s liquidation protocols.</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, and Ellison agreed to conceal the arrangement by <strong>fabricating fake financial statements</strong>, according to Ellison, who also claimed to be aware of Alameda accounts with negative balances indicating <strong>the company was borrowing money from FTX customers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Russia&#8217;s crypto mining bill could be pushed back over fears it could act as a conduit for capital flight.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the bill is expected to be passed soon.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>On December 23, it was reported by the Russian news agency <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1555117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TASS</a> that the Chairman of the Financial Markets Committee of the State Duma Anatoly Aksakov and said the Russia&#8217;s Crypto Mining Bill has been delayed because critics fear it could become a channel for capital loss.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1806.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1020" height="649" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1806.png" alt="Russia&#039;s Crypto Mining Bill Delayed Amid Capital Outflow Fears" class="wp-image-154958" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1806.png 1020w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1806-300x191.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1806-768x489.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1806-750x477.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" title="Russia&#039;s Crypto Mining Bill Delayed Amid Capital Outflow Fears 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>&#8220;I will not name the organizations that represent down the movement of the bill. At the same time, according to the critics of the bill, it could create channels for capital flight from our country. Ostensibly, it will be the activity of buying cryptocurrency , but in fact, the main objective will be capital flight from our country. That risk probably exists. I&#8217;ll meet with these critics and say &#8211; let&#8217;s finalize it together,&#8221; the lawmaker said.</p>



<p>However, Aksakov believes the bill will be passed soon, saying that it <strong>hopes to pass its first reading in January 2023</strong>. But the passage of the bill could be further delayed if no agreement is reached with competitors next month.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we will initiate this process in January &#8211; the approval in the first reading. This will transpire if I manage to convince the critics that their opinion will be definitely addressed when revising for the second reading. If we do not succeed, they have their own options; we will probably postpone [it]. Still, I believe we will be 90% able to come to terms in order to launch this bill for approval,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>The bill was introduced in the Financial Markets Committee of the State Duma on 17 November 2022 and after being passed into law, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/69405-ukraine-calls-for-changes-to-freeze-russian-and-belarusian-crypto-accounts-28-feb-2022-crypto-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russians</a> will be able to legally mine cryptocurrencies. In addition, the bill allows Russian miners to sell their mining cryptocurrencies on foreign platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Authorities in Italy and Albania have taken down an online investment fraud involving the use of cryptocurrency with the assistance of Eurojust, the cross-border agency of the European Union, for countering organized crime.</em></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>By letting the victims obtain an immediate financial return in exchange for a little initial investment, the offenders won the victims&#8217; trust.</em></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>A united investigation team&#8217;s activity resulted in the seizure of assets worth 3 million euros, Eurojust reported on December 19. Additionally, more than 160 electronic items, including laptops, servers, digital video recorders, and cell phones, were seized.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>An alleged crypto scam scheme that netted 15 million euros has been <a href="https://www.eurojust.europa.eu/news/takedown-online-investment-fraud-responsible-losses-eur-15-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exposed</a> by law enforcement in Italy and Albania.</strong></h5>

<p>The inquiry determined that an<strong> organized crime gang (OCG)</strong> operating out of a contact center in <strong>Tirana, Albania,</strong> was responsible for the investment fraud. The suspects allegedly used delocalized virtual private networks and anonymous <strong>virtual phone numbers (VPNs) </strong>to call the victims.</p>



<p>According to an announcement made on <strong>December 19</strong> by <strong>Eurojust</strong>, the European Union&#8217;s transnational organization for combating organized crime, assets worth 3 million euros were recovered during the operation. Additionally, more than <strong>160 electronic items</strong>, including<strong> laptops, servers, digital video recorders</strong>, and<strong> cell phones</strong>, were seized.</p>



<p>Victims were requested to open an account and transfer a small amount of money, demonstrating a quick financial gain. Then, despite it being unclear whether any crypto assets were bought, they were approached by scammers acting as brokers that recommended favorable investments in cryptocurrencies with minimal risk.</p>

<p>According to <strong>Eurojust</strong>, victims were then pushed to make much greater investments—in some cases, their whole financial resources. The account information was updated, and the victims were locked out once the larger deposits had been made.</p>



<p>Criminals have found success with cryptocurrency investment schemes, which prey on people looking to make substantial short-term financial gains.</p>



<p>According to police data, crypto fraud <a href="https://news.coincu.com/146983-uk-crypto-fraud-rose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surged</a> by a third in the <strong>UK</strong> in a single year, with thieves stealing hundreds of millions of pounds from victims.</p>

<p>The total value of the purchase is roughly<strong> $53 million</strong>, and both <a href="https://news.coincu.com/128585-sbi-holdings-ceo-co-signed-ripple-i-remit/"><strong>SBI </strong></a>and <strong>Square Enix</strong> intend to make substantial strides in the crypto and blockchain gaming market as a result. According to a news release, SBI planned to combine <strong>Gumi&#8217;s game development </strong>and operational know-how with its own token listing expertise. Both exchanges are owned by SBI. The company further stated that it would use <strong>SBI NFT</strong> as <strong>a secondary distribution market </strong>for NFTs obtained from <strong>Gumi-created games</strong>.</p>



<p>The Tokyo-based gaming company<strong> Gumi</strong> announced the agreement in a press release, detailing how the acquisition would make SBI the company&#8217;s largest stakeholder with <strong>22.46% of the company&#8217;s voting rights</strong>. Due to their investment,<strong> Square Enix</strong> now owns <strong>3.01%</strong> of the company. Among Square Enix&#8217;s many accomplishments are the video game series Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.</p>

<p>Square Enix predicted earlier this year that it would &#8220;<strong>not be enough</strong>&#8221; to continue putting its emphasis on traditional gaming to ensure its future success. User-generated content like <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and play-to-earn crypto games </strong>were mentioned as potential additions to the company&#8217;s future revenue models. Gumi could be Square Enix&#8217;s first hesitant step into space.</p>



<p>A &#8220;<strong>platform dedicated to blockchain games</strong>&#8221; is something that SBI is &#8220;thinking&#8221; launching. It claimed that through &#8220;<strong>collaboration</strong>,&#8221; it could build a one-stop solution in the gaming industry, wherein blockchain games could be created, distributed, and sold, in addition to new forms of digital currency.</p>

<p>The <strong>Commercial Crime Bureau of the Police </strong>held a press conference today on the arrest of a fraud case involving a cryptocurrency trading platform. It is reported that the trading platform involved the Hong Kong crypto exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147946-aax-rug-pull-plan-relationship-aax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAX</a>.</p>

<p>During the press briefing, <strong>Kung Hing-fun</strong>, a member of the Commercial Crime Bureau&#8217;s Fraud division, remarked:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Through false information, news, and illegal means, the trading platform stopped operating, so investors have failed to get back their virtual assets.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Kung</strong> noted that the current investigation might lead to additional arrests.</p>



<p>Authorities claim that before the exchange&#8217;s senior management left <strong>Hong Kong</strong> with the company&#8217;s cryptocurrency wallets and secret keys,<strong> </strong>it<strong> </strong>suspended user withdrawals for <strong>&#8220;fault and maintenance.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/154618-ftx-seeks-help-ownership-robinhood-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, the world’s second-largest virtual currency trading platform, filed for bankruptcy protection, triggering a wave of closures.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147611-disclosure-aax-wallet-addresses-related/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, AAX suddenly closed down in the middle of last month, high-level executives jumped ship, employees were dismissed, investors were unable to withdraw assets, and there were thousands of people in the online suffering group. Some claimed that the loss exceeded one million yuan, and it is estimated that <strong>the total amount involved exceeded 100 million yuan.</strong></p>

<p>This is the season for our newly created <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153935-metamask-support-for-optimism-arbitrum/"><strong>MetaMask</strong></a> Grants to make their first awards. DAO is an<strong> employee-led program</strong> that awards funds to developers who are creating meaningful experiences inside the <strong>MetaMask ecosystem</strong>. The company chose <strong>Agoric</strong> and <strong>Safeheron</strong> as the initial winners.</p>



<p>Agoric will use the <strong>$500,000 funding</strong> to continue building <strong>a variety of open source technologies</strong> that will serve as a bridge between security and a fun, fast-paced ecosystem.</p>



<p>Agoric and MetaMask have a long history, with the former providing tools and mentoring aimed at: keeping users secure, and enabling new and exciting extensibility.</p>



<p>The platform discovered the possibility to accomplish extraordinary supply chain security with programs like <strong>LavaMoat</strong> by integrating <strong>Agoric&#8217;s tools</strong>, and with <strong>Hardened JS</strong> (previously &#8220;Secure EcmaScript&#8221;), they have been pioneering what it means to add new services to the wallet at runtime through<strong> Snaps</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;We are building a user-centric consent system, and I believe our work with Agoric will allow us to build a safer platform that empowers users to do more interesting things, enabling not only the composition of dynamic and resilient software but also extending into the social fabric,&#8221;</p>

<p>A <strong>$35,000 award</strong> will be used by <strong>Safeheron</strong> to create and <strong>security audit </strong>a key sharding solution for The Flask, Keystone hardware wallets, and mobile apps ( Mobile or alternatives).</p>



<p>Safeheron and MetaMask are continuing their work to <strong>improve MetaMask users&#8217; security and usability</strong>. This project will focus on improving <strong>MetaMask&#8217;s key management experience</strong>, focusing on: assisting users in managing their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) to decrease phishing assaults and minimizing the likelihood of keys being lost.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/142549-paxos-freezes-19m-in-crypto/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/142549-paxos-freezes-19m-in-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>on November 15, <strong>Paxos said that U.S. federal authorities had ordered the company to freeze $19 million in bitcoin linked to the insolvent FTX exchange</strong>. Over 24 hours on the day, the tokens had been transferred from FTX.com to unidentified wallet addresses. </p>



<p>Soon after Sam Bankman-Fried sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month, their failing exchange was taken advantage of to the tune of <strong>$400 million</strong>. The Paxos Gold (PAXG) tokens, which are backed by actual gold held by the firm, were among the stolen goods. </p>



<p>In four wallets under the hands of hackers, the firm swiftly frozen <strong>11,184 Paxos Gold (PAXG) tokens worth $20 million</strong>. The team has now completely regained the assets, roughly six weeks.</p>



<p>Security company PeckShield discovered based on on-chain data that Paxos took action yesterday to relocate the stolen tokens from addresses designated as &#8220;FTX Accounts Drainer&#8221; by Etherscan to a null address and burn them. It then completed the reclamation process by minting the identical amount into another wallet.</p>

<p>The Paxos recovery, however, only accounts for a minor percentage of the robbery. <strong>The FTX reserves&#8217; ether holdings were $302 million at one time in the FTX drainer wallet</strong>, but virtually all of that money was lost when it was exchanged for bitcoin and could not be recouped.</p>



<p>John Ray III, the new CEO of FTX, stated in prepared testimony that FTX had very lax security measures in place and was storing private keys to its wallets in an unencrypted way, all of which might have made it very easy for the breach to occur.</p>

<p>Deeper investigations into the digital assets of the anti-theft company have shown that scammers have been stealing millions in cryptocurrency and NFTs by taking advantage of the OpenSea gasless platform&#8217;s vulnerability.</p>



<p>Many users are drawn to execute gasless transactions within the <strong>OpenSea</strong> platform, which needs users to approve their signatures with an unintelligible message, claims the <strong>Harpie</strong> security firm.</p>



<p>Additionally, users can construct private activities with unintelligible signatures using the <strong>OpenSea</strong> <strong>gasless</strong> <strong>functionality</strong>. As a result, con artists have begun requesting people to sign one of their illegible letters using this technology.</p>

<p>The login messages are signature requests to execute a private sale of the victim&#8217;s NFT to the con artist for <strong>0 Ether</strong>, it&#8217;s important to note. Hackers are now able to siphon funds from the victim if they sign.</p>



<p>In addition to this fraud, the blockchain security firm <strong>CertiK</strong> recently warned the cryptocurrency community about a practice they call <strong>&#8220;ice phishing.&#8221;</strong> By using this exploit, con artists get <strong>Web3</strong> users to sign permissions that give the attackers the right to use their tokens. The scam, according to <strong>CertiK</strong>, is specific to the <strong>Web3</strong> industry and poses a serious threat.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152966-bayc-scammers-spend-4-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, on <strong>December 17</strong>, an analyst pointed out how a con artist allegedly stole<strong> 14 Bored Ape NFTs </strong>using the gasless <strong>Seaport</strong> signature feature. The hacker conducted extensive social engineering before leading the victim to a phony NFT site and having the holder sign a contract. The victim&#8217;s wallet was then stolen after that.</p>
