This issue has “immense implications for every person involved in the $1 trillion digital-asset economy,” a <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/assets/documents/U.S.-Chamber-Amicus-Brief-In-re-Coinbase-Third-Circuit.pdf">court filing</a> by the Chamber states.</p><p>According to the filing, the SEC has refused to engage in any systematic process or rulemaking to explain what its claimed authority means, instead offering one-off enforcement actions and public speeches. This has created regulatory uncertainty and destabilized the regulatory environment for digital assets.</p><p>In July 2022, Coinbase <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2022/petn4-789.pdf">petitioned</a> the SEC to initiate a rulemaking regarding digital-asset securities. It urged the Commission to answer basic questions such as "which digital assets are securities?" More than 1,700 commenters echoed Coinbase's call, but the SEC expressed no interest in addressing Coinbase's request, according to the Chamber. Coinbase then <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/coinbase-files-lawsuit-against-sec-seeking-regulatory-clarity">pursued a lawsuit</a> against the SEC in order to compel the regulator into action, which is where the filing by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce comes from. </p><p>The SEC's Chairman has asserted that the securities laws are unambiguous as applied to blockchain-based digital assets. Despite constructively denying Coinbase's petition, the SEC has refused to memorialize its decision in a formal response.</p><p>According to the Chamber, the SEC's lack of clarity has caused economic harm to both Coinbase and the broader business community. The uncertainty deters productive conduct and stifles innovation and undermines broader American economic and strategic interests. Continued uncertainty also has implications for the nation's geopolitical interests and the continued primacy of the dollar, given the increasing relevance of digital assets to international monetary policy.</p><p>The SEC's refusal to engage in rulemaking or respond to Coinbase's rulemaking petition has destabilized the regulatory environment for digital assets, the Chamber states. </p><p>“Agencies ordinarily provide regulatory clarity by promulgating rules of general applicability,” the filing says. “This preference for rulemaking has important benefits: It forces agencies to put to paper their regulatory plans, and it provides for fixed, prospective effective dates that ensure parties can bring their conduct into conformance with the law rather than be held liable later for violating duties they did not know existed.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marathon Digital Holdings Faces Second Subpoena By SEC In Relation To Montana Mining Operation]]></title><description><![CDATA[According to a quarterly filing by the miner, the SEC is still inquiring about a Montana mining operation previously investigated in 2021.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-digital-holdings-faces-second-subpoena-by-sec</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-digital-holdings-faces-second-subpoena-by-sec</guid><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[SEC]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Marathon Digital Holdings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 18:35:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Marathon Digital Holdings, a public Bitcoin miner, has received another subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding whether there were possible violations of federal securities law in agreements related to a Hardin, Montana data center facility that Marathon built.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Company and certain of its executives received a subpoena to produce documents and communications,” related to the facility in the third quarter of 2021, a <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001493152-23-016184/0001493152-23-016184.pdf">quarterly filing</a> by the company stated. </p><p>In that agreement, Marathon issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, “in transactions exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.” However, the company filing revealed that it recently received another subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023, “relating to, among other things, transactions with related parties." <br><br>The company says it is cooperating with the investigation.

    </figure><p>“One of the many ways that Bitcoin is an experiment is in its decentralized development model,” explained Amiti Uttarwar. “Whether a non-profit or a private company, the vast majority of software projects have a centralized structure for directing funding, prioritizing projects and coordinating efforts. But the community consensus model of Bitcoin is essential for ongoing censorship resistance. While it’s not easy to get tens of thousands of individual computers to agree, getting thousands of humans to agree is arguably the greater challenge.”</p><p>As a Bitcoin Core developer, Uttarwar is understandably fascinated with Bitcoin’s unique consensus model. She opted to focus on this community-led, open-source project full time in 2019, taking a significant pay cut from an engineering role with Coinbase, and has since earned grants to continue her work from <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/okcoin-bitmex-operator-grant-150000-to-core-developer-amiti-uttarwar">OKCoin, BitMEX operator HDR Global</a> and <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developer-amiti-uttarwar">Gemini</a>. </p><p>Her past codebase contributions have <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22950">changed the logic of Bitcoin’s address management</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528">fundamentally shifted address communication</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18038">reduced privacy leaks caused by transaction broadcasting</a>. Today, her development focus is on improving support for privacy-enhancing communication layers like Tor, I2P and CJDNS through a collaboration with Chaincode Labs’ <a href="https://twitter.com/lightlike1?lang=en">Martin Zumsande</a>.</p><p>“While Bitcoin users can run nodes on multiple networks right now, the benefits are limited and often require a deep level of understanding from the node operator,” Uttarwar said. “Our current project is to enable automatic connections to nodes on every network that a user has enabled. With our work, if a user has enabled clearnet (with interfaces IPv4 or IPv6) and Tor on their Bitcoin node, the node will strive to ensure at least one of their 10 outbound connections is to an onion peer on the Tor network.” </p><p>For Uttarwar, who has seen her work merged into a Bitcoin Core update and who depends upon the larger community of Bitcoin developers for feedback and critical review of her work, the decentralization that underpins this software project is more than just a development model, it is a responsibility.</p><p>“Honoring decentralization in the world of Bitcoin development requires participation from Bitcoin users at varying levels of expertise,” she said. “For example, a protocol upgrade can only happen if users all over the world decide to adopt the code and activate the new logic... The question of what makes Bitcoin better evokes strong opinions in the community, but whether advocating for ossification or soft-fork methodology, funding developers or selecting maintainers, the question that underpins all of these conversations is: How do we agree on what Bitcoin needs in a decentralized way?”</p><p>Exploring this existential question will be Uttarwar’s focus at the upcoming Bitcoin 2023 conference, where she is <a href="https://b.tc/conference/agenda">set to deliver a keynote</a> titled “Decentralization In Action.” Rather than advocating for a particular Bitcoin project, use case or implication, Uttarwar will be using this spotlight to grapple with the very nature of organizational systems and the unique value of Bitcoin development in their context.</p><p>“My talk begins with an epistemological lens, identifying meaningful mental models by taking a look at the world around us,” she described. “By starting with these examples, I encourage the audience to broaden their understanding of how decentralization works in practice. The rest of the talk relates these questions back to daily challenges in the ecosystem of Bitcoin builders. Bitcoin relies on nodes running code around the world to ensure censorship resistance on the network. Upholding this goal also requires a decentralized model of development — the community needs to ensure that making changes to the code is not vulnerable to a single point of failure.”</p><p>She will also participate in a panel discussion alongside Bitcoin Magazine’s <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronvanW">Aaron van Wirdum</a>, Judica Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin">Jeremy Rubin</a> and Lightning Network Developer <a href="https://twitter.com/tdryja">Tadge Dryja</a> called “Evolving Bitcoin’s Code” to further explore when and how changes can be successfully made to Bitcoin’s underlying software.</p><p>Uttarwar sees Bitcoin 2023 as a chance to advocate for the work that she and the rest of the Bitcoin development community are doing every day, reinforcing what decentralization really means for all of us who enjoy the tools built on top of this technology.</p><p>“At Bitcoin 2023, I aim to encourage people to develop a richer understanding of the complexity of what it means to build a truly decentralized technology, and how the success of Bitcoin relies on the individuals within the community contributing their unique attention,” she concluded. “I look forward to getting a pulse of the greater community, learning more about what excites people as well as current pain points. I’m also excited to connect with different people and discover corners of conversation that reinforce my excitement for this space.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3Nzg1MjcwNzA3OTA3/okcoin-bitmex-grant-150000-to-bitcoin-core-developer.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[With The E-Krona, Sweden Is Attacking The Virtues Bitcoin Is Built To Protect]]></title><description><![CDATA[As they increase financial surveillance and control, Swiss authorities are inadvertently making the case for Bitcoin as an alternative.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/sweden-cbdc-for-financial-surveillance</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/sweden-cbdc-for-financial-surveillance</guid><category><![CDATA[central bank]]></category><category><![CDATA[cbdc]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sweden]]></category><category><![CDATA[Surveillance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Bistoletti]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwODQ5NjE5NzcxNTMyODgx/blockchain-surveillance.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Peter Bistoletti, a Bitcoiner who has lived in Sweden since 1971.</em></p><p>Sweden is the nightmare example of a state destroying financial privacy, winning the war on cash and having control of all financial transactions. Sweden has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-01/the-cashless-economy-sweden-s-switch-to-digital-tells-a-cautionary-tale#xj4y7vzkg">almost completely abolished anonymous cash transactions</a> and, as a result, its regulators have control of all financial assets. Since at least 1971, when I moved to Sweden, bank assets have to be reported annually to the tax authorities, which can also demand documentation for all bank transactions. Since 2020, <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/swedish-law-enforcement-given-the-permission-to-hack/">the Swedish police have the right by law to acquire access to locked iphones and computers by use of force</a>. </p><p>In such a privacy-averse environment, one should consider Bitcoin as a better alternative. </p><h2>Introducing The E-Krona</h2><p>In the early days of Bitcoin, one could buy BTC anonymously through platforms such as LocalBitcoins, which is impossible today. To buy BTC through the majority of accessible platforms now, one has to follow strict KYC and AML regulations. Sweden <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/205/bitcoin-atm-sweden/#:~:text=Total%20number%20of%20Bitcoin%20ATMs%20%2F%20Tellers%20in%20Sweden%3A%200">also has no Bitcoin ATMs</a>. Swedish banks, politicians and the media have an overwhelmingly hostile attitude towards BTC.</p><p>Sweden is now moving toward a central-bank-issued, digital, national currency. <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/e-krona/2017/rapport_ekrona_uppdaterad_170920_eng.pdf">Since 2017</a>, the Swedish central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/">the issuer</a> of the prize in economic science in memory of Alfred Nobel, has been promoting the e-krona as a complement to, or replacement of, physical cash. Proponents of e-krona argue that it prevents money laundering and criminal activities, speeds up the financial system and finetunes financial and monetary activities. Critics argue that it is the ultimate tool for financial censorship, control and surveillance. The development of e-krona is happening in <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/e-krona/2023/e-krona-pilot-phase-3.pdf">cooperation with other central banks</a> and the Bank For International Settlements (BIS).</p><p>E-krona is, at present, a pilot project, testing the technical platform and the cooperation of banks, companies and end users. The e-krona will preserve several functions of cash but <em>not</em> anonymity. The volume of e-krona created will <em>not</em> be determined by mining (like it is for Bitcoin), but by the central bank. Positive or negative interest rates will also be determined by the central bank. In a deeper sense, the e-krona without a function like Bitcoin mining is merely a central database controlled by the central bank. </p><h2>Designed To Limit Freedom</h2><p>The technical underpinnings for the e-krona are based on a form of blockchain technology through <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/e-krona/2022/e-krona-pilot-phase-2.pdf">the Corda platform, developed by the software company R3, and ran a February 2020 technical pilot project in cooperation with Accenture</a>, a large, global tech company. The e-krona is programmable and only the central bank can create and destroy e-krona, which is distributed via banks to the general public. The end user can exchange e-krona with bank money in an account and can execute and accept transactions. </p><p><a href="https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments--cash/e-krona/technical-solution-for-the-e-krona-pilot/">There will be</a>:</p><ol><li>A “riksbank node” to create and destroy e-krona.</li><li>A “notary node” at the Riksbank to prevent double use of e-krona.</li><li>“Participants nodes” at banks, and payment service providers for checking the authenticity of e-krona.</li><li>“Nodes for end users” for deposits/withdrawals with the aid of digital wallets. </li><li>Mobile bank identifications, which <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en">have been in use in Sweden for many years</a>, will be necessary for personal identification.</li></ol><p>With the e-krona, the Swedish government will be able to see, in real time, every money transfer that anyone makes. It will also be possible to decrease access to the e-krona, for example, via a social credit score or if one is not compliant with climate change propositions. With the e-krona, the government can freeze someone's financial resources and the Swedish state can directly tax customers' accounts. As a guise pretending to spur spending, a negative interest rate would result in people losing money on their e-krona accounts and the programmable capacities of e-krona could mean that people are prohibited from buying certain goods. There will be numerous ways to program the e-krona, which opens the way to a dystopian, Orwellian surveillance and control state. </p><p>The e-krona is centralization and central planning as it existed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosbank#:~:text=The%20Soviet%20state%20used%20Gosbank,five%2Dyear%20plans%20and%20directives.">Soviet Union's banking system</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, central planning has never worked, and large, centralized bureaucracies are often not very efficient. Central storage of financial information might also pose a problem for authorities. In a cyber attack, the entire network might be disabled. </p><p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides decentralization. It is much more difficult, maybe impossible, to attack the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network has also become more and more resilient over time. </p><h2>We Must Remain Vigilant </h2><p>However, the e-krona could become a competitor to Bitcoin because ordinary people might rather trust and use e-krona instead of bitcoin. One main purpose of the e-krona is price stability. Bitcoin has, at present, high price volatility. The bitcoin price’s stability is influenced by supply and demand, investor sentiments, trading activities, regulations and media hype. As of this writing, <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/">the latest 60-day estimate for bitcoin volatility was 2.48%; while for gold, the historical average volatility has been around 1.2%; and for major currencies, it is between 0.5% and 1%</a>.<br></p><p>Financial privacy should be a human right, but central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the e-krona are leading to the destruction of financial privacy and to the centralization of authoritarian state power. Therefore, we have to fight and prevent the creation and use of CBDCs and the e-krona. The vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, was built on three core values: security, privacy and decentralization. Bitcoin can provide all of these benefits, which CBDCs and the e-krona never can to the same extent. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Peter Bistoletti.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Dan Weintraub, an author and high school teacher who first became interested in Bitcoin while teaching economics.</em></p><p>Recently, I’ve been thinking a good deal about Balaji Srinivasan’s $1 million dollar bet that bitcoin would reach $1 million in June (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/05/02/balaji-srinivasan-concedes-bet-that-bitcoin-will-reach-1-million-in-90-days/?sh=698f93cb76c6">which he recently conceded</a>), his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/balaji-srinivasan-says-hyperinflation-happening-now-makes-million-dollar-bets-on-bitcoin-price-exceeding-1m-in-90-days/">apparent hyperbole with regard to imminent U.S. dollar hyperinflation</a> and his <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/former-coinbase-cto-urges-get-to-bitcoin-before-cbdc-digital-lockdown/">musings about digital lockdowns</a>. It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me. </p><p>On this score, he reminds me of Peter Schiff, a man who <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/crypto-extinction-peter-schiff-predicted-140000434.html">for decades</a> has told us the sky is falling and that the world will end as fiat currencies all collapse; a man who claims intellectual superiority over <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/video/fed-might-look-like-fools-if-they-raise-rates-says-peter-schiff-13275500">the “fools” at the Federal Reserve</a> (meanwhile and generally speaking, the global economy hums along and collapse appears, at least for the time being, to be the stuff of dystopian clickbait on YouTube). </p><p>I, for one, try to eschew conspiracy thinking because it feels neurologically indulgent to me. In simpler words, those who peddle in conspiracy theories do so because it gets them, and their followers, off. “Meltdown masturbation,” if you will. (By way of example, the <a href="https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/bcfb22c4">wild-eyed belief that the U.S. government used the COVID-19 lockdowns as a trial run for further repression</a> reeks of paranoia and a desperate quest for making some kind of dopamine-producing meaning out of a rather bleak moment in time. Crazy town, really; but good fodder for the production of adrenaline-inducing catastrophe porn.)</p><p>Yes, I am skeptical of prognostications of impending doom. But that said, there is an underbelly to such thinking that reveals a far more troubling dynamic; a dynamic that, driven by the exponential age in which it exists, is fast on the rise. And this dynamic will be far more destructive, far more catastrophic, than the supposed collapse of fiat or that the coming of a global banking crisis could ever be. </p><p>We are entering an age in which all trust is dying, and with the end of trust comes the end of… <em>everything</em>. Sure, I may think that Srinivasan and all of the other gloom-and-doom, the-end-is-nigh purveyors have, in some manner and to some degree, lost their grips, but there is something quite revealing not simply in the power of their musings, but in the reality that it reveals, in the attention and excitement it attracts. </p><p>You see, no one trusts anything or anyone anymore. And that utterly terrifies me.</p><h2>The Death Of Trust</h2><p>The list of institutions that we increasingly mistrust is, well, endless. And the depth and breadth of such distrust grows daily. </p><p>I’m not so sure that I need to provide the reader with an in-depth analysis of our collective loss of trust in everything. And so, in the interest of brevity, here is the abridged version:</p><p>Track the numbers and you will see that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022">trust in government is at all-time lows</a> and continues to crash. Whether it’s because our leaders actually are dishonest, self-serving, greedy, power-hungry, incipient lobbyist-ghouls, or whether it’s because that’s how they are portrayed in the media, government officials and institutions are roundly and profoundly distrusted. </p><p>An <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywashburn/2023/02/03/america-less-confident-in-police-than-ever-before-a-look-at-the-numbers/?sh=2e27e4296afb">ever-diminishing minority trusts law enforcement</a>, perhaps because such a minority either has relatives who serve on the police force or because their own power is buoyed by the machinations of the policing and legal systems. For the most part, Americans seem to view police officers as former high-school misfits who magically discovered expressions of sweet revenge in being able to bully the rest of us. Add to this the widespread corruption that permeates every nook and cranny of law enforcement and of our justice system (<em>cough, the </em><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/politics-law-drive-supreme-court-decisions-poll/story?id=99168846"><em>Supreme Court</em></a><em>, cough</em>), and it’s no wonder that “f*** the police” is a popular cultural refrain. </p><p>Interestingly, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403166/americans-trust-media-remains-near-record-low.aspx">fewer and fewer people trust the so-called mainstream media</a>; so few, in fact, that there actually isn’t a mainstream media anymore. Pretty much all media has become an expression of ideological vitriol, a theatrical dance aimed at capturing a larger market share of the neurologically dispossessed; a cynical beast birthed and nurtured to line the coffers of the men and women who captain these galactic founts of misinformation. </p><p><a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/pandemic-declined-trust-public-education/637383/">Few trust our public school systems anymore</a>. What was once viewed as a virtuous institution, an endeavor of the highest good, public education has been summarily devoured by every possible ideologically-propelled interest group; the vomit that has followed has painted a picture of public education as rife with lazy teachers teaching knucklehead kids.</p><p>I could go on. From corrupt corporations and their corrupt CEOs to the self-serving, self-righteous and self-aggrandizing leaders of organized labor; from duplicitous, woke and censorship-informed activists touting the need for correct pronoun adherence to the reactionary and manipulative religious leaders looking to return the nation to the wonderful patriarchies of the 1950s, trust is vanishing into the very ether in which these individuals stoke their fires and solidify their self-concentered narratives.</p><p>But wait! It gets better. For now, superimposed over this already bleak landscape, say hello to ChatGPT, to deep fake technology, to central bank digital currencies; bid an open-hearted welcome to trust’s final frontier, a world in which discerning truth from falsehood becomes virtually impossible.</p><p>What a dumpster of a world. What is to be done?</p><p>Enter, Bitcoin.</p><h2>Bitcoin And Verification Of Truth</h2><p>I have written several papers (I like to call them books because it makes me feel smart, and I have even published them on Amazon) about Bitcoin, extolling the virtues of this quite-extraordinary technology. In all of those pieces I have asked, nay begged, that we have some imagination when considering our Bitcoin future. I will go even further here: Bitcoin is our <em>only</em> hope in an increasingly trustless world, for within the Bitcoin protocol lies the answer to all of the conundrums <em>posed</em> by a trustless world: </p><p>The ultimate answer is verification of truth. Hear me out.</p><p>To begin with, when I suggest that we have some imagination, I am actually not asking for all that much. The boxes in which we live, the lenses through which we view reality, have evolved time and time again. It wasn’t all that long ago that we believed that the Earth was the center of the universe, that humans would never fly, that computers were the providence of NASA. Things have changed, and they have changed quickly. The <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/world-wide-web-launches-in-public-domain">public internet was born</a> around 30 years ago, give or take. Now look at us. It is almost too hard to imagine what the next 10 years will bring.</p><p>So, why Bitcoin? Why is this relatively-straightforward technology (ingenious and elegant, complex and nuanced… but straightforward nonetheless) the answer to the impending doom we all face if we are unable to prime and restart our national and international trust engine? </p><p>It’s simple. Because Bitcoin <em>is</em> the truth. On a most basic level, the Bitcoin protocol — and the tens of thousands of nodes that run the software — verifies each and every transaction that takes place on chain. No one is in control. No one’s word needs to be taken as fact. The truth is manifest and auditable on the blockchain itself. Countless, entirely-objective nodes make falsification of the record an impossibility. Bitcoin is thus an inviolable, immutable, incontrovertible truth.</p><p>Have some imagination!</p><p>What if, just what if, the Bitcoin network, in time, becomes the base layer of this thing we call the internet? What if all data that passes through this network is verified and scoured for falsehood by the soon-to-be billions of verifying nodes; nodes that become native to the devices that we employ for all of our communication and social/virtual interactions? And what if more and more people, in an effort to <em>believe</em>, abandon the cynical and exploitative and fetid digital world that has evolved to date, and instead join a network of unassailable truth?</p><p>You see, the promise of Bitcoin is not that it serves as sound money in an unsound monetary universe; the promise is not that it births a banking system that is devoid of scammy, fraudulent middlemen; no, the promise is far, far more profound. </p><p>The promise of Bitcoin is that it slowly devours the very beast that gave birth to its need. </p><p>Trust is a human imperative, a social imperative. Without trust, chaos ensues. In a world in which belief in things must always be questioned, mental health suffers, governments fail and anarchy rises; lawlessness and violence become the norm rather than the exception. In a trustless world, isolation and hoarding are seen as virtues rather than maladaptations. In a trustless world, everything falls apart, institutions crumble, warlords and demagogues emerge on an ever-rising tide of uncertainty and fear. </p><p>We are moving toward such a future, toward such a world. Bitcoin is our only hope. In Bitcoin there exists the possibility that trust can slowly be reestablished, not based upon the words and deeds of men, but instead on a universal digital protocol that sifts through the mire and always, without prejudice, arrives at the truth.</p><p>We must have the imagination to believe in this possibility. This is what makes Bitcoin a beacon of hope, a ray of light permeating the haze of a creeping fog of surrender. </p><p>I HODL bitcoin, thus. I preach the gospel of Bitcoin because I dare to hope, for my great grandkids, in a world community governed by truth, verified by benevolent objectivity; a world in which trust forms the very core of our existence.</p><p>So to Srinivasan and Schiff and all of the other catastrophians I say: Perhaps you are right. But the truth remains: The only way out of this existential death spiral is through a rebirth of trust, and only Bitcoin, realized to its highest and most majestic potential, can provide this. </p><p>Just imagine.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dan Weintraub.

    </figure><p><em>Disclaimer: Bitcoin 2023 and Bitcoin Magazine are both operated by BTC Inc.</em></p><p>The Declaration of Monetary Independence (DoMI), which made an <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-2022-separation-of-money">impressive debut at Bitcoin 2022</a> in Miami Beach, will once again be on display at Bitcoin 2023. The 9-foot by 12-foot document made a massive impact on attendees at the previous conference, with thousands of Bitcoin enthusiasts adding their signatures to the piece of art. <a href="https://declarationofmonetaryindependence.org/">DoMI</a> is essentially a 21st-century version of the Declaration of Independence, with 27 reasons listed on why fiat currency is an unfair and broken monetary system controlled by governments that favors the wealthiest and most privileged. The second half of the document lists 29 reasons why Bitcoin is the fairest and most egalitarian monetary system ever conceived and implemented.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTg4ODc1MDA5NjMwOTM4NzA0/domi-saturday.jpg" height="827" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>At Bitcoin 2022, DoMI was displayed at the entrance of the Nakamoto Stage, where it attracted the attention of everyone who entered. The signing got off to a slow start, but after one of the original authors of the document signed it, hundreds of attendees started to add their own signatures to the piece of art. Over the course of the three-day conference, thousands of people signed the document, making it resemble activist street art upon a replica of the original Declaration of Independence.</p><p>As Bitcoin 2023 approaches, Bitcoin enthusiasts are eagerly looking forward to the re-emergence of DoMI. The document will once again be displayed prominently at the conference, this time on a 10-foot by 8-foot document with a “Tick toc next block” background in the Lightning Food Court, reminding everyone of the need to separate money from the state and to promote Bitcoin as the fairest and most egalitarian monetary system. Attendees can expect the same enthusiasm and excitement that characterized the signing of DoMI at the previous conference, with many people eager to add their signatures to this historic document.</p><p>DoMI is a reminder that Bitcoin is more than just a digital currency; it represents a fundamental shift in the way we think about money and the role of government in its creation and regulation. As Bitcoin continues to gain wider acceptance and adoption, DoMI will serve as a testament to the power of decentralization and the need for a fairer and more just monetary system.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNTM3MTYyODg3OTk2OTY0/individual-challenge-climb-peak-flag-mountain-top-photo.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTg4ODc1MDA5NjMwOTM4NzA0/domi-saturday.jpg" height="827" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bull Bitcoin Launches No-KYC Purchasing Through Canadian Post Office]]></title><description><![CDATA[Users can now purchase up to $999 CAD at any post office without providing personal identifying information.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bull-bitcoin-launches-no-kyc-purchasing</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bull-bitcoin-launches-no-kyc-purchasing</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchanges]]></category><category><![CDATA[bull bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[KYC]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 14:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyODY5MDM0MjAxNTIzNjE5/img_4905.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Brad Mills, host of the Magic Internet Money Podcast and an investor in several Bitcoin-focused projects.</em></p><p>Big banks are failing. Credit Suisse, one of the largest globally-systemic important banks (G-SIBs) in the world <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-credit-suisse-bank-decline-explainer-timeline/">at $1.2 trillion in total assets</a>, has recently failed, requiring a bailout from the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/switzerland-puts-up-260-billion-francs-credit-suisse-rescue-documents-2023-03-20/">Swiss central bank</a>. </p><p>Before the era of quantitative easing (QE), Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TARF) and Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) bailouts, bank failures were common. Allowing excess risk to flush from the system is a healthy part of free markets. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bank_failures_in_the_United_States_(2008%E2%80%93present)">Almost 500 banks</a> failed during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). </p><p>During the last decade of QE, barely any banks failed while economists, central bankers and politicians have been continually and confidently assuring us that their stress tests are keeping the banking system sound.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3ODAyODQ4ODk1OTAzMDIx/fkcq8six0aahwdu.jpg" height="478" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Is it a coincidence that during the last decade, as governments, central banks and commercial banks worked together to expand the money supply faster and higher than ever before in history, that banks stopped failing? </p><p>Have banks stopped failing over the last seven to eight years because banks are safer and more conservative, or is it because record amounts of money printing and government bailouts have moved the risk from bank balance sheets to somewhere else, simply delaying the inevitable? </p><p>Did moving this risk from bank balance sheets to the central bank’s balance sheets via deficit spending, stimulus, QE and bailouts actually help keep your deposits safer, or has it actually caused wealth inequality to rise, debased the value of your savings account and contributed to high inflation rates which makes the dollars in your bank worth less? </p><p>Finally, after all of this, are we about to see a reversion to the mean of bank failures anyway? Is there a way to protect yourself from the extremely-unlikely event of hyperinflation, or the more-likely event of a deflationary bust or continued high inflation due to governments printing money to prevent the collapse of the global banking system and the loss of confidence in the currency itself? </p><h2>Deposit Insurance Turned Into A Confidence Game</h2><p>Economists and policymakers cite Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) insurance and post-GFC regulations like <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm">the Dodd-Frank Act</a> and <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm">Basel III</a> stress tests to assuage our concerns, telling us that the banks are healthy and that the banking system is sound. </p><p>The reality is that the insurance fund is woefully undercapitalized to cover large bank failures. </p><p>In the U.S.,<a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1637974397347676160?lang=en"> there is more than $18 trillion in deposits and only about $125 billion in the FDIC fund</a>. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-sitting-record-pile-153952186.html">Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway has more money than the FDIC</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>FDIC insurance was <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/firstfifty/chapter1.pdf">put into place in 1933</a> during the Great Depression as a way to provide confidence in the banking system. A lot has changed since 1933. The money supply used to be constrained by the amount of gold that was backing dollars. There was still fractional-reserve lending, but it was a lot more conservative back then. </p><p>While we were on a sound money standard, it was plausible that the FDIC and CDIC could act as a legitimate insurance policy for depositors, when coupled with strong bank regulations and balanced budgets. </p><p>However, the FDIC’s reserves have failed to keep up with the growth in the money supply, and it has had to be bailed out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation">in some form or another</a> during the 1990s, in 2008 and 2009 and, most recently, with the latest round of bank failures. </p><p>Deposit insurance is just another strategy in the confidence game designed to distract you from discovering the reality of how money and banking work. </p><h2>Addressing Fractional Reserve Banking And The ‘Money Multiplier’</h2><p>Many think that we operate on a fractional-reserve bank system that enables the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier">money multiplier</a>,” but this is a common misconception as banks do not operate on that system anymore. Banks literally have the license to print money from nothing and the “money multiplier” is a myth.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>You may have seen fractional-reserve banking and the money multiplier described as the bank keeping 10% of your deposit as reserves and lending the rest out, then repeating that process until the original deposit is multiplied upwards of ten times.</p><p>When you deposit $1,000 into the bank, there is no formula that says the bank keeps 10% of that as reserves and then it can loan $900 to someone else, repeating this ad nauseum until $1,000 becomes $10,000. </p><p>In reality, it’s “<em>fictional</em> <em>reserve</em>” banking, because the money lent out by banks is not backed by anything tangible and the debt that the government issues continually expands. The national debt will never be paid off and the banks have no reserve requirements anymore. </p><p>Many smart people reject this framing. They can’t accept that this is how the monetary system works. </p><p>Don’t feel bad if you’re confused about this stuff. It’s an opaque process <em>designed</em> to obfuscate the reality of how the purchasing power of money will always be debased.</p><p>The modern banking system is like a computer operating system where a small group of people have root-level administrator access, and they give a group of their friends a god mode cheat code. </p><p>The reality is that “BankOS” has been architected as a system of control and a wealth transfer mechanism from the bottom to the top… and you’re probably not at the top. </p><p>Many smart people who believe they understand the banking system are confused about how banks issue loans, they believe that banks conservatively issue new loans based on the amount of deposits they have. They believe that as customer deposits grow, banks lend that money out, and since the money had to exist in order for the bank to lend it out, the banks didn’t print the money. </p><p>This is a naive understanding, and it does not serve your interests to believe in this fairytale. </p><p>Let’s take Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">the third-largest bank to collapse in U.S. history</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>My smart friends will look at the above graphs and say, “See, Silicon Valley Bank didn’t just make money from nothing; they received lots of new deposits over the years and loaned out those deposits!” </p><p>They will see that the bank ended with about $200 billion in deposits and about $70 billion in loans and mistakenly think that the bank was conservatively lending existing money, not creating new money. </p><p>But the hard-to-accept reality is that the incoming deposits were actually created when a bank made a loan. </p><p>Maybe it was Silicon Valley Bank that created the deposits from nothing, maybe it was another bank — but the majority of the “deposits” in the banking system are created from nothing by banks. </p><p>My smart friends will say, “This makes no sense, if banks can create money from nothing, why wouldn’t they just continually print money to make unlimited profits?” </p><p>The truth is, when you look at the growth of the money supply, that’s what they do. </p><p>As long as there’s demand for borrowing, banks will lend. They have a license to print the money and a license to charge usurious levels of interest on the money. </p><p>It’s a wonder why banks fail at all under a system where they have a license to expand the money supply through issuing loans, constrained primarily by our demand for borrowing and what they deem your “creditworthiness” to be. </p><p>Most of the “money” in the system is actually just created from nothing this way by banks — and as icing on the cake, when you deposit this created-from-nothing-by a bank “money” into a bank, they also take your deposits and invest them in the treasury market or deposit them to the central bank as bank reserves to make even more profits. </p><p>The moment that you deposit money into a bank account, it becomes a liability on the bank’s balance sheet and is no longer “your money.” </p><p>Bank regulations are part of the confidence game, designed to prevent bank runs by depositors. In March 2020, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm">the reserve requirements for U.S. banks were lifted</a>, and many British Commonwealth countries have been on a zero-reserve requirement regulatory scheme for 20 to 30 years.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Instead of 8% to 12% reserve requirements, there are various liquidity and collateral rules that banks are urged to follow. One of these rules is the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity-coverage-ratio.asp">liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR</a>. </p><p>LCR is important when it comes to bank runs, which is what we are seeing happen now across the global banking system. </p><p>In order to pass regulatory stress tests, banks must keep a portion of their reserves in <a href="https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/LCR/30.htm?tldate=20191231&amp;inforce=20191215">high-quality liquid assets (HQLA)</a> which include cash and cash-like instruments such as government bonds that can be quickly sold to meet customer withdrawals. </p><p>Banks must always have enough high-quality liquid assets in order to meet 30 days of expected net outflows and customer withdrawals. </p><p>The Bank of Canada assumes that customer deposits in the country’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bigsixbanks.asp">”Big Six” banks</a> are very sticky, so it <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/05/staff-analytical-note-2022-5/">only assigns a run-off rate of 3% to 5%</a> and these banks are not required to keep significant HQLAs to cover deposits.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The problem arises when there is a systemic crisis in either the banking system or the money itself that causes fear and panic, driving people to withdraw their money physically or wire it out digitally. </p><p>In 2022, when Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergencies_Act">invoked the Emergencies Act</a> and threatened to freeze the bank accounts of anyone involved in or supporting the Freedom Convoy, this caused a run on the Canadian banks, as shown by the LCR chart below. </p><p>This sudden shock and erosion of trust in the Canadian banking system from a large enough percentage of the population caused the LCR of Canada’s biggest banks to drop significantly. </p><p>When a bank run happens, 30 days’ worth of expected net outflows might be taken out in one day, leaving the bank potentially insolvent if there are liquidity issues with the high-quality liquid assets the bank uses for its HQLA reserves.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>‘Too Big To Fail’: How The Current Bank Failures Are Not Like 2008 </h2><p>So, now that we know that the money multiplier is a myth and banks are actually allowed to create credit (money) from nothing via fictional-reserve banking, authorized by the central bank, let’s continue! </p><p>Why did we not see any signs of bank failures during the last 10 years until now? </p><p>It turns out that the central bankers kept interest rates near zero while they recapitalized banks and monetized record government debt issuance (deficit spending) to the tune of trillions of dollars. In that environment, banks appear to be healthy. </p><p><em>If the government gave you a money printer, I’m sure your finances would be a lot more sound as well! </em></p><p>There is a “financial soundness” indicator that the central banks use known as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common-equity-tier-1-cet1.asp">Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio</a>, which is also known as a capital buffer. </p><p>In the chart below, thanks to QE and other bailout programs, you can see that the soundness of the banks increased until recently, when we saw the largest percentage drop of CET1 since they started measuring it.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The last banking crisis was caused by too much real estate speculation by the public and too much toxic, derivative-risk taking by big banks. </p><p>The big banks were deemed “too big to fail.” In order to save the flawed system, they threw out the idea of being fiscally conservative and started normalizing bailouts as the first resort. </p><p>We are 50 years into the backed-by-nothing U.S. dollar experiment and nearly 15 years into this infinite, reserve-banking, central-planning experiment, and it looks like everything is broken, especially the purchasing power of dollar savers. </p><p>Too much centralization and interference in financial markets to save the “too big to fail” banks has shown up as an acceleration of the perversion of incentives in the economy. </p><p>The role of the dollar went from being a savings vehicle — work hard and save your money — to a system of control and wealth redistribution from the bottom to the top — work hard and spend your money. </p><p>Due to this new ‘too big to fail’ experiment, we’ve seen the rise of the “everything bubble,” which makes this crisis much different than the last one. The current crisis is a crisis of confidence in the money itself and the entire banking system, not necessarily anything that the banks did.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>How Did Governments And Central Banks Cause The Everything Bubble? </h2><p>Interest rates were held artificially low during this period of time. With the central bankers signaling that rates would be held lower for longer, this encouraged over borrowing and excessive risk taking by banks, corporations and citizens. </p><p>Combine this poor central banking policy with gluttonous government deficit spending and we see the total supply of money rise exponentially. </p><p>When you add in the supply chain disruptions from the “<a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/abundance-doesnt-end#:~:text=Speaking%20to%20his%20ministers%20at,and%20the%20ongoing%20supply%20problems.">end of the age of abundance</a>” as French president Davos aficionado Emmanuel Macron recently warned about — all of this has caused inflation to rise faster than my generation has seen in our lifetimes. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/national-debt-by-year-compared-to-gdp-and-major-events-3306287">U.S.’s national debt increased</a> from a staggering $10 trillion to a mind-numbing $30 trillion since the 2008 to 2009 GFC.</p><p>The money supply has inflated massively. It took the U.S. two centuries to accrue $7 trillion in national debt until recently, when $7 trillion was added in just another two years!</p><figure>

In the post-war era, we inherited monstrous debts fighting the fascists. We basically operated on an American-led standard whereby you could exchange a U.S. greenback at a rate of $35 per ounce in gold.” </p><p>Poilievre continued talking about the prosperity we had in the post-war era under the gold standard: </p><p>“Here in Canada, with solid currency, we wrestled the inflationary beast to the ground. We paid off our record war debts, we increased the size of the Canadian economy by 300%, and by 1973 we had basically become a debt-free country.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>“Then what happened in the 1970s?” he continued. “President Nixon wanted to spend on warfare and welfare. Of course, the Americans were bogged down in Vietnam, which was costly an enterprise. President Nixon wanted to keep his popularity at home, so he decided to spend, spend, spend… In the decade that followed 1971, not only did they unleash the American dollar from a sound money standard, but they increased the number of U.S. dollars in circulation by 150% while output only grew by 39%. In other words, the amount of money grew about four-times faster than the amount of underlying output that that money represented.” </p><p>This next part gets a bit partisan, but it’s very relevant to what we’re experiencing now.</p><p>Poilievre continued, “Here in Canada, we had Pierre Elliot Trudeau as prime minister. He looked down at all the inflation that the U.S. government was creating — they had reached double-digit inflation, a total inflationary crisis. </p><p>“The American dollar was devalued on an international basis, incapable of buying affordable petroleum on the world market … poverty was overtaking inner-city streets and the wealth gap was expanding in the United States of America. </p><p>“What did Pierre Elliot Trudeau do? He started printing money here in Canada, massively increasing the money supply. Between 1971 and 1981, the money supply in Canada grew by over 200% while GDP only grew in real terms by about 47%. </p><p>“So you can imagine when money is growing in supply at more than four times the rate as the economy is growing, you have more dollars chasing fewer goods, and what do you get?” </p><p>Inflation. </p><h2>Why Deflation Is Good And Prices Should Come Down, If It Weren’t For Central Banks And Politicians</h2><p>Not only are we dealing with government-induced inflation, but we’re also now suffering from their proposed solution to inflation: jacking up the interest rates and crushing everyone financially. </p><p>The banking crisis was never fully dealt with in 2008 and 2009. </p><p>Instead of taking a decade of pain, allowing rates to naturally rise while over-leveraged, large banks failed and poorly run businesses went under, they decided to socialize the losses and privatize the gains. </p><p>Not only was the can kicked down the road, but central bankers and economists tried to sell us on being scared of deflation! </p><p>They were trying to rationalize their monetary machinations as a way to stop prices from dropping, trying to fear monger and convince all of us that lower prices is a bad thing.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In Jeff Booth’s book “The Price of Tomorrow,” he describes how technology is deflationary. If we had a sound money like Poilievre described, it would make sense that technological advancements and productivity gains would cause prices to drop. </p><p>With a more sound money that does not continually inflate like our current debt-based, broken money system, your purchasing power would not decline over time and we would enjoy the deflationary benefits of technology. </p><p>With deflation and a more sound monetary system, you could live a dignified life and afford a home on a smaller wage as prices naturally come down. </p><p>Critics of sound money will say that under the gold standard we saw booms and busts, and you can’t get out of an economic depression without inflating the money supply. </p><p>There is no easy answer here, and the solution is probably something in the middle, at least during a transitory phase. We need to slowly transition to a sound money system while also increasing financial literacy. </p><p>Critics of sound money systems like a gold-backed standard too often rely on a false dichotomy argument, where it has to be either continuous stimulus <em>or</em> global depression with nothing in the middle. </p><p>Something has to change — it’s clear that the debt-based, money-printing, stimulus-by-default system we’ve been operating on has seen continual expansion of the wealth gap. In fact, it is plausible to have a period of transition where you could help the bottom 50% out with a form of universal basic income, while you increase financial literacy and encourage saving in a hard money. </p><p>You could do this while eliminating a lot of excessive federal spending, and transitioning to a more sound monetary system over a period of five to 15 years, all while we enjoy the benefits of technology making our lives better! </p><p>Politicians, mainstream economists and central bankers are fighting the deflationary benefits of technology by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/20/the-federal-reserves-2percent-inflation-targeting-policy-explained.html">arbitrarily targeting 2% inflation</a> and continually increasing the supply of money via various methods like government deficit spending, commercial bank credit creation and central bank money printing. </p><p>Since these economists and bankers were claiming that QE and stimulus didn’t cause inflation, they were fear mongering about a “deflationary spiral,” trying to create the political will for the next round of money printing to keep their inflation experiment going… and, predictably, they overreacted and gave us an inflationary crisis instead of a deflationary one.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>He continued, “Those deposits can be turned into hard paper cash. That is why the money supply went from $1.8 trillion to $2.3 trillion — half a trillion dollars, which is almost exactly what the deficit was — not a coincidence. </p><p>“The paper money — the stuff that’s printed — went from $90 billion to $124 billion. Both increased by approximately 27% in a few years. </p><p>“The money that’s still on deposit with the central bank has created a new problem. The central bank bought bonds with yields of 0.25% and paid for it with deposits on which it now has to pay 4.5% — in other words, they’re now losing money on the spread. </p><p>“For the first time in history, the Central Bank of Canada needs a bailout of $4 billion a year. That doesn’t take into consideration any additional losses that will happen if they eventually sell those bonds which are worth less now than when they bought them.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>“This has been very good for the very wealthy because in addition to arbitraging those transactions, this inflationary policy drove up asset prices,” Poilievre continued. “If you have a $10 million mansion and house prices go up by 50%, you’ve just made $5 million tax free. If you’re the new immigrant who doesn’t own any property, the purchasing power of your dollar in terms of real estate has just gone dramatically down.”</p><p>Poilievre punctuated his lesson on how QE creates wealth inequality by saying it is “a massive wealth transfer from the have-nots to the have-yachts.” </p><h2>Quick Review So Far </h2><p>At this point, l’d like to recap and add some more factors to the discussion so we can continue understanding why many banks are technically insolvent and starting to fail:</p><ol><li>Central bankers held interest rates too low and signaled to everyone, including the banks, that they will continue to keep rates low to avoid deflation, promoting the flawed logic of “inflation is transitory” and “deflation is bad.” </li><li>Banks do not operate on a reserve system anymore — instead they continually create debt money through credit issuance and are encouraged to hold high-quality liquid assets, such as government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, to protect against bank runs in case everyone discovers there are not adequate reserves for everyone to get their money out.</li><li>Governments inflated the money supply with massive stimulus and deficit spending. Central Banks enabled the massive deficit spending with QE. </li><li>QE by itself did not directly add new money to the system, even though the central bank created the reserves from nothing — because banks used existing money (our deposits!) to buy the bonds which they sold to the central banks.</li><li>The G7 made a difficult decision to drop a nuclear bomb on the financial system by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/18/g7-ministers-pledge-to-intensify-russia-sanctions-slam-china#:~:text=The%20foreign%20ministers%20of%20G7,member%20of%20the%20international%20community%E2%80%9D.">sanctioning Russia</a>, putting contagion pressure on European and other Western banks. </li><li>Central banks started raising rates faster than they ever have before in history to combat inflation, deflating the bond bubble and causing banks to become insolvent.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>As Poilievre mentioned in his rebuke of QE, central banks could realize losses if they are forced to sell bonds. </p><p>However, a fair rebuttal to this argument is that central banks don’t have to sell their bonds — they will likely hold them for years or decades to maturity and not realize any losses in dollar terms because they can create the dollars. </p><p>(This is why they claim that the bonds are “risk free.” While it’s true that they are risk free when denominated in the currency, they are not risk free when measured in purchasing power.) </p><p>Unlike central banks, regular banks are in a precarious position where they have to sell underwater bonds as depositors withdraw record amounts of money. </p><p>Due to this exodus from the banking system, they are no longer able to hide the problem with accounting tricks. The depositor runs are forcing banks to realize the massive losses that were hidden with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/held-to-maturity-security.asp">held-to-maturity (HTM) accounting</a> rather than fair-value accounting of their underwater bond portfolios. </p><p>This accounting trick only worked as long as depositors didn’t withdraw their funds. Now that there are record withdrawals happening, as demonstrated in the chart below, it is exposing the insolvency and causing banks to fail. </p><h2>Why Are People Withdrawing Their Money At Historic Rates? </h2><p>There are two main reasons why depositors are withdrawing their money. </p><p>Firstly, as depositors lose confidence in their banks, it causes them to move their money to a bank that they trust more. Secondly, high interest rates are causing depositors to wire their money out of their accounts to seek higher yield in money market funds, bonds, guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) and certificates of deposit (CDs) and other investment vehicles. </p><p>Maybe you haven’t thought about how unfair this is, but many people are realizing that the banks and central banks are taking advantage of them. </p><p>Let’s say you’ve been depositing and saving money at a big bank, and the big bank gives you a savings rate of roughly 0%. The big bank took your money and bought government debt during QE and received central bank reserves which it parks at the central bank and now gets paid about 5%! </p><p>People are waking up to how unfair this is, and they are wiring their savings out of their banks and putting it into investments and alternative stores of value, like gold, real estate and bitcoin. </p><p>In an age of digital money, bank runs in the 2020s don’t look like they did in the 1920s. Instead of lineups around the corner, now we have digital bank runs. </p><p>In 2022, a record $600 billion in deposits were withdrawn from U.S. banks:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Many were speculating at this time, in 2019, that Credit Suisse or Deutsche Bank were functionally insolvent, and that they — and many other banks — would have failed much sooner had the central banks not intervened in 2019 and 2020 with massive bailouts in the interbank lending markets, the corporate bond markets and the U.S. treasuries market. </p><p>Since cracks have started to show in the U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets in 2019, 2020 and 2021 with no-bid auctions, rate volatility and growing illiquidity, the central banks are doing whatever they can to prevent banks from having to add sell pressure to the U.S. treasuries markets. </p><p>With <a href="https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1640016416412663808">record outflows</a> from depositors, banks like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-caused-silicon-valley-banks-failure-2023-03-10/#:~:text=SILICON%20VALLEY%20BANK%20SELLS%20BOND,Treasury%20yield%20of%20around%203.9%25.">Silicon Valley Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisses-risky-bond-wipeout-hurts-asias-rich-a502ce">Credit Suisse</a> were forced to start selling their bonds, realizing the losses on their underwater bond portfolios and going insolvent.</p><p>These issues in the banking system and bond markets were not caused by COVID-19, and the trend of bank failures is clearly not over as another large U.S. bank, First Republic Bank, has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/first-republic-bank-fdic-takeover-sold-jp-morgan-rcna81437">been taken over by the FDIC and sold to JPMorgan</a>.</p><h2>Added Pressures From Europe And Russian Sanctions</h2><p>Almost precisely one year before Silvergate Bank failed in the U.S., kicking off a wave of bank failures, <a href="https://twitter.com/bradmillscan/status/1500954640002781190?s=20">I wrote about</a> how the Russia sanctions were a nuclear bomb that went off in the banking system and expected to see a wave of bank failures come in the wake of it. </p><p>Much like how two nuclear bombs ended World War II, capital-crushing central bank policy rate hikes and Russian sanctions were like two nuclear bombs dropped on the economy and the banking system. The shock wave took one year to make its way around the world, and now we're dealing with the fallout. </p><p>European banks like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/deutsche-bank-ceo-gets-20-pay-rise-2021-2022-03-11/">Deutsche Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-ubs-among-banks-facing-uss-russia-sanctions-probe-bloomberg-news-2023-03-23/">Credit Suisse</a> were very intertwined with Russia, and tried to resist cutting ties with Russian business lines as this would inevitably lead to their failures, which would spread as contagion to the rest of the global banking system. </p><p>When you want to get an idea of the health of a bank, you can look at a few things, things such as:</p><ul><li>CET1 </li><li>LCR </li><li>Share price</li><li>Credit default swaps (CDS)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We already covered CET1 and LCR earlier, and a bank’s share price dropping is a pretty obvious sign that market participants have found something concerning, so let's discuss credit default swaps. </p><p>CDS are a form of insurance against debt defaults and insolvency for large institutional traders and investors to hedge the risk of owning the debt of an entity.

    </figure><h2>How Bad Is This Compared To Previous Bank Failures? </h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">Three of the largest bank failures in U.S. history have just happened</a>, Silicon Valley Bank at $209 billion, Signature Bank at $118 billion and First Republic Bank at $229 billion.</p><p>(For reference, the largest bank failure in U.S. history was Washington Mutual at $307 billion in 2008.) </p><p>Hundreds of U.S. banks would technically be insolvent if it weren’t for HTM accounting, in a similar position as the banks that have failed already. Time will tell if banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate were the riskiest banks or just the first banks to fail. </p><p>The failure of these large banks led to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm">emergency action by the Federal Reserve</a>, starting up a new round of bailouts and lending programs designed to prevent the banks from having to realize the losses on their U.S. treasuries. </p><p>Instead of having to sell their HQLA government bond portfolios and realizing losses to meet withdrawals, they can now borrow money from the Federal Reserve against their bond portfolios at the held-to-maturity value rather than the actual market value.</p><p>Essentially, central planners intervened with the free market pricing mechanism, rescuing banks once again by allowing them to mark up the value of their bond portfolios to their held-to-maturity values rather than just borrow freshly printed Fed money — allowing them to borrow even more money than what the bonds are worth. </p><p>Typically, banks avoid borrowing from the Fed via the <a href="https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/">discount window</a> as there’s a stigma attached to the institutions who do so. Remember, the colloquial term is that the Fed is the “lender of last resort.” </p><p>Since it’s public who is borrowing from the Fed as a last resort, that’s interpreted as a sign of weakness by the market. But when there’s systemic risk in the system, the stigma of borrowing from the Fed seems to be removed. </p><p>Strangely, the Federal Reserve is actually charging banks a pretty high interest rate. </p><p>In this scenario, the Federal Reserve has gone from the lender of last resort to the loan shark of last resort for small- and medium-sized banks, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/13-3-report-btfp-20230316.pdf">paying about 5%</a> for <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm">Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP)</a> funding or borrowing at the Fed’s discount window. </p><p>They call this program BTFP, and I look at it like a living will for the U.S. banking system. </p><h2>What The BTFP Does To Slow The Banking Crisis </h2><p>The Fed’s BTFP does two things. </p><p>Firstly, it hopes to stop the banking crisis by giving banks more time to process withdrawals, stopping panic from spreading as customers return to a state of complacency with their deposits. </p><p>It is buying time. The longer this draws out, the more they can control the narrative. </p><p>Secondly, if that fails and this really is the resolution of the 2008 crisis where we see sustained bank runs and systemic bank insolvencies, the BTFP helps reduce the pressure on the FDIC if it has to resolve hundreds of small and medium bank failures. </p><p>As we’ve learned so far, there is not enough demand in the free market to buy the bonds that the government is trying to sell, so the central bank has to buy the bonds to fund government deficit spending and QE.</p><p>There is <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fed-emergency-loans-btfp-banking-liquidity-svb-collapse-contagion-deposits-2023-3">upwards of $2 trillion in bonds</a> held by hundreds of small- and medium-sized banks. </p><p>If these banks have to sell these bonds into the market, that will freeze up the bond market, which might cause a loss of confidence in the money itself, which is much worse than a loss of confidence in banks. </p><p>The Fed’s BTFP allows them to create <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-16/jpmorgan-says-fed-s-loans-will-provide-2-trillion-of-liquidity#xj4y7vzkg">up to $2 trillion and lend it to these banks</a>, taking their underwater bonds off the market and putting some 500 small- and medium-sized U.S. banks into debt to the Fed. </p><p>If these banks fail, the Federal Reserve can absorb the bond collateral onto its balance sheet without it looking like another round of QE and bailouts as the banks have become debtors to the Fed. </p><p>These money-printing, bank-lending schemes are all about buying time and stopping fear from spreading in both the banking system and the bond market themselves. </p><h2>Is This A Widespread Banking Crisis? </h2><p>If enough customers try to withdraw their money from banks, the banks will go insolvent… because not only are the dollars printed from nothing, but the banks do not even have the “dollars” anymore. </p><p>In fact, the money in your bank account is not even “your money.” It’s actually a liability on the bank’s balance sheet. This is why bank bail-in provisions were written into law post-GFC. </p><p>If they can not prevent the fear from spreading and we see a systemic failure, banks can legally do bail-ins and haircuts above the CDIC/FDIC limits, like we saw in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis">Greece</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%932013_Cypriot_financial_crisis">Cyprus</a> a decade ago. </p><p>The FDIC and the Fed knew the banks were in trouble last year. They started holding meetings and trying to come up with rule changes to figure out how to resolve large bank failures. </p><p>They know FDIC insurance is a fairy tale designed to keep depositors placated and that if large banks start to fail, the FDIC fund is laughably undercapitalized to resolve that situation. </p><p>They discussed doing haircuts and bank bail-ins, as well as disclosing information on the true risks in the banking system to the public in advance of a systemic event.</p><p>Some <a href="http://fdic.windrosemedia.com/index.php?category=Systemic+Resolution+Advisory+Committee">recent comments from FDIC regulators on bank bail-ins from November 2022</a>: </p><p>“It’s important that people understand they can be bailed-in. You don’t want a huge run on the institutions, but there are going to be (runs) and it could be an early warning signal to the FDIC and the primary regulators.</p><p>“…and if there’s significant long-term debt, you can contemplate a bail-in-type exit for these institutions where you’re turning the institution over to its creditors.” </p><p>There does not seem to be the political will to allow bail-ins to happen yet. </p><p>As we saw just a couple of months after this FDIC meeting, when banks actually started to fail, the Silicon Valley billionaires were bailed out instantly and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/silicon-valley-bank-deposits-guaranteed-signature-bank-federal-reserve-fdic/#:~:text=All%20deposit%20accounts%20at%20both,Deposit%20Insurance%20Corporation%20(FDIC).">all deposits were guaranteed</a>. </p><p>The $250,000 FDIC limit was essentially <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fdic-proposes-congress-increase-deposit-insurance-limits-for-payroll-accounts-181123469.html">thrown out the window</a> immediately. </p><p>While the legal framework is in place, bail-ins seem to be a last resort tool at the bottom of the toolbox. You can think of bail-ins like lockdowns. They will only go with that option when they are about to completely lose control. In February 2020, the idea of schools and public buildings being shut down and everyone being forced to stay at home was thought to be hyperbolic and ridiculous. </p><h2>FDIC/CDIC Unable To Handle The Failures Of Large Banks </h2><p>In fact, when you look at the CET1 ratios of Canadian banks, it does not look great. </p><p>Silicon Valley Bank failed <a href="https://www.almfirst.com/what-to-know-about-svb-signature-bank-and-the-feds-emergency-measures/">with a CET1 ratio of 14%</a>, and Credit Suisse failed with a <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/csg-announcement-202303.html#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20end%20of,of%20March%2014%2C%202023">CET1 ratio of 15%</a>, which is better than the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CBIC) or Scotiabank, which are all under 13%:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>There’s not enough capital buffer in the banking system to absorb the massive losses in these bond markets. </p><p>Preston Pysh, host of “The Investors Podcast,” <a href="https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh/status/1638272343804989440">recently tweeted</a>: </p><p>“The total capital buffer in the US banking system is $2.2 trillion, while unrealized losses are between $1.7 and $2 trillion. If banks had to liquidate their bond and loan portfolios, they'd lose 77-91% of their capital cushion, highlighting the fragility of most banks. 186 US banks are in distress.” </p><p>The idea that CDIC/FDIC insurance can cover the losses from a systemic failure is a fantasy. </p><p>The FDIC couldn’t handle even the first bank failure in 2023 and had to tag in the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to backstop depositors, as 97% of the deposits of that bank were those millionaires and billionaires, evidenced by the fact <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/svbs-collapse-exposes-the-feds-massive-failure-to-see-the-banks-warning-signs/">that they were above the $250,000 deposit insurance limit</a>. </p><p>They decided to rescue all depositors instead of applying haircuts/bail-ins because, understandably, they felt like it would lead to systemwide panic and full-on </p><p>bank run, cascading to an unstoppable banking crisis like we saw in the 1920s, rather than the one in 2008. </p><p>There was also a real, legitimate issue of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/10/silicon-valley-bank-customers-scramble-to-meet-payroll-pay-bills.html">many Silicon Valley companies being unable to meet payrolls on the following Monday</a>, and what that would do to the economy, which is overly dependent on tech companies. </p><p>Tech companies drive stock market performance: If you look at the stock performance of the top five or 10 tech companies, and then look at the other 490 companies in the S&amp;P 500, the economic outlook would look a lot worse:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Imagine what would happen to the U.S. stock market, which has been artificially inflated to record high prices via money printing and low interest rates, if Facebook, Google, Microsoft and all of the non-profitable-but-public tech companies lost tens of billions of dollars to bail-ins and couldn’t meet payroll. </p><p>The choices facing the FDIC, U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are not easy ones. There are decades of policy mistakes and bipartisan political blundering that brought us here. </p><p>So, is the $250,000 FDIC limit just a fantasy if <em>all</em> deposits of the Silicon Valley elite were backstopped? Did the government just tell us that it will socialize <em>all</em> money in the banking </p><p>system with this action, or is it just going to pick winners and losers as more banks start to fail, and eventually the bail-ins start? </p><p>Foss has <a href="https://twitter.com/FossGregfoss/status/1637979478172246017?s=20">pointed out</a> that, even with all of the bailouts, emergency lending programs and confidence games that the Fed, U.S. Treasury and FDIC are playing, soon the interest rate risk might spillover to credit risk, which will be even worse for banks. </p><p>The FDIC was formed in the 1930s when the United States was still on a somewhat-sound monetary standard; it was a way to provide confidence to depositors in the U.S. banking system who had lost trust in the banks. </p><p>Today, the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/assuringconfidence.pdf">FDIC fund only has around $100 billion</a>, which is lower than the mandated amount. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/warren-e-buffett/">Buffet has more money than the FDIC fund does</a>. </p><p>As the monetary system transitioned from sound money to credit money, and the supply of money expanded rapidly, the idea of FDIC insurance is more of an illusion — another confidence game. </p><p>We are supposed to believe that this FDIC insurance is financed by fees that banks pay on deposits, however, as we’ve seen with the recent bank failures and in previous periods of financial crisis — such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis">savings and loan crisis in the ’80s and ’90s</a> and during the GFC in 2008 and 2009 — the FDIC is too big to fail and it will also get bailed out. </p><p>They will do whatever they have to in order to prevent people from peeking behind the money curtain to see how things really operate. </p><p>So, what does all of this mean? </p><p>One thing is for certain, all of this central planning and interference in the free market to prevent the risk from flushing out of the system has a cost: </p><p>Wealth inequality is going to keep rising and your money is going to continue to lose purchasing power over time, probably at an accelerated rate. </p><p>I believe there are really only three ways that this can be resolved. </p><h2>One: No Can Kick, Leading To Deflation And Falling Prices </h2><p>Why would we see this? Well, the G8 central bankers are all trying to fight inflation at the same time as they are trying to prevent a banking sector meltdown, which requires them to keep raising rates and not doing any more blatant QE (although, in Canada, we raised first and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-11/interest-rates-bank-of-canada-to-stay-on-pause-despite-strong-economic-growth">have since put a pause on raising rates</a>.)</p><p>Another reason why this scenario is plausible is the looming debt ceiling. There’s a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/business/economy/us-debt-ceiling.html#:~:text=The%20national%20debt%20crossed%20%2431,is%20set%20at%20%2431.381%20trillion.">statutory cap on the amount of debt the U.S. government can have</a>, and it will need to be legally raised again before another massive round of stimulus can happen.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In 1939, U.S. Congress passed the initial "<a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/public-debt-acts">Public Debt Act</a>" which established limits on aggregate U.S. debt levels. </p><p>The debt ceiling has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_debt_ceiling">been raised 98 times since</a>, although sometimes this becomes a partisan battle if an opposing party controls the presidency, house or senate. </p><p>In the long arc of history, it really doesn't matter who's in power; they eventually raise the debt ceiling and print. </p><p>However, this debt-ceiling deadlock can cause problems in the short term, and we’re potentially facing that scenario now where the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3919994-senate-republicans-introducing-resolution-to-overturn-bidens-debt-relief-program/">Republican-controlled House does not want to allow the Democratic president to issue more debt</a> coming up to an election year. </p><p>This is deflationary because it effectively shrinks the money supply and would lead to a continuing decline in bonds and stocks. </p><p>In the “no can kick” scenario, we would see more banks fail and we could potentially even see the extreme conditions required to force bail-ins where depositors start to take haircuts. </p><p>Real estate would crash in this deflationary spiral, erasing the “phantom wealth” that most people feel when they borrow against their retirement accounts and real estate portfolios that have grown rapidly in value during the bubble. </p><p>This could lead to governments being unable to run massive deficits, as there would be no net-new buyers for bonds and confidence would be lost in government treasuries as the safest place to protect wealth. </p><h2>Two: Can Kicked Too Hard, Leading To Hyperinflation</h2><p>This scenario is the least likely to happen in the U.S. or Canada. It’s extremely unlikely yet worth discussing as it would require massive policy errors. </p><p>In this scenario, we see some exogenous event such as a once-in-a-generation pandemic, or a coronal mass ejection (CME) similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event">Carrington Event</a>, perhaps a nuclear war or an unstoppable rogue AI internet virus, which causes an acceleration of existing risks in the system. </p><p>Some people call these hard-to-predict financial shocks “black swan” events. </p><p>If we get a significant black swan event that accelerates the current banking crisis, we could see a sudden collapse of hundreds of banks as global stock markets rapidly crash and bond markets lock up, similarly to what we saw in 2008 or in March 2020. </p><p>A real estate market correction could also accelerate to a crash, causing public outcry for policymakers and central bankers to once again lower interest rates and rescue the economy. </p><p>Emergency measures would be taken, similar to what we saw in the aftermath of COVID-19, however, this time we would likely see 1930s-style price fixing, capital controls and much more massive bailouts by the government and central banks. </p><p>Only if they print obscene amounts of money in response to the crisis do we start to enter hyperinflation territory. </p><p>Hyperinflation <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp">is defined as</a> rapid monetary inflation causing prices to increase at 50% month over month. Oftentimes when people use the term hyperinflation, they don’t actually realize what they are saying, and they can sound hyperbolic to someone who understands the dictionary definition of the word. </p><p>Policymakers would have to make all the wrong choices and not have learned anything from history to cause a hyperinflationary collapse. </p><p>It’s a very unlikely scenario. </p><h2>Three: Can Kicked, Status Quo With Inflation </h2><p>This is the most likely scenario. There’s no political will to see deposits start taking haircuts, and nobody seems to want to pull the lever to be responsible for a recession. </p><p>With a status-quo can kick after the debt ceiling is raised, we get continued waves of higher inflation with interest rates held lower. </p><p>The bond markets continue getting propped up by the central banks as QE restarts and the Fed’s balance sheet expands by upwards of $10 trillion to $20 trillion. </p><p>This is where we see Ponzi finance starting to become more obvious to most people as the share of the U.S.’s debt owned by the Fed crosses 50%. </p><p>I’m not sure whether it will be able to fight the free market forces of higher interest rates, but it will try to artificially drop rates as close to zero as it can get it in order to finance the massive and growing debt of the public and private sectors as inflation rises and we continue in a higher inflation environment. </p><p>This creates another crisis in about 10 years. </p><p>Since banks are insolvent in any of these scenarios, we may still see hundreds of bank failures which will lead to further centralization of the banking system. </p><p>We will likely see the continued trend of banking Canadianization in the U.S., where 500 to 1,000 small and medium banks fail and get absorbed by larger banks. </p><p>The FDIC cannot resolve this many banks, which is why the Fed is acting as the loan shark of last resort. </p><p>The Fed absorbs up to $2 trillion of treasuries from the insolvent banks as they default on their loans from the Fed.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>How Do You Protect Yourself? </h2><p>Diversification out of dollar savings and into more scarce assets is wise. Global index funds, gold, farm land, bitcoin, etc. are all attractive options to protect and grow your purchasing power. </p><p>The response to the crisis is likely going to be more of the same: printing money and bailouts. </p><p>The purchasing power of the dollar will continue to decline against scarce assets like gold and bitcoin. </p><p>Most people reading this will not have enough money to invest into something like farmland, and while dollar-cost averaging into index funds has historically been a great bet, it has the same counterparty risks to a banking system collapse and capital controls as keeping money in the bank does. </p><p>Compared to gold, bitcoin is the fastest horse in the race and it is likely to increase in purchasing power faster than gold until it gets to gold parity, likely within 10 years. </p><p>For reference, the price of 1 bitcoin would have to increase by about 24 times to $678,125 per bitcoin in order for it to have the same market cap as gold.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As Bitcoin gains relevance as a post-trust, world-reserve asset and digital currency for the internet, it could rise in value significantly. <br><br>On Bitcoin’s Volatility</p><p>If you’re a wealthy investor who is nervous about bitcoin’s historical volatility, even having a conservative allocation, like 5% of your net worth, to bitcoin as an insurance plan is still a wise strategy.<br><br>If your bitcoin drops significantly in value, or if you lose conviction and sell it in a drawdown, it won’t materially affect your life. However, if bitcoin does what many of us expect it will do over the next five to eight years, a 5% allocation to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/16/small-weightings-of-bitcoin-can-have-a-positive-impact-on-portfolios.html">bitcoin could provide outsized returns</a>. </p><p>If you’re the average Canadian who doesn’t have a significant net worth and lives paycheck to paycheck, saving a larger portion of every check in bitcoin with a five-to-10-year timeframe could change your life significantly. It did mine.<br><br>As a bootstrapped internet entrepreneur with no investing experience, I learned about money, the banking system and diversified investment strategies over the last 15 years managing my own wealth. <br><br>I started with a small allocation to bitcoin in 2011, and even though I’ve made many mistakes along the way during my school-of-hard-knocks education, the small bitcoin allocation has become the majority of my net worth. <br><br>I still hold other assets like gold, index funds, real estate and cash. I’ve held bitcoin through many volatile drops of 50% to 80% and I’m still buying bitcoin today with free cashflow. </p><p>Always expect the price of bitcoin to drop by at least 50% from where you bought it — volatility is part of bitcoin’s story as it bootstraps its way to become a global store of value. It’s imperative that you think about bitcoin as a long-term savings play, not a trade.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://genbiz.com/the-looming-millennial-wealth-transfer-60-trillion-up-for-grabs#:~:text=Globally%2C%20it%20is%20estimated%20that,future%20of%20the%20global%20economy.">$60 trillion wealth transfer</a> coming from the silent generation and boomers to the younger generations.

    </figure><p>Bitcoin has a credibly-scarce, disinflationary supply cap of 21 million, enforced by math, auditable by anyone and resistant to change by central planners, insiders or governments. </p><p>With an ever-increasing demand for BTC by younger, digital-native generations in their high-earning years, who will soon see a massive wealth transfer, the growth outlook for bitcoin is likely to only keep rising. </p><p>Also, it’s worth noting that bitcoin buyers typically have very high conviction. You can see in the data that the majority of bitcoin holders understand what they are buying, and they are willing to hold and even buy more through large drawdowns. </p><p>When the price of bitcoin peaked in 2021 and went through a bear market in 2022, dropping more than 70% from the high — the long-term holders actually increased their positions:</p><figure>

Bitcoin educators and influencers typically advocate a DCA strategy to avoid the follies of trying to time the market and become a trader. </p><p>Saving trumps trading in 90% of cases. </p><h2>‘Should I Buy Bitcoin Or One Of The Other Cryptos?’</h2><p>A common misconception about Bitcoin is that it is the same as “crypto.” </p><p>If I were to stress anything that you could take away from this, it’s that Bitcoin is not the same as crypto. </p><p>Most people would do well if they just ignored crypto and learned as much as they could about Bitcoin. </p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>, also known as “the 80/20 rule,” applies to Bitcoin. My advice to most of my friends and family member who ask me about other coins to buy is this: <br><br>You will achieve 80% of the results of active crypto traders with 20% of the effort if you simply save in and learn about BTC, ignore crypto and hold your BTC for 10 years.<br></p><figure>

    </figure><p>At this point, most of the over 1 million crypto tokens are actually some variation of a Ponzi scheme, and <a href="https://www.hedgewithcrypto.com/how-many-cryptos-have-failed/">many of them have been exploding over the last two years</a> because they have no value aside from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory">greater fool theory</a>. </p><p>Not all of them are Ponzis. Some of them are just pump-and-dump meme investments, risky bets or even would-be “next bitcoin” competitors. A small percentage of them might have some legitimate value into the future.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve seen the top-25 or -50 crypto tokens and thought you should buy ETH, BNB or XRP to diversify into “crypto” as a whole rather than just simply save in bitcoin. </p><p>In this case, I strongly advise you to remember the Pareto principle and learn more about Bitcoin. You should do the work to understand why Bitcoin is valuable before you try to understand any of the cryptocurrency tickers. </p><p>In the significant majority of cases, whether it’s Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin or an NFT from your favorite influencer, buying a crypto token is more like VC investing, buying penny stocks, forex trading, gambling or other forms of speculation. </p><p>Bitcoin is saving. Crypto is speculation. <br><br>Speculators can make money, but unless you want to be glued to charts, consuming crypto content for 80 hours a week while also learning how to be a professional portfolio and risk manager, you probably won’t come out ahead.</p><p>If you wouldn’t find yourself on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">r/wallstreetbets</a> looking for the next YOLO bet on a meme stock, then don’t bother learning about Ethereum, DeFi, Web3, NFTs or “degen” crypto trading schemes. </p><p>If you <em>would</em> find yourself on r/wallstreetbets looking for the next get-rich-quick bet… do yourself a favor and do not drink the crypto kool aid. </p><p>There is no such thing as “the next Bitcoin.” Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin.</p><figure>

Most successful people in crypto have gone out on the moral risk curve, and exploited their reputations and insider access. They <a href="https://time.com/6171307/influencer-scams-crypto/">get paid to promote coins</a>, launch their own coins or get into presales.

    </figure><p><a href="https://bittrex.com">Bittrex</a>, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange platform founded in 2014, has filed for bankruptcy in the state of Delaware. The decision comes after the company previously announced that it would be ceasing all operations in the U.S. effective April 30th as a result of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-78">charges</a> against the firm and its former CEO for operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. However, this announcement does not impact Bittrex Global, according to a <a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10840250329245">statement</a> released by the company, which will continue its operations as usual for customers outside of the U.S.</p><p>For customers who did not withdraw their funds from the platform prior to the end of April, the company has stated that their funds remain “safe and secure.” While the Bankruptcy Court will ultimately decide the method by which those funds can be claimed by and distributed to customers, the company stated its intentions to activate those accounts as soon as possible so that customers who meet the necessary regulatory requirements can withdraw their funds.</p><p>Bittrex has also retained Omni Agent Solutions to provide email and website updates to customers. The company has encouraged affected customers to visit their website during this process, as they will provide additional information as it becomes available, and customers will also receive information directly from the bankruptcy court.</p><p>In the released statement, the company said, "Our main priority is to ensure that our customers are made whole. We are committed to working through the bankruptcy process in a way that is transparent and compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience during this time."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNjYwMTg3NDc0NDcwNTYz/bitcoin-magazine-euclosed.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[High Bitcoin Fees From BRC-20 And Ordinals Lead To Controversy And Challenges]]></title><description><![CDATA[New developments on Bitcoin have created a bull market for mining fees, causing great controversy within the Bitcoin Twitter community.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges</guid><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fees]]></category><category><![CDATA[Inscriptions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[BRC-20]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[transaction fees]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 18:23:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDMwNTgzOTcxNjUzNTMw/bitcoin-inflation-price-rising-bullish-chart.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>The fees collected in a single block of Bitcoin transactions have surpassed the block reward, a testament to the growing demand for block space as a result of Ordinals and BRC-20. Given that this is the first time this has happened without the price of bitcoin being in a significant bull market, it is a milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin, as it reinforces the growing potential for transaction fees to sustain the network's operations.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/druidian/status/1655573159188283392?s=20">According to Dustin Trammell</a>, CEO of Trammell Venture Partners, the first time that the fees in a block surpassed the block reward was in block 500,521 in 2017. <br><br>The rise in transaction fees can be attributed to the introduction of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/ordinals-1">Ordinals</a> and BRC-20. Inscriptions, sets of data inscribed utilizing the Ordinals protocol, already pumped up the fee market and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-inscriptions-impact-bitcoin-block-space">began impacting</a> mempools within the last couple of months. But <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-brc-20-token-standard-becomes-a-new-destination-for-meme-tokens">BRC-20</a>, a recently-introduced token standard which allows tokens to be tied to the Bitcoin blockchain, has created an economic incentive with minting, most often done on the smallest UTXO size possible, leading to the recent competition for block space.<br><br>This has led users to pay higher and higher fees to ensure that their transactions are processed faster, as miners naturally prioritize bitcoin transactions with higher fees to maximize their profits.</p><p>On top of that, the recent rise in Bitcoin's price has also contributed to an increase (although small) in transaction fees, as users are willing to pay more to move their bitcoin holdings around. The combination of these factors has resulted in a significant increase in the revenue earned by miners from transaction fees, which is now exceeding the fixed block reward in certain blocks.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The increase in fees has had a measurable impact on businesses that utilize both on-chain bitcoin and Lightning. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has had to <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419622764720128?s=20">halt and restart bitcoin withdrawals</a> twice, claiming network congestion was the reason. As a result, the firm has stated that it is looking into <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419624962527233?s=20">integrating Lightning</a> in order to better facilitate small withdrawals during high fee environments. Francis Pouliot, CEO of Bull Bitcoin, a Canadian, bitcoin-only non-custodial exchange, took to Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1654595297199247361?s=20">saying</a> “I think it's important for bitcoiners to know how increased fees w/o increased tx volume and price pumps affect business like ours.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not just businesses, either — citizens in countries that rely on bitcoin are <a href="https://twitter.com/MarceMR19/status/1655378068083470336?s=20">seeing difficulties</a>, as the fees for on-chain transactions are significant sums of money for many — and Lightning is <a href="https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1655508866233253891?s=20">not always available</a> yet.</p><p>Bitcoin’s security market <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-security-without-mining-subsidy">has long</a> been a <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1597320944846254080?s=20">center of debate</a>, as, save for price bull runs, block space has largely remained cheap since Bitcoin’s inception. </p><p>While the fixed block reward is set to decrease over time, the rise in transaction fees can offset this reduction and ensure that miners continue to be incentivized to process Bitcoin transactions. But many individuals on Bitcoin Twitter seemingly disagree with Ordinals and BRC-20 fulfilling Bitcoin’s fee market security role, <a href="https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin/status/1655235807458873349?s=20">calling</a> the flood of transactions a “DoS attack.” </p><p>Anita Posch, a Bitcoiner focused on global adoption, also <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1655459803957739520?s=20">highlighted challenges with adoption on Twitter, asking</a>, “Can anyone explain how I'm going to onboard people with these fees? Can't use on-chain, can't open channels. Makes custodial Lightning the only option.”</p><p>Others are <a href="https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1655507730436698112?s=20">quick to remind</a> their fellow Bitcoiners that this phenomenon is not something that can be easily reversed, and was <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinIsaiah/status/1655467258804576262?s=20">eventually inevitable</a> — the increase in fees is a major incentive for miners to continue facilitating the transactions that cause it. </p><p>“BRC-20's purpose so far has been the highlighting of certain friction points within the Bitcoin community and sparking a very necessary debate about immutability, censorship and what Bitcoin is and is supposed to be.” AngelBlock CEO Alex Strzesniewski said in regards to the controversy. “A debate that is long overdue.” </p><p>While the debate continues, the free market and built-in incentives of Bitcoin will resolve the situation in whichever way the network finds most valuable.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDMwNTgzOTcxNjUzNTMw/bitcoin-inflation-price-rising-bullish-chart.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3ODA2MTI2NDkyODIxMjk4/image1.png" height="281" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Is The Lifeline Argentina Desperately Needs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Facing inflation, rising interest rates and reliance on the U.S. dollar, Argentina could solve many of its problems with Bitcoin adoption.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Argentina]]></category><category><![CDATA[inflation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jonathan Buck]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNjYwMTg3MjA2MzYyNjEw/bitcoin-magazine-argentina.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jonathan Buck, founder of JB &amp; GS Mining GmbH, a German bitcoin mining hosting company.</em></p><p>Argentina is currently in the midst of a crippling inflation crisis, with the national currency, the Argentine peso (ARS), losing value at an alarming rate. Just one year ago, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USD-ARS?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBkoWyrtf-AhXskIkEHTepD0EQmY0JegQIBxAd&amp;window=1Y">the exchange rate from the U.S. dollar to the ARS</a> was 115.75, and at the time of this writing, it stands at 224.52. Reports indicate that on the black market, people are <a href="https://en.mercopress.com/2023/04/21/argentine-peso-keeps-sinking-against-us-dollar">paying more than double this rate</a>. The country's annual <a href="https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/argentinas-annual-inflation-jumps-to-104-worst-since-1991/">inflation rate has skyrocketed to a staggering 104%</a>, presenting significant challenges to both its economy and citizens. In response, the country’s central bank has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-argentina-central-bank-debate-155309902.html">raised interest rates to an astounding 81%</a>.</p><p>As the peso's value continues to nosedive, Argentinians urgently need a reliable store of value to safeguard their wealth. Enter Bitcoin, often referred to as “digital gold,” a trustless decentralized system with a capped supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity <a href="https://www.jbgsmining.com/en/post/deflation-a-misunderstood-economic-phenomenon">ensures that bitcoin's value remains less susceptible to inflationary erosion</a>. As such, by adopting Bitcoin, Argentinians can shield their assets from the rapidly-depreciating peso and maintain their purchasing power.</p><h2>Financial Inclusion And Empowerment For All</h2><p>A significant portion of Argentina's population is unbanked<a href="https://www.equifax.com/newsroom/all-news/-/story/supporting-expanded-credit-access-in-argentina/"> (estimated at 51% in 2021)</a> or underbanked, often due to strict requirements from financial institutions, high fees or insufficient access to traditional banking services. But the decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows for easier access to financial services, regardless of one's socio-economic background. Embracing Bitcoin could enable financial inclusion for Argentina's citizens, empowering them to participate in the global economy. This, in turn, could potentially drive economic growth and reduce wealth inequality.</p><p>Argentina's reliance on foreign currencies, <a href="https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/argentina-remains-hooked-on-dollar-dependence.phtml">such as the U.S. dollar</a>, has contributed to its precarious economic situation. Bitcoin can provide a more stable alternative to the peso and decrease the country's dependency on foreign currencies. As a global currency, bitcoin is less vulnerable to local economic fluctuations and can help insulate Argentina from external shocks. Additionally, Bitcoin's decentralized nature prevents manipulation by central banks or governments, ensuring a more transparent and stable financial system.</p><p>In conclusion, bitcoin offers a much-needed lifeline to Argentina as it battles its inflation crisis. By embracing this digital currency, the country can secure a more stable financial future for its citizens, promote financial inclusion and reduce its reliance on foreign currencies. As Argentina seeks a solution to its economic problems, Bitcoin may very well be the key to overcoming its challenges.</p><p>Argentina is facing a severe inflation crisis, with the Argentine peso rapidly losing value. Bitcoin could provide a solution by acting as a stable store of value, promoting financial inclusion and reducing reliance on foreign currencies.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jonathan Buck.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics. He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.</em></p><p>Whether it’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">Patriot Act</a>, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/freedom-and-privacy-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">COVID-19 measures</a> or the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RESTRICT_Act">RESTRICT Act</a>, it seems that the only thing U.S. politicians can agree on is that taking away freedoms is essential. <em>It’s for your own safety, you see. And we can’t forget about security, too. Who wouldn’t want to be safe and secure?</em></p><p>The unilateral agreement around these measures has made the phrase “bipartisan” a warning sign in my eyes and I am increasingly concerned about the direction we’re moving. </p><h2>Bread, Circuses And Conflict</h2><p>I was criticized on NOSTR recently for covering environmentalist Bitcoiners, the justification being that the environmentalist movement is a net negative for society. While I understand where this individual who criticized me is coming from, I think there are some deeper concerns at hand hidden behind their comments. </p><p>After some reflection, I came to a realization: People are not really concerned with the environmentalist movement. In fact, people are not really concerned about politics at all. Most political disagreements are surface-level proxy wars for a much deeper argument: the argument over control. </p><p>Who is going to have control? What are they going to use it for? How is this going to affect my life?</p><p>As governments expand at increasing rates, the fear over who has control grows along with it. I think this is the root of the polarization we’re seeing today. The real concern is about central planners and central planning. Everything else is a distraction. I think that’s the real psyop. </p><h2>Bitcoin Defunds Central Planners</h2><p>As more and more people adopt bitcoin as their savings vehicle, we can begin to grow the parallel economy and take the exorbitant privilege of money printing out of the hands of those who would seek to abuse it. </p><p>In doing so, we can slowly but surely defund the central planners that so many are fearful of. In doing so, we can reduce the level of control that keeps us up at night. In doing so, we can reduce the amount of political polarization that is seemingly tearing the country apart. </p><p>I think that too many are fighting the wrong fight and missing the forest for the trees. If Bitcoin is truly incorruptible, then why do you care who chooses to support it? Why not give everyone a chance to have their egos and preconceptions about the world absolutely shattered by this permissionless monetary protocol. </p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone. We can’t allow the culture wars to manipulate us into friendly fire. We can’t allow political narratives to co-opt Bitcoin into a weapon for politicians to wield against us. It doesn’t matter if you win your little skirmish if the war engulfs you shortly thereafter. </p><p>The faster we can gain adoption, the faster we can make all these petty arguments irrelevant. Once central planners lose their ability to control, your neighbors' vote becomes less of a concern. Without the ability to print money, governments suddenly have to think about trade offs again.

In other words, whatever is most likely standing in the way of this person being converted.</p><p>Let’s therefore start with the main orange-pilling obstacles, before a solution is presented.</p><h2>Why ‘Selling’ Something As Great As Bitcoin Is So Hard</h2><p>The challenge of orange-pilling newbies boils down to three things, and all three mutually reinforce each other to make it even harder:</p><figure>

    </figure><p><strong>1. Fiat paradigm blindness mixed with fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD)</strong></p><p>When I prompted it, OpenAI defined “paradigm blindness” as the “inability to recognize or fully understand the assumptions and frameworks that shape one's beliefs, values and actions.”</p><p>Bitcoin is a paradigm-breaking innovation, and it’s therefore hard to truly grasp its value without breaking out of the “comfort zone” of the indoctrinated fiat paradigm.</p><p>A lot of the FUD is generated by this “fear of the unknown,” in addition to the fear of losing money.</p><p><strong>2. The skeptic “power-position” compensation (resistance to being “lectured”).</strong></p><figure>

    </figure><p>Nobody likes being in the “submissive” position of being “lectured,” and few are humble enough to admit that they “don’t know” something. </p><p>Any orange-pilling attempt thus creates an equal and opposite force of resistance in them, and this is especially true if you try to convince them in person.</p><p>Remaining “skeptical” gives them the perceived “power position” and “upper hand,” which is why people love to proclaim how “skeptical” they are.</p><p><strong>3. The blind men and the elephant dilemma (the “holistic-understanding killer”).</strong></p><figure>

    </figure><p>As all sales people know, logic and arguments are there to retrospectively rationalize decisions (or reinforce ingrained positions). A true change of mind is always a paradigm shift (small or big), and leaving the comfort zone of the old, ingrained paradigm is always a “leap of faith.” </p><p>Logic alone is seldom a strong enough catalyst and motivator for that to happen. This is why the purely-educational approach seldom is enough to break a newbie's self-reinforcing, fiat-paradigm-blindness, FUD loop.</p><p>In addition, the educational approach takes too long, and it’s too boring/technical for the “instant gratification” fiat mindset. </p><p>What is needed is another semi-conscious force that's equally powerful to FUD; namely fear of missing out (FOMO). If the level of FOMO eclipses and exceeds the level of FUD, people will convert. Simple as that.</p><h2>Making Bitcoin Irresistible To The Fiat-Minded Nocoiner</h2><p>This was always the first question I would ask myself when starting a new sales page copywriting gig:</p><p>“How do I present this offer in a way that’s absolutely, mouthwateringly irresistible to the target audience?”</p><p>The example below clearly illustrates the difference between feature-oriented “education” and “sexy,” benefit-oriented persuasion:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NjY0NjkyNjgzMDI0MTc4/ipod-marketing.png" height="377" width="620">

    </figure><p>Do you see the massive difference in perceived value? </p><p>Boring, educational, feature focus is a classic “rookie mistake” in the world of ad copywriting, and it’s an epidemic in the world of orange pilling. </p><p>It’s easy to believe that people need to “understand” Bitcoin before they would “invest” their hard-earned fiat into it. </p><p>The truth is, however, that Mr. Normie Nocoiner is <em>less</em> likely to “invest” the more you try to make him understand Bitcoin.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NjY0NjkyNjgyOTU4NjQy/bad-explanation.png" height="776" width="620">

    </figure><p>It’s hard to “sell” people on Bitcoin when you focus on the features. </p><p>Paradoxically, Bitcoin sells itself to anyone who <em>does</em> understand it, and the reason why is simple: Bitcoin is the best deal in town. It’s an absolutely, 100% irresistible offer.</p><p>This is why every Bitcoiner is doing everything they can to get their hands on as much bitcoin as humanly possible. The key takeaway here is the “irresistible offer” part.</p><p>There is a massive difference between trying to “educate” normies about Bitcoin, and in presenting Bitcoin as the irresistible offer that it is. </p><p>With that in mind, let’s forget about “peer-to-peer,” “permissionless” and “decentralized” for a moment. Let’s instead dive into:</p><h2>Bitcoin: The Irresistible Offer</h2><p>Normies do not need to be confused by the technical monster that is Bitcoin (repeat that sentence a few times for yourself, and sense the sigh of relief it gives you).</p><p>Nor do they need to understand the history of money, what “sound money” is, or why proof of work is such a big deal.</p><p>Mr. Normie Nocoiner only needs one single thing to “click” in his mind to be orange pilled on the spot, and that is to see a deal that’s irresistible.</p><p>In essence: What will push Mr. Normie Nocoiner to take the “leap of faith” into Bitcoin boils down to three things:</p><ol><li>A clear vision of the deal that a bitcoin “investment” represents (not what Bitcoin “is” or even what it “does”).</li><li>A justified sense of urgency and FOMO.</li><li>A clear understanding of why the deal is so irresistibly good (and why holding zero bitcoin is a far bigger risk than getting off zero).</li></ol><p>Without further ado, here is my ultra-simple orange-pilling formula. It opens with the following question:</p><p>“So, what do you think will happen to the price of bitcoin once a critical mass realizes that Bitcoin mining not only solves global warming, but also the global energy crisis?”</p><p>This flies right in the face of what they’ve most likely been programmed by the media to believe, so it will definitely get their attention and make them curious.</p><p>I then follow up by reminding them that bitcoin has absolute scarcity, and that most of the supply is already in the hands of long-term holders who already understand where this is going.</p><p>You will most likely get tons of resistance when making the above claim about Bitcoin mining, which is good. It clears the space for you to present irrefutable proof elements to back it up.</p><p>You must have these proof elements ready up front, of course, and it’s a good idea to store them on your phone. You will find plenty of ammo in the orange-pilling rabbit hole that I have created over at <a href="https://bitcoinmaxinews.com/">Bitcoin Maxi News</a>.</p><p>Once they see the proof elements of how Bitcoin mining is already being used to mitigate methane emissions (which is far worse than CO2 when it comes to the “greenhouse effect”), and how it balances the grid and incentivizes the buildout of renewable energy, well, at the very least, you’ve given them something to think about.</p><p>You can then repeat the initial question, and remind them that this early-bird opportunity will not last forever. This starts a “ticking FOMO clock” in their mind, as nobody wants to miss out on a great deal.</p><p>Explain that they don’t have to go “all in,” and that owning as little as 0.2 to 0.5 BTC can turn into generational wealth for their family when all this goes mainstream.</p><p>Close by saying that owning zero BTC is the biggest financial risk they can take, and that knowing these things is akin to having fully-legal “insider knowledge” that 98% of the population doesn’t know about — yet.</p><p>With this approach, you avoid all of the technical, confusing and boring stuff, and you present Bitcoin as the sexy and irresistible offer that it is, all within a few minutes’ time.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by SV.

This reduction event is called the bitcoin halving (or “halvening” in some circles). </p><p>When Bitcoin miners successfully find a block of transactions that links a set of new transactions to the previous block of already confirmed transactions, they are rewarded in newly created bitcoin. The bitcoin that is freshly created and awarded to the winning miner with each block is called the block subsidy. This subsidy combined with transaction fees sent by users who pay to get their transaction confirmed is called the block reward. The block subsidy and reward incentivizes the use of computing power to keep the Bitcoin code running.</p><p>When bitcoin was first released to the public, the block subsidy was 50 bitcoin. After the first halving in 2012, this number was reduced to 25 bitcoin, then 12.5 bitcoin in 2016. Most recently, the bitcoin halving occurred on May 11, 2020, with miners currently receiving 6.25 bitcoin per new block.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin issuance gets reduced in half roughly every four years.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>The next halving is coming up in about one year. The exact date will depend on the amount of hash power that joins or leaves the network, as this impacts the speed at which blocks are found. Estimates for the next halving range from late April to early May 2024. After the next halving, the block subsidy will be reduced to 3.125 bitcoin.</p><p>In the past, the bitcoin price rose considerably after the halving, albeit many months after the subsidy was reduced. Every halving cycle, there is a debate about whether or not the halving is priced in. This question considers the fact that the halving is a well-known event and attempts to address if the market would factor this into bitcoin’s exchange rate.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzNjIxMDA4Njg1/bitcoin-halving-cycles.png" height="399" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The bitcoin price has typically gone through an exponential appreciation after the halving.</figcaption>
    </figure><h3>Long-Term Holder Dynamics</h3><p>Our primary thesis is that the halving leads to a demand-driven event in bitcoin, as market participants become acutely aware of bitcoin’s absolute digital scarcity. This leads to a rapid phase of exchange rate appreciation. This hypothesis is somewhat divergent from the main narrative, which is that a supply-driven event instigates the exponential increase in price because miners earn fewer bitcoin for the same amount of energy expended and put less selling pressure on the market.</p><p>When we look closely at the data, we can see that the supply shock is often already in place — the HODL army has already staked their ground, if you will. On the margin, the reduction of supply hitting the market does make a material difference in the daily market clearing rate, but the increase in price is due to a demand-driven phenomenon that hits an entirely illiquid supply on the sell side with holders who are forged in the depths of the bear market unwilling to part with their bitcoin until price appreciates by approximately an order of magnitude.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzODg5NTEwMTk0/long-term-bitcoin-holders-percentage-of-supply.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Trends in long-term holder supply sets the floor and tops of market cycles.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Statistically speaking, long-term holders are the least likely to sell their bitcoin and the current supply is held tightly by this cohort. The people who were buying and holding bitcoin while the exchange rate was down approximately 80% are now the dominant majority share of the free float supply. </p><p>The halving reinforces the reality of Bitcoin’s supply inelasticity to changing demand. As education and understanding about bitcoin’s superior monetary properties further perpetuate across the world, there will be an influx of demand while its inelastic supply makes the price rise exponentially. It isn’t until a large share of the convicted holders part with a proportion of their previously dormant stash that the exchange rate crashes from a feverish high.</p><p>These holding and spending patterns are very well quantifiable, with an entirely transparent and immutable ledger to document it all.</p><p>We know that the long-term holders are the ones setting the floor in the bear market, but they are also the ones setting tops in bull markets. Many people look to the halving’s supply shock as what drives the increase in price, with miners earning fewer coins while still needing to sell some in order to pay their bills that have remained the same cost in dollar terms (or the local currency terms). We can observe miners’ net position change overlaid with the bitcoin price and see the impact of their accumulation and selling.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzODg5NTc1MjEz/bitcoin-miner-net-position-change.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Miner net position overlaid with the bitcoin price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>There is clearly a relationship between the bitcoin price and whether miners are accumulating or selling, but correlation does not equal causation and when we include the behavior of long-term holders, we can see how much larger the tide of holder accumulation and distribution is compared to miner sell pressure. The chart below shows the same miner net position change as above, but overlays it with long-term holder net position change, both measuring the net accumulation and distribution of the two cohorts over a 30-day period, displayed on the same y-axis. When we compare the two, it is difficult to see the miner net position change (red) in relation to the much more prominent position change of long-term holders (blue). While miner sell pressure receives all of the press, the real driver of the bitcoin cycle is the convicted holders, who set the floor with accumulation, compressing the proverbial spring for the next wave of incoming demand.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Miner net position compared to long-term holder net position demonstrates the difference in scale and affect on the price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Long-term holders tend to distribute their coins as bitcoin makes its parabolic rise and then begin reaccumulating after the price corrects. We can look at long-term holder spending habits to see how the change in long-term holder supply is what ultimately helps the price cool off after a parabolic rise.</p><p>On-chain data shows that coins that haven’t moved for over six months currently have an average spend price that stays relatively flat during the entirety of the bear market — compared to the volatility of the market-to-market exchange rate. What occurs during the bear market is simply a reshuffling of the deck: UTXOs are exchanging hands from the speculator to the convicted, from the overleveraged to the ones who have free cash flow.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Long-term and short-term holder spending price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>During periods of market frenzy to the upside, the outflow of coins from long-term holders is much larger than the sum of daily issuance, while the opposite can be true in the depths of the bear — holders are absorbing far greater amounts of coins than the sum of new issuance. </p><p>We have been in a net accumulation regime for two years, while wiping out nearly the entire derivative complex in the process. Today’s long-term holders have coins that did not budge during the Three Arrows Capital blowup or the FTX fiasco.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The red area of the chart shows a pattern of long-term accumulation.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>To demonstrate just how much conviction long-term holders have in this asset, we can observe coins that haven’t moved for one, two and three years. The chart below shows the percentage of UTXOs that have remained dormant over these timeframes. We can see that 67.02% of bitcoin hasn’t changed hands in one year, 53.39% in two years, and 39.75% in three years. While these aren’t perfect metrics for analyzing HODLer behavior, they show that at the very least there is a significant amount of the total supply that is held by people who have little intention of selling these coins anytime soon.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The amount of bitcoin supply that hasn't been active for more than one, two and three years is increasing.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Aside from bitcoin becoming harder to produce at the margin, the halving event’s most likely contribution to bitcoin is the marketing around it. At this point, the predominant majority of the world is familiar with bitcoin, but few understand the radical concept of absolute scarcity. With each halving, the media coverage is larger and more significant. </p><p>Bitcoin stands alone with its algorithmic and fixed monetary policy in a world of arbitrary, bureaucratic fiscal policy gone astray and a never ending stream of debt monetization policies.</p><p>The 2024 halving, less than 52,000 bitcoin blocks away, will again reinforce the narrative of supply inelasticity, while an overwhelming majority of the circulating supply is held by holders who are entirely disinterested in parting with their share.&nbsp;</p><h3>Final Note:</h3><p>Despite the halving’s lessening effect in relative terms after each cycle, the upcoming event will serve as a reality check for the market, particularly for those who begin to feel that they have insufficient exposure to the asset. As the programmatic monetary policy of Bitcoin continues to work exactly as designed, approximately 92% of the terminal supply is already in circulation, and the commencement of yet another supply issuance halving event will only reinforce the narrative of apolitical money and bitcoin’s unique digital scarcity will come into focus more sharply.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Matt Maraia, </em><em>a CPA focused on how changes to accounting regulations impact the Bitcoin community.</em></p><p>Today, companies spend egregious amounts of money on credit card fees when processing customer payments, ultimately cutting into margins that are widely scrutinized by investors and management alike. </p><p>But the Lightning Network presents a new payment solution with the ability to process instantaneous payments (using Bitcoin) for virtually no fees. It boasts equivalent decentralized safeguards to the Bitcoin network, ultimately using Bitcoin’s blockchain, which has not been hacked since its inception in 2009. While doubt among the general public about bitcoin manifests itself in the asset’s price volatility, this innovative technology built on top of “Bitcoin rails” poses a unique opportunity for CEOs and CFOs to improve profitability. </p><p>In fact, you can be anti-Bitcoin and still be able to extract the advantages of the Lightning Network into your company’s payment processes, avoiding the issues of bitcoin price variability. </p><p>Here are some of the biggest advantages of adopting the Lightning Network for businesses:</p><h2>Improving Margins, Reducing Fees </h2><p>With<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/jenny-craig-planning-mass-layoffs-shutting-down-weight-loss-centers"> mass layoffs</a> circulating the market, investors and managers understandably continue to scrutinize margins — every dollar matters and can spell disaster without proper planning and foresight. </p><p>The Lightning Network helps to alleviate these pressures by way of minimal transaction fees. On average, payments made via credit card amount to <a href="https://thepaymentsassociation.org/article/bitcoin-lightning-as-a-payment-rail/">about 3% in fees</a> owed to intermediary financial institutions. The Lightning Network opens up the possibility to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">process payments at a fraction of the cost</a> by using micropayment channels. While it is unlikely that an entire customer base will immediately transact through the Lightning Network, even transitioning 25% of credit card payments could significantly improve margins. </p><h2>Benefitting From Consistent Innovation </h2><p>Without delving into the superfluous details of how Lightning operates behind the scenes, the innovations materializing in the space remain frequent. </p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/">IBEX Pay</a> operates as a web application service that allows merchants to create an invoice on demand, generate a QR code to be scanned by the buyer with any Lightning wallet and process payment via Lightning instantaneously. Merchants can opt to receive payment based on the user-designated ratio of BTC to USD. </p><p>For companies with point-of-sale (PoS) terminals, S<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/jack-mallers-adding-bitcoin-to-major-pos-networks">trike is developing Lightning Network compatibility for many of those</a> while offering similar benefits to the IBEX Pay platform in both efficiency and cost effectiveness. And most of these services do not require monthly subscription fees. </p><h2>Instant Settlement </h2><p>Another benefit of using the Lightning Network is a near-immediate settlement of funds. No longer are companies required to wait two to three business days for ACH/wire payments to settle to access capital via “fiat rails.” Intermediaries are removed with the use of the Lightning Network, permitting fast access to capital while limiting counterparty risk. </p><h2>A Built-In Customer Base </h2><p>Although customer bases are highly dependent on the goods or services offered by a company, there is a large contingent of Bitcoin supporters who prefer and often seek out vendors that operate directly or indirectly within the Bitcoin environment. </p><p>Many Bitcoin advocates use websites such as <a href="https://btcmap.org/">btcmap.org</a> and <a href="https://satmap.app/">satmap.app</a> to find businesses that accept bitcoin. Given that the Lightning Network is a layer built on top of the Bitcoin network, adopting it can provide you with an ever-growing, built-in customer base that is hungry to contribute to and share the successes of businesses operating under the Bitcoin umbrella. </p><h2>Limitations And Risks</h2><p>Still, the relative infancy of the Lightning Network means there are potential limitations and risks. </p><p>For instance, IBEX Pay <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/support">currently offers a maximum $2,500 transaction size</a>. Additionally, and as with any new technology, while the network is gaining traction, there are still potential risks with bugs and other vulnerabilities. Recent traction in popularity has helped to lessen concerns over this proof of concept, but without decades of data points to lean on, there is no guarantee issues will not emerge. Lastly, a current lack of regulatory clarity in the digital asset realm could potentially lead to more questions later. </p><p>With all that said, the Lightning Network provides companies with a competitive advantage from a financial, operational and technological standpoint, though there are some concerns due to the relative infancy of the product in addition to existing limitations in current solutions. However, rather than standing by and suffering through the oncoming margin pressures that continue to infiltrate the economy, it is worthwhile to take action and adapt. </p><p>My recommendation for business owners out there is to trial run implementing this solution for at least a small segment of your business and to build out enough of a sample size to compare to current payment processes. What’s the worst-case scenario here? You are not reaping the benefits outlined herein, but you are without collateral damage to your business. The best? You are a first mover in a technology that aims to interrupt the payment processing space, coupled with increasing margins and gaining quicker access to customer payments. </p><p>The decision is yours. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Matt Maraia.

    </figure><p>The academy was created by <a href="https://bentaus.com">Bentaus</a>, a company that signed a Master Training and Education Services Agreement to develop the course. The Bitcoin Blockchain technician course aims to provide students with a technical understanding of the infrastructure of Bitcoin, specifically mining. It is designed to be a hands-on course that will allow students to obtain strong fundamentals in one of the fastest growing emerging technologies today.</p><p>The course is divided into five parts: networking, electronics concepts and repair, hardware repair and maintenance, security and finance, and philosophy. It is intended for high school graduates or equivalent, with a prerequisite of basic knowledge in math, science, and finance theory. The course will be taught by Bentaus founder Robert Davidoff, who has real-world experience in the field as CEO of a mining company.</p><p>The course will begin at the Florida State College at Jacksonville with a lab of three S19s on two campuses. Thirty students will be used as the basis for all future classes. The course was approved via a Fintech Grant by the Department of Economic Opportunity of Tallahassee, Florida. The company is looking at adding additional courses in the future.</p><p>Bentaus plans to donate the course content to Indonesia to spearhead all the exciting developments to come in the country. Davidoff plans to travel to Indonesia to teach the very first course in the country.</p><p>"The goal of this course is to provide a hands-on approach to serve as an introduction course to allow for the student to obtain strong fundamentals in one of the fastest growing emerging technologies today," Davidoff explained. "This course is also suitable to be used as a springboard to a vocational school or apprenticeship/journeymen as an electrician or HVAC technician."</p><p>Students who complete the course will receive a "Blockchain Technician Certificate," which can be used to secure a job in a network operations center, a cryptocurrency mining farm, or as an elective to continue their college career in cybersecurity, programming or management of systems.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5Njg3Mjc4MTQwOTI1NzA1/screen-shot-2022-05-23-at-95610-am.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NzE2NTQ1NTU0NjIxNzQx/image.jpg" height="465" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[North Carolina House Passes Bill Prohibiting State Payments With CBDCs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Now headed to the state Senate, HB690 rectifies language that previously encompassed Bitcoin in its goal of restricting CBDC usage.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-house-passes-bill-banning-cbdc-payments</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-house-passes-bill-banning-cbdc-payments</guid><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><category><![CDATA[North Carolina]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cbdcs]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 21:25:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzOTk5NDg5MTkzODEzNTA5/bitcoin-domino.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The North Carolina House of Representatives has unanimously passed <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/House/PDF/H690v3.pdf">House Bill 690</a>, which prohibits the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) for payments to the state or any participation by the state in Federal Reserve branch testing of CBDC.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jason Maier, a teacher and author of “A Progressive’s Case For Bitcoin.” Disclaimer: This book was published by Bitcoin Magazine.</em></p><p>Does Bitcoin need progressives?</p><p>The simple answer to this question is no, Bitcoin doesn’t need progressives. We can all quote the memes by heart: Bitcoin doesn’t care. Tick tock, next block. Bitcoin is inevitable. Bitcoin can’t be regulated. I believe each of these mottos are true, in their own ways, in the long term. But recently, I have devoted a lot of energy to answering the converse of this question, namely: Do progressives need Bitcoin? </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Progressives-Case-Bitcoin-Equitable-Peaceful/dp/B0C1J3DC2X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=BHMKM398V21S&amp;keywords=a+progressive%27s+case+for+bitcoin&amp;qid=1683039479&amp;sprefix=a+progressi%2Caps%2C92&amp;sr=8-1">My book</a> answers this more intricate question thoroughly in the affirmative. And while it’s easy to conclude, with confidence, that Bitcoin doesn’t <em>need</em> progressives, it might be interesting to consider why you should care at all that I’m on a mission to orange pill as many progressive liberals as I can. It’s true that Bitcoin doesn’t care. But I think you should.</p><h2>Shortening The Long Run</h2><p>As clear as it is to me that Bitcoin will ultimately succeed, it is also clear that the support of liberals and those on the left of the political spectrum, while not an absolute necessity, is important nonetheless. Even if Bitcoin is inevitable in the long run, there is an awful lot of time between now and the end of that long run. That time can be filled with growing adoption, innovation and promoting freedom money across the planet. Or that time can be filled with political fighting at every level of every government across the globe. Plenty of people reading this may not care, or they may even welcome the fighting. But in the long run, I’ll be dead and the world would be a better place if more people understood and used Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation before my stack of corn gets passed along to my children. </p><p>There are Bitcoiners who do not align with me politically, but nonetheless support my work. These folks like to remind me that Bitcoin is money for enemies. This is not only true, but actually an important property of all “good” money. Furthermore, it is also critical to remember that, in this narrow sense, no Bitcoiner is your enemy, regardless of how they align themselves within the legacy political system. While left and right may fight about everything else, it is imperative that we unite when it comes to Bitcoin, because doing so provides our best opportunity to replace our current system <em>before</em> the end of the long term. </p><h2>Overhaul The System</h2><p>Like many people, my vision of bitcoin is that it is money for everyone. I also see it as the best tool we have to replace the corrupt, opaque and regressive global financial system which we have all inherited. At some point, the people who control the current system will actually start to fight Bitcoin and when they do, they will fight hard. The<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/28/1069190/ethereum-moved-to-proof-of-stake-why-cant-bitcoin/"> current environmental fear,uncertainty and doubt (FUD)</a> and the recent closing of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-are-breaking-up-with-crypto-during-regulatory-crackdown-22de1832">fiat onramps to crypto exchanges</a> will look quaint in comparison. Powerful interests from Washington, D.C., to High Street will be able to pull their levers to make it difficult for any non-expert to learn about bitcoin, gain access to it or store it securely. Each of the players in the current game are incentivized to keep it running as long as possible and they have access to tremendous resources to help make that happen. Perhaps, for the first time, the issue isn’t powerful interests trying to make more money, it is the very definition of money itself. It will be a war and they will pull out all the stops.</p><p>Some Bitcoiners confidently claim that Bitcoin bans don’t matter because people are able to move to places where Bitcoin isn’t banned. If Bitcoin becomes illegal in some countries, or even some states within the U.S., we might have a chance to see how difficult jurisdictional arbitrage is in practice. Those with wealth and connections may be able to move to a different country that embraces Bitcoin. Those struggling to get by will be left behind. Even <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/wbd588-ted-cruz">Ted Cruz was dismissive</a> of the idea when he quipped to a Bitcoin audience recently, “How many folks here have your El Salvadoran passports?” </p><p>I don’t often agree with Cruz, but he is right. It’s hard to see how the emergency plan of everyone moving to El Salvador can fulfill the promise that “Bitcoin is for everybody” within my lifetime. </p><p>But perhaps the goal of those currently in power won’t be to make Bitcoin illegal, but instead to just keep us fighting about it from our entrenched and polarized political viewpoints. Since their goal is to protect the current system, they likely won’t start by outlawing their competition, but instead they would just keep people arguing about it. </p><p>The best outcome for those seeking to maintain the status quo is for the public to see Bitcoin as a right versus left issue, something else to divide people while those in charge continue to benefit from the current systems. And there is every reason to think that this will happen. Currently, there are a small number of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/14/elizabeth-warren-anti-crypto-ftx-00082624">liberal politicians who regularly attempt to win political points by bashing Bitcoin</a>. If the tactic proves successful over time, others will add their voices to the chorus. On the flip side, some conservative legislators have rushed not only to support Bitcoin, but also highlight that the politicians on the left don’t. Eventually, all of the FUD, roadblocks and political fighting could reach a crescendo, at which point Bitcoin would start feeling a lot less inevitable.</p><h2>Make The War Impossible</h2><p>The window to get in front of this narrative is small and rapidly closing. My strong belief is that the secret to our collective success isn’t in convincing the politicians in power that Bitcoin is a force for good, but instead it’s in educating the citizens that vote for those politicians. We still have a chance to do so. Most pre-coiners just haven’t thought about Bitcoin a lot. I have seen that once people are given an opportunity to learn and ask questions, they are often convinced of Bitcoin’s value proposition. However the converse can also be true. If we get to the point where the government tries to ban Bitcoin, there will likely be a large swath of the population that will conclude that it must be bad. If public sentiment turns from “bitcoin is pretend money” to “Bitcoin is a bad thing for bad people,” it will be hard to unring that bell. Such an outcome doesn’t make Bitcoin’s success any less likely in the long run, but it can push back adoption, innovation, the building of infrastructure and education by decades. This would not only lock us in an outdated system, but also delay the real-life benefits that Bitcoin offers to the people who need this technology now. </p><p>Because of Bitcoin’s superior monetary properties, it will eventually win and become a preferred method of storing and transferring value among the world’s citizens. We know those currently in power are incentivized to fight Bitcoin. If given the chance, they will. But, even though we could win their war, we still have an opportunity to make such a war politically impossible in the first place. Doing so should be considered an imperative. <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/ten-million-bitcoiners-the-intransigent-minority/">Cory Klippsten makes a similar argument</a>, employing <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15">Nassim Taleb’s framework</a> of “The Intransigent Minority.” Klippsten’s claim is that if Bitcoin reaches 10 million supporters in the United States, that small but unmoving minority will make it practically impossible to fight the technology.</p><p>Even if imperfect, the schematic holds some intuitive value. Let’s say for the sake of argument that Klippsten’s 10 million number is correct. It would be foolish to think that we will reach that goal (in “<a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/the-race-to-avoid-the-war/">The Race To Avoid The War</a>”) without intentionally expanding the scope of our target audience. So far, progressives remain a fairly-untapped option for such an expansion. Further, our coalition of 10 million will be stronger and more antifragile if it is heterogeneous across the political spectrum. A robust coalition of Bitcoiners that spans the political spectrum will be impossible to ignore and harder to fight. This is why I, and many others like me, are bringing the case for Bitcoin to progressive people however we can. I think that should matter to you.</p><h2>Bitcoin Doesn’t Care, But You Should</h2><p>The world needs us to orange pill progressives. I very much want to reach Klippsten’s 10 million target and see the intransigent minority of Bitcoiners shape the future of money. The good news is that there is a growing catalog of Bitcoin educational resources offered through a progressive lens. There is also a growing and vocal progressive community within the Bitcoin space. Thanks to these tools, we have an opportunity, however fleeting, to reach more people and convince them of Bitcoin’s promise. And we need your help. </p><p>This is a call to action. Don’t shy away from conversations about Bitcoin with a liberal colleague, in-law or neighbor. Try to reach those people where they are and explain how Bitcoin addresses the unfairness they care about in the current system. Many progressives will respond well to an informed discussion about how and why Bitcoin addresses wealth inequality or gives property rights to marginalized groups of people. You may have more success than you think. If you’re unable to convince them yourself, direct them to appropriate books, podcasts and articles so they can continue their learning. </p><p>There is no doubt that we will eventually reach the tipping point when Bitcoin becomes inevitable. When that happens, it will be critical to have a variety of political ideologies represented in our coalition if we are to find the greatest success. The only unknown that remains is if we will act quickly enough to reach that tipping point before the war. I am optimistic that we will, and to that end I will continue to orange pill as many progressives as I can. I hope you will join me in that work.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jason Maier.

    </figure><p>Bitdeer Technologies Group and Druk Holding &amp; Investments have partnered to develop a 100% carbon-free digital asset mining operation in the Kingdom of Bhutan. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the partnership aims to help accelerate Bhutan's digital transformation and economic diversification, while expanding Bitdeer's global footprint. The two firms will establish a closed-end fund worth up to $500 million, which will launch in May 2023. Bitdeer will serve as the general partner, while DHI will act as a strategic limited partner.</p><p>“The Partnership is expected to create local jobs in areas ranging from engineering to project management, supervisory and supportive functions,” the press release said. “At the same time, the Partnership is expected to generate economic activity and foreign-currency-denominated revenue for local communities and the country.”</p><p>Bitdeer's Chairman, Jihan Wu, said, "We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan's zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value." <br><br>“We are thrilled to partner with Bitdeer on this important development for DHI.” Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments, commented. "DHI exists for the betterment of the lives of Bhutanese people today and for generations to follow."</p><p>Bitdeer currently operates data centers in Northern Europe and North America. As the press release notes, the upcoming carbon-free bitcoin mining operation in Bhutan will mark a crucial expansion into Asia for Bitdeer, which “will enable Bitdeer to tap into Asia's abundant resources, contributing to the flourishing regional ecosystem.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[North Carolina County Enacts One-Year Ban On Commercial Bitcoin Mining, But Not Without Pushback]]></title><description><![CDATA[After a public hearing, Buncombe County voted to approve a moratorium on bitcoin mining in order to craft zoning standards and regulations for special land use.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-county-enacts-one-year-ban-on-bitcoin-mining</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-county-enacts-one-year-ban-on-bitcoin-mining</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ban]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Craig Deutsch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 17:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQyMTE4Njk0/img_6164.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

Commissioners approved the one-year ban after holding a public hearing during their meeting on May 2. The County’s current ordinances do not define cryptocurrency mining as a specific use. Cryptocurrency mining operations can negatively affect surrounding neighborhoods due to excessive energy use, e-waste, pollution, and noise. The temporary pause will help protect the public interest until regulations regarding cryptocurrency mining are adopted. The one-year ban is effective immediately through May 1, 2024.”</p></blockquote><figure>

Fedi seeks to empower individuals to collaborate through "federations" made up of friends, families, neighbors, nonprofit organizations, social clubs, businesses, conferences and other forms of community to take control of their money, data and digital lives while protecting user privacy and autonomy. <br><br>The open-source Fedimint protocol, on which Fedi is built, makes it easy for developers to build additional apps and modules to complement Fedi's offerings and give more options to users. “It provides a resilient, privacy-protecting, and simple way for people who don’t have access to or don’t trust centralized alternatives to secure and use their data and money,” a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine explained.</p><p>The financing round was led by Ego Death Capital, with participation from Block, Kingsway, Trammell Venture Partners and Timechain, among others. This funding brings Fedi's total funding to $21.21 million. Fedi CEO Obi Nwosu said that the interest in the round allowed them to select investors that are fully aligned with the future they are trying to create with Fedi.</p><p>Fedi's community or "second-party" custody model offers a secure alternative to third-party cryptocurrency exchanges, cloud backup services and encrypted messaging apps. The system's underlying technology is readymade for rapid expansion and can be adapted to do virtually all the things people currently use their smartphone or computer to do. The system aims to answer the security, privacy and trust deficiencies of current alternatives, bringing users benefits similar to self-custody without technical or financial barriers to entry. </p><p>“Fedi is offering a truly decentralized and federated way not only to custody bitcoin but to take back control of everything that matters in your digital life,” said Jeff Booth, co-founder of Ego Death Capital and lead investor for this series. “It’s hard to overstate what this combination of technologies makes possible, and while I expect Fedi to be at the forefront, I’m just as excited by what people are going to build around it.

    </figure><p>The President's new budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2024 includes the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, which would require bitcoin mining firms to pay 30% of the cost of electricity used for mining crypto assets. This tax aims to address what the White House claims are the economic and environmental costs of mining, citing local pollution, increased greenhouse gas emissions and higher energy prices.</p><p>Unfortunately, the proposal does not take into account the large mix of renewable energy sources being used to power bitcoin mining, which <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/bitcoin-mining-electricity-mix-increased-to-59-5-sustainable-in-q2-2022/">Bitcoin Mining Council research</a> shows continues to grow, making up more than half of the energy utilized by miners. In addition, it does not consider the grid-strengthening benefits that Bitcoin mining can offer, which has been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/texas-bitcoin-miners-are-offered-to-cut-electricity-usage-to-help-the-grid/">seen</a> in states like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-fits-texas-energy-grid">Texas</a>. </p><p>The recent announcement of the DAME tax is yet another example of government overreach and intervention in the private sector. The proposal is just another tax grab by the government, disguised as an effort to address environmental concerns.</p><p>While it is true that mining consumes energy, it is not the responsibility of the government to dictate how businesses operate or what is a good and bad use of energy. The government should not be punishing businesses for pursuing innovation and technological advancement. The DAME tax is nothing more than a blatant attempt to stifle innovation in the Bitcoin industry and limit the potential for economic growth.</p><p>Furthermore, the government's claim that Bitcoin mining imposes costs on others is unfounded. Bitcoin mining firms already pay for the electricity they use, and any negative externalities are mitigated by the fact that they often locate in areas with excess or <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/renewable-energy">renewable</a> energy. The argument that mining firms impose costs on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color is simply fearmongering and lacks any empirical evidence.</p><p>In fact, the DAME tax could have negative consequences for these same communities. The tax could cause firms to move their operations overseas, resulting in job losses and decreased economic activity in the United States. Moreover, the tax could create risks for local electrical grids who now benefit from the increased production and instant shut-off ability of miners. </p><p>It is clear that the government is targeting the mining industry because it is a new and innovative technology that is disrupting traditional financial systems.</p><p>The DAME tax is a misguided attempt by the government to stifle innovation in the Bitcoin industry and generate revenue under the guise of environmental protection. The tax is hypocritical, lacks any empirical evidence and could have negative unintended consequences for communities and consumers. The government should focus on creating a regulatory environment that supports innovation and economic growth, rather than imposing arbitrary taxes on businesses.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMzg4OTgzNTU5NDk3MDMy/usa.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MoonPay Launches App In More Than 130 Countries]]></title><description><![CDATA[MoonPay is now offering its multi-wallet management solution via the app store in countries across the globe.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/moonpay-launches-app-in-more-than-130-countries</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/moonpay-launches-app-in-more-than-130-countries</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Moonpay]]></category><category><![CDATA[app]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wallets]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 15:37:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5ODc3NDQ5NjI5MTE2MTU4/20220531_btcfinal_best-make-your-ln-node-mobile---anthony-feliciano.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Carlos Cárdenas, an institutional account manager who has worked at legacy banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.</em></p><p>Argentina is on the verge of financial collapse as record inflation and Argentine peso (ARS) devaluation hits the market. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1650492285539471360?s=20">research</a> from Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, the peso has depreciated 47% against the U.S. dollar (UD) and inflation is running higher than <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1647792706725490688">118%</a> per year. His solution: dollarize the Argentine economy. </p><p>While dollarization is already in play in Argentina to some extent (many Argentinians save in dollars and accept dollars at their businesses) the peso is still the de facto currency of the country. The <a href="https://bluedollar.net/informal-rate/">Dólar Blue</a> rate, an informal measure of the cost of buying and selling a physical dollar bill in Argentina, has risen 23 times since 2018. At the time of this writing, it sits at 465 ARS to 1 USD. Factors such as the rising costs of living, bad economic practices and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to this outcome for Argentina. </p><p>Pundits, politicians and local citizens are advocating for full-fledged dollarization as the solution, but is this the best method, or can we find something better? Given the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/as-banks-collapse-bitcoin-is-stronger">inherent problems with the USD</a>, perhaps a hybrid approach that implements the superior qualities of Bitcoin, could serve Argentina better.</p><h2>A Case Study In Ecuador</h2><p>To analyze this, let's take a look at Ecuador, which was one of the first Latin American countries to leave its national currency, the sucre, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">adopt U.S. dollars in 1999</a>. </p><p>By the end of 1999, <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/The-Case-of-Ecuador.pdf">inflation in Ecuador had reached 60%</a> and the sucre had <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_364613.pdf">devalued by about 300%</a>. To prevent bank failures, the government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">shut down banks and started to “rescue” the financial system</a>. As expected, this did not work and not only did poverty explode in the country, but the monetary base expanded by <a href="https://fee.org/articles/celebrating-ecuador-s-dollarization/#:~:text=Ecuador%20entered%20dollarization%20under%20a,of%20devaluation%20exceeded%20300%20percent.">552%</a>. Consequently, Ecuadorian citizens abandoned the sucre and, by 2000, the government officially adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender. The short-term consequences for dollarization were dire: people lost their entire lives’ savings, some committed suicide and many left the country to work in the United States and in Europe. That immediate cost caused the government to collapse and the country to suffer a depression that, eventually, it recovered from.</p><p>Fast forward and, as a result of dollarization, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2536238">the real GDP of Ecuador grew by 75% in total from 2000 to 2013, while the inflation and interest rates dropped</a>. This might have seemed like a happy ending, but due to corruption and mismanagement of resources, the full economic potential of Ecuador was never realized and <a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/country/ecuador#:~:text=Ecuador's%20economic%20freedom%20score%20is,the%20world%20and%20regional%20averages.">today it has a below-average economy</a>. </p><p>Dollarization was very successful in Ecuador, such that it continuously posed a threat to politicians and central bankers. They no longer had the power to manipulate a currency so, with the inspiration of blockchain technology, came up with a program to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC) through a fintech program called “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666143821000107">Dinero Electrónico</a>” between 2014 and 2018. Because there were no effective data controls, this program allowed the government to print more dollars and allow users to transact via their phones, thus creating a currency that operated in parallel to the dollar. This added to privacy concerns and a lack of trust that drove the program to crash and burn.</p><h2>Lessons Learned For Argentina</h2><p>Seeing the initial success of the U.S. dollar in Ecuador, I do believe dollarization is the most prudent way that Argentina can go about fixing its monetary policy. However, Argentina can also officialize bitcoin as legal tender in order to reduce the immediate shock to the economy, modernize its financial system and offer its citizens alternatives. </p><p>Mere years ago, Bitcoin was non-existent. Today, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin has a market cap of well over $500 billion dollars</a> and it is leveraged by sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, insurance firms, tech firms and retail users all across the globe. And while institutional adoption grows, so do business opportunities across borders. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is now <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">1,000 times cheaper</a> to use than major credit card providers like Visa or Mastercard. The potential for businesses relying on international capital and remittances would be huge and bring trust to the country. </p><p>Argentina also already has one of the higher indices of crypto adoption in Latin America, with <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/latin-america-cryptocurrency-geography-report-2022-preview/">over 31%</a> of the retail-sized crypto transactions being conducted with stablecoins, a way for citizens to protect themselves from the ARS inflation. In addition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/20/world/americas/argentina-cryptocurrency-value.html">over 60% of Argentinians</a> believe that BTC has capabilities as a store of value with the power to outperform the peso. </p><p>Most recently, Argentina’s Comisión Nacional de Valores, its national securities commission, authorized the launch of a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/12/argentinas-national-securities-commission-approves-bitcoin-futures/">bitcoin futures contract</a> that settles in ARS. In addition, bitcoin is up <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-ARS?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiE2t_-2cz-AhVohIkEHdKCCv8Q-fUHegQIFxAf&amp;window=YTD">105% year to date, as quoted in Argentine pesos</a>, reflecting the conviction that both citizens and the government have in the orange coin. </p><p>There are many challenges that could slow down Bitcoin adoption in Argentina, such as the lack of infrastructure or regulatory clarity. Nonetheless, with a population that is already highly educated in crypto assets and in need of a lifeboat, Bitcoin-hybrid dollarization might prove to be a better experience than Ecuador’s. In addition, incorporation of Bitcoin adoption would deliver a better social contract between the government and its citizens. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Carlos Cárdenas.

    </figure><h2>Natural Gas Prices At The Waha Hub</h2><p>Approximately <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53499">70% of Mexico’s natural gas imports</a> are supplied by U.S. pipelines. Therefore, it is common for natural gas contracts in Mexico to be <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/pipeline-natural-gas-exports-to-mexico-rising-as-infrastructure-comes-online/">linked to locations in the U.S.</a> where pricing is determined, such as the Waha hub, Henry hub and Houston Ship Channel.</p><p><a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Texas-Natural-Gas-Prices-Sink-Close-To-Zero.html">The Waha hub is one of the most important pricing point for natural gas in Mexico</a>, in part because each of the Wahalajara pipelines jointly operated by Carso Energy and Energy Transfer <a href="https://tppetconnect.energytransfer.com/ipost/TPP/capacity/design-capacity-for-intrastates">are designed</a> to <a href="https://pipelines.energytransfer.com/ipost/CTP/capacity/design-capacity-for-intrastates">transport</a> and sell over 1 billion of cubic feet of natural gas per day to Mexico’s state-owned Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) power plants.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gob.mx/cre/documentos/precios-de-gasolinas-y-diesel?idiom=es">natural gas price index for the Mexican market</a>, known as the IPGN, is <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/mexicos-cre-to-publish-natural-gas-prices-for-six-regions/">calculated with the Waha benchmark price by</a> the Comisión Reguladora de Energía (CRE), a government energy regulatory commission. Carso Energy’s transport income generally benefits from higher prices at the Waha hub. The CRE uses the Waha benchmark to calculate a daily reference price for natural gas used by CFE, which helps determine the price of natural gas <a href="https://elcapitalino.mx/nacion/cfe-principal-factor-para-el-crecimiento-de-carso-energy/">sold to the CFE by Carso Energy</a>, including the midstream costs of transportation and other fees associated with importing natural gas. The <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/cfe-alliances-driving-mexico-natural-gas-infrastructure-growth-as-imports-cool-off/">CFE is one of the largest customers of natural gas in Mexico</a> and by the end of next year, the CFE is expected to generate <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-generate-65-energy-2024-lopez-obrador">65% of Mexico’s power</a>. Selling natural gas to the CFE can become extremely profitable during severe weather events in Texas, due to <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-embroiled-us400-million-legal-dispute-goldman-sachs">heavily-inflated spikes</a> in the Waha benchmark price.</p><p>Severe weather events aside, the Waha hub has been plagued with takeaway capacity constraints, causing record low prices in the Waha benchmark of natural gas that have <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53919">consistently fallen below the Henry hub</a> in Erath, Louisiana. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) primarily uses the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_fut_s1_d.htm">Henry hub price for natural gas futures</a> contracts. Physical supply and demand dynamics at the Waha hub can have effects that influence the Henry hub and NYMEX natural gas futures. The Wahalajara pipelines had been <a href="https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/article/14180425/us-gas-exports-to-mexico-to-rise-with-wahalajara-completion">expected to help narrow the steep Waha hub discount</a> to the Henry hub, however, the Waha benchmark still went <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Texas-Natural-Gas-Prices-Sink-Close-To-Zero.html">negative 20 times in the last three years</a> due to other factors that <a href="https://btuanalytics.com/natural-gas-pricing/can-el-paso-south-pipeline-save-waha-from-negative-outright-pricing/">remain an issue</a>.</p><p>Negative pricing at the Waha hub can occur when there is an <a href="https://aegis-hedging.com/insights/waha-basis-forces-affecting-price-aegis-reference">oversupply of natural gas and not enough pipeline capacity to transport the gas</a>. When this happens, producers may be forced to pay buyers to take their natural gas in order to avoid having to entirely shut down production. This can lead to negative pricing, which can present a number of challenges for Waha pipelines.</p><blockquote><p>“Waha is in the Permian basin, and is characterized as a market that is perpetually long supply, and needs to trade at a discount to its marginal demand market. That demand market is almost always outside of the Permian basin. Therefore, basis is determined by the amount of excess gas that needs to be moved to another location. The relative abundance or scarcity of this egress capacity influences Waha basis greatly…</p><p>“On a daily basis, wind generation directly competes with natural gas. As new wind (and solar) farms are constructed, renewable energy sources are taking a larger share of total generation. If renewables generation grows faster than load (demand for power), then gas demand generally suffers.”</p><p>–<a href="https://aegis-hedging.com/insights/waha-basis-forces-affecting-price-aegis-reference">“Waha Basis: Forces Affecting Price,” AEGIS Reference</a>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>Bitcoin Mining Competes With Natural Gas Pipelines</h2><p>Low prices reduce the incentive for producers to sell natural gas in the Waha market, which in turn can lead to lower throughput volumes for the Wahalajara pipelines. Shale oil wells in the Permian Basin <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-25/to-manys-dismay-permian-produces-more-gas-and-condensate-instead-of-oil-and-profits/">have become extremely gassy</a> — producing more <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=A#ass_diss_nat_gas">associated natural gas</a> as they age and oil production falls. This results in increased exploration for shale oil, which <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-are-setting-billions-of-dollars-on-fire-11578652210">results in more gassy wells</a> and an oversupply of natural gas. As prices stay low, or go negative, it becomes more profitable to waste natural gas by either venting it or flaring it.</p><p>Venting methane is harmful for the environment as it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/12/climate/texas-methane-super-emitters.html">a potent greenhouse gas</a> that traps <a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight">80 times more heat than carbon dioxide (CO2)</a> over a 20-year period. Flaring is better than venting, but is only <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/flaring-emissions">92% efficient</a>, meaning that 8% of all flared methane still escapes into the atmosphere. </p><p>Bitcoin mining is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/12/23-year-old-texans-made-4-million-mining-bitcoin-off-flared-natural-gas.html">nearly 100% efficient</a> at <a href="https://www.weforum.org/videos/this-start-up-catches-waste-methane-to-power-data-centres">mitigating methane emissions</a>, so it's <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-are-setting-billions-of-dollars-on-fire-11578652210">more ecologically sound and profitable to mine Bitcoin</a> with methane from stranded Permian Basin wells than it is to waste it. Bitcoin miners can even be used to <a href="https://www.satoshiaction.io/orphaned-wells">reduce fugitive emissions from abandoned oil wells</a> once the wells are no longer productive. Ultimately, this all means there is less incentive to build expensive infrastructure to transport Permian natural gas to the Waha hub where it may sell for practically nothing.</p><p>This is a major problem for operators of the Wahalajara pipeline system. Midstream companies such as Carso Energy and Energy Transport grow profits by increasing the volume and value of transported natural gas. The oil and gas industry has concluded that costs have to rise because <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-25/to-manys-dismay-permian-produces-more-gas-and-condensate-instead-of-oil-and-profits/">the current cost structure is unsustainable</a> as losses for natural gas explorers <a href="https://ieefa.org/articles/ieefa-update-bankruptcies-multiply-fracking-sector">continue to mount</a>.</p><h2>Bitcoin Mining Competes With Natural Gas Peaker Plants</h2><p><br>To make matters more challenging for the oil and gas industry, research indicates that using large, flexible loads, such as Bitcoin mining operations, can have a net <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4347220">decarbonizing effect</a> on grids over the long term. This is believed to happen when loads balance fluctuations in variable renewable generation, which in turn <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032114005504">facilitates higher penetrations of renewable resources</a> when those power sources are available.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Brad Jones, the former interim CEO of ERCOT, has <a href="https://youtu.be/gKnRfDeFgr0">publicly affirmed that Bitcoin mining</a> has already played a major role in bringing renewables into the Texas grid, by supporting the financials of solar and wind facilities, and providing a balancing effect between consumers and excess generation that would otherwise be negatively priced or curtailed.</p><blockquote><p>“For many years, ERCOT had been looking for loads of scale that could respond in a demand responsive way that can help us balance our grid... It's here now. And it's a great thing for helping us to manage the grid. Helping us to manage our resources. Bitcoin has the nature of really turning down when prices begin to rise, in a way that we can give that power back to other consumers. And at the same time, as we bring more and more renewables into the state, it becomes a driver of more renewables. Because right now if we bring in all the renewables that are signed up to want to come to our state, there will be a significant depression of pricing during the day. By having Bitcoin there to assist, to stabilize those prices throughout the day, it's going to drive more renewables into our system. And that's good for Texas.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1614634614504493056">Brad Jones</a>, former Interim CEO of ERCOT</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, research suggests that demand-response programs are competitors to traditional, flexible-generation plants and, by proxy, the natural gas companies that provide fuel to those plants.</p><blockquote><p>“Widespread adoption of demand response may not be viewed favourably by all participants in the power market. In particular, if the capacity value, or the availability in times of need, of demand response is significant, owners of peaking plants will likely see their capacity factors decrease as demand response takes over some or all of the responsibility for regulation, load following and ramping… This will have a significant impact on the potential for generator owners to recover their investment, possibly leading to the decommissioning of otherwise operational plants. Such a scenario would clearly be greatly opposed by operators of flexible generators, even though it may present an efficient solution for the system as a whole."&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.098">Benefits And Challenges Of Electrical Demand Response: A Critical Review</a>”</p></blockquote><p>If flexible demand response can lead to the decommissioning of flexible generation, there would obviously be fewer potential buyers of natural gas during periods of peak demand. As variable renewables continue to increase market share within ERCOT, Carso Energy and Energy Transfer would have <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/sb1751-would-hurt-bitcoin-miners-but-who-does-it-benefit/">good reason to view demand-response programs that Bitcoin mining operations participate in as competitors to peaker plants</a> that reliably buy and consume natural gas.</p><p>Of course, natural gas peaker plants are necessary when solar and wind aren’t available, enabling miners to continue mining during those hours. On the surface, this would appear to make Bitcoin miners and natural gas companies close allies. However, if oil and gas executives concur with Jones and the research above, there would be <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/sb1751-would-hurt-bitcoin-miners-but-who-does-it-benefit/">a motive</a> for oil and gas companies to negatively color the public’s perception of Bitcoin’s participation in ERCOT demand-response programs. Natural gas may be maintaining its market share within ERCOT as renewables grow, but the industry would rather increase its market share and eliminate competition to secure its long-term future.</p><figure>

For example, <a href="https://archive.is/pk9qx">Energy Transfer raked in $2.4 billion during the February 2021 blackout of Winter Storm Uri</a>, by using natural gas as a peaking asset — storing it when the price is low, and selling when demand skyrocketed. </p><p>Exporting natural gas to Mexico during a severe weather event in Texas can be even more profitable for the Wahalajara pipeline operators, since the Mexican price might be even higher — especially If ERCOT were more reliant on natural gas peakers. During the 2021 Texas winter blackouts, the price of natural gas in Mexico <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-embroiled-us400-million-legal-dispute-goldman-sachs">skyrocketed to 100 times normal prices</a>. Natural gas peaker plants struggled during Uri, as natural gas was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nagham-Sami/publication/279188724/figure/fig3/AS:614193791266818@1523446619432/Hydrate-formation-in-natural-gas-transmission-pipeline-2.png?ref=hashrateindex.com">freezing in pipes</a>.</p><p>After an influx of mining rigs from China relocated to Texas <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58414555">in late 2021</a>, many became sanctioned as <a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf">large flexible loads (LFLs) within ERCOT</a>. Today, LFLs are providing and profiting from ancillary services that natural gas peaker plants would have previously dominated. And they are doing so at a lower price point that peaker plants struggle to compete with — saving Texans money on their electric bills by getting more for less. In fact, LFLs <a href="https://finbold.com/texas-bitcoin-miners-resume-operations-after-shutting-down-due-to-high-power-demand/">helped balance the grid and avoid blackouts during the summer heat wave of 2022</a> and <a href="https://finbold.com/bitcoin-miners-returned-enough-power-to-heat-1-5-million-homes-during-texas-blizzard/">during Winter Storm Elliot</a>, over Christmas of 2022 — freeing up over 3,000 megawatts of spare capacity on the grid. This success was forecasted by ERCOT a few weeks prior to Winter Storm Elliot, in a report that heralded Bitcoin miners <a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf">as beneficial to balancing the grid during extreme weather events</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Gray Lady Attacks Bitcoin</h2><p>In November 2022, five months before his anti-Bitcoin mining article was published, Gabriel Dance — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gabriel-dance">deputy investigations editor at The New York Times</a> — attended the Texas Blockchain Summit, in Austin, as part of his investigative research. A few weeks later, he began emailing participants from the conference, promising to include their nuanced perspectives in his upcoming article.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Dance ultimately proved this was all a ruse. When his article was finally published, it became evident that he chose to omit all of the pro-Bitcoin mining arguments and only included unbecoming quotes from its proponents.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1645426405793038337"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The substance of Dance’s article deserves harsh criticism. It was filled with disinformation and fallacious reporting about the role of demand response that has since been <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/the-absurdity-of-the-nyts-latest-bitcoin-hit-piece">thoroughly debunked by the Bitcoin Policy Institute</a>. Dance’s reporting contradicted the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/demand-response">U.S. Department of Energy, which views demand response favorably</a>. It also conflicted with <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1645550345265852418">earlier endorsements of demand response from The New York Times</a>, going back at least to 2007. </p><p>Here is a selection of previous endorsements from the Times:</p><blockquote><p>“Across the United States, several thousand businesses and residential customers are ceding control of their electrical systems during moments of unusually high demand. And they are getting paid to do it. The system, based on a concept called ‘demand response,’ is one of the latest ways that Internet technology is being applied to manage over-stretched U.S. power supplies better.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04iht-rbogcut.1.8184549.html">Demand Response Technology Shaves Peak Energy Consumption By Remote Control</a>,” The New York Times, November 7, 2007</p></blockquote><p>In 2009, The New York Times <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/dimming-the-lights-to-meet-demand/?searchResultPosition=1">reported that demand response had been endorsed</a> by the Obama administration’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, Jon Wellinghoff.</p><blockquote><p>“The Obama administration, Congress and the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, Jon Wellinghoff, have all focused on reducing peak demand. Mr. Wellinghoff has called demand response the ‘killer application’ of the smart grid.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/dimming-the-lights-to-meet-demand/?searchResultPosition=1">Dimming The Lights To Meet Demand</a>,” The New York Times, April 17, 2009</p></blockquote><p>In 2010, in its “Energy And Environment” section of the paper, the Times continued to extol the benefits of demand response to its readers.</p><blockquote><p>“This concept, called demand response, has gained traction in utility circles. In essence, it involves paying users to make small sacrifices when there is an urgent need for extra power (the ‘peak’). The utility can then rely on cutting some demand on its system at crucial times and, in theory, avoid the cost of building a new plant just to meet those peak needs… For farmers, however, this process isn't easy. Workers must be dispatched to turn the pumps on and off, and there is a risk of crop damage.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/business/energy-environment/24idaho.html">Why Is A Utility Paying Customers?</a>,” The New York Times, January 23, 2010</p></blockquote><p>Again, later in 2010, the Times reiterated the Obama administration’s positive view of demand response.</p><blockquote><p>“…[Wellinghoff] sees consumers as active parts of the grid … stabilizing the grid by adjusting demand through intelligent appliances or behavior modification, known as demand response; and storing energy for various grid tasks. He thinks consumers should get paid to provide these services.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/business/energy-environment/29iht-rbogferc.html">Making The Consumer An Active Participant In The Grid</a>,” The New York Times, November 29, 2010</p></blockquote><p>The newspaper even quoted environmentalists who wanted Texas to adopt more demand response.</p><blockquote><p>“Environmentalists argue that the strains on the grid should spur Texas to work on energy-saving strategies. In particular, they are pushing a program called demand response, in which businesses and consumers are paid to reduce power at times of high demand, like late summer afternoons. Colin Meehan, a clean energy analyst with the Environmental Defense Fund in Texas, said in an e-mail that Texas had ‘so far only taken very small steps’ on demand response.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/business/energy-environment/electric-grid-in-texas-faces-multiple-challenges.html">Electric Grid In Texas Faces Multiple Challenges</a>,” The New York Times, December 22, 2011</p></blockquote><p>The Times continued to praise demand response throughout the Obama administration, almost as if it was doing the administration’s job to promote the technology.</p><blockquote><p>“But balancing the grid involves more than just increasing capacity. Perhaps the state’s most promising conservation tool is ‘demand response,’ … The programs, which are voluntary in Texas, can take many forms… Demand response ‘probably deserves more focus and attention,’ said Doyle Beneby, the president of C.P.S. Energy, a municipally owned utility that has not taken a position in the capacity market debate. ‘In Texas, it could be a big part of the solution.’”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/with-strain-on-electric-grid-a-push-to-prioritize-conservation.html?searchResultPosition=1">With Strain On Electric Grid, A Push To Prioritize Conservation</a>,” The New York Times, January 23, 2014</p></blockquote><p>And yet, Dance’s hit piece against Bitcoin mining single-handedly reversed the Times' position on demand response. Dance wrote the following passage, which makes demand response sound like an evil scheme for flexible customers to defraud retail customers:</p><blockquote><p>“Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets. They can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their electricity at a premium when prices spike and even be paid for offering to turn off. Other major energy users, like factories and hospitals, cannot reduce their power use as routinely or dramatically without severe consequences.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">The Real-World Costs Of The Digital Race For Bitcoin</a>,” The New York Times, April 9, 2023</p></blockquote><p>It all begs a long list of questions: Why did The New York Times spend months researching an article that distracts readers from serious environmental issues, only to focus on a technology that is only responsible for an infinitesimal <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/ghg/comparisons">0.14% of global emissions</a>? Why did it ignore a December 2022 ERCOT study that showed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/applied-direct-response-ercot-study-shows-bitcoin-mining-is-beneficial-to-the-texas-grid/">large flexible loads, such as Bitcoin mining operations, were beneficial</a> to the Texas grid? Why did The New York Times ignore the fact that <a href="https://finbold.com/bitcoin-miners-returned-enough-power-to-heat-1-5-million-homes-during-texas-blizzard/">Bitcoin mining played a significant role in avoiding blackouts during Winter Storm Elliot, over Christmas</a> and during the <a href="https://finbold.com/texas-bitcoin-miners-resume-operations-after-shutting-down-due-to-high-power-demand/">2022 summer heat wave</a>? Why did it ignore that Bitcoin mining reliably <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/intermittent-bitcoin-mining-fixes-energy">provides a price floor</a> for overbuilding renewable generation on the ERCOT grid? Why single out a sanctioned demand-response customer that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKnRfDeFgr0">according to ERCOT’s former interim CEO</a>, largely responsible for bringing in large-scale, variable renewable projects into Texas? Why did The New York Times <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1645550330162102272">reverse more than a decade of support</a> for pro-renewable demand response programs that were <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/demand-response">championed by the U.S. Department of Energy</a> and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/dimming-the-lights-to-meet-demand/?searchResultPosition=1">Obama’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman</a>? Why, after months of research, did The New York Times publish its anti-Bitcoin mining story precisely when the Texas legislature <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/sb1751-would-hurt-bitcoin-miners-but-who-does-it-benefit/">was voting on bills that attack Bitcoin mining demand-response programs and replace them with natural gas peaker plants</a>? Why did the Times’ editors use <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1646204715833737216">allegedly-manipulated footage that made it appear as if there was smog in Rockdale, Texas</a>?</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Very little about the hit piece makes any sense. Is it a coincidence that <em>The New York Times </em>attacked Texas Bitcoin mining at just the right time that it could benefit one of its largest shareholders?</p><blockquote><p>“The point is, Slim doesn’t have to interfere at all. I know from experience that publishers do intervene in the editorial process, as is their prerogative. And I can assure you that Slim’s investment will be a factor, even if unspoken, in editorial decision-making henceforth at the Times. Perhaps Mexico’s crony capitalism will remain a mostly neglected topic — but now conspiracies will be read into the neglect.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/01/will-carlos-slim-use-the-new-york-times-to-bolster-his-reputation.html">Andreas Martinez</a>, former columnist for The New York Times</p></blockquote><p>We may never know if Slim influenced the editorial process in the newspaper’s latest hit piece attacking Bitcoin mining. However, it would fit an ongoing pattern of The New York Times <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/20/el-chapo-or-carlos-slim-who-is-more-dangerous">protecting Slim’s business interests</a> in addition to patterns of alleged, <a href="https://www.thegrayladywinked.com">calculated, systemic bias and distortions</a>. Whether these are all coincidences, or something more, may be up for debate. However, editors of the Times seem more than willing to sacrifice the newspaper’s remaining shreds of journalistic integrity for whatever motivates them to run such hit pieces. </p><p>More and more readers, on the other hand, are beginning to distrust mainstream media and it doesn’t help when the largest shareholders of media companies are positioned to reap profits from the reporting. There is little recourse in such matters, however, bringing attention to potential conflicts of interest may at least provide some context to otherwise inexplicable editorial decisions.</p><p><em>Thanks to Justin Orkney for assistance with this article.</em></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Level39.

Trader and art dealer Steven Hay has even suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-ordinal-collection">the government of El Salvador release an official Ordinal art collection</a> to potentially raise money to fund its proposed Bitcoin City or otherwise accelerate Bitcoin adoption.</p><p>Unfortunately, this suggestion seems to lack an on-the-ground Salvadoran perspective and, in my view, is a blatant attack on El Salvador’s Bitcoin objectives.</p><p>El Salvador turned to Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/stop-drinking-the-elites-kool-aid">because of the qualities that make it sovereign money</a>, one that is not beholden to foreign powers or organizations. While a couple of the leading value propositions for using Bitcoin in El Salvador are to attract private, foreign investment and to spur tourism, the promise of hard money that is unconfiscatable, uncensorable and resistant to manipulation is why El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender. </p><p>However, Ordinals do not provide any of the hard money benefits of Bitcoin.</p><h2>NFTs On Bitcoin Are As Bad As NFTs Elsewhere</h2><p>The Bitcoin community has seen recent, vivid examples demonstrating that NFTs are bad investments. </p><p>For example, a Malaysian investor who bought <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20">Jack Dorsey’s first tweet NFT</a> for $2.5 million <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bought-29-mln-nft-jack-dorsey-tweet-finds-few-takers-2022-04-14/">struggled to find bids when he later tried to sell it</a>. Even El Salvador President Nayib Bukele<a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1452160674856116229?lang=en"> appeared to recognize the lack of real value in NFTs</a> as he auctioned <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/1402507224916836352?s=u_a">his tweet announcing the country’s Bitcoin Law approval in its legislative assembly</a> — the NFT was never sold and Bukele did not pursue the endeavor any further.</p><p>Numerous <a href="https://twitter.com/nvk/status/1619667314944925697?s=20">maximalists</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arekkusudes/status/1650600273365336064?s=20">Salvadorans</a> have been discouraging Bitcoin NFTs because they believe that folks who get rug-pulled could suffer significant financial harm. For many of these critics, defending Bitcoin’s social layer and calling out potential scams is essential to keeping the Bitcoin network secure. </p><p>There are several key elements that critics consistently bring up, which could demonstrate that Bitcoin NFTs on the Ordinal protocol are grifts and no different than NFTs on other protocols. These are as follow:</p><ol><li>The hype around NFTs is arbitrarily assigning exaggerated values to things that are not inherently scarce.</li><li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/402PaymentReq/status/1621845134496210944?s=20">Ordinal protocol cannot actually track individual satoshis</a> as <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html#:~:text=Ordinals%20are%20a%20numbering%20scheme,tracking%20and%20transferring%20individual%20sats.">claimed by the creators and promoters of the protocol</a>.</li><li>The Bitcoin protocol is unaware of the inscriptions or Ordinals, so none of it is verifiable by the network.</li><li>There are debatable concerns on the impact of inscription activity on storage resources of node runners. </li><li>The NFTs scams are a significant distraction from the integrity of Bitcoin’s primary purpose.</li><li>Finally, the intellectual dishonesty that markets Ordinals as “art investment” that will increase in value over time.</li></ol><p>Taking the above elements into account, an El Salvador Ordinals buyer risks purchasing an expensive, low-quality, reproducible image that’s likely to decrease in value. While there is a valid argument that the marketplace will decide whether it wants such a digital product, critics point out that people should be aware of the inherent grift of the NFT space and the similarities to promotions of Ordinals.</p><p>To paraphrase the creator of <a href="https://timechaincalendar.com/en">Timechain Calendar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Meditation_Man">TC</a>, who has spoken on this topic in several Twitter Spaces conversations that I’ve heard, “A blockchain makes a very poor database. It only works in Bitcoin because it is only verifying the truth about Bitcoin transactions.” </p><p>Another Bitcoiner, <a href="https://twitter.com/HodlMagoo">Magoo</a>, has opined in similar Twitter Spaces that adding engineering complexity to the Bitcoin timechain or any software is congruent with increasing possible attack vectors. These attack vectors can appear not only in the network itself but also in the social layer. As such, Ordinals have the potential to manifest attack vectors in each of these layers. It has encouraged people to focus their energy on an activity that Bitcoin was not designed or optimized for.</p><h2>Ordinals Contradict Proof Of Work</h2><p>While the CEO of BTC Inc (which operates Bitcoin Magazine), <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey">David Bailey</a>, has argued that <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey/status/1626523168801189896">Bitcoin NFTs on the Ordinals protocol are compatible with Nakamoto consensus</a>, they are antithetical to Bitcoin because their marketing suggests that they will increase in value, and that violates the concept of proof of work. </p><p>In the same line of thought, Hay proposed that a government Ordinal collection would be all benefit and no risk, implying that it’s easy money — but the principles behind proof of work demand that money should not be easy to generate through natural law. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/saifedean">Saifedean Ammous</a> wrote about this topic in several sections of his book “The Bitcoin Standard,” emphasizing that creating hard money requires an effort to provide value and benefit to the market and society. Ordinals are a high-time-preference activity based on easy money and speculation; therefore, encouraging El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption acceleration by releasing an Ordinals collection is peak fiat mentality.</p><h2>Salvadorans Don’t Need Ordinals</h2><p>El Salvador has a rich pool of artistic talent, including musicians, actors, filmmakers, dancers, folklorists, writers, architects and visual artists. Those Bitcoiners eager to help the country with its adoption will do well to support the existing artist community by promoting them and paying for their crafts by using bitcoin. </p><p>As a starting point, Bitcoiners can go to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294476-d7126187-Reviews-Mercado_Nacional_de_Artesanias-San_Salvador_San_Salvador_Department.html">National Artisan Market</a>, where people can find paintings, indigo-dyed apparel, hammocks and sculptures. Bitcoiners can also provide opportunities to digital artists, such as graphic designers, through contracts for working on web projects, apps and in print, and they can support digital content creators by giving value-for-value tips for their published works.</p><p>Ultimately, Salvadorans are <a href="https://www.canal12.com.sv/noticia/principal-preocupacion-de-el-salvador-es-la-economia-segun-encuesta/">more concerned about improving their day-to-day situations</a> than collecting JPEGs on mobile phones. The everyday Salvadoran demands that their government focus on security, infrastructure, public transit, traffic, health and education. Therefore, issuing an NFT collection is far from what Salvadorans value.</p><p>Given that El Salvador has had <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-one-year-later">relatively positive success with its Bitcoin adoption</a>, it’s easy to forget that its current government had a rough start and faced much criticism with its formal Bitcoin adoption launch.</p><p>Many criticized the government’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-fixing-chivo-bitcoin-wallet">release of the Chivo wallet</a> over insufficient accompanying education and the technical challenges experienced by some users. The primary recipient for much of this negative feedback was not the government itself, but Bitcoin as a whole, thereby hindering Bitcoin adoption. </p><p>Heading into Bitcoin’s second anniversary as legal tender in El Salvador, some of the negative perceptions created around Bitcoin are finally beginning to fade. But if the government were to release a Bitcoin NFT collection, that would only rewind the progress made.</p><p>The government must not promote Ordinals or NFTs, as many perceive them as scams. El Salvador needs to generate confidence and trust, and when Ordinals, <a href="https://cryptomode.com/the-significant-decline-in-nft-marketplace-activity-shouldnt-surprise-anyone/">like NFT projects of the past</a>, inevitably crash, El Salvador cannot be associated with them. Unfortunately, any negative perception about Ordinals would lead to reputational damage for the country, which is precisely where the attacks on Bitcoin adoption continue. </p><h2>The Bitcoin Mission is Clear</h2><p>Despite being inundated with all of the Ordinal noise, it is refreshing to see folks like South Africa’s <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi">Bitcoin Ekasi</a> work toward the Bitcoin mission with absolute clarity. In a recent tweet, the Bitcoin Ekasi team said it is <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1647575965827047424?s=20">“not here to have fun” but to change the world</a>. There is a real chance of failure for groups like Bitcoin Ekasi due to these distractions from the primary mission of adopting the hardest money in the world. With that same level of clarity, El Salvador must remain undeterred from these attacks.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Jaime García</em><em>.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jonathan Buck, founder of JB &amp; GS Mining GmbH, a German bitcoin mining hosting company.</em></p><p>In April 2022, the Central African Republic (CAR) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">adopted bitcoin as legal tender</a>, becoming the second nation in history to do so. However, just a year later, <a href="https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/currency/digital-currencies/7956294/car-to-drop-crypto-as-legal-tender">the nation reversed its decision</a>. But what are the reasons behind <a href="https://www.jbgsmining.com/en/post/central-african-republic-drops-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">this failure in the CAR</a>?</p><h2>Challenging Economic Conditions</h2><p>The CAR, one of the poorest countries in the world, faces numerous obstacles, such as political instability, inadequate infrastructure and food shortages. </p><p><a href="https://www.wfp.org/countries/central-african-republic">In the 2018 Human Development Index, </a>the CAR ranked second to last, with around 79% of its 4.7 million residents living in poverty. More than three million people in the country <a href="https://www.concernusa.org/story/central-african-republic-crisis-explained/">are reported to require humanitarian assistance while more than 85% of the population lacks electricity</a>. </p><p>One of the significant barriers to the success of the Bitcoin project in the CAR was surely the country’s limited internet access. With only about <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=CF">10% percent of the population having access to the internet</a>, widespread adoption of digital currencies was highly unlikely.</p><p>While Bitcoin has been helping to bank the unbanked globally, the digital currency alone cannot solve all of a country's underlying infrastructure problems. And while Bitcoin can be resilient off the grid, the lack of basic amenities such as electricity and internet in CAR likely hindered the spread and usability of Bitcoin there.</p><h2>Skepticism And International Concern</h2><p>The introduction of bitcoin as legal tender in CAR was met with skepticism, partly due to the country’s close ties with Russia, raising suspicions about its potential plans to <a href="https://african.business/2022/10/technology-information/is-central-african-republics-crypto-push-linked-to-russia">use cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions</a>. </p><p>The United Nations also warned that developing countries like the CAR could <a href="https://www.globalgovernmentfintech.com/un-agency-warns-on-crypto-in-developing-nations/">face high risks and costs associated with cryptocurrencies</a>.</p><p>And, ultimately, the economic benefits promised by the proponents of Bitcoin in the CAR never materialized. Ambitious projects, such as building a “<a href="https://sango.org/#cryptoCitySection">Bitcoin city</a>,” failed or never began, further dampening enthusiasm for the digital currency experiment.</p><h2>A Larger Trend?</h2><p><br>Despite the disappointment in the CAR, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been gaining traction in other African countries. For example, countries such as Nigeria and South Africa have seen a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abubakarnurkhalil/2023/03/01/nigerian-election-and-naira-crisis-is-fueling-bitcoin-adoption/">significant increases in bitcoin adoption</a>, with millions of users now buying, selling and trading digital assets. In these countries, the growth of the cryptocurrency industry has been driven by factors such as the high inflation rate of local fiat currencies; an increasing number of young, tech-savvy individuals; and a growing number of businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method.</p><p>In the end, the failure of bitcoin as legal tender in the CAR can be attributed to the nation's challenging economic conditions, skepticism surrounding its motives, limited access to technology and unfulfilled peripheral promises. </p><p>But despite this failure, other African countries represent some of the world’s most promising, growing epicenters of Bitcoin adoption. If anything, this failure in the CAR highlights the importance of developed environments and good-faith intentions for the successful adoption of Bitcoin, at least for the first handful of countries that hope to be successful.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jonathan Buck.

    </figure><p>Oftentimes, when you hear about the “American dream,” you think of a heart-warming success story. The entrepreneur who made millions. Or the immigrant family that changed the trajectory for their children. And while these inspiring stories do exist, there are many others who came to America hoping for a better life only to be met with countless obstacles that hindered them from achieving their American dreams.</p><p>Modern-day monetary policy runs on fluctuating interest rates and inflation. Many people are not aware that the U.S. dollar, which was founded on a gold-reserve system, has not only been off of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/01/25/the-gold-standard-ended-50-years-ago-federal-debt-has-only-exploded-since/?sh=7286f7301e17">gold standard</a> for over 50 years, but is now “backed” by the United States military and <a href="https://faculty.georgetown.edu/imo3/petrod/define.htm">petrodollar</a>. The amount of control that the United States government has on those living in poverty is astronomical. Because of these limiting restrictions, among other factors, the American dream has become much harder to achieve. </p><p>However, Bitcoin can help change this negative cycle.</p><p>Natalie Brunell burst onto the Bitcoin scene in 2021. She was born in Poland and immigrated with her parents to America as a young child. Growing up with a family that was determined to build a new life in America, the value of hard work and a healthy amount of skepticism was ingrained into Brunell for as long as she can remember. </p><p>With over ten years of experience in the media sector, she took a risk and started her own <a href="https://talkingbitcoin.com/podcast">Bitcoin podcast</a>. Since then, <em>Coin Stories</em> has been wildly successful and influential in highlighting power players in the Bitcoin space. </p><p>Her story is inspiring and welcoming to anyone interested in getting started on their Bitcoin journeys. </p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what specifically drew you to it?</strong></p><p>I first learned about Bitcoin in 2016 from a group of friends while working as a local news reporter covering breaking and investigative stories in Sacramento, California. I didn’t understand Bitcoin’s technological innovation or the mission of Bitcoin’s proponents to address systemic issues in our financial system. In fact, I equated it back then to investing in stocks.</p><p>Luckily, I bought a little bit and held through my first bear market. I also pitched a story about Bitcoin to my news outlet and ended up reporting on a local Bitcoin ATM. I was fascinated by this emerging technology, but my station was not keen on covering more stories on it, so I let it go as a reporting assignment.</p><p>It wasn’t until a few years later when my mentor told me to read <a href="https://saifedean.com/tbs"><em>The Bitcoin Standard</em></a>&nbsp;that I began my journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Saifedean Ammous’s book changed my perspective on money and sparked my idea for the <em>Coin Stories</em> podcast, which ultimately changed my career and my life. </p><p>What drew me to Bitcoin was the idea of removing the state’s monopoly on money and creating an opportunity for our economy to be rebuilt on a sound monetary unit that is immune to manipulation. I envision a world where money is based on value rather than proximity to politics and power.</p><p><strong>What made you leave your traditional media job to pursue Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>Ever since I was a young girl, I aspired to become a broadcast journalist. My family immigrated from Poland to Chicago when I was five years old. My family always had the news on at home because the programming helped my parents learn to speak English and kept us informed about current events both overseas and in our new home country. My idol growing up was Barbara Walters.</p><p>I always believed in journalists as watchdogs, not government lap dogs. My parents grew up under a communist regime and were always skeptical of both central authority and media propaganda. I’m grateful for that upbringing because it caused me to question everything around me and made me a more determined reporter.</p><p>I spent more than ten years working in mainstream news media and became disillusioned by the increasing bias I saw on various networks. I was fortunate to be able to cover in-depth investigative pieces in my last TV correspondent position that were not politicized, but the industry around me was moving in the direction of partisanship, censorship of alternative views and prioritization of access to politicians rather than pursuing and demanding accountability.</p><p>When preparation meets opportunity, that’s “luck.” I had the communication skills and media training (preparation) and the market had a growing demand for knowledge (opportunity). Bitcoin offered me an opportunity to leave mainstream media in October 2021 to develop my podcast and promote Bitcoin education. I decided to bet on myself and see if I could build a business doing something I believed would ultimately impact the world more than my news reporting. I have never felt more fulfilled by what I do and I am propelled by a sense of duty to help people understand our financial system and the benefits of Bitcoin, a revolutionary fix for our money.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you (such as your close friends, etc.)?</strong></p><p>I respond with, “I know; I was there once, too.” Being skeptical and critical is a good thing, it means you’re not easily persuaded or sold on the latest fad. It means you think for yourself. That’s already a win. I try to meet the person where they are. One of my mentors, Jeff Booth, has an excellent question to pose to skeptics and newcomers to Bitcoin. That question is: “If technology is supposed to make things cheaper and easier to produce, why is the cost of living around us continually going up?”</p><p>It’s a simple but powerful question that drives at the heart of the problem in our monetary system: inflation.</p><p>Every year, it gets more and more difficult to afford a home, a college education and retirement. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and we’re all working harder for currencies that are worth less and less. This isn’t a natural phenomenon of our existence. It is the synthetic outcome of the state monopoly on money, and it impacts every aspect of our lives.</p><p>When I do engage with friends on the topic of Bitcoin, I encourage them to note the various crises they're hearing and reading about, or perhaps even experiencing directly. Most people have a sense that things are really challenging at the moment, that we seem to be moving in the wrong direction. Once that groundwork is laid, I can spark their curiosity about why Bitcoin offers such a powerful alternative.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>I released the first episodes of my podcast at the Bitcoin 2021 conference. I attended the event on a media pass and brought my best friend, Paula, along for company because I didn’t know anyone personally in Bitcoin. My intention was to meet fellow Bitcoiners and try to ask individuals I admired to appear on the show, with no intention of building a career in the space.</p><p>I had never attended industry conferences and was taken aback by the size and number of attendees. But it was hard not to notice a massive gender gap in that audience. In fact, nowhere was it more apparent than when you looked at any conference restroom area: there would be a queue of men stretching around a corner on one side, and a vast, empty expanse on the women’s side. </p><p>I began to think more deeply about why women were so underrepresented in this industry. As we know, finance, engineering and computer science are all male-dominated fields that organically intersect with Bitcoin, so it makes sense that a male audience would discover this amazing technology before a female audience. Social media also tends to perpetuate a "crypto bro culture" that obscures the global community of Bitcoin pioneers doing brilliant, wholehearted work. Bitcoin is an inherently multifaceted technology that takes time and effort to understand, and even requires some reeducation around money in general. I believe that all newcomers to Bitcoin, and women in particular, including my closest friends, who are already busy industry leaders and smart investors, need trusted and approachable guides to help navigate around these barriers.</p><p>I saw this imbalance as an opportunity to grow the space and connect with these newcomers. Ever since that first conference, I have been determined to become a resource for ordinary working people, and especially women, to learn more about Bitcoin and how our global economy works. </p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone. Bitcoin is a tool of freedom and prosperity for every gender, age, race, language, cultural background, and political affiliation. Bitcoin levels the playing field and can bring us all together in cooperation. I am passionate about educating other women about Bitcoin because I want them to have a seat at the table of this financial revolution and empower themselves and their families for the long run. We often feel the most comfortable learning from and engaging with people who look and sound like us. If I can serve as a welcoming voice for new women in the Bitcoin space, I see it as an honor. I love being a woman, I love learning from and connecting with other women, and I am so proud to be a woman in Bitcoin. Discovering Bitcoin is incredibly empowering, and we need to continue building a supportive, inquisitive community for that journey.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

According to <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-04-28-Introducing-Crypto-Transfers-for-Venmo-Customers">the announcement</a>, more than 50% of its cryptocurrency-using customers chose Venmo due to its safety, security and ease of use, while more than 74% of customers have continued to hold their cryptocurrency in their Venmo account over the past year.</p><p>The transfer process is designed to be simple and can be done in a few steps via the Venmo app. Customers can navigate to the Crypto tab, view their assets, tap the Transfer arrows and choose to send bitcoin to a Venmo account, or by entering a recipient’s wallet address to send to PayPal or another external wallet. Customers can also tap Receive to display their unique bitcoin address QR code, which can be shared with other people.</p><p>Venmo is quick to note that cryptocurrency transfers cannot be canceled or reversed, which is something that can be difficult for new Bitcoin users to get used to, but eliminates chargebacks and other complications presented by fiat rails. </p><p>“Crypto transfers will be rolling out to Venmo customers over the coming weeks starting in May 2023,” Venmo said in a press release. “We’re excited to connect Venmo’s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead.”</p><p>Being one of the largest mobile finance applications in the United States and a first step into bitcoin for many, this update now introduces users to the ability to take self-custody of their bitcoin, an <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-self-custody-and-financial-sovereignty">essential step in realizing the full properties bitcoin</a> entails.

Some were excited by this new experimentation, which <a href="https://covers.bitcoinmagazine.com/#FAQ">sought to provide buyers with a trust-minimizing experience</a>, while others were not so happy.</p><p>David Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc, the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine, tweeted that the world’s first Bitcoin-only magazine <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey/status/1647430173661224961">received</a> harsh reaction from the Bitcoin community.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey/status/1647603125652533250"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Francis Pouliot, the founder of non-custodial, bitcoin-only exchange and payments service Bull Bitcoin, underscored the criticisms in a reply to that tweet:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1647607570377392128"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h2>The Ordinal Controversy</h2><p>Ordinals <a href="https://github.com/casey/ord/blob/master/bip.mediawiki">were proposed</a> in 2022 by developer Casey Rodarmor. Launched on Bitcoin’s mainnet on January 21, 2023, it is a <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/introduction.html">protocol</a> that creates an inscription whereby “sats” (short for “satoshis,” the lowest denomination of a bitcoin) can be inscribed with arbitrary data. This can include JPEG files, clips and even video games.</p><p>But the introduction of the Ordinal protocol has stirred up a controversy which has divided the Bitcoin community. While some have shown favor for the prospect of inscribing collectibles on the chain permanently — assisting the flourishing of the arts in the Bitcoin space, creating monetary demand for Bitcoin blockspace, incentivizing miners and more — others have expressed concerns about storing that data directly on Bitcoin. </p><p>Significant push back has <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1619824591580598272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1619824591580598272%7Ctwgr%5E49456bfba5687743e46fb9c1784466db09cf286f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F120250%2Fordinals-launches-nfts-on-bitcoin-triggers-controversy">come from</a> influential Bitcoin Maximalists, with some <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/luke-dashjr-doesnt-want-his-name-on-bitcoin-nfts">condemning</a> the project as a direct attack on Bitcoin.</p><h2>What Is Bitcoin ‘For’?</h2><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-magazine-announces-historic-nft-auction">Bitcoin Magazine’s</a> first public steps on its journey in the world of Ordinals, marked by this first auction, were met with disdain. Some perceived the move as a mere extension of the NFT culture, which incentivizes making quick money on pump-and-dump schemes.</p><p>But this controversy has now sparked new debates. Regardless of our differences of opinion on “NFTs on Bitcoin,” the implementation of Ordinals is providing us with an opportunity for education. It helps us deeply examine Bitcoin's core values and our roles in the network.</p><p>What is Bitcoin? What is it meant for? Bitcoin was invented as peer-to-peer digital cash. In its white paper, its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">described</a> Bitcoin as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.”</p><p>Bitcoin’s trust-minimized transactions enable censorship resistance. Many of those who criticize Ordinals are Bitcoin loyalists. They see Bitcoin’s base layer as something to be used strictly to settle monetary transactions and they oppose any move to extend beyond this original use case.</p><p>Also, concerns have been raised by Ordinal critics regarding these non-monetary transactions taking up Bitcoin’s limited block space, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-records-largest-mined-block-to-date-4-mb-block-containing-nft-causes-unease-among-small-block-supporters/">as inscriptions can be large files</a>. Some are worried that an increased cost of running a full node could reduce the ability for users to participate in this network and maintain Bitcoin's decentralization.</p><p>(Additional possible implications and concerns around inscriptions are detailed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-implications-of-bitcoin-inscriptions">here</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space?utm_source=Bitcoin+Magazine&amp;utm_campaign=c63022d3c9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2023_02_27_07_32&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f7d45fbb67-c63022d3c9-43389605&amp;mc_cid=c63022d3c9&amp;mc_eid=20005d9db2">here</a>.) </p><p>So, is using Bitcoin’s foundation outside of monetary transactions bad or harmful for Bitcoin?</p><p>There is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">nothing within the Ordinal protocol that violates Bitcoin’s specified consensus</a>. Also, there are no rules that restrict users to monetary transactions. Bitcoin is permissionless in that everyone is allowed to use it in a way that they wish to use it. This includes adding data to transactions and using them as a database for JPEGs. As some have pointed out, this isn’t at all that new:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1619692068519149568"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>But just because we can do it, should we do it or encourage others to do it? </p><p>Now, this question takes us into a moral dimension. And exploring it might help us understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals.</p><h2>Impulse For Creation </h2><p>Technically, Ordinals are built on Bitcoin, working within its consensus rules. So, they can be seen as a part of the Bitcoin project. But is this true? Let’s examine. </p><p>All technologies are created by human beings, with a vision and philosophy behind them. The question we should ask is whether the impulse that led to the creation of Ordinals aligns with Bitcoin philosophy, or diverges from it. </p><p>In an interview with CoinDesk, Rodarmor <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/bitcoin-community-erupts-in-existential-debate-over-nft-project-ordinals/">spoke about</a> the vision behind Ordinals. He said that he wished it to be a fun art project and also something that can encourage people to learn more about Bitcoin. For instance, he made the point that, in order to use Ordinals, users are required to run their own full nodes and suggested that this would help people get interested in doing so, which would be good for Bitcoin.</p><p>Rodarmor also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/ordinals-creator-views-his-bitcoin-centric-creation-as-digital-artifacts-not-just-nfts/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKPFWLeMiAfRdYa7lSKXnsMABHcmKnbZXRv_jvdSxtToI61pPpBLF80USOl1yzLJltWsncHNZAwZdPr3fXB1Qg7Hv8k9ICJT83XXhW7l5mEzDrhwU_A9VLIGQwaOva90sh8bmJay8TG8yUj4a4-tePySR4Es50-GWmqfJORkw6vZ#:~:text=Ordinals%2C%20a%20Bitcoin%2Dbased%20NFT,no%20idea%20it%20would%20explode.">noted</a> that, with the creation of Ordinals, he tried to fulfill an unmet market demand from NFT collectors, and it seems that this playful way of experimenting on Bitcoin did respond to those desires. The project has attracted many users, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ordinal-inscriptions-surpass-1-million-mark-miners-collect-4-7m-in-fees-as-bitcoin-nft-trend-continues/">producing</a> over one million inscriptions incorporated into transactions less than three months after its debut.</p><p>Certainly, market demands drive the development of technology. Many protocols and apps were created to please and satisfy the desires of consumers. Yet, there was something other than simple commercial interests at work behind the invention of Bitcoin.</p><p>The impulse for Bitcoin didn’t come from market demand. It arose somewhere else, outside of business and profit motives. Bitcoin is the holy grail of cypherpunks, a community of activists connected by ​​an<a href="https://lists.cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/"> electronic mailing list</a> who had long advocated for free speech and privacy protected by the use of strong cryptography. </p><h2>The Vision Of The Cypherpunks</h2><p>Who are the cypherpunks? In his 2015 essay, titled “The Moral Character Of Cryptographic Work,” Phillip Rogaway, a professor of computer science, <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf">described</a> them as “cryptographers with ethics,” noting that they brought major shifts in the approach to scientific work that had previously been detached politically and divorced from the moral dimension.</p><p>Cypherpunks aim to actively develop technology in a way that is aligned with human values and priorities. For instance, Rogaway regarded Julian Assange as a representative of the value of cypherpunks and listed WikiLeaks as an example of the projects that revitalized the moral impulse in cryptographic work.</p><p>Rogaway <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf">articulated</a> the philosophy that informs their work:</p><blockquote><p>“Cypherpunk cryptography has been described as <em>crypto with an attitude</em>. But it is much more than that, for, more than anything else, what the cypherpunks wanted was crypto with <em>values</em>. And values, deeply felt and deeply embedded into our work, is what the cryptographic community needs most. And perhaps a dose of that cypherpunk verve.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a part of the free software movement. It is guided by a vision of technology which can empower individuals and change the world. Richard Stallman, the godfather of the GNU/Linux operating system, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m37s">defined</a> free software as “free” in the sense of freedom, “libre” in French, and not in terms of price; software that respects users’ freedom.</p><p>At the core of Bitcoin is this value of individual freedom. It is this value that one cannot put a price tag on, that has been repeatedly threatened. </p><p>We have seen that during <a href="https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained">the block size debate</a> (centered on disagreements around the best methods of scaling for Bitcoin) that took place between 2015 and 2017. The proponents for a larger block size argued that they wanted Bitcoin to become a payments network. They wanted it to become faster, with large transaction volumes that could compete with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. As a series of proposals to change Bitcoin’s consensus emerged over time, the conflict <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-first-major-bitcoin-civil-war">quickly escalated into a civil war</a>.</p><p>During the heat of this scaling dispute, Amir Taaki, who was one of the first developers to work on Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7rXKS_SiVE&amp;t=3785s">recognized</a> that this divide was really based on a difference in values. He pointed out that the efforts to push large block sizes were a hijacking of Bitcoin's original vision, rooted in ethics. </p><h2>Bringing Love Into Computing</h2><p>Bitcoin was created by the commitment of cypherpunks to their fellow human beings — what they saw as their moral obligation to secure the right of liberty for all. With the birth of Bitcoin, love was brought into computing. This love as a moral force began to revitalize the market, moving capital dynamically toward the emancipation of humanity.</p><p>From Cypriots to Argentinians, bitcoin <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/22/the-blockchain-and-the-rise-of-networked-trust/">has become</a> a safe haven for those whose money has been debased by rampant hyperinflation and/or bank deposit confiscation. While attacks on journalists and whistleblowers intensify in many countries, Bitcoin <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/08/20/wikileaks-bypasses-financial-blockade-with-bitcoin/?sh=468e46997202">offers</a> a form of asylum for <a href="http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150323/1019901312.html">dissidents of the West</a>. </p><p>Bitcoin is freedom money. Yellow Vest protesters occupying the streets of Paris <a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@cryptoewp/yellow-vests-and-buy-bitcoin">recognized</a> Bitcoin as a critical linchpin for their financial revolution. When the government became authoritarian, Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-fueled-canada-trucker-convoy">provided</a> a rail for the Canadian trucker “Freedom Convoy” to continue its non-violent, civil disobedience in the fight against medical mandates.</p><p>And now, a nation state has joined this currency of resistance. In September 2021, El Salvador <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034838909/bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-tender-official-currency-cryptocurrency">made bitcoin legal tender</a>. Led by President Nayib Bukele and his policy of economic liberty, a small, impoverished nation with a <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">population of about 6.5 million</a> began to liberate itself from the dictatorship of the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Now, a new game is on that is much more fun and grand than the one played by the new kids on the block with their pokémon cards. By challenging the banking monopoly, Bukele opened up a free market contest, in which Salvadorans can now actively engage in taking back a future that had been stolen from them. </p><p>As the economy is being regenerated, human beings come alive. Bitcoin now inspires our love for creation. With the resurgence of arts and freedom of expression, we are now seeing a new renaissance. Beauty and magnificence that are demonstrated by ordinary people now extend beyond galleries of digital art collectibles and auction rooms. This is now reviving the culture that can transform our society. </p><h2>The Value Of Freedom</h2><figure>

We can pay for the available block space and use it as storage for arbitrary files, the function that could be served by other trust-minimized systems, such as <a href="https://opentimestamps.org/">OpenTimestamps</a>. Or we can choose to hold this scarce space for monetary transactions only.</p><p>Nakamoto paid homage to the sacred heart of Bitcoin that embraces each, single person. By spending tireless hours engaging in his or her labor of love, he or she paid for the whole of humanity and reserved this precious tiny space that keeps us all free. </p><p>Inspired by this selfless act of this mysterious creator, developers joined hands to ensure everyone’s access to this sanctuary. Some then became devotees of liberty. Bitcoin Maximalists remain vigilant, ready to throw out money changers who are trying to enter this temple, from shitcoiners to random JPEG posters.</p><p>We all are given freedom as our intrinsic value when we are born. This value of freedom is priceless. It cannot be secured by economic incentives alone. It demands the conscience of each person and his or her principles to defend it.</p><p>Cypherpunks write code. Can we sovereign individuals uphold their ideal and share this gift of liberty as the unalienable right of all people? </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nozomi Hayase.

    </figure><p><a href="https://preturnio.com/">Preturnio</a>, a full-text search engine for the Bitcoin blockchain, has been introduced, allowing users to scan for Bitcoin transactions that include readable text.</p><p>Preturnio is a platform that allows for the search of plain text within any coinbase transaction, text-based ordinal inscription or OP_RETURN script since the genesis block. All data in the Bitcoin blockchain is stored natively in hexadecimal format, and Preturnio offers search results that are converted to a readable format. OP_RETURN is a unique opcode in the Bitcoin scripting language that enables data to be embedded in a transaction output without the need to spend any bitcoin. <br><br>This was added to the Bitcoin protocol in 2014, primarily to allow for the creation of simple, low-cost and secure timestamping services. OP_RETURN has been useful in various applications, including digital signatures, notarization and proof of ownership. The recently launched <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">Ordinals</a> project has created a significant debate on the topic of immutable data time stamped onto Bitcoin. </p><p>“Regardless of where you stand on this issue,” the <a href="https://preturnio.com/docs">docs page</a> of the website states, “the fact remains that there is a ton of plain text buried in the Bitcoin blockchain so Preturnio was created to make searching for this text easier and more enjoyable.”</p><p>Preturnio searches in three areas where plain text can be found quickly: inside a coinbase transaction, inside an OP_RETURN script, and inside a text or HTML based ordinal inscription. Preturnio searches every block mined since the genesis block to locate a match inside a transaction for the text/pattern the user is looking for. The website offers various search options, with the interface designed to be as user-friendly as possible, according to the docs page. Users simply enter the text they are looking for and click the search icon or press ENTER. They can search for a single word, a phrase or just about any set of characters.</p><p>The Preturnio docs include search examples. The platform offers different types of searches, including searching for a single word or a phrase. Preturnio will return results for any transaction that contains that phrase or part of it. To match on an exact phrase, enclose the query in double quotes (“”). The website only does a literal search when enclosed in these quotes. “This is important to remember,” the website adds. “For search phrases with more than one word, Preturnio will only return for transactions with all words in the phrase - if a transaction contains one of the phrase words but not all, it won't be included in the search results.”</p><p>Preturnio aims to offer simple and effective search features that will make finding the right information embedded into Bitcoin faster and more convenient.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNDAxMTQ0NTc1MDc1ODcz/border-wallets-seed-phrase-recovery-top-photo.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Insight Honed Since $5 BTC, Tuur Demeester Is Ready For Bitcoin 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tuur Demeester, a macroeconomic analyst who has offered insight into Bitcoin since 2012, will bring his unique insight to Bitcoin 2023.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/tuur-demeester-analysis-at-bitcoin-2023</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/tuur-demeester-analysis-at-bitcoin-2023</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tuur Demeester]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 14:23:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NTQ3MTU5MDIzODU0NTk4/tuur-demeester-1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>Tuur Demeester has a self-described “out of the box” approach to macroeconomic analysis, and it’s one that has made his insight into Bitcoin’s unprecedented potential sought after by institutions (in 2021, Demeester’s bitcoin alpha fund Adamant Capital was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockstream-to-launch-finance-division">sold to Blockstream, where he is now an advisor</a>) as well as individuals (Demeester’s is ranked as the <a href="https://hive.one/c/bitcoin">third “best Bitcoin Twitter account to follow”</a> by social media analyst Hive.One).</p><p>Combining deep research into historical patterns, an academically-rigorous approach and a willingness to embrace new innovation, Demeester’s outlook on how Bitcoin fits into our wider world has been remarkable for its consistency and prescience for more than a decade.</p><p>He first recommended BTC as an investment to readers of his newsletter in 2012, when it was priced at $5. In 2013 (with <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/bitcoin+price+june+2013">bitcoin priced around $100</a>), <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/interview-with-tuur-demeester-1371692092">he told Bitcoin Magazine</a>:</p><p>“I think bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies are the greatest investment opportunity of our day and age. First of all because bitcoin has all the qualities to make for an ideal money, to a greater extent than any digital or tangible commodity on the planet. Second, in contrast with traditional fiat money, bitcoin is designed for the internet; it’s open source, it’s mobile, fast, and it allows for personal privacy. Third, because we are approaching a bankruptcy event in the developed economies, both in banks and governments, I think that bitcoin, as a discrete and nonconfiscatable currency, will benefit greatly from the capital flight that will ensue.”</p><p>As more people around the world have realized Demeester is right about this nascent digital currency, his own perspective has continued to grow. In the introductory note to Adamant’s landmark research paper from 2019, “<a href="https://casebitcoin.com/docs/TheBitcoinReformation_TuurDemeester.pdf">The Bitcoin Reformation</a>,” Demeester made the case that bitcoin was not merely a new kind of money, but represented a fundamental shift with few precedents in history.</p><p>“In the past I’ve drawn parallels between bitcoin and the early petroleum industry, the search engine wars, the domain name markets, the growth of P2P file sharing, and internet protocols,” he explained. “But I kept feeling that I was failing to fundamentally grasp the magnitude of the epoch in which bitcoin functions as a catalyst. It wasn’t until I studied the era around the Protestant Reformation that I felt I’d found a potential blueprint of sufficient scope.”</p><p>Demeester continues to develop one of the most sought-after perspectives in Bitcoin and now he’s preparing to share that perspective at the upcoming Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami.</p><p>“I have a new report, ‘<a href="https://unchained.com/how-to-position-bitcoin-boom">How To Position For The Bitcoin Boom</a>,’ which I’m happy to talk about in Miami,” he told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview about the event. “I can’t say much as to the content right now, but rest assured it will be bullish on bitcoin. In general, my aim is always to inspire people to think for themselves by providing good source information and perspectives that they hadn’t considered before.”</p><p>Of course, today’s global, macroeconomic climate is one that will produce a lot of compelling Bitcoin content at the largest annual event dedicated to showcasing it. And this year is one that is bringing some of Demeester’s earliest insights about Bitcoin to fruition.</p><p>“It’s hard to predict the very short term, but my view for 2023 is that quantitative easing will make a comeback, and hence that we’ll see a surge of new inflation, in particular in rising commodity prices,” he said. “That is enormously bullish for bitcoin, because it’s one of the few true inflation hedges out there.”</p><p>The event will also be a chance to reflect on the progress Bitcoin is making as a technology, independent of BTC’s value relative to fiat currency or the erosion of the legacy financial system. With an outlook that has experienced numerous bear and bull cycles, Demeester is optimistic about how the current environment will produce more advanced and resilient Bitcoin projects.</p><p>“In bear markets, developers, entrepreneurs, politicians and other Bitcoin actors tend to take their time working on projects because they know that announcements — no matter how impressive — will generally see very little interest,” Demeester said. “I expect a huge amount of exciting announcements to come out in 2023, even though I can’t yet predict where exactly they will come from. I’m expecting serious progress in nation-state adoption, in Lightning technology, in bitcoin mining and in the use of bitcoin as a financial performance benchmark, and in bitcoin-backed mortgages.”</p><p>Finally, Demeester — a veteran of Bitcoin events, big and small, in bear markets and bull markets — is looking forward to checking in with the Bitcoin 2023 attendees who he’s known throughout his long and expansive career in the space, as well as meeting the new ones who will help take that journey into the future.</p><p>“I look forward to catching up with friends, some of whom I haven’t met in a long time, and also of course to meet new people,” Demeester concluded. “Bitcoin conferences like Bitcoin 2023 are so fun because they gather Bitcoin people from all around the world together in one place.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NTQ3MTU5MDIzODU0NTk4/tuur-demeester-1.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners Releases Venture Industry’s First Bitcoin-Native Startup Ecosystem Research]]></title><description><![CDATA[The report examines the growth of the industry and highlights the discrepancy between bitcoin’s dominance and the level of investment bitcoin startups receive.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tvp-releases-venture-industrys-first-bitcoin-startup-ecosystem-research</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tvp-releases-venture-industrys-first-bitcoin-startup-ecosystem-research</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners]]></category><category><![CDATA[VC]]></category><category><![CDATA[Venture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Startups]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzYwODg2MzE2MTE1MzQ4/draper-moon-rocket-bitcoin-studio-demo-pitch.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a> (TVP), an Austin-based venture capital firm focused on Bitcoin, has released the venture industry's first Bitcoin-native startup ecosystem research.

The report also highlighted the misallocation of capital for Bitcoin startups and the gap in institutional venture capital for founders focused on the Bitcoin tech stack and ecosystem.</p><p>Christopher Calicott, TVP’s managing director and founding partner, commented in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine that “Bitcoin — the first, best, and only truly decentralized ‘crypto’ asset — is becoming a platform at an accelerating pace.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Hongumart, a frontline healthcare worker.</em></p><p>Bitcoin is often praised for its innovative design, its resistance to censorship and corruption and its potential to revolutionize the global financial system. </p><p>But beyond these practical aspects, Bitcoin also has a deeper philosophical dimension. In this vein, Bitcoin can be seen as an expression of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics">pure mathematics</a>," a manifestation of the beauty and elegance of mathematical logic and principles. </p><p>Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independent of any real-world applications. Pure mathematicians are interested in logic, basic principles and the properties and structures of abstract objects, and their findings may originate from practical problems or be put to use for practical solutions, but they are working from a more philosophical viewpoint than applied mathematicians are.</p><p>One way that Bitcoin expresses pure math is through its use of algorithms and protocols. Bitcoin relies on a set of rules and procedures that are defined by mathematical equations and functions. These rules and procedures govern how transactions are validated, how new bitcoin are created, how the network reaches consensus and how the system adapts to changing conditions. These algorithms and protocols are transparent, deterministic and verifiable. They ensure that Bitcoin operates in a consistent and predictable manner, regardless of human intervention or manipulation and are ultimately independent of any specific real-world environments or attempts at disruption. </p><p>Another way that Bitcoin expresses pure math is through its use of cryptography. Cryptography is the science of encoding and decoding information using math and it is considered by many to be one of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/about-pure-math/what-is-pure-math#:~:text=Finance%20and%20cryptography%20are%20current,is%20applied%20in%20significant%20ways.">most powerful applications for pure mathematics</a>. Bitcoin uses cryptography to protect the privacy and security of its users and their transactions. For example, Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography to enable users to generate unique digital signatures that prove their ownership of their bitcoin. It also uses hash functions to create cryptographic puzzles that miners have to solve in order to add new blocks to the blockchain. These cryptographic methods are based on well-established mathematical theories and assumptions.</p><p>Bitcoin is more than just a currency or a technology. While it is essentially open-source software, its application of pure mathematics also makes it a form of art and expression that showcases the beauty and power of this philosophical field.</p><p>By using mathematical logic and principles to create a decentralized and secure system, Bitcoin demonstrates how mathematical concepts developed purely for their philosophical merits can be applied to solve real-world problems and challenges. By using mathematical techniques and methods to protect the privacy and security of its users, Bitcoin shows how math can be used to enhance human rights and freedoms. By using mathematical symbols and representations to encode and manipulate information, Bitcoin reveals how math can be used to communicate and create meaning. </p><p>Bitcoin is an expression of pure mathematics that appeals to both the rational and the aesthetic aspects of human nature. It challenges us to think critically and creatively about the nature and role of money, information and trust in our society. It invites us to appreciate the beauty and elegance of mathematical logic and principles that underlie its design and operation. It inspires us to explore the possibilities and potentials of pure math in our world.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Hongumart.

Bitcoin might be most closely related to the Fedwire Funds Service which only settles about 200 million transactions per year compared to Bitcoin’s trailing 1-year figure of 98.5 million transactions.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1540011820332769281"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1540011820332769281">Link to embedded tweet.</a></em></p><p>As it stands today, the Bitcoin network is on pace to settle $3.5 trillion worth of change-adjusted value over the course of 2023, for costs of just $198 million, an equivalent fee rate of 0.006% for the average transaction. While average transaction costs are obviously skewed by the largest transfers in the data set, we can look at the median transaction settlement value and account for the median transaction fee, and still see that on-chain bitcoin transactions are a tremendously efficient way to send and receive value in a trustless manner over the internet.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Despite bitcoin’s extreme efficiencies as a global immutable settlement network, it remained unideal for minuscule and instantaneous transfers, as the 10-minute block interval target adds a latency to the settlement of transactions. This is okay for large sums of money, evidenced by the incumbent financial system, where net settlement of funds between financial intermediaries often don’t finalize for days or weeks on end — think MasterCard or Visa settling their books on a net basis with a banking institution like JPMorgan. </p><p>However, the need for a sound internet money that could settle instantaneously for nearly no cost was still there. With the advent of the Lightning Network, the latency involved with sending a bitcoin transaction, particularly for micropayment settlements, has all but vanished. This has brought about a whole new use case for bitcoin, as the monetary medium is now finding itself being inserted into the tech stacks of web applications and services across the globe.</p><p>As a refresher and overly simplified description, the Lightning Network works by node runners doing an on-chain transaction to open up payment channels with other nodes. This adds liquidity to the network and creates a network of channels when enough users open channels to one another. Lightning payments are sent from one node and hop across other nodes who have enough liquidity in their channels until the payment reaches its intended destination.</p><p>By doing one on-chain payment to open a channel, funds on the Lightning Network are able to move with less friction and settle without waiting for 10-minute periods between blocks for each transaction, until the channel gets closed with another on-chain transaction. These channels allow for lower fees as payments only pay to hop across nodes that have liquidity in their channels.</p><p>With a refresher on the technical workings out of the way, let’s take a look at the costs of the Bitcoin settlement stack compared to current retail settlement options like credit cards and focus on the massive efficiency gains of the Lightning Network in particular. Shown below, we compare the upper- and lower-bound costs of legacy payment processors to the median settlement cost of a Bitcoin on-chain transaction — median fee paid divided by median transaction volume — and the Lightning median fee rate percentage for sending the equivalent of 1 BTC. </p><p>We acknowledge that the comparison between the median cost of a bitcoin on-chain transaction to legacy payment processing costs isn’t quite an apples-to-apples comparison because credit card processors allow for near instantaneous payments to be made (but not settled!). That being said, this is where the vast efficiencies of the Lightning Network come into play.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The two charts above demonstrate how much more cheaply the Lightning Network is settling payments when compared to credit card processors.</p><p>Yes, legacy payment processors facilitate the transfer of trillions of dollars a year, which dwarfs the Lightning Network’s settlement volume. As a side note, it isn’t possible to quantify the transfer volume of Lightning like it is with on-chain transactions. Given the relative size of the Lightning Network, it is vital to remember that the network has continued to grow exponentially, while facilitating instantaneous transfer for near-to-no cost, all the while growing ever more connected. </p><p>In addition to cheaper settlement, the Lightning Network is also facilitating payments 60,000% to 140,000% more efficiently than credit cards.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While it may be a bit of a stretch to directly compare the median lightning payment fee to that of a multinational credit card processing firm, particularly given the minuscule micropayments of many Lightning transactions, the nature of public Lightning channels and transactions means that this technology is very capable of scaling to accommodate much larger transactions if/when needed. There is already indirect evidence of this happening with the average size of public channels pushing all-time highs in both BTC and USD terms at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Final Note:</h3><p>First enabled by the Segwit soft fork in 2017, the Lightning Network has gone from a conceptual idea to a flourishing global ecosystem in the span of less than six years. Reminiscent of the early days of the internet, Lighting Network nodes and user participation has gone from niche hyper-technical software developers to the edge of mainstream adoption in a short amount of time.</p><p>While the Lightning Network may not be headline news, the technology enabled by Lightning — the ability to direct a digitally native bearer asset in a trustless manner across the internet for nearly no cost — is an extremely significant development in the history of payment networks, and it is the first to do so in an open and decentralized manner. </p><p>We are extremely bullish on the continued development and adoption of the Lightning Network, and think that the advent of a common open-standard for sending and receiving internet-native value instantaneously for extremely low costs may be the killer app that brings bitcoin to a billion people.</p><p>It’s helpful to compare the early days of the internet to where Bitcoin is in its lifecycle. Looking at the growth of the two networks below can give us a small glimpse into where Bitcoin and Lightning may be heading as adoption increases.</p><p>How the internet started:</p><figure>
