<li>Cuts are &ldquo;enough for now&rdquo; based on the current trading environment</li>
<li>Coinbase can be one of the few survivors of crypto winter</li>
<li>Bitcoin is highly correlated with the interest rate direction</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Oppenheimer Executive Director and Senior Analyst Owen Lau <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/coinbase-one-few-survivors-amid-215308774.html">talks about</a> Coinbase&rsquo;s latest round of layoffs and how the crypto exchange&rsquo;s cost reduction strategy is helping it survive in the broader crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are the cuts enough?</strong></p>
<p>Coinbase recently <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/what-is-happening-at-coinbase-another-20-of-employees-laid-off/">laid off around 20% of its workforce</a>. Lau says:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>To me, it&rsquo;s enough for now based on the current trading environment, but longer-term, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised by further cuts. They should have just over 3,000 employees after these layoffs. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Does this change the bullish Coinbase rating?</strong></p>
<p>Oppenheimer&rsquo;s Coinbase rating is Outperform with a price target of $72. Lau says this doesn&rsquo;t change the rating:</p>
<p><em>If you believe in this technology, blockchain etc., there will be some survivors (of the crypto winter). Longer-term, we believe Coinbase can be one of the few survivors.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why are you bullish specifically on Coinbase? How many exchanges do you expect to be left years from now?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Coinbase is a strong brand, no. 1 in the US. Second, there are the regulations. They are more compliant compared to many other platforms. Longer-term, there will be fewer than five exchanges in the world and Coinbase will be one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin has been very volatile in the past few years, although it&rsquo;s now stabilizing around $17,500. Do you see more volatility with Fed rate hikes?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin and other digital assets are highly correlated with the interest rate direction. If the Fed stops raising interest rates or pivots at the end of this or next year, that should support the price of Bitcoin and other digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other fundamental reasons to be optimistic in this space. One of them is Ethereum&rsquo;s Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for March 2023, which will let users unstake their ETH. Another is the Bitcoin halving in March 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What do you expect to see in trading action short-term? Is it likely to be very volatile?</strong></p>
<p>I think trading will be stable compared to what we saw in 2021. Rising interest rates will benefit Coinbase. They have an agreement where they are sharing the interest income with Circle, a large company on the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/circle-plan-to-go-public-is-cancelled-what-does-it-mean-for-stablecoin-market/">stablecoin market</a>. Coinbase can benefit from rising rates and offset some of the lost trading.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Cameron accused Silbert of misrepresenting statements to Gemini on how the company was capitalized &nbsp;</li>
<li>DCG&rsquo;s responsibility for Genesis restructuring and bankruptcy based on non-callable $1.1b promissory note </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The feud between Gemini <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/">crypto exchange</a> cofounder Cameron Winklevoss and Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO Barry Silbert continues to escalate, with Winklevoss calling for Silbert&rsquo;s removal from the company. David Hollerith <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/crypto-feud-dcg-ceo-barry-215709078.html">reports</a> on Yahoo Finance.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Winklevoss demanded Silbert step down&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss filed the second of two open letters. In the first one, which came last week, Winklevoss wrote:</p>
<p><em>There is no path forward as long as Barry Silbert remains CEO of DCG.</em></p>
<p>He demanded Silbert step down so DCG and Gemini can settle their ongoing dispute out of court.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Misrepresenting statements&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Most recently, Cameron accused Silbert of misrepresenting statements made to Gemini in relation to how the company was capitalized after an earlier loss in the summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silbert responded in a letter to investors. The key point of contention is about how culpable the company DCG is for Genesis&rsquo; current restructuring and potential bankruptcy. It boils down to this $1.1 billion promissory note, which is not callable now. That means DCG would not have to return those funds in the event of bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What does this mean for Genesis?</h2>
<p>There still isn&rsquo;t much debate there, but the war of words will go on according to Hollerith. Silbert has claimed that his company never took out a $1.675 billion loan from Genesis, adding that the company is current on all outstanding loans and never missed an interest payment. He suggested the next interest payment on the loan would be made in May.</p>
<h2>The background&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Winklevoss twins turned to Genesis when the company introduced its Gemini Earn program,&nbsp;which offered a yield of up to 8% on crypto assets. Gemini paid the interest partially by loaning customer money to Genesis Global Capital, owned by DCG, which then loaned the funds to institutional clients.</p>
<p>After FTX&rsquo;s collapse, Genesis <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/gemini-launches-page-to-help-gemini-earn-users-affected-by-genesis-crisis/">suspended customer redemptions</a>, leaving Gemini unable to pay back Earn clients.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Brady held 1.1 million shares in Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s business&nbsp;</li>
<li>His ex-wife Gisele Bunchen has 680k shares </li>
<li>New FTX CEO John J. Ray III says no one is likely to recover losses</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the most famous people in US sports and people like Paul Tudor Jones and Peter Thiele are among those facing the consequences of the collapse of crypto trading platform FTX Group.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Brady and Bob Kraft held substantial stakes in SBF&rsquo;s business&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Star NFL quarterback Tom Brady and New England Patriots owner and billionaire Robert Kraft held substantial shares in Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s business. Su Keenan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgy-G-aZdmY">reports</a> on Bloomberg Television.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It wasn&rsquo;t clear how Brady was paid&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Su Keenan reports that it wasn&rsquo;t clear how Tom Brady was paid in shares of the company, but nonetheless, he is an FTX creditor according to court documents. The star quarterback, who&rsquo;s currently playing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, joins the club of those unlikely to get their money back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a disappointing development. FTX was even among the crypto companies that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-exchange-ftx-buys-slot-to-advertise-during-the-super-bowl/">bought an advertising slot</a> during the Super Bowl.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The other losers&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Patriots owner and billionaire Robert Kraft owns significant shares in several FTX-related entities. Brady owns more than 1.1 million common shares of FTX Trading. His ex-wife Gisele Bunchen has 680,000 shares.</p>
<h2>No one is likely to recover losses&nbsp;</h2>
<p>They join the ranks of luminaries like Paul Tudor Jones and Peter Thiele in holding the bag on some of these shares, whose value is assumed to be nonexistent. FTX is now bankrupt and the new CEO, John J. Ray III, says it&rsquo;s not likely anyone will recover losses.</p>
<h2>The noose tightens&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried faces trial in October. Two people in his former inner circle, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, are cooperating with prosecutors. A third witness may be in the works &ndash; FTX former engineering chief <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/prosecutors-ramp-up-pressure-on-sbf-associate-nishad-singh/">Nishad Singh</a>, who was reported to be looking for a deal.&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>GBTC Fund is up 25% since the start of the year, compared to a 4% rise in the underlying asset, Bitcoin</li>
<li>The discount is now back to where it was prior to the FTX collapse, at 37%</li>
<li>The discount had hit an all-time high of 50% only four weeks ago</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The largest <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> fund in the world, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has seen its value jump by 25% since the start of the year. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is only up about 4% on the year.</p>
<p>This means that the discount to the underlying asset, Bitcoin, is at its smallest level in months. I had analysed the divergence in December, only four weeks ago, when the discount hit an <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/why-has-the-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-hit-an-all-time-high/">all-time high of 50%</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the discount sits at 37%, back to where it was before the ignominious <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-insolvent-what-next-for-crypto/">collapse of FTX</a>.</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12400257">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2><strong>What is the Grayscale discount?</strong></h2>
<p>Grayscale is a trust which provides an avenue for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without physically buying Bitcoin. This can be convenient for institutions or other entities who may not be able to participate I the Bitcoin market directly for regulatory or legal reasons.</p>
<p>But Grayscale has rarely traded at the same price as its net asset value. Previously, it had traded at a premium to the underlying Bitcoin as shares surged with investors desperate to get exposure to the high-flying cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Today, however, it is the opposite &ndash; a steep discount. While there is a chunky fee of 2% that explains some of the discount, this does not come close enough to bridging a discount of 30%+ that we have seen consistently in this crypto winter.</p>
<p>The SEC recently denied Grayscale&rsquo;s application to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund, spelling bearish action around the fund. There has also been the rise of more competition, with similar funds being launched, especially in Europe, and filings for Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>But the most significant worry was surrounding the safety of reserves. This issue grew legs after the FTX collapse, as speculation mounted that Grayscale&rsquo;s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), may file for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>DCG is also the parent company to Genesis, which recently laid off 30% of its staff and is reportedly considering bankruptcy. Concern grew when Grayscale refused to publish a proof of reserves report, suddenly in vogue following the nefarious actions behind the scenes at FTX.</p>
<p>It cited &ldquo;security concerns&rdquo; as the reason that this would not be possible, but analysts decried this, with it very unclear what security concerns could be ignited by the publishing of public records on the blockchain.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">6) Coinbase frequently performs on-chain validation. Due to security concerns, we do not make such on-chain wallet information and confirmation information publicly available through a cryptographic Proof-of-Reserve, or other advanced cryptographic accounting procedure.</p>
<p>&mdash; Grayscale (@Grayscale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1593737746413244417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2> <strong>Why has the discount closed?</strong></h2>
<p>While the discount is still enormous at 37%, this has narrowed from the staggering 50% it reached in the aftermath of the FTX implosion.</p>
<p>There has been increasing pressure on DCG to address this discount, with calls from within the industry that the trust should allow investors to redeem their holdings, which would allow them to realise the full value of the Bitcoin they hold. This clamour may have helped narrow the gap somewhat.</p>
<p>One hedge fund, Fir Tree, even launched a lawsuit against Grayscale, demanding that the company either lower its fees or allow redemptions such that the discount can be closed.</p>
<p>But like everything in crypto right now, macro also has a part to play. The year has begun with <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/why-are-crypto-prices-rising-2023-off-to-hot-start/">crypto prices rising</a> off increased optimism that inflation may have peaked. This follows a relatively serene month or so in crypto markets.</p>
<p>The discount widened to a large degree in the aftermath of the FTX crash because people feared contagion and the chips were still falling. Similar to the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/im-sick-of-talking-about-tether-but-heres-an-article-about-tether/">peg on Tether slipping</a> when the UST crisis occurred.</p>
<p>Now that normal service <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/normalcy-returning-to-crypto-markets-on-chain-data-shows/">has somewhat resumed</a>, the discount has narrowed. Unfortunately for investors, it is still a staggering 37% off the net asset value. In a year where Bitcoin itself has plummeted, layering in a discount on top of that torrid price action is the last thing investors needed&hellip;</p>

<li>The exchange wants to reduce operating costs by 25%.</li>
<li>It is the second crypto exchange after Huobi to confirm layoffs in 2023.</li>
<li>Coinbase CEO has however confirmed that the exchange is well capitalized.</li>
</ul>
<p>The American-based cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> has announced through its website that it is cutting down on its operating expenses by 25%. The move includes laying off 950 employees, which accounts for about 20% of the company&rsquo;s workforce.</p>
<p>The exchange&rsquo;s CEO, Brian Armstrong, has listed the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-winter-may-not-end-anytime-soon/">ongoing bear crypto market</a> and the broader macroeconomy as the main reasons to reduce the company&rsquo;s expenses.</p>
<h2>Hard times for the exchange</h2>
<p>While announcing the laying off, the CEO also assured the public that the crypto exchange is well capitalized and added that crypto is not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the CEO noted that while the exchange has gone through multiple crypto bear markets, the current bear market is proving to be a real struggle for Coinbase. He said that it is the first time a global economic meltdown has aligned with a bear crypto market. He said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;As we examined our 2023 scenarios, it became clear that we would need to reduce expenses to increase our chances of doing well in every scenario. While it is always painful to part ways with our colleagues, there was no way to reduce our expenses significantly enough without considering changes to headcount.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>2023 has already seen several layoffs</h2>
<p>Coinbase joins several other companies that started the year 2023 by announcing layoffs. Huobi exchange also <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/is-huobi-safe-why-customers-should-be-withdrawing-funds/">recently confirmed 20% layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>For example, Salesforce announced it is planning to reduce its workforce by 10%, which would translate to laying off about 8,000 people. Amazon also confirmed that it is carrying out its second round of layoffs that will see it lay off about 18,000 people from its workforce.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bonk token launched on December 25, 2022</p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto has always treated its fans with twists, turns, and surprises. The crypto community loves it this way, for it becomes a time to make quick bucks as the rest of the market sleeps. In 2022, we were treated to a wild launch of the ApeCoin. Before the dust settled, Optimism airdrop came with a thud! The year couldn&rsquo;t end in a better way for crypto fans than it did with the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bonk-price-has-soared-prepare-for-a-major-dive/#:~:text=Bonk%20is%20a%20new%20meme,exposure%20to%20FTX%20and%20Alameda." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bonk token</u></a> (BONK/USD).</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are a fan of&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/a-brief-history-of-dogecoin-and-other-meme-coins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>meme tokens</u></a>, then BONK does not miss your watchlist after a heroic entry into the crypto space. Launched on December 25, 2022, BONK has been a sensation, jumping by four digits percentage in price. The token also dominated social trading platforms. Analysts credited the popularity of the newly dog-themed token to the Solana community. The former is based on the Solana network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, if history is indeed a good teacher, then we should learn that the gains may not last forever. We have seen highly hyped launches boosting token prices, only for them to crash thereafter. BONK may not be an exception. As of press time, the meme cryptocurrency had lost at least 50% of its value from its all-time high. Typical of the phrase, if you didn&rsquo;t board early, don&rsquo;t do it now. Technical pointers show BONK could fall further.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BONK on a decline as price finds minor support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/10/1673368409614-a491c771-3e2a-4c0e-b442-8697a559f1f5.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="266"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BONKUSDT/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BONK/USDT Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From the 4-hour chart outlook, BONK trades nervously at a support zone. The highs to the upside have been lower, coinciding with a declining price. Buy-side volumes have improved slightly at the support, but not sufficient to boost BONK&rsquo;s price.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BONK price prediction</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">As the hype around the BONK launch dies, the price could continue falling. Investors may look at BONK as an overvalued asset. Profit-taking and panic selling may also be at play and force a bearish breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Polkadot had the second-highest development activity in 2022</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">DOT price has heavily disappointed since the 2021 ATH but has recovered lately</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">DOT faces resistance at $5 and may correct downwards</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Polkadot (DOT/USD) buyers are struggling to break above $5. A technical outlook shows the cryptocurrency has been rejected at the building resistance for the second day. However, Polkadot fans should be at least excited by a relief rally that has seen the price recover from the $4.2 bottom.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If time is a true judge, then the Polkadot price has disappointed heavily. The cryptocurrency touched a high of nearly $56 in November 2021 and has since come crumbling. With a single-digit price now, DOT is a shell of its former self.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although 2022 may have ended on a low note for DOT buyers, enthusiasts should be happy with the blockchain&rsquo;s activity. Santiment data indicates that the blockchain had the highest development activity in the year after Cardano. Polkadot was followed by Cosmos blockchain, Ethereum, and Internet Computer in the top 5. That shows that the decline in the price of the native token wasn&rsquo;t in any way signalling a falling popularity of the protocol. Rather, it was due to a sustained bearish market that has hit every cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are considering&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/polkadot/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying DOT</u></a>, you may have to wait until the throat clears. For short-term investors, a break above $5 is the needed confirmation.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>DOT price facing resistance at $5 and 50-day MA</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/10/1673368020387-eeade7e4-076c-4c55-a1d3-915498d6a000.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="270"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOTUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DOT/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the price action, DOT&rsquo;s long-term momentum is still bearish. The short-term is bullish, with the RSI now in the bullish zone. However, DOT is facing resistance at the 50-day MA. The moving average coincides with the $5 resistance level.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What happens next for DOT?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">A potential correction is looming for the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/polkadot/#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20DOT%20today,trading%20volume%20of%20%2490.58M." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DOT price</u></a> at the current level if bulls do not recover above $5. If a breakout occurs, DOT could set the next target above $7, with minor corrections at $5.6 and $6.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bloomberg report projects bullish Bitcoin in 2023</p>

<p dir="ltr">Analysts bank on recession dynamics and central banks&rsquo; actions as bull triggers</p>

<p dir="ltr">BTC trades on a short-term recovery, with $19,000 in sight</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Investors may hold their breath, hoping that 2023 will turn out to be a good year for crypto and stocks alike. But even with these hoped-for expectations, market analysts have warned that 2023 could be the year of a global recession. With the economic depression, notable recoveries may be hard to come by. But Blomberg analysts think a recession would be a bullish trigger for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20BTC%20today,trading%20volume%20of%20%2413.67B." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bitcoin price</u></a> (BTC/USD). How?</p>
<p dir="ltr">In its cryptocurrency outlook, analysts say Bitcoin will come out ahead in a potential economic shutdown in 2023. Even so, the prediction is not outright. According to the report, Bitcoin could slide to $12,000 or even $10,000. From there, it will stage a strong comeback.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Bloomberg report highlights policy easing in 2023 as a key bullish trigger for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The analysts say central banks could be forced to ease policy on the back of deflationary outcomes. If this happens, the use case of Bitcoin as a digital version of gold will strengthen. The analysts point out that Bitcoin will start performing like the US long-dated treasury bonds and metal. The scenario will be bullish for the digital asset.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin price movement as moving averages join the support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/10/1673367549133-a2c2b36d-aad8-408b-9311-04e04052f034.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="276"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BTC/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Technically, BTC is mildly bullish and trades along a short-term ascending trendline. The price has, for the first time since November, moved above the 50-day moving average. A potential 20-day MA crossover of the 50-day MA could heighten the recoveries. The RSI reading has safely surpassed the midpoint reading of 50, indicating that buyers are in control.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is the likely target for BTC?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">With the upside,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> now trades below an overhead and crucial resistance at $19,000. Should the current upside continue, the level is the target zone for buyers. Accelerated recoveries will depend on the prevailing crypto sentiment.</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>NFT sales jumped 26% as trading volume rose across major blockchains.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Ethereum accounted for the most NFT sales, while Bored Ape Yacht Club dominated among collections.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>The broader crypto industry has started 2023 slightly higher, with notable rallies for coins such as Cardano, Solana and Ziliqa.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The NFT market size is expected to grow over the next several years, and 2023 has begun with a significant jump in sales on <a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-nft-marketplaces/">top NFT marketplaces</a>. It is one of the interesting <a href="https://coinjournal.net/research/nft-statistics/">NFT statistics</a> for the year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to data from <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cryptoslam.io</a>, NFT sales increased by 26% in the first week of the year. The platform showed the metric rose by the margin as 1.2 million NFT transactions registered across 400,740 NFT buyers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for the NFT collection with the highest transaction volume, the honour fell to the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). The collection registered $19,052,102 in sales, with trading volume rising by 53% in the week.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BNB Chain records 71% spike in NFT sales</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Per the data, the most sales occurred on the Ethereum blockchain &ndash; where NFT sales accounted for $164 million of $209 million. Overall, the sales rose across all major blockchain networks. BNB Chain saw the largest jump in sales, with a 71% spike just higher than the 70% growth on Theta grew.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Solana remains a top NFT ecosystem despite recent upheaval following the collapse of FTX and saw its NFT sales increase by 28.8% last week.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto prices up early in 2023</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">Cryptocurrencies</a> entered 2023 on the back of major losses in the previous year, with Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market having recorded massive dips from their all-time highs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the first week of the year has seen crypto mirror broader market movements with gains pushing BTC above $17,000 and Ethereum to $1,340. While Bitcoin is up more than 4% in the past week, Ethereum has notched double figures with over 10%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the most impressive performers include Cardano that&rsquo;s up 28% and Solana that has rallied by more than 45% this past week. SOL&rsquo;s surge came after the BONK &nbsp;meme coin airdrop to the Solana NFT community. Ziliqa has soared over 50% amid major network upgrades and integrations &ndash; including with esports loyalty programs.</p>
