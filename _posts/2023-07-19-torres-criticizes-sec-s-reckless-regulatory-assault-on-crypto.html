<p>Representative Ritchie Torres becomes the latest US lawmaker to level criticism against the SEC and its Chairman Gary Gensler&rsquo;s position on crypto. </p>
<p>New York Representative Ritchie Torres urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its Chairman Gary Gensler after &ldquo;crypto regulation by enforcement had a dreadful day in court.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Crypto regulation by enforcement had a dreadful day in court. In light of the SDNY&rsquo;s landmark decision in the Ripple case, @SECGov must reassess its reckless regulatory assault on the crypto industry. My letter to Chair Gensler: pic.twitter.com/Mrk63N4KhH</p>

<p>Rep. Torres is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.</p>
SEC Should Limit Enforcement Cases to &ldquo;Bonafide Bad Actors&rdquo;
<p>In a letter to Chairman Gensler on July 18, Torres asked the agency to limit its enforcement cases to &ldquo;bonafide bad actors&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;indiscriminately&rdquo; dealing with most crypto assets as securities under its supervision.</p>
<p>Torres&rsquo;s criticism and motivation to call the SEC out on its &ldquo;reckless regulatory assault on the crypto industry&rdquo; followed the landmark court ruling in the SEC&rsquo;s case against Ripple Labs. The regulator suggested Ripple&rsquo;s sale of its $XRP token on public exchanges was an offer of securities, leading numerous exchanges to delist the token and its value to plummet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a ruling by Judge Analise Torres stated the $XRP token is &ldquo;not necessarily a security on its face.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In his letter, Rep. Torres said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing to inquire if the SEC intends to come to terms with the folly of the Commission&rsquo;s crusade against crypto assets in light of the latest decision by Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a landmark legal opinion, Judge Torres resoundingly rejected the regulatory overreach of the SEC, which has been indiscriminately declaring all crypto assets, except bitcoin, to be securities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The congressman concluded by saying:</p>

<p>I hope that the SEC will find itself so chastened by the court&rsquo;s decision that it will concentrate the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement energies where it belongs: on the bonafide bad actors who perpetrate serious transgressions like fraud, market manipulation, and the misappropriation of customer funds.</p>

SEC Has Failed to Provide Clear Guidance for the Crypto Industry
<p>Rep. Torres, who coincidently shares a last name with the judge presiding over the SEC&rsquo;s case against Ripple, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has not issued a single rule on crypto assets, nor has it given any clear guidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adding, &ldquo;All it has done is sent mixed messages, one after the [other], not only contradicting the CFTC but often contradicting itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Torres and other industry experts believe that an immediate appeal by the SEC seems unlikely. The precedent set by the $XRP ruling would jeopardize the agency&rsquo;s case against Coinbase in particular.</p>
<p>Rep. Torres suggested:</p>

<p>[The SEC] must reassess its reckless regulatory assault on the crypto industry.</p>
