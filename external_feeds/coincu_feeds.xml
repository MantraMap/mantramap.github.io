<p>The bulk of the funds were sent to the cryptocurrency brokerage firm, FalconX. The company received $8.46 million worth of Chainlink (LINK), $7.71 million in Synthetix (SNX), and $3.06 million in BNB. In addition, other assets sent to FalconX include $2.1 million worth of 1INCH, $1.87 million in 0x Protocol’s ZRX token, and $718,000 worth of FTX’s native token, FTT.</p>

<p>The bankrupt lender also transferred roughly $235,000 worth of ShibaSwap’s BONE to the OKX exchange. These transactions were corroborated by blockchain investigator Lookonchain, who added that FalconX was depositing the altcoins to Binance. These transactions appear to be the on-chain evidence that the lender is looking to liquidate the digital assets for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in line with its recent court approval.</p>



<p><a href="https://celsius.network/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://celsius.network/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celsius</a> still holds around $183 million worth of altcoins according to Dune analytics data, including its CEL token, Polygon’s MATIC, Avalanche’s AVAX token, stablecoins, and others. Celsius’s altcoin holding is dominated by its CEL token, worth $106.28 million at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Blockchain analytical firm Kaiko warned on June 10 that Celsius could have trouble liquidating some of its altcoins because of liquidity issues. The firm highlighted how liquidity for CEL is almost non-existent and how the liquidations of other assets could exert pressure on the crypto market.</p>



<p>It is interesting to observe that Celsius’s BTC and ETH holdings account for over $350 million of the total assets in its portfolio.</p>



<p>Amidst Celsius’s efforts to liquidate its assets, the bankrupt firm agreed to a $4.7 billion fine with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on July 13. Meanwhile, Celsius co-founder Alex Mashinsky also faces charges from U.S. regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged that he violated federal securities law. Mashinsky is out on a $40 million bail after he was arrested on July 13. Other regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, CFTC, and FTC, also filed charges against him.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethena has raised $6 million in seed funding led by Dragonfly to develop an Ethereum-based stablecoin and internet bond.</em></li>



<li><em>The stablecoin, called USDe, will be collateralized and maintain a peg to the US dollar by hedging price exposure through shorting Ethereum using perpetual swaps.</em></li>



<li><em>Ethena aims to provide accessible, permissionless dollar-denominated savings instruments beyond the US, offering a decentralized and capital-efficient alternative to traditional banking systems.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2023/07/17/ethena-6-million-stablecoin-ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axios</a></em>, Ethena, a startup focused on developing innovative financial products, has raised $6 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Dragonfly, a blockchain-focused venture capital firm, and included participation from major crypto derivatives exchanges and other venture capital and trading firms. The project has also received support from BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes and his family office, Maelstrom.</strong></h5>

<p>Inspired by an article by <a href="https://coincu.com/192844-arthur-hayes-investors-to-join-the-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arthur Hayes</a>, Ethena aims to create a stablecoin called USDe that is backed by derivatives. The stablecoin will maintain its peg to the US dollar by using collateral from users to hedge price exposure through shorting <a href="https://coincu.com/202925-ethereum-rejects-2000-price-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> using perpetual swaps. This mechanism, known as &#8220;delta-neutral&#8221; stability, ensures that any gains or losses from Ethereum and perpetual swaps are offset, enabling the stablecoin to maintain a constant peg of $1.</p>



<p>In addition to the stablecoin, Ethena is developing the first-ever digitally native savings bond built on top of the stablecoin. The bond token will function similarly to a US treasury but without any reliance on centralized banking institutions or government entities. Together, the stablecoin and bond asset will form a highly scalable digital currency and savings platform, providing an alternative to traditional banking systems for users worldwide.</p>



<p>Ethena&#8217;s goal is to address the need for accessible, permissionless dollar-denominated savings instruments beyond the US. By offering a stablecoin and bond asset that operate independently of traditional financial systems and banking infrastructure, Ethena aims to provide a widely accessible and permissionless internet bond.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1133.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="563" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1133.png" alt="DeFi Startup Ethena Raises $6 Million Led By Dragonfly" class="wp-image-203423" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1133.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1133-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1133-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1133-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="DeFi Startup Ethena Raises $6 Million Led By Dragonfly 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The project intends to mitigate the risks associated with existing fiat-based stablecoins, such as custodial and regulatory risks shifted onto users. Ethena&#8217;s stablecoin also aims to address issues of overcollateralization and capital efficiency by breaking ties with external banking infrastructure.</p>



<p>With the seed funding secured, Ethena plans to launch its stablecoin and bond asset in the third quarter of 2023. The team will focus on completing the testnet phase, forming partnerships with industry leaders, and conducting smart contract audits to ensure the security and efficiency of the protocol.</p>



<p>Investors are optimistic about Ethena&#8217;s innovative approach to stablecoins, emphasizing the potential for stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency. The partnership with <a href="https://coincu.com/182535-dragonfly-capital-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragonfly</a> and other industry leaders will help bring Ethena&#8217;s vision to life and create a breakthrough stablecoin with broad user appeal.</p>



<p>Ethena&#8217;s ambitious project seeks to revolutionize the world of stablecoins and provide a global savings instrument that is accessible to investors of all means. By leveraging the power of Ethereum and derivatives, Ethena aims to offer a new financial infrastructure that is transparent, secure, and independent of traditional banking systems.</p>

<p>The marketplace will enable developers to use popular coding languages like C++ to build Ethereum chains and applications, bypassing the need to learn new programming languages. The Nil Foundation&#8217;s zero-knowledge builder, zkLLVM, which was unveiled earlier this year, is an essential tool for developers who want to build Ethereum chains and applications without worrying about learning new programming languages. This partnership will enable them to leverage their skills while building a decentralized marketplace for cryptography and outsourced proof generation.</p>

<p>Michael Gao, Fabric CEO, said that cryptography has a problem. Every day, new protocols, coins, and projects emerge, and the public continues to associate blockchain technology with speculation and a lack of real-world application. The partnership between Nil Foundation and Fabric Cryptography aims to overcome this problem by introducing a new marketplace for cryptography and outsourced proof generation.

<p>The FSB is a global finance regulator that seeks to address the risks of crypto to global financial stability. The recommendations are based on the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulation.” In essence, the Financial Stability Board believes that crypto activities must be regulated exactly how their traditional finance counterparts are regulated, regardless of how crypto firms market their products.</p>



<p>To ensure the safeguarding of client assets, the Financial Stability Board recommends that client assets are segregated from a firm’s own assets. The FSB points to national authorities to require that crypto-asset service providers maintain adequate safeguarding of customer assets and protect ownership rights, including in insolvency. This is an important aspect of crypto regulation that can help ensure that clients are not left in the dark when it comes to their own assets.</p>

<p>The FSB is concerned about the practice of certain crypto exchanges, such as Binance, that “combine multiple functions.” In traditional finance, certain functions need to be carried out by different entities to avoid fraud. In crypto, it’s common for firms to act as a jack of all trades, which leads to some firms not being transparent about their governance structures. The FSB believes that setting up complex affiliate corporate structures that finance each other leads to “acute conflicts of interest” as well as increases the risk of contagion. To solve this problem, the finance regulator has recommended that crypto exchanges and their affiliates be subject to “legal separation of certain functions” by authorities.</p>



<p>The FSB has also provided recommendations for ‘global stablecoins’ within the framework. The FSB believes that issuers should safely store and report data, have robust risk management guidelines, and otherwise comply with regulators. The FSB believes that global stablecoin issuers should need official approval before operating in a certain jurisdiction. This is an important aspect of crypto regulation as it can help prevent fraud and other illegal activities.</p>

<p>The importance of cross-border cooperation has been stressed by the FSB, as some countries enforce stricter crypto regulations than others. The FSB is vague on how it hopes to achieve this but said that its recommendations “have been strengthened on information sharing, including about the level of compliance of activities spanning multiple jurisdictions, especially those in jurisdictions that have not implemented international standards.”</p>



<p>The FSB is working together with the IMF to deliver a joint report to the G20 in September. This will combine macroeconomic and monetary issues stemming from crypto (compiled by the IMF) with the FSB’s work on regulation. By the end of 2025, the FSB hopes to conduct a review of how these recommendations have been implemented “at the jurisdictional level.” Until then, the finance regulator will be focusing on ways to improve cross-border coordination. This includes engaging with more jurisdictions to get them onboard and monitoring cross-border issues in crypto as they occur.</p>

<p>The recent developments surrounding Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin have brought to light a significant decrease of approximately $100 million in its circulating supply over the past week. This downward trajectory has persisted for a year, and it has resulted in a substantial reduction of approximately $28 billion in USDC&#8217;s market capitalization.</p>



<p>Although the reduction in USDC circulation during the previous week is striking, it is not an isolated event. Over the past month, a significant $4.6 billion has been redeemed, while a comparatively lower $3.6 billion in new stablecoins has been issued. These developments prompt questions about the stablecoin&#8217;s resilience and raise doubts about its future standing.</p>



<p>One of the primary reasons for this decline is the surge in USD Coin redemptions, which reached a substantial $1.4 billion within a seven-day period, as reported by Circle. This trend has been going on for a while, and it raises concerns about the stablecoin&#8217;s ability to maintain its peg to the US dollar.</p>

<p>In March alone, the supply of USDC experienced a contraction of $10 billion, primarily due to investor concerns regarding Circle&#8217;s exposure to a Silicon Valley bank, which triggered a temporary disruption in the stablecoin&#8217;s peg to the US dollar. Although the disruption was short-lived and USDC&#8217;s value temporarily dropped to $0.97, the subsequent loss in market share has endured.</p>



<p>While the supply of USDC has been diminishing, its primary competitor Tether has been making significant strides over the past year, consolidating its leading position. On-chain data indicates an impressive surge of approximately $17.8 billion in USDT circulation throughout the past year, with the majority of this growth occurring in 2023. Moreover, in the same week that USD Coin&#8217;s supply decreased by $100 million, the total amount of USDT in circulation expanded by $22 million.</p>

<p>USDT&#8217;s dominance has witnessed substantial growth in recent months, currently standing at over 7%. Over the course of the past year, Tether&#8217;s supply as a percentage of the total market capitalization has consistently surpassed 8%. In contrast, USDC&#8217;s market dominance dipped below 5% in January and has not recovered since, presently hovering around 2.3%.</p>

<p>Lens Protocol V1, launched without a user interface, served as a catalyst for creativity, inspiring the development of community-built social media applications like Lenster, Orb, Buttrfly, and others. Building on this success, Lens Protocol V2 introduces several notable features and enhancements that aim to expand the protocol&#8217;s capabilities and further bridge the gap between self-custodial crypto wallets and traditional payment methods.</p>



<p>One of the key advancements in V2 is the introduction of Open Actions, which allows users and developers to enable any external smart contract action on a Lens publication. This feature empowers users to bring their own smart contracts, including those from different blockchains, and integrate them seamlessly with <a href="https://coincu.com/193278-lens-protocol-raises-15-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lens</a>. For instance, users can perform actions such as minting NFTs directly on Lens, buying and selling ERC-20 tokens or NFTs, joining decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and even making donations using Gitcoin.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-1024x576.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Lens Protocol Announces V2 Release With Web3 Experience Supports" class="wp-image-203397" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-2048x1152.jpeg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1Oo0TaaUAAeHLj-1140x641.jpeg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Lens Protocol Announces V2 Release With Web3 Experience Supports 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, V2 expands the scope of Open Actions to include cross-chain actions with oracle support. This means that users can execute actions on multiple chains, including Ethereum and layer 2 solutions. By enabling cross-chain interactions, Lens Protocol opens up new possibilities for users to leverage their self-custodial assets across different blockchain networks.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126-1024x576.png" alt="Lens Protocol Announces V2 Release With Web3 Experience Supports" class="wp-image-203395" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1126-1140x641.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Lens Protocol Announces V2 Release With Web3 Experience Supports 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>In addition to Open Actions, Lens Protocol V2 reintroduces the power of composability through the integration of profiles with the ERC-6551 token standard. This enhancement enables the value generated from &#8220;mints&#8221; and &#8220;collects&#8221; to be accrued to profiles rather than solely to the owner&#8217;s address. This feature gives NFTs their own social relationships, voice, and monetization opportunities. For instance, a CryptoKitty can own a <a href="https://coincu.com/203038-lens-protocol-profiles-nft-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lens profile</a>, follow other CryptoKitties, and publish content, creating a unique value chain for the NFT and its associated profile.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-1024x576.png" alt="Lens Protocol Announces V2 Release With Web3 Experience Supports" class="wp-image-203398" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1127-1140x641.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Lens Protocol Announces V2 Release With Web3 Experience Supports 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>V2 also brings improvements to the following architecture, transitioning from a relationship between a profile and a wallet to a relationship between profiles themselves. This change means that all social actions, such as following, occur directly between profiles. Moreover, users can now transfer their handles without transferring their profiles, thanks to the introduction of Open Namespaces. This feature tokenizes both handles and profiles as NFTs, allowing for easy handle transfers while retaining ownership of the associated profile.</p>



<p>Lens Protocol V2 prioritizes security enhancements as well. The Profile Guardian, introduced through LIP-4, strengthens profile security and mitigates the risk of phishing profile takeovers. Additionally, V2 introduces native Quoted Publications, which foster greater engagement and establish a simplified standard for implementation throughout the protocol.</p>



<p>With these advancements, Lens Protocol aims to expand the overall Web3 community and create a seamless and interconnected ecosystem. By providing support for external smart contract actions, enabling cross-chain compatibility, enhancing profile functionality, and fostering composability, Lens Protocol V2 demonstrates its commitment to empowering developers, integrators, and users to fully leverage the potential of web3-powered experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Gnosis introduced Gnosis Card, a Visa-certified debit card connected to on-chain self-custodial wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>Gnosis Card allows users to spend their crypto funds from self-custodial wallets anywhere Visa is accepted.</em></li>



<li><em>Gnosis aims to bridge the gap between crypto and the real world, enabling seamless integration of real-world money into the crypto ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gnosis, a blockchain project, is aiming to bridge the gap between self-custodial crypto wallets and traditional payment methods by introducing its latest product, Gnosis Card.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="418" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120.png" alt="Gnosis Card Now Available, Helping Crypto Wallet Users To Make Real-World Purchases" class="wp-image-203384" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120-750x392.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Gnosis Card Now Available, Helping Crypto Wallet Users To Make Real-World Purchases 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>The card, which operates on the Visa payment system, allows users to spend funds from their self-custodial wallets anywhere Visa is accepted. The goal of Gnosis is to make crypto assets more accessible to a wider audience beyond the crypto community.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/gnosispay/status/1680874992509272065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduction</a> of Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card marks a significant milestone for Gnosis as it becomes the first decentralized payment network integrating with a traditional payment processor and the first Visa-certified consumer debit card directly connected to an on-chain self-custodial wallet. Gnosis Pay operates as a layer 2 solution on the Gnosis chain, enabling faster and cheaper transactions.</p>



<p>Initially available in EU and EEA countries, along with the UK, Gnosis has plans for expansion in Q4 to include the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The Gnosis Card differentiates itself from other Web3 payment cards by not being prepaid, offering users more flexibility in their transactions.</p>



<p>Gnosis Pay will support stablecoin payments, starting with EURe, a stablecoin pegged to the Euro. The team is also actively working on integrating MakerDAO&#8217;s decentralized stablecoin, DAI, for further payment options. The service will initially provide a physical card and web app, with a mobile app in development.</p>

<p>The collaboration between Gnosis and payment processor SaltPay has facilitated the creation of Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card, combining the benefits of decentralized payment networks with traditional processors. This integration allows users to utilize their crypto assets for online purchases with greater ease and convenience.</p>



<p>The introduction of the Gnosis Card was inspired by a conversation between George, a member of the Gnosis team, and an executive at payment processor SaltPay during a ski trip in the French Alps. This discussion sparked ideas on how blockchain technology could be applied in everyday life.</p>



<p>By introducing Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card, <a href="https://coincu.com/130579-three-arrows-capital-moving-over-300-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gnosis</a> aims to break down the barriers between the crypto world and the real world, enabling users to utilize their digital assets in everyday transactions and facilitating the adoption of cryptocurrencies in mainstream commerce.</p>

<p>The National Australia Bank (NAB) has blocked payments worth over A$270 million to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges in the past four months, citing the risk of scams and frauds. Similar steps have been taken by other Australian banks like Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and ANZ in recent weeks. </p>



<p>According to NAB Executive for Group Investigations and Fraud, Chris Sheehan, several measures have been introduced in the last six months to protect customers from scams, including introducing payment prompts, stopping the use of links in unexpected text messages, and taking action on spoofing. </p>



<p>The payment prompts feature a checklist based on uncharacteristic activity designed to get the customer to pause and review the payment before hitting send. Additionally, NAB is taking action to block payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent scammers further. Mr. Sheehan believes that Australia needs to balance speed and safety in a digital economy and that conversations need to be had on the same.</p>



<p>NAB&#8217;s intervention in over $270 million worth of customer payments in the four months between March and July, which raised scam concerns, led to the abandonment of 12% of payments when customers received a real-time payment promptly in the app. While many customers ultimately complete their payment after receiving a prompt, around $290,000 worth of payments are abandoned daily. Mr. Sheehan&#8217;s research shows that four in ten Australians are &#8216;extremely willing&#8217; for payments to be slower if they were better protected from scammers.</p>



<p>NAB&#8217;s announcement comes as almost 50% of scam funds reported to the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange were linked to cryptocurrency in a recent 30-day period. Cryptocurrency scams are one of the fastest-growing security threats, with Australians losing more than $221 million to them last year. </p>



<p>These scammers are part of organized transnational crime groups, and they are increasingly using cryptocurrency platforms to send stolen funds quickly and overseas. In response, NAB and other Australian banks are taking measures to protect their customers from such scams and frauds.</p>

<p>The integration of ENS-based .eth domains into the Unstoppable Domains website marks a significant milestone in creating a one-stop shop for Web3 domains. Unstoppable Domains aims to be the go-to platform for purchasing .eth, .nft, .crypto, <a href="https://coincu.com/177604-unstoppable-domains-releases-ai-avatars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.polygon </a>domains, and more, providing users with a comprehensive range of options.</p>



<p>When purchasing .eth domains through Unstoppable, users can expect the same full functionality and registration process as with other .eth domains, ensuring no naming collisions occur. The platform&#8217;s objective is to support the most important naming systems and blockchains in Web3, starting with .eth, as part of its broader mission to expand the Web3 community.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/160229-ready-player-me-partner-unstoppable-domains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unstoppable Domains</a> is not only offering a seamless experience for Web3 domain purchases but also introducing new features to enhance the process. Users now have the option to secure their .eth domains in a vault managed by Unstoppable, providing additional security and the freedom to separate Web3 domains from other crypto assets. The domains held in the vault are fully owned by the users and can be transferred to a self-custodial wallet at any time.</p>

<p>To address the challenge of annual renewal fees for ENS-based Web3 domains, Unstoppable is offering an optional auto-renewal feature for .eth domains. This feature ensures that users won&#8217;t lose their domains accidentally and allows them to have peace of mind knowing their domains will be renewed as long as desired.</p>



<p>Unstoppable aims to make the buying experience for Web3 domains as easy as traditional e-commerce websites. Users can purchase .eth domains using various payment methods, including credit cards through Stripe, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Unstoppable enables users to manage records, transfer domains, use ENS integrations, and pay renewal fees directly through ENS if preferred. The pricing for .eth domains on Unstoppable aligns with the ENS website, including Ethereum network fees for gas, and additional services like Unstoppable Parking and auto-renewal are available as options.</p>



<p>While .eth domains purchased through Unstoppable will not initially function with the platform&#8217;s more than 860 integrations, users will be able to leverage all ENS integrations. Unstoppable is committed to continuously enhancing the functionality and integration capabilities of .eth domains within its ecosystem.</p>

<p>All .eth domains purchased through Unstoppable will be minted on the Ethereum blockchain, incurring associated blockchain fees. This expansion of Unstoppable&#8217;s offerings provides customers with more flexibility and options for their <a href="https://coincu.com/131949-unstoppable-domains-integrated-fantom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web3 domains</a>. Additionally, the platform plans to introduce new features allowing users to manage .eth domains, including setting crypto addresses, managing on-chain profile data, and facilitating domain transfers.</p>



<p>Unstoppable Domains and ENS are recognized as leading platforms for Web3 domains, with 3.6 million registered Unstoppable domains and 2.7 million registered ENS domains. By integrating .eth domains into the Unstoppable website, the platform aims to contribute to the growth and development of the broader Web3 ecosystem, offering users the combined benefits of both platforms in a user-friendly registrar experience.</p>



<p>In April, Unstoppable Domains <a href="https://coincu.com/184303-binance-us-partners-unstoppable-domains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its collaboration with Binance US, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. The exchange&#8217;s users can send and withdraw crypto to any domain of Unstoppable.</p>

<p>Binance has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-terra-luna-network-upgrade-1e65aa0e555d4d67b7134dd230b61188" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-terra-luna-network-upgrade-1e65aa0e555d4d67b7134dd230b61188" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>its support for the Terra (LUNA) network upgrade. The upgrade will take place at the Terra block height of 5,994,365, which is approximately on July 18, 2023, at 13:00 (UTC). During this time, deposits and withdrawals of LUNA will be suspended starting from approximately 12:00 (UTC). It’s important to note that the trading of LUNA will not be affected during the network upgrade.</p>



<p>Binance will handle all technical requirements involved for all users holding LUNA in their Binance accounts. The upgrade is estimated to take place at the Terra block height of 5,994,365, but the estimated time is for users’ reference only. Once the exchange deems the upgraded network to be stable, deposits and withdrawals for LUNA will be reopened, and users will not be notified of further announcements.</p>



<p>Binance had announced the resumption of the “Market Order – Total” feature for impacted Spot and Margin trading pairs. Starting from July 19, 2023, at 02:00 (UTC), users will once again have access to this important functionality. The feature had been temporarily suspended since May 7, 2023, at 09:00 (UTC).</p>



<p>The update brings good news to BNB users as they will now be able to utilize both the “Total” and “Slider for Amount Customization” features while placing market orders on any Spot or Margin trading pair. These features provide enhanced flexibility and customization options, enabling users to optimize their trading strategies.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a recent update on <a href="https://coincu.com/203299-binance-withdrawal-system-restored-efficiency/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/203299-binance-withdrawal-system-restored-efficiency/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the representative of Binance, revealed that the exchange experienced a brief technical glitch with its withdrawal system. The issue persisted for approximately 10 minutes before being completely resolved.</p>
