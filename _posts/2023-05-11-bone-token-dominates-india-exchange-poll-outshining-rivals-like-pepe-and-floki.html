The Shiba Inuâ€™s governance token, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), will grab a new and prominent listing in India.Â BONE overtook PEPE and FLOKI, rising to the top in an exchange poll for the next crypto listing. Unocoin Poll Sees BONE At The Top A crypto exchange firm in India, Unocoin, recently conducted a poll on Twitter.

According to data, BONE is currently dominating the poll.Â  The Shiba Inu governance token shoved PEPE and FLOKI, with a wide gap accumulating about 84.7% of the total votes. Subsequently, PEPE has gathered just 7.2% of the votes while FLOKI crawls behind with 5.9% of the total votes.
