			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cryptocurrency’s price instability has seriously hit some tokens such as Hooked Protocol (HOOK) and ImmutableX (IMX). In contrast,</span> Orbeon Protocol keeps gaining investors&#8217; delight with 655% price gains.</p>
<h2><b>Hooked Protocol (HOOK)’s Bearish Run Continue</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hooked Protocol is a unique protocol built for Web3 and provides onboarding infrastructures for businesses and users as they enter the Web3 world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hooked Protocol boasts over 2 million active users every month and is driven by its governance token: HOOK.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just five days ago, Hooked Protocol reached an all-time high of $2.93 which has gradually reduced to $2.31 or a little over 20% depreciation as of the time of writing. With the Price of Hooked Protocol doing well and Hooked Protocol holders currently increasing their holding, things are looking good for Hooked Protocol.</span></p>
<h2><b>ImmutableX Depreciates Consistently</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ImmutableX is another cryptocurrency protocol designed for the Web3 world. The ImmutableX team created what they believe will power the next generation of Web3 games with the Web3 Gaming sector being so large ImmutableX will want to get things right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among its selling points are zero gas fees, amazing speed, and a host of others. Nevertheless, ImmutableX has failed to live up to expectations as it devalues and currently sells for $0.4478 as of the time of writing from $9.50 a year ago, representing over 95% depreciation for ImmutableX.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the past 24 hours, ImmutableX has lost 7.35% of its value as its depreciation continues unabated. ImmutableX could be in for a rough 2023 if demand for the token does not pick up.</span></p>
<h2><b>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Consolidates its Gain</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly immune to the bearish run sweeping over the crypto community, the Orbeon Protocol has consistently built on its gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol is a solution to some of the problems most aspiring investors and entrepreneurs have to deal with: poor access to funds and business ideas to invest in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Orbeon Protocol, interested investors can find a good number of proven business ideas to invest in while those sourcing funds can have access to venture capitalists through the protocol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that are struggling to raise funds may consider using Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to fundraise effortlessly. Through the protocol, they may create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and offer them fractionally to prospective investors. Making it super easy for those investors to become stakeholders in such companies, through Orbeon Protocol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, a company that intends to raise $500,000 can create 100,000 fractional units of the token and offer them to investors for just $5. The lowered investment cost encourages more investment in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is currently at its presale stage and the token is expected to appreciate significantly to $0.0216 over time.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s often said that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. That saying probably describes the situation in the crypto market more than anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the </span><a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20204/what-caused-the-bullish-crypto-market-of-2020-21" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last bull run</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started in early 2020, the market was the best place to be. The price of Bitcoin rose exponentially, and like a rising tide, it took almost every project along with it. People in the community were innovating on a day-to-day basis, and venture capitalists were blowing cash like they had a limitless pit of it. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/decrypt.co/62898/most-expensive-nfts-ever-sold%3famp=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and play-2-earn projects got simply insane valuations. Everyone wanted to have a piece of the crypto pie, and in a way, a lot of people did. That period probably made hundreds of millionaires out of ordinary people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even the highest of highs don&#8217;t last forever, and the dizzying rise of crypto couldn&#8217;t be maintained. Something had to give. </span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unprecedented investment of cash into crypto ensured that the ecosystem had become joined at the hip with the traditional economy. In simple terms, DeFi was seeing too much money at the same time from TradFi. Ordinarily, that would be great news. But it also meant that if TradFi got ill, DeFi got ill as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And TradFi got ill. The </span><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1x0h73r8pm6zf/If-History-is-Any-Indication-the-Russian-Invasion-of-Ukraine-is-Unlikely-to-Trigger-a-Bear-Market" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invasion of Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Russia drove up energy prices, which led to an economic chain of reaction that ended in the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. This reduced the appetite investors had for risk. And of course, this reduced their willingness to invest in crypto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once these dynamics played out, it was clear that crypto was heading for a bear market. However, what people didn&#8217;t know was that the bear would not just wipe out money, it would wipe out lives as well. </span></p>

			<h2>The &#8220;Too Big to Fail&#8221; Fantasy</h2>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As investors continued to pour money into the market, they created some sustainable businesses. However, they also created some unsustainable behemoths that were regarded as too big to fail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who regarded these businesses as too big to fail forgot one important thing. These businesses are such because of government subsidies and bailouts. Crypto was (and is) actively anti-government bailout, and no government was going to bail out crypto behemoths no matter what. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One by one, these businesses began to fail. The first to hit the dust was the </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/why-is-lunas-do-kwon-not-in-prison-yet/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luna network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The network was backed by the myth of an algorithmic stablecoin, and its fall erased around $300 billion from the crypto ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, many people thought that was the worst that could happen to crypto. But things were just starting to get bad. The next business to fall was </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/3ac-called-out-by-authorities-of-singapore-for-giving-incorrect-info/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3AC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the biggest capital players in the ecosystem. Within days, 3AC assets, which were worth billions of dollars, were worth mere thousands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several companies were also affected, with companies like </span><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/the-downfall-of-three-arrows-capital-3ac-what-went-wrong/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voyager, Finblox, blockchain, Genesis, and BlockFi </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting hit as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even that wasn&#8217;t the worst to happen. In November of 2022, a bank run on the </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/it-felt-very-bernie-madoff-like-in-that-way-ex-fdic-chair-on-ftx-saga/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second-largest decentralized exchange in the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led to $8 billion in customer deposits disappearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these shocks not only brought institutional powers in the ecosystem to their knees, but they also had real consequences on the lives of people. </span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For new investors in crypto, this is the most critical time in the ecosystem. The amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market is so palpable that many have decided to give up entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But old players in the ecosystem understand that this has all happened once before. In 2011, the price of Bitcoin fell from an all-time high of </span><a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/the-june-2011-bitcoin-flash-crash/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$32 to $0.01</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This wiped out millions of dollars in value and left thousands of people &#8220;holding the bag.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But within two years, the coin was ascending once more. The same thing happened in 2015 and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018. Veteran players in the ecosystem are no strangers to extreme bear markets, and to them, this is just one of those markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, each time the bear comes, it takes some people along with it.</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When an economic mishap happens, people are quick to ask exactly how much was lost. The papers report almost exclusively on the economic impact of the misfortune. They do this while leaving out the real impact these economic disasters have on the lives of ordinary people. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Man In Taiwan </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after the Luna crash, </span><a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4551502" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwanese law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a man dead on the streets outside his apartment. He&#8217;d committed suicide by falling from his window. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man lived in a luxury apartment building, so he was reasonably well off. However, even the warmth of living in such an expensive building couldn&#8217;t save him. In the early hours of May 24, 2022, he stepped out of his window and fell to his death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man was 29 years old, and according to the police investigation, he&#8217;d not left a suicide note. There was also no sign of struggle in his apartment, and no one had broken in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After investigating further, the police found a text message where the man complained that he&#8217;d lost 99% of the value of his Luna tokens in just two days. He&#8217;d invested about $2 million in the tokens, and only about $1,000 remained. </span></p>
<p><strong>Telangana Man </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Indian man named Ramalingaswamy decided to take the </span><a href="https://m.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-man-dies-by-suicide-after-losing-money-in-cryptocurrency-342652" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drastic option of suicide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of his crypto losses. The man booked a hotel room and then consumed poison after he&#8217;d locked the door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, the hotel workers called the police because they couldn&#8217;t access his room. The police arrived, found a way to open the door, and found him dead. The police searched the room and found a suicide note that he&#8217;d left for his wife. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his family members, Ramalingaswamy had been investing in online trading via a cryptocurrency app. He initially invested a little money and had gotten good returns. Hence, he decided to invest a lot more, and that led to devastating losses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately for Ramalingaswamy, he&#8217;d lost a lot of money, and he&#8217;d raised a bulk of it through loans. The people who&#8217;d lent him the money pressured him, and they even took his car. This pressure eventually led to him killing himself. </span></p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Trader </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/heartbroken-man-took-life-after-26260173?int_source=amp_continue_reading&amp;int_medium=amp&amp;int_campaign=continue_reading_button#amp-readmore-target" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Reale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took his own life after sending a distraught voice note to his friend. He told his friend to donate his organs if he could, and told his ex-girlfriend that he had &#8220;lost everything.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Stephen&#8217;s untimely death, he was a Bitcoin Trader. While not too much is known about the exact cause of his suicide, his messages suggest that he&#8217;d lost a great deal of money to crypto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This loss plunged him into a deep depression and drove him to take his own life. In the end, his lifeless body was found by passersby in a wooded area of London. </span></p>
<p><strong>A Family Affair </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://m.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/family-found-dead-police-suspect-suicide-is-related-to-luna-crash-2842782?ampMode=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three members of a family</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were found dead in South Korea around the same period as the Luna crash. A car belonging to the family was retrieved from the waters off the island of Wando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the vehicle were three dead bodies. The bodies were that of a 10-year-old, her 36-year-old father, and her 35-year-old mother. The family had presumably gone on a vacation, but after a while, the 10-year-old&#8217;s school alerted the police to the absence of the family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After investigations, the police found the family&#8217;s car and retrieved the bodies from it. Further investigations revealed that the family was in dire financial trouble and had googled Luna, sleeping pills, and a way to &#8220;make an extreme choice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these made it quite likely that the family had committed suicide because they had lost all their money on the Luna network. </span></p>
<p><strong>Murder-Suicide </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the bull run of 2020, Bitcoin suffered a massive loss of value that made a Chinese man lose a huge chunk of his savings. This loss was quite devastating because the bulk of the money belonged to his parents and his wife&#8217;s parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng, the man in question, told his wife about his plans to </span><a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/world/chinese-couple-kills-daughter-commit-suicide-due-loss-bitcoin-180952?amp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commit suicide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of the losses. However, she convinced him that if he had to die, they had to die together. The couple then decided that they wouldn&#8217;t just commit suicide but also kill their daughter as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng first killed his daughter and threw her into the sea. After that, he took his wife&#8217;s hand and they jumped into the sea as well. However, Zheng survived the jump, while his wife didn&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he was rescued, he confessed his crimes to the police and was made to face the law. Ironically, by the time Zheng was in court, the price of Bitcoin had almost doubled. If he&#8217;d just waited a little longer, he might have never had the cause to take such drastic measures. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these deaths reveal that more and more people are taking their own lives due to their involvement in cryptocurrencies. It&#8217;s a difficult problem, and it&#8217;s one that even the biggest stakeholders in crypto are unwilling to face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the solution to this problem isn&#8217;t to hide from the uncomfortable facts. The solution is to own up to them and understand that the ecosystem, as a whole, needs to become more transparent and safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s easy for the people up on Wall Street to see each bear market as a mere economic misfortune. But it rarely is. It ends up having life-or-death consequences for real people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mission to make crypto a safe ecosystem for everyone isn&#8217;t easy or simple. Some may argue that it&#8217;s impossible. Be that as it may, the ecosystem will not last for much longer if each bear market comes with its batch of suicide victims. In other words, crypto either gets it right now, or there will be no crypto to get anything right in the future. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulation has led to questions about whether it will prevent a repeat of the current market dip ravaging cryptocurrencies, particularly among actors in the crypto industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the worsening crypto market conditions, the call for stricter and more robust regulations has continued to dominate the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, many factors have, over time, been identified as architects of the recent heavy dip. One of those factors, according to reports, is the rising exploitation of crypto projects. In current data by Chainanlysis, hackers stole more than </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-13/crypto-hackers-set-for-record-year-after-looting-over-3-billion" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$ 3 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022. </span></p>

			<h2>Is Preventing Future Market Dip Possible with Better Regulations?</h2>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closer look at most countries that have designed a comprehensive regulatory framework for the industry will unveil how the regulations have prioritized investors&#8217; security. These regulations strongly frown on using virtual assets to launder funds and finance terrorism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, here are a few areas that regulations can positively affect:</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 21px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>Institutions can Benefit from Regulations</h2>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions play a significant role in the market, and if they do not feel secure, they will continue to move assets out of the market, causing dips. Institutional investors need transparency to make informed decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each investment must have a risk profile for institutions because of its risk-management nature. Risk profiles like these can only be built for transparent assets, which cryptocurrencies are not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the lack of transparency for the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) caused massive price drops for UST, its sister coin LUNA, and BTC prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having this level of uncertainty is not sustainable for a large financial institution. In the face of underlying fiscal problems, financial firms may avoid speculating on assets that might lose them enormous amounts of capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, institutional investors could withstand greater crypto investments and stabilize asset prices with the right regulation and transparency. </span></p>

			<h2>Regulations Could Reduce Speculation</h2>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulators could reduce speculation among crypto assets if they provide well-targeted guidance. In a highly speculative, volatile crypto market, less speculation can lead to higher investor confidence, which might attract more long-term investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A massive inflow of capital could stabilize regulated crypto prices and attract retail investors who aren&#8217;t yet familiar with the asset class. In turn, this would lead to a further increase in value and stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, most cryptocurrency enthusiasts perceive regulation as a strategy by the government and related institutions to curtail the industry&#8217;s growth. Despite this, a healthy regulatory environment can help project the industry positively, aiding its prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While regulation may not be the definite solution, it’ll go a long way to prevent or manage a price downturn. Supporting these claims is a reference to how the collapse of firms like </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/crypto-lender-voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voyager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/co-founder-of-celsius-cel-daniel-leon-resigns/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Luna Terra, and FTX has prolonged the current bear market. Likewise, proper regulation of the industry could have prevented the crisis that led to the collapse of the companies mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this regard, it&#8217;s arguable that proper regulation will brace the sector against future dips. It might not stop totally due to other factors outside regulators&#8217; control, like hacks, panic sales, fierce competition, and other micro and macro factors that can trigger a general downturn in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, investors can always rely on the assurance of having a shield protecting them against situations that can illicitly claim their funds.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency world with its innovative platform. By connecting regular investors with startups looking to grow quickly, Orbeon Protocol allows startups to bypass venture capitalists and raise funds directly from their own community. The recent influx of buyers eager to purchase ORBN tokens before the latest price rise led to a temporary crash of the Orbeon Protocol website after the news of the </span>ORBN token rallying 655% during phase 3 of the presale<span style="font-weight: 400;"> hit.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is changing how crowdfunding works by connecting startups with regular investors who want to invest in the next unicorn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the average investor, finding opportunities to get involved in the world&#8217;s most promising startups is difficult. Most businesses can only build communities if they get the funding they need to take their businesses to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) lets people buy fractionalized NFTs representing a stake in a business opportunity. This gives investors more choices, freedom, and a better way to get good returns out of their investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does this give investors more options, but it also makes raising funding for a startup fairer. Startups don&#8217;t have to look for wealthy people or organizations to back them. They only need a group of people who believe in their project and invest via Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to raise capital.</span></p>
<h2><b>Orbeon Protocol focuses heavily on security</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solid Proof has audited and will continue to audit all smart contracts to ensure that the ecosystem is safe. The &#8220;Fill or Kill&#8221; mechanism is another fail-safe. Investors get their money back if a project doesn&#8217;t reach its funding goals within the set time period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orbeon Protocol ecosystem also has many other useful features for users, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Orbeon Wallet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, users can buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies and NFTs all in one place. Users can sign up quickly and pay with both fiat money and cryptocurrency. No one person or group will be in charge of the wallet.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Orbeon Swap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a fully decentralized network that lets people trade cryptocurrencies quickly and cheaply.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Orbeon Exchange</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This platform lets companies raise money by selling NFTs based on fractionalized rewards or equity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Orbeon Metaverse</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Orbeon will focus on decentralized governance, assets that can&#8217;t be traded, interoperability solutions, virtual augmented reality, and making economies that work well together.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>The force behind Orbeon Protocol: the ORBN token</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORBN is the token that fuels the whole Orbeon ecosystem. ORBN token holders also get a lot of benefits, like cashback rewards, lower trading fees, and the right to vote on important resolutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is one of the most talked-about projects in cryptocurrency because it has many advantages over traditional venture capital. </span>Analysts see a bright future for the project, expecting returns of up to 6000% from its presale phase<b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ORBN is currently trading for $0.0302 after reaching the third phase of the presale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent influx of buyers eager to purchase ORBN tokens before prices rise further has led to the temporary crash of the Orbeon Protocol website. Despite this, the platform&#8217;s potential to disrupt the venture capital industry and democratize investment opportunities remains evident.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2017, no one knew who Changpeng Zhao was. The name would have only elicited blank stares if people were asked about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, just eight months later, CZ became a billionaire and was running the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just eight months he went from a nobody to one of the most important people building the future of the blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question now is how did CZ become the most powerful man in crypto? </span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, starts in China. Zhao was born in China&#8217;s Jiangsu province to Chinese teachers. He was born in 1977, so the overtly totalitarian communist rule in China was coming to an end as a result of </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/mao-zedong-dies-in-beijing-at-age-82-sept-9-1976-227742" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mao&#8217;s death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/08/03/giving-historys-greatest-mass-murderer-his-due/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communist fundamentalist Mao Zedong </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">had died, there was still some appetite for Soviet-era repression in China. For example, intellectuals were regarded as members of the bourgeoisie class and were routinely sent into exile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a fate that CZ&#8217;s father suffered shortly after his son&#8217;s birth. For some reason, CZ&#8217;s father was branded a &#8220;bourgeoisie senior intellectual&#8221; and </span><a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/338426558?utm_id=0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was sent into exile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This kicked off a chain of events that resulted in the entire family leaving China and relocating elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the 80s, CZ&#8217;s family chose to move to Canada to start a new life. CZ at the time was just 12 years old and had to become acclimated to a new culture and a new language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CZ&#8217;s family moved to Canada, they weren&#8217;t rich. While they weren&#8217;t living in penury, they didn&#8217;t have the luxury that other immigrant families had. CZ had to immediately start working to support his family. As a teenager, </span><a href="https://bsc.news/post/influential-crypto-figures-who-is-changpeng-zhao-cz-binance" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he flipped burgers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a McDonald&#8217;s and even took on all-night shifts at a gas station.  </span></p>

			<h2>The Ladder of Success</h2>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing high school, CZ decided to study Computer Science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that he was able to get into McGill University in the first place is a testament to how bright CZ proved himself to be. McGill University has one of the highest average entering grades of any University in Canada. High-schoolers who gain admission into the university almost always have a finishing grade </span><a href="https://i.redd.it/6e68bmmuhgf21.jpg" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">above 90%. </span></a></p>
<p><strong>Tokyo </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After college, CZ was selected for an internship in Tokyo. He took the opportunity with open arms and soon found himself working for a subcontractor of the Tokyo Stock exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZ didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but his experience at the stock exchange would eventually mold his career and give him the financial knowledge needed to build Binance. His job at the time was simple, and it was actually right in his area of expertise. He was to develop </span><a href="https://startuptalky.com/changpeng-zhao-binance-founder/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matching software for trade orders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>Bloomberg Tradebook</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In time, CZ  got a job at Bloomberg Tradebook where he developed futures trading software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spent four years at Bloomberg Tradebook and experienced meteoric career growth. He was promoted three times in those four years and became responsible for managing multiple teams around the world. </span></p>
<p><strong>Shanghai </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted something more and decided that Shanghai was the place to find it. In 2005, he made his move to the city and founded Fusion Systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this point in his career, CZ essentially had all the skills he needed to build a company like Binance. He was a guru at Computer Science and had spent years in finance and high-stakes trading. It was almost like he was being built for his role in cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p><strong>Fusion Systems and Bitcoin </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZ spent eight years in Fusion Systems. His company was thriving, his profit margins weren&#8217;t bad, and business was booming. But then, a friend introduced him to crypto in 2013, and he immediately knew that it was something he had interest in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The friend who introduced CZ to crypto was an investment poker player named Bobby Lee. Lee told CZ that if he invested just 10% of his net worth into Bitcoin, the coin could be worth ten times its value, and CZ would be twice as rich. And if Bitcoin lost all of its value, CZ would have lost just 10% of its net worth. According to Lee, investing in Bitcoin was a no-brainer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZ saw the logic in this argument and believed his friend completely. To prove just how dedicated he was to Bitcoin, CZ immediately</span><a href="https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/02/20/binances-cz-on-selling-his-apartment-for-bitcoin-and-if-crypto-can-be-truly-free/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sold his apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to buy Bitcoin and quit his job to switch to crypto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZ spent much of 2013 researching Bitcoin as quickly as he could and he even attended conferences. Because of his immense networking efforts, he soon got on the </span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain.info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team where he worked closely with </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/15/roger-ver-on-blockchains-past-present-and-future/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roger Ver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Ben Reeves, who were very important figures in the crypto space around 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After just a year of working at Bitcoin.Info, CZ left to become the CTO at OKCoin. However, he didn&#8217;t find success at OKCoin and he left a bit later.</span></p>

			<h2>CZ Binance, Crypto King</h2>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout his time at Bitcoin.info and OKCoin, CZ learned a lot about crypto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2017, he eventually put all this knowledge to work by creating Binance.That same month, he raised $</span><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/changpeng-zhao/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the company through an ICO, and the company started growing almost exponentially. In eight months, Binance had surpassed Blockchain.com and became the largest exchange by trading volume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And CZ was suddenly one of the most influential men in crypto. He was also worth $1.2 billion. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Troubles </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Binance wasn&#8217;t an instant success. Those eight months weren&#8217;t rosy by any means. Just as the company was expanding, the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/china-crypto-bans-a-complete-history/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banned ICOs and eventually banned crypto exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China made this policy because it faced a weakening economy and wanted to block the flow of money out of the country illegally. This led to an investigation of crypto firms and their activities. It seems that the finding of this investigation informed the decision to ban ICOs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People&#8217;s Bank of China finalized the bans of ICOs in September 2014, and then went on to ban ICO platforms from issuing ICO tokens. While the crypto ecosystem was still reeling from the ban, Chinese regulators banned crypto exchanges in their entirety. All of this happened within the span of two weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately for Binance, its IP address wasn&#8217;t in China unlike that of its biggest competitors. Huobi and OKCoin were Binance&#8217;s biggest competitors, but unfortunately, they were domiciled in China. That means they had to close down and they found it difficult to diversify their customer base outside China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Binance had no problem with staying open, since its servers weren&#8217;t affected by Chinese regulations. Hence, following the Chinese ban, Binance was able to get a huge chunk of their businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just eight months after Binance was founded, the company had grown exponentially and had 7 million users. But that was just the beginning. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being extraordinarily wealthy, CZ still wears cheap clothes. He doesn&#8217;t have expensive cars, houses, or anything of the sort. He wears basic clothes and shoes and looks like your everyday guy. The only difference is that he&#8217;s been on the cover of Forbes magazine, and he&#8217;s one of the richest people on the planet. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday&#8217;s Twitter fight between Changpeng (CZ) Zhao of Binance and Sam (SBF) Bankman-Fried revealed how the two became rivals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZ branded the former Bankman-Fried as a &#8220;fraudster in a fiery Twitter thread.&#8221; He also revealed details about FTX’s buyout of Binance’s stake in the company. He said SBF was &#8220;unhinged&#8221; after Binance pulled out of its FTX investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former FTX CEO claimed that CZ was lying about the deal. According to SBF, FTX initiated the buyout. He also said that Binance “threatened to walk at the last minute” without an additional $75 million. </span></p>
<pre>"You won. There's no need to lie, now, about the buyout," SBF said.</pre>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firestorm started when CZ responded to a Thursday interview with former FTX spokesperson Kevin O&#8217;Leary. In the interview, O&#8217;Leary suggested that Binance had issues with regulators.</span></p>
<pre>"It seems $15m not only changed Kevin O'Leary's mind about crypto, it also made him align with a fraudster. Is he seriously defending SBF?"

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Leary, whom FTX paid $15 million to be its paid spokesperson, said that FTX told him that one of the reasons why it was in trouble was its multibillion-dollar share buyback from Binance. Binance was an early investor in FTX and owned 20% of the exchange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himself an FTX investor, O&#8217;Leary said that the buyout cost FTX a &#8220;couple of billion&#8221; dollars. Moreover, he said he was forced to buy out Binance due to regulatory concerns, suggesting that regulators were uneasy with Binance.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance&#8217;s CEO explained how the two CEOs of crypto exchanges went from partners to rivals. According to CZ, it all started when Binance decided to pull out of FTX. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZ said Binance decided to pull out of FTX after becoming &#8220;increasingly uncomfortable&#8221; with how SBF ran the exchange and sister firm Alameda Research. He claimed that the decision prompted Bankman-Fried to lash out at them.</span></p>
<pre>"Sam was so unhinged when we decided to pull out as an investor that he launched a series of offensive tirades at multiple Binance team members, including threatening to go to 'extraordinary lengths to make us pay,'" CZ said. He added that he has text messages to prove it.</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Binance&#8217;s exit, SBF began investing in friends in high places – from media and policymakers to celebrities (like Kevin), CZ said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s also when SBF started attacking Binance and him personally, CZ said. &#8220;My ethnicity was a focus of those attacks,&#8221; CZ said. &#8220;I’m Canadian and Binance is not a Chinese company,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZ also pointed out the extravagant amount of money FTX was spending on marketing.</span></p>
<pre>"You don't have to be a genius to know something doesn't smell right at FTX," CZ said. "They were 1/10th our size, yet outspent us 100/1 on marketing &amp; "partnerships," fancy parties in the Bahamas, trips across the globe, and mansions for all of their senior staff (and his parents)," he added.</pre>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After days of trying to get out of testifying, Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to appear before Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankman-Fried will appear at a hearing on Dec. 13 before the House Financial Services Committee, probably via videoconferencing. Under oath, the ex-CEO of the bankrupt exchange will explain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the recent collapse of his crypto exchange FTX and his role in it.</span></p>
<pre>"I still do not have access to much of my data, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1601186246990401537" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">said</a>. "But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th."</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The public is now waiting to see whether his testimony will provide new insight into the demise of the popular exchange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, Bankman-Fried suggested that he</span> <a href="https://dailycoin.com/bankman-fried-not-sure-if-he-will-appear-at-ftx-hearing-in-washington/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would not appear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the committee on the 13th. He claimed he had not &#8220;finished learning and reviewing what happened.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that he is unsure when he will have all the information but promised to testify then. Rep. Waters was not satisfied with that answer and pressed Bankman-Fried to appear before the committee.</span></p>
<pre>"Based on your role as CEO and your media interviews over the past few weeks, it’s clear to us that the information you have thus far is sufficient for testimony," Waters tweeted in reply.</pre>
<pre>"As you know, the collapse of FTX has harmed over one million people. Your testimony would not only be meaningful to Members of Congress, but is also critical to the American people," Waters added in a tweet addressed at SBF.</pre>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If SBF did not agree to appear before the committee voluntarily, the committee would have the option to issue a subpoena. This would effectively compel him to appear under penalty of arrest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waters took issue with the reports. She </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RepMaxineWaters/status/1600643111973261312" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a subpoena was &#8220;definitely on the table&#8221; if SBF did not appear on his own accord.</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hearing is likely to be a tough one for Bankman-Fried. He will be asked difficult questions on the collapse of FTX. These include questions about potential criminal liability, including the responsibility for</span> <a href="https://dailycoin.com/i-did-not-knowingly-commingle-funds-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-claims/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commingling user funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s political connections, as well as his sizeable public donations to Democrat candidates, raise some concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter replies between Congresswoman Waters and Bakman-Fried&#8217;s correspondence are</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMaxineWaters/status/1598693811252875264" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with comments about potential collusion between the disgraced CEO and top politicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, multiple members of the Financial Services Committee suggested that they won’t go easy on the disgraced FTX CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranking committee member Patrick McHenry (R-NC) </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/ftx-bankruptcy-key-house-lawmaker-calls-collapse-of-crypto-exchange-a-dumpster-fire-at-hearing.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the FTX collapse “a dumpster fire” as committee members announced the hearing.  </span></p>
<pre>“There is no sugarcoating it. The collapse has been a dumpster fire. Users left out to dry. Ecosystem in limbo,” McHenry said.</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others question whether SBF should be awarded the right to appear via videoconference. One of them is Congressman Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), also a House Financial Services Committee member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davidson</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1598401852579741728" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he was &#8220;stunned&#8221; that SBF was not in custody. He added that SBF should be &#8220;brought in and questioned in the United States&#8221; and not allowed to appear from the Bahamas.</span></p>

Thereafter, they can share the items on Odyssey to earn more points. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, Polygon collaborated with firms to establish their presence in the virtual assets space. This earned the blockchain a reputable stature in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, Polygon supported the expansion of the prominent clothing brand Nike in the virtual assets sector. With Polygon, Nike </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/nike-launches-virtual-apparel-platform-swoosh-on-polygon/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched its Swoosh platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plans for Swoosh include the opportunity for customers to become co-creators and have a share in the virtual product royalties of Nike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nike will use the platform to establish digital apparel like t-shirts and sneakers for avatars that can be utilized within Web3 games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early last month, Meta </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/meta-will-soon-allow-users-to-mint-and-sell-polygon-powered-nfts-on-instagram/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the selection of Polygon for the minting of digital collectibles on Meta. The development marks the first to offer content creators the privilege to mint and trade virtual collectibles on Instagram through Polygon.</span></p>
